<h1>The Geekicon</h1>

UNLIKE the reference monoliths that respond to changes in English the way an elephant flinches from gnats, the "Hacker's Dictionary" or "Jargon File" is an electronic compendium as fluid and variable as the language it records. It has many authors and sits in many editions on different Internet sites. The latest issue contains over 2,000 entries.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many are computer-geek slang from the 1970s or earlier, and many are rarely used logical puns, of which geeks are fond, on the illogicality of English. (The plural of "mongoose", states the dictionary, is widely agreed to be "polygoose".) A few, though, are terms that have made their way to the wider Net community and even the outside world.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Netlish is an ad hoc sort of tongue, creating words and spellings as the need arises (<i>adhockery</i> itself, now used for all sorts of arbitrariness, may have originated as a programmer's term for random problem-fixing attempts).<i> Software </i> is familiar even beyond Net-users--but, on the Net, much software is freely distributed in forms such as <i>freeware </i>(no cost), <i>shareware </i>(appeals to your conscience to send a fee), <i>careware </i>(the fee is a donation to charity), <i>postcardware </i>(send a postcard to the programmer), and others. People, in contrast to computers (<i>hardware</i>), may pejoratively be referred to as <i>wetware</i>. Another Netlish effect is to cross-breed languages: Italian hackers, says the dictionary, have invented <i>scrollare </i>and <i>deletare </i>in place of the Italian words for "scroll" and "delete".<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Abbreviations in e-mail (no one now says "electronic" mail) are also a favourite. Their original purpose, speed, has been supplanted: it is the convention that matters. A contentious statement may be prefixed by <font size=-1>IMHO</font>, <i>in my humble opinion</i>. Often this is ironic, since no humility is intended; some users dispense with the irony, preferring <font size=-1>IMAO</font>--<i>in my arrogant opinion</i>. Jeering or wistful references may be made to <font size=-1>IRL</font>--<i>in real life</i>, ie, not in cyberspace. Another well-known <font size=-1>TLA</font> (<i>three-letter acronym</i>--also sometimes used <font size=-1>IRL</font>) is <font size=-1>URL</font>, of which it can safely be said that more people know what it is (an Internet address) than what it stands for (<i>uniform resource locator</i>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a while the <i>smiley</i>, <b>:-)</b> (like a face on its side), seemed to be a metalinguistic breakthrough for expressing emotion on the cold face of a computer screen. An industry in <i>emoticons </i>was briefly spawned, including <b>:-(</b> (sad), <b>:-O</b> (shocked) and <b>%)</b> (punched in the face). Few, though, are used. Over-use now is the mark not of the true geek but of the <i>newbie</i>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Oddly, the Hacker's Dictionary does not give the origin of <i>geek</i>. A couple of mouse-clicks, however, lead to the online site of a more traditional source: Webster's, which has "a carnival performer often billed as a wild man whose act usually includes biting the head off a live chicken or snake."<br>

<p><b>The other technopolists</b></p>
<h1>Intuitively competitive</h1>

<p><b>Intuit owns most of the market for financial software. In the last of our series, we look at its prospects in the age of on-line financial services</b></p><br>
THE technopolists this series has covered so far have tended to concentrate on markets where the customers are all big, sophisticated firms. Consumer software is different. Products for home use tend to be cheap, consumers fickle and standards less important than in a networked office.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet the home is exactly the market where Intuit rules. Thanks largely to a program called Quicken, the 13-year-old Californian firm has consistently held around 75% of the financial-software market, despite fierce competition from Microsoft. That dominance has helped its revenue grow fourfold in as many years, to $538m (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>) for the year that ended in July, although its aggressive acquisitions of other firms and investments in new business have often kept it in the red.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Intuit's secret for winning, and keeping, its quasi-monopoly is simplicity itself. When Scott Cook founded Intuit and started selling Quicken in 1983, it faced 43 competing products, many of them highly sophisticated ones. Quicken, on the advice of Mr Cook's wife, distinguished itself by replicating on-screen a universally familiar device for paying bills: a plain chequebook. Since then the program has remained among the easiest to use, resolutely focused on the daily needs of ordinary people. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Intuit is one of the few firms to have bested Microsoft. For more than five years the software giant has been pushing a competing program, Money, even giving it away at times, but has been unable to gain more than a quarter of the market. In April 1995 Microsoft even offered to buy Intuit in a generous $2 billion deal that included a promise to give away Money to another firm to maintain a semblance of competition in the market. But America's trustbusters were unconvinced. Faced with the prospect of a long and bruising court battle, Microsoft dropped the bid.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Having beaten off an all-out assault from Microsoft, Intuit has every right to walk tall, but its victory provides no guarantee of future success. The biggest challenge for the firm may not be its larger competitor but a changing marketplace. Over the next few years software of any sort will become less important than providing services on-line, such as letting people pay bills, manage their share portfolios and buy pension schemes over the Web.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Booz-Allen & Hamilton, a consultancy, reckons that nearly one in six American households will be banking over the Internet within four years. Most of these will be relatively well off, so between them they will make up nearly a third of bank profits by then. Such rich pickings have attracted many firms, including banks, to the emerging on-line financial-services market. In the face of this new competition, as well as that from Microsoft, can Intuit carry its dominance to this new market?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many of Intuit's products connect to its Web-based Quicken Financial Network (<font size=-1>QFN</font>). Intuit acts as a middleman, offering information about mutual funds and insurance schemes, and introducing buyers and sellers. Some of these services are free, others require a monthly subscription. Intuit hopes to make its money from these subscriptions, as well as from advertisements on its site. And Intuit's Open Exchange, which connects Quicken users directly to their bank accounts, is used by 38 American banks, which pay the company a licence fee. Mr Cook reckons that within five years the Internet might account for as much as half of Intuit's revenues.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Intuit's relations with the banking industry will be complicated. On the one hand it wants banks to use Open Exchange and support Quicken as part of their on-line banking services. On the other, it will be in head-to-head competition with them. More than 1,000 American banks will develop Web-based banking services within three years, according to Booz-Allen & Hamilton. These banks will find that <font size=-1>QFN</font>, rather than themselves, will rapidly become the point of contact between on-line customers and their financial institutions; and if the banks get their customers via <font size=-1>QFN</font>, they may have a hard time differentiating themselves from their rivals. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Intuit has two advantages over the banks. The first is that it can be seen to give impartial advice on current accounts, investments and pensions. The second is that its users are fiercely loyal. "People would change their bank rather than switch from Quicken," says Philippe Amouyal of the Boston Consulting Group.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Meanwhile Microsoft has redoubled its efforts to promote Money, and linked it to a personal-finance Web site that is part of its Microsoft Network, the core of its ambitious push into media and other "content". Microsoft's Open Financial Connectivity, a direct rival to Intuit's Open Exchange (the word "open" means little, since both are proprietary networks), has brought in 61 institutional partners. Yet, ironically, Microsoft's attempt to buy Intuit boosted Open Exchange because it made the banks take the smaller firm more seriously. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For Intuit, winning the battle for on-line financial services is a matter of survival, much more so than for either Microsoft or the banks, which have deep pockets to keep them going while they work out a new strategy. In a networked marketplace, standards count for more than they do in a home environment, and Intuit's standards are just one set of many. A commanding lead is a good place to start; but Intuit's greatest advantage may be that it is a lot hungrier than its rivals.<br>

<h1>Weird, perhaps, but quite wonderful too</h1>

<p><b>Nothing left to discover on earth? Don't believe it. Wherever humans go, other creatures have beaten them to it; and pretty odd most of them are</b></p><br>
WHEREVER you look, life is there. Within the hair follicles of hamsters, and even of people, mites hatch, have sex and die. Inside the hearts and lungs of crocodiles, worms grow through adolescence and enter young adulthood, feasting on the rich blood of their hosts. Parasitic flies lay their eggs inside the bodies of fire ants; when the maggots hatch, they crawl into their host's head and devour the brains before they pupate. And this is just on the world's surface. Down in the bowels of the earth, curious bacteria flourish. Deep in the darkest oceans, fish with huge eyes and gigantic mouths patrol the gloom.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is nonsense to say that the Last Frontier has been crossed. Apart from the almost limitless expanses of space, where the physical cosmos may or may not blend into a non-physical one, there are plenty of places down here on humdrum old earth yet to be opened to human knowledge. Antarctica offers volcanoes, deserts, rivers and huge lakes deep beneath the ice. In more temperate climes, caves riddle the continents, offering amateurs the chance to discover places where no one has ever been before. And on the bottom of the ocean, fumaroles--"black smokers"--sear the rift valleys, spewing super-heated water and sulphuric gases from the globe's belly.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;None of these places is hospitable to people. No one would plant a flag or build an empire there. But other organisms do not mind the dark, the heat, the cold, the poisons, or any of the other apparently dreadful conditions of these last untravelled reaches of the earth. Creatures thrive there; and they are weird.<br>
</p><p><b><b>A mere 3m years old</b></b><br>
In eastern Antarctica, the central ice sheet never melts, not even in midsummer. In the upper regions of the ice sheet, the temperature averages minus 50&#176;C. Yet four kilometres below the frozen surface lies Lake Vostok, a vast freshwater lake. According to the latest measurements*, it is in places 500 metres deep and covers 14,000 square kilometres (5,400 square miles), as much as Lake Ontario. Things move slowly down there. The average length of time a water molecule stays in the lake is about 50,000 years.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lake Vostok could be a biological treasure trove. Ice samples taken from above the lake contain bacteria and other microbes such as algae, diatoms and other microfungi; the microfungi are possible sources of new antibiotics. As the gigantic lid of ice melts into the surface of the lake (something that occurs at the stately rate of about a millimetre a year), these organisms will be released into the water. At the point of their release, they will be 500,000 years older than they were when they first landed on the Antarctic ice-cap.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Work on Siberian permafrost by David Gilichinsky and his colleagues at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Pushchino shows that some bacteria can remain alive, if quiescent, for 3m years. Other microbes can certainly stay alive in ice for at least 180,000 years. No one knows the mechanics of such longevity. But one day, when sampling can be done without polluting the ice and the water, Lake Vostok could do for biologists what distant galaxies do for astronomers: it may allow them to look backwards through time, giving them a tiny window through which to explore an ancient world.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Antarctica is a good place for this. The cold is so searing that many organisms expend little energy. Indeed, the world champions of leisurely growth live in Antarctica. But these under-achieving organisms are not interesting only because of their excruciatingly slow pace of life. They have chosen an unlikely residence: they actually live inside rocks.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The "endolithic" communities of Antarctica, as they are called, live where it seems impossible for anything to survive. In the dry valleys of eastern Antarctica, along the polar plateau, the cold, dry katabatic winds blow down from the central plateau at an average speed of about 70mph (110km per hour). They expose the quartz crystals of the sandstone rocks, keeping them free of snow. The year's average temperature (including the wind-chill factor) is minus 45&#176;C. Nothing, apparently, steps outdoors in this part of town. Yet the landscape is not so barren as you might suppose. Within some of the rocks, strange, layered communities of black lichens, white fungi and green algae have been living comfortably for centuries.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to David Wynn-Williams, a biologist with the British Antarctic Survey, rocks are quite cosy places to live in, once you can get inside them. Within, the temperature is hospitable (for Antarctica), hovering around 0&#176;C. They are even pleasantly humid; although no moisture lasts for more than a few minutes outside, droplets of water sometimes seep into the cracks and escape obliteration by the winds.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, even if an organism can get between the grains of the rock, another difficulty arises: food. The inside of a rock is, after all, dark. Or so it would seem. But to the algae, the basis of this quiet community, this is no problem. They are able to photosynthesise--harness the sun's energy to convert carbon dioxide from the air into the organic compounds needed for living-- with the little light that makes it through several millimetres of rock and two layers of other living organisms.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The black lichens are the first layer; then come the fungi; then, at last, the algae. The lichens live one millimetre under the rock's surface. They too photosynthesise; their black colouring comes from a pigment, melanin, which protects them from the ultraviolet rays of the sun. The stringy white fungi feed on the algae. And the algae are so efficient that they can get by with 180 times less light than most other plants. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Besides a little sunshine and a little water, these communities do not need much. One molecule of carbon dioxide captured from the air lasts them for 10,000 years before it is released again to the atmosphere. Yet, despite all this, the communities are relatively common in the translucent sandstone outcrops fringing the polar plateau. They may even occur on Mars. And they are probably centuries old. The key to long life, it seems, is not to do too much.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Groping in the dark</b></b><br>
A little light is, of course, different from none at all. In truly dark places, life seems impossible. Again, life surprises. Even in the blackest passages of the deepest caves, where the air is hot and foul, something is probably alive. Of all of earth's remaining frontiers, caves are perhaps the most accessible. New ones are discovered all the time, often by lucky amateurs. And, once in a while, a cave is found that has for ages been sealed off from contact with the earth's surface.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Movile Cave, underneath a cornfield in southern Romania just a few minutes' drive from the Black Sea, is one of these. Discovered by Cristian Lascu, a geologist at the Emile Racovita Speleological Institute in Bucharest, it was entered for the first time in 1986. Until then, it had been closed for more than 5.5m years.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This cave has turned out to be stranger than most. Completely dark and virtually silent, it is home to a tremendous number of little animals. Part of it is quite dry; the rest is filled with warm waters (about 21&#176;C). The atmosphere is unpleasant: in parts, the cave is dangerously low in oxygen and poisonously high in carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide. And, most unusually, life in Movile Cave has no need of sunlight (or virtually no need--vital oxygen seeps in through cracks in the cave's walls).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For almost all organisms in almost all ecosystems, sunshine is the ultimate source of energy. Plants capture the sun's rays and, through photosynthesis, use the sun's energy to convert carbon dioxide in the air into organic molecules. Animals then feed on plants and on each other; fungi and bacteria grow on the living and dead tissues of plants and animals. If there is no light at all, life gets much more difficult.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So, usually, caves do not hold much of interest. Bats sometimes roost; eyeless fish sometimes splash about in the water; the occasional spider sometimes startles an unsuspecting spelunker. But these beasties all depend indirectly on the sun. Bats fly abroad to collect their supper; the fish eat the detritus from dead things; spiders depend on straying insects that in turn depend on plants. Without some kind of regular food supply, a cave will be a desolate place, home only to small populations of just a handful of species.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hence the oddity of Movile. So far, 48 definably different animal species have been found there, 30 on the land and 18 in the water. Of these, 33 are peculiar to this cave. Woodlice and millipedes graze on mats of bacteria and fungi; pseudoscorpions, centipedes and spiders gorge on the meat of whatever they can catch. In the water, leeches prey on worms; eyeless shrimps try to evade capture by water scorpions. No plants and no vertebrates (except for visiting scientists) are found there.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most of the animals are troglomorphic: that is, they look as if they live in a cave. They have tiny eyes, or no eyes at all, and have often lost all colour. Their bodies are white or translucent; if you look at them with a torch, you can see their guts. They are true creepie-crawlies: they have extra-long legs and antennae (being crawled over by one of the millipedes would be, well, an experience) to feel and smell their way around. For cave biologists, Movile Cave may help to resolve an argument. One camp argues that the loss of eyes in cave animals happens because, when not much food is around, eyes become too expensive. The other argues that eye loss has nothing to do with the food supply. Movile--which is rich in food--suggests that the second camp may be right.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The water is the key to this diversity. It is "geological water"--it comes from a source far underground, not from the land above or the Black Sea. It could be 25,000 years old, and may have come, a long time ago, from the Danube. And it contains three substances that can provide energy to organisms which have evolved the equipment to take advantage of them: hydrogen sulphide, a gas that smells like rotten eggs; methane, a gas that (to humans) smells of nothing at all; and ammonium ions.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Using one of these as their power supply, instead of using the sun, the bacteria in Movile Cave somehow (nobody yet quite knows how) convert carbon dioxide from the air into organic compounds. According to Serban Sarbu, a biologist at the Speleological Institute, and his colleagues Thomas Kane and Brian Kinkle, of the University of Cincinnati in Ohio, these bacteria underpin the whole ecosystem.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The upper passages of Movile Cave are like those in most caves: not much lives there. But down near the water's edge, about 200 metres below the cave's entrance, lots of animals scurry about (and occasionally one of the leeches comes out on to the bank). To get to the most interesting parts of Movile Cave, however, requires something more: cave diving. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For, although it becomes impossible to travel farther in the cave by foot, the cave continues in a series of underwater passages. Dive along one, and every so often it opens up into an "airbell"--a large pocket of air. And it is in these airbells that Movile Cave really comes alive, because it is within them that the food (huge mats of bacteria) is most abundant. Each of the three airbells investigated so far has a different atmosphere, the one farthest from the shore of the lake being the most toxic (to humans, that is). Each is inhabited by a bustling community; but the creatures that live in one airbell may not survive in the next. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Movile Cave is the first terrestrial (as opposed to aquatic) ecosystem to have been discovered that does not depend on sunshine. It will not be the last. The geological water that fuels the life in Movile extends over an area of more than 100 square kilometres. More airbells, complete with their denizens, probably live in this subterranean expanse. And networks of other, as yet undiscovered, caves in other parts of the world will probably turn out to be supplied with the energy to house even more creepy-crawlie critters in the dark.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Life under pressure</b></b><br>
Now plunge lower still. The darkest, deepest and most bizarre ecosystems of all are the deep oceans. Below the "photic zone", at depths where no light penetrates, the oceans are a surrealist desert. In the darkness, monstrous fish go for long stretches of time without food. On the ocean floor, organisms depend on falling detritus from dead creatures in the waters above. It is cold. And the pressure is immense.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Occasionally, though, the monotony of this desert is broken by equally surrealist oases. These are the deep-sea vents, known as black smokers, that belch out sulphidic water as hot as 400&#176;C. Over and around these vents live some of the wackiest creatures imaginable.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1977, deep-sea vents were discovered along a rift valley in the eastern Pacific, not far from the Galapagos islands. Since then, vents have been found scattered like islands in archipelagoes along the edges of the oceanic plates wherever the plates are spreading apart. The consequences of volcanic activity, these vents are springs of super-heated water. And, to the surprise of almost everybody, they have turned out to support ancient and complex ecosystems.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to Robert Vrijenhoek, of Rutgers University in New Jersey, exactly what you find living on a deep-sea vent depends on four things: which ocean you are in, how deep you are, how hot the water is, and how long the vent has been there.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the mid-Atlantic, the vents tend to last longer than the hotter, more ephemeral ones found in the eastern Pacific. On a vent four kilometres under the surface of the Atlantic, you might find bacteria with filamentous strands so enormous they can be seen by the unaided human eye (unaided, that is, except by a good submarine and a bright light), brilliantly-coloured mussels and clouds of small orange shrimps. The mid-Atlantic vents are often home to endemic species, suggesting that some of them have been stable for millions of years.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the eastern Pacific, the shrimps are much less common; instead, gigantic tube-worms, sometimes two metres long and two or three centimetres in diameter, cluster around the mouth of the vent. Their protective tubes are white, and feel leathery. The worms themselves are purple, with bright red gills. Crabs without eyestalks prey on the worms, pulling them from their tubes like spaghetti. Also present in the eastern Pacific are mussels and clams up to 30 centimetres across. Here, the creatures have to move around because new vents erupt, ready to be colonised by the enterprising.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the western Pacific, the fauna is different again. Few worms and mussels cavort in the deep spas of these waters. Instead, hairy snails the size and colour of golf balls are stacked high around the edges of the vents. These snails do not often comb their hair; they are full of bacteria. And the shrimps of the western Pacific vents graze directly on the bacteria living among the snails' tousled manes.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Several things are notable about the communities living on these vents. First, like the organisms in Movile Cave, none of them seems to depend on light. The bacteria are able to use hydrogen sulphide, or other sulphurous gases that are belched from the belly of the earth, as a source of energy. But, unlike the Movile residents, some of the other vent organisms do not depend on free-living bacteria for food.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The clams, mussels, snails and worms all have special links with their own species of bacteria. These endosymbionts, as they are known, are housed by their hosts within chosen chambers (cells in the gills in the case of clams and mussels, a structure called the "trophosome" in the worms). There, they metabolise the sulphide gases on behalf of the organisms they live in. In the clams and mussels, the bacteria are passed down the generations from parent to child; but in the worms, Dr Vrijenhoek and his colleagues have found, the symbionts must be recaptured afresh by each new generation--a curious arrangement, for, without their symbionts, these creatures cannot survive for long.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another feature of life on deep-sea vents is that all the animals seen so far reproduce sexually. This is unexpected (to those who ponder these things) for two reasons. First, organisms that live in extreme environments are usually asexual; that includes the endolithic communities in Antarctica. Those that live widely dispersed are also usually asexual; it only needs one to start a new colony. This suggests that, though boiling-hot sulphidic water at a depth where the water pressure may be 600 times greater than at sea-level sounds like a tough environment, such conditions are in fact the deep-sea equivalent of a lush tropical forest.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor are the vents as dark as might be supposed. Until recently, almost all the species were thought to be eyeless. On closer examination, some species, especially the shrimps, have turned out to have eyes of a sort. In 1996, a new species of shrimp was collected from the Snake Pit vent on the mid-Atlantic ridge. Like others previously found in the mid-Atlantic, it has a small eyespot with no lens. Instead, the eye is covered by a smooth sheet of material that is highly sensitive to light.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At first, this seems peculiar. So far under the sea, it is not immediately apparent that there is much to look at. But, of course, these creatures live near exceedingly hot water. Hot things, when viewed in the infrared, become visible. Very hot things become very bright. And, even more surprising, these vents actually give out a dim glow in the reddish end of the visible part of the spectrum. No one knows what causes it. But the shrimps can probably see it. They feed on bacteria spewed up from the fiery cauldrons below the seabed. The shrimps themselves do not actually live in the hot water: they would be boiled alive. So being able to see enough to maintain a healthy distance from the heat is a useful trick.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr Vrijenhoek and his colleagues have traced the ancestry of the vent creatures. They have found that, contrary to some theories, the animals down there, weird as they are, have all evolved from more familiar relations in the tidepools and reefs of the more familiar earth. It just shows what too much pressure can do to you.<br>

<h1>A bit about photographs</h1>

<p><b>Digital photography is developing rapidly. How quickly it will overtake conventional cameras and film, though, is debatable</b></p><br>
HIGH on The Peak--the mountain that overlooks Hong Kong's famous skyline--one of the colony's more enterprising hawkers has gone high-tech. Piled on to his hand-cart are a personal computer, a monitor and a colour printer, all powered by batteries and linked to a digital camera mounted on a tripod. Tourists are offered instant souvenir pictures of themselves against one of the most spectacular backdrops in the world. And if the dramatic view is obscured by clouds, never mind: the hawker's imaging software will soon superimpose a clear skyline.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Digital cameras are the first serious change in the technology of recording static images since Louis Daguerre perfected his process in 1838. By storing pictures electronically, they avoid all the tedious mucking about with chemicals that is required to turn out photographs. And, as a bonus, they deliver their images in a form that multimedia computers can play with. Not surprisingly, sales of digital cameras are growing rapidly--up from 200,000 in 1995 to 800,000 in 1996.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It seems likely, therefore, that the digital revolution is going to ride rough-shod over photography, as it has over other areas, such as the music industry. But probably not quite yet. For electronic cameras, despite all their wizardry, still lack the thing that has given digital devices their edge elsewhere--they are not yet as accurate as the old-fashioned, analogue way of doing things.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Colouring the picture</b></b><br>
Digitising something means dividing it up into discrete parcels that can be described by numbers. In the case of pictures, these parcels are known as "pixels" (the individual spots on a television screen are one familiar example of them). A digital camera generates its pixels by focusing light not on to a film, but on to a silicon chip known as a charge-coupled device (<font size=-1>CCD</font>)--a component that also forms the core of moving-picture cameras such as camcorders.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The main working elements of the best-known chips--the microprocessors at the heart of computers--are transistors. These are semiconductor switches with three wires protruding from them. One carries current in. A second carries current out. And a third tells the transistor whether or not to let the current (and thus a signal) through. <font size=-1>CCD</font>s are also made of semiconducting switches, but in this case the switches are diodes, and thus have only two protruding wires. <font size=-1>CCD</font> diodes, however, are light-sensitive, and it is this sensitivity that provides the third input--the one that controls the electrical signal. When exposed to an image, each diode produces a signal that depends on the brightness and colour of the part of the image that is falling on it. Since a <font size=-1>CCD</font> has at least several hundred thousand light-sensitive diodes, the image can be broken up into a corresponding number of pixels.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The pixels generated by a <font size=-1>CCD</font> can be stored either in an internal memory chip in the camera or in a small plug-in "flash" memory consisting of yet another type of chip. When the memory is full, the picture files stored in it are transferred to a computer where, with the appropriate software, the pictures can be viewed, edited, printed out, placed in other programs (such as desk-top publishing documents), used to decorate a web site or e-mailed to a friend.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So, with no chemicals and no more films to buy, why would anyone ever bother with a conventional camera again? The reason is resolution. The light-sensitive gels on photographic film are very fine-grained, and can thus store a lot of detail. To reproduce the detail found in a good-quality colour transparency would require about 80m pixels. Even the most expensive digital cameras cannot manage this. A digital version of a Nikon single-lens reflex (<font size=-1>SLR</font>) camera, for example, can produce an image of only about 6m pixels. And at $27,000 a throw, it is unlikely to be gracing the Christmas stockings of even the most enthusiastic amateurs. Meanwhile, digital cameras affordable by lesser mortals (those retailing for less than $500) can manage but a few hundred thousand pixels.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor do the putative digital photographer's problems end there. Having taken his photograph, he must store it--and a traditional slide box will not do the trick. Instead, a fair amount of electronic memory must be available.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The simplest pixel conceivable requires one "bit" of information. Photos based on single-bit pixels would not, however, be very exciting, since one bit would allow a pixel only to be either black or white (off or on in a computer's vocabulary). Once shades of grey are included, the number of possibilities escalates-- and so does the storage space required. A simple 8-bit image allows each pixel to have 256 possible shades of grey or basic colours. For richer 24-bit colour (which many computer monitors use) each pixel can have 16.7m different colour possibilities.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Each extra bit, however, requires more storage space. Exactly how big the picture file ends up depends on the size of the photo, the level of detail, the camera's colour-management software and the format in which it is stored (there are many such formats, and some use compression techniques to try to cut down on the storage capacity required). Yet even a dozen 24-bit colour snapshots, each made up of only 200,000 pixels, will occupy two megabytes of memory (a quarter as much as an average personal computer holds), while some of the professional digital cameras around spew out so much data that they have to be tethered directly to a fast computer's hard disk in order to gather it all. A picture of the quality required by a magazine could easily gobble up 60-80 megabytes. A large poster would require some 400 megabytes. Lugging around the hardware necessary to cope with all this is not going to appeal to the average holiday maker.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Digital cameras are improving, to be sure. But so is conventional photography. Chemical imaging, which has come a long way since Daguerre's day, is getting better still. Kodak and its arch-rival, Fuji, recently teamed up to launch the "Advanced Photo System" (<font size=-1>APS</font>). This employs ordinary film to capture the image, but incorporates a magnetic strip on which data such as the lighting conditions prevailing when a shot was taken are stored. <font size=-1>APS</font> is easier to use than a digital camera, and allows more accurate processing.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So film wins? Not necessarily. And certainly not for many professional photographers. Even if their work is shot on film, the pictures taken by most working photographers increasingly end up as pixels anyway. In many newspapers and magazines, darkrooms are already a thing of the past. Both colour-negative and transparency film are now routinely machine-processed and scanned directly into digital files. The pictures are edited on a computer screen and placed straight into the electronic page-make-up.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, where speed is important, a growing number of professional photographers are already using digital cameras. Not just news photographers, but police-cameramen, estate agents and insurance assessors. Many of the photographs used in catalogues are also taken with digital cameras: if the final pictures are going to be small anyway, then digital cameras are already good enough. They are also good enough for images that will appear only on a computer screen, or will be printed out in a document on a low-resolution printer.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is this tolerance for imperfection that may yet allow digital cameras to win the mass market. For, while a small group of well-equipped amateurs armed with <font size=-1>SLR</font>s and enough lenses to start a minor observatory might like to think themselves a cut above the average holiday photographer, most people only want to take snapshots.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For those not in search of the ideal, the digital camera already is--or soon will be-- perfectly suitable for many types of photography. <font size=-1>CCD</font>s will surely get better and so will the software that the cameras use. Kodak recently joined up with Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and a new Californian firm called Live Picture in order to establish a new format for digital snapshots. Called FlashPix, it promises less memory-intensive pictures and faster editing.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The cost of digital photography will also fall, particularly since it will soon no longer be necessary to build your own digital dark-room at home to process and display the pictures. A plethora of new products and services to support digital photography is starting to arrive. These range from simple-to-use snapshot-quality home printing machines for digital cameras, to instant print and enlargement services from high-street film developers. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And digital photography could shake the equipment market up even further. Camera companies may know a lot about optics, but they do not necessarily have much experience with electronics. It is not just film manufacturers that should be quaking in their boots--if Nikon, Canon and Minolta are not careful, they may find themselves competing with the likes of Sony and Casio.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So eventually, as with every battle between digital and analogue, it is likely that digital will win. Film will live on, but probably only in specialist use. Just as a few die-hards still shun <font size=-1>CD</font> players and listen to vinyl discs through valve amplifiers, in years to come there will always be one tourist in that group high above Hong Kong who pulls out a battered old Nikon <font size=-1>F5</font> and delights in informing everyone that photographs never look right unless they are made from silver halide. For most people, though, the chance to alter their holiday's weather conditions after the event will win out every time.<br>

<img src="monmor.gif"><br> "Heresy! Rank heresy!" The editor squeezed his hands together unhappily."Come now, Geoffrey. Tom was merely being provocative."
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Edward, why do you persist in ignoring the truth about this subversive? Tom has just questioned whether we should continue to support the Anglo-American special relationship! He'll be telling us next that we should drum America out of <font size=-1>NATO</font> and rely on the French." Hodgskin's voice rose in a screech. "The French!!!"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tom St Loe Rathbone's patronising drawl cut in. "Chill out, Geoffrey. I thought the whole point of editorial meetings was to think the unthinkable."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hodgskin drew himself up to his full six feet four. "There is the unthinkable and there is the unspeakable. And what is not speakable is the querying of our fixed principles."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In fairness, Geoffrey," said the editor mildly, "our commitment to the Atlantic alliance was relatively recent."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Geoffrey Hodgskin's enormous frame quivered. "For over a third of <i>The Economist</i>'s life a guiding principle has been the need to keep our allies from going back into Fortress <font size=-1>USA</font>."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, for heaven's sake," said the editor irritably. "You know perfectly well Tom is just expressing his own personal opinion. We don't necessarily agree with him. Just because he tilts at our sacred cows doesn't mean the cows aren't sacred."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hodgskin's voice rose to a scream. "With an editor who has chosen to abandon the monarchy, how can I have any faith that we will be true to our heritage?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The editor sighed. "We've been through all that. Bagehot took a relaxed view on that over a century ago."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"To be precise," observed the Britain editor, "Bagehot said he didn't expect the monarchy to last much beyond his life-time."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Bugger Bagehot," said Rathbone. "Who cares what he thought. It's what <i>we </i>think that matters."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Typical," shouted Hodgskin. "Typical of your complete failure to appreciate . . . "<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rathbone yawned. "Oh, for God's sake, Jeffers, you're carrying on as if we had abandoned free trade. Though I have to say I've been wondering recently if protectionism mightn't have the virtue of . . . "<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's it," howled Hodgskin. "You infidel! You apostate!" He picked up his coffee-mug and threw it across the room at Rathbone. It bounced off the deputy editor's shoulder and shattered against the window. As Hodgskin stormed out, the assembled staff showed no emotion. As one man they shrugged and moved on to discuss whether anything useful might emerge from the latest European Union summit.<br>

<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Five minutes later, the luscious Julia Barrington, one of the editor's secretaries, emerged from the lift into the lobby and stopped in mid-stride to stare through the plate-glass window at what looked like the corpse of Geoffrey Hodgskin lying on the plaza among several pieces of wood and metal. As she exclaimed with alarm, two passers-by materialised and helped Hodgskin to his feet.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What's happened, Zoe?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The receptionist tittered nervously. "I think Geoffrey has finally gone bonkers. He came charging out of the lift, rushed over to James . . . " She waved at the forbidding marble statue of the founder of <i>The Economist</i> that stared from a corner of the lobby, " . . . waved his arms at him, shouted something like 'It'll be back to the Corn Laws next,' rushed out the door and crashed straight into that . . . that whassitsname." She consulted a piece of paper. "Oh, yes. 'Fiscal Rectitude'. Now, what's been going on? What have you been doing to him?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's not us," protested Julia. "It's him. He's off his bleeding rocker. Comes screaming out of the editorial meeting about how the world's coming to an end or something." She looked over at the statue. "If you ask me, he thinks he's James Wilson. He's nearly as ugly anyway."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Leave off making fun of James. Sanest person in this place if you ask me. At least he doesn't shout and run about. Seems to me Geoffrey is driving himself mad spending every night crouched over old <i>Economists</i>."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, blimey. Is that what he's at? So that's why he's raving on about getting rid of the welfare state, is it?" <br><img src="xth2.jpg"><br><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And why he's going blind and falling over things. Mind you, I'm delighted he's messed up that piece of rubbish. Art, indeed! With a bit of luck it can't be repaired."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Should we try to calm Geoffrey down?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Too late, love." Zoe waved towards the plaza. "I think he's taken his nervous breakdown home."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Let's hope he stays there with it. Sometimes I think Geoffrey's going to do someone an injury."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Like Tom, for instance? Serve him right. From all I hear, he's always winding Geoffrey up."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Julia looked cross. "It may seem like that from down here, Zoe, but on the 13th floor it's different. As Edward says . . . " -- her voice took on a note of pomposity-- "we have a noble tradition of dissent."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Zoe laughed coarsely. "Dissent my bum! There's nothing noble about Tom Rathbone. Nasty flashy bit of work."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You just don't like him 'cos he's a bit stand-offish," said Julia. "In editorial we admire him 'cos he's brilliant."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To Julia's relief and Zoe's regret, the arrival of a visitor brought the dispute to an end. <p><img src="wedeve.gif"><br> The editor groaned and picked up his phone. "Sophie? How the hell did Geoffrey's privatisation leader get through? For God's sake, he starts from the premise that government has no legitimate role except to organise defence and then proposes privatising the armed forces. Even James Wilson might have thought that was going a little far."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Sorry, Edward. What with the allegations of group sex in the cabinet and the rapprochement between Margaret Thatcher and Ted Heath, we're all up to our eyes."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Anyone around who can write a substitute?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Tom, maybe."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Don't tell Geoffrey. He'll go completely off his head."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How would we know the difference?" enquired the Britain editor icily. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was unfortunate, the Britain editor agreed, after the murder of Tom St Loe Rathbone, that she had not ensured that Geoffrey Hodgskin had gone home rather than--as it turned out--having been on the 14th floor obsessively reading 1840s <i>Economists</i> and occasionally keying into the system to find out what had happened to his leader. It was even more unfortunate that no one had time that evening to read and amend Tom's proposition that privatisation was yesterday's solution to tomorrow's problems and that the time had come to look again at the merits of public ownership of the means of production. Unfortunately, the senior editorial staff were working frantically to cover an unprecedented series of political crises.<br><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At 7.00pm the cabinet sex story which had formed the basis for a leader on terminal sleaze had turned out to have been invented by a disgruntled secretary at No. 10 who had had her advances rejected by the prime minister; at 8.30 the cover showing Thatcher and Heath in an embrace under the heading "Bygones will be bygones" had to be replaced when the Moscow correspondent sent through the news about Boris Yeltsin's double; the flash from the Washington office that there was to be a congressional inquiry into the allegation that the cat Socks occasionally ate food paid for from the White House Hospitality Budget came at 9.30; and at 10.30, just as the remnants of the graphics department were leaving, came the news from Reuters that Rupert Murdoch had bought Indonesia, necessitating a change of cover for three editions, a new front leader and a complete reorganisation of two sections. Mass hysteria at 11.00 when the computer system crashed was narrowly averted by a successful rescue mission by the technical department's Donald Barrington. <p><img src="thumor.gif"><br> <img src="xth3.jpg"><br> At 2.00am, having indulged in mutual congratulation, discussed the latest stage of the Hodgskin-Rathbone feud and consumed wine and sandwiches, the five senior editors left the building together.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As they walked towards the waiting taxis, the deputy editor stopped.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"'Market Forces' seems to have come a cropper. No doubt Geoffrey will blame Tom."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's certainly been an expensive week on the sculpture front," said the foreign editor. "I hope it's not an omen. There's only one left intact."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The quintet walked over to inspect the damage. It was the finance editor who spotted a flash of beige cloth and the deputy editor who said worriedly that it looked like an arm.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And isn't that a leather glove?" asked the editor.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As one they dashed back into the building, instructed the security guard to call the police, took the lift back to the editor's office and broke open a bottle of whisky. "That looked like cashmere to me," said the Britain editor, as she tremblingly raised the glass to her lips. "The only person I know who wears a cashmere coat is Tom Rathbone."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Where's Geoffrey?" asked the other four, in unison. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It took an hour for the police to summon up the block-and-tackle necessary to restore "Market Forces" to its vertical position. Having identified the squashed and bloody remains of Rathbone, at 3.30 the senior editorial staff went shakily home; the editor had time only to shower and change before making it back at 5.30 to start reading the first proofs.<br><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By 10.00am he had joined Detective-Inspector Greg and Detective-Constable Asquith in the board room.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I hope my secretary was able to assist you, gentlemen."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Thank you, sir. Mrs Barrington made us very comfortable. Now would you be so kind as to tell us which of your colleagues would have wanted to kill Mr Rathbone."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Surely it was an accident?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Sorry, sir. It won't wash. The sculptor's been round; the constructor's been round; the security guards have had a look. They're all adamant that that whateveritwas . . . "<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Sculpture. An abstract representation of Adam Smith's invisible hand."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Whose what?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The economist Adam Smith agreed that selfish, individual actions work together, through market forces, to the benefit of society as a whole--as if guided by an invisible hand."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He did, did he? Well, there's no accounting for taste, sir. Well, then, this very large and--if Mr Smith will forgive me-- visible triangular object was rock-solid on its base. It simply could not have fallen over without help." He gazed severely at the editor. "What's more, it will have taken three people to push it over on top of that unfortunate gentleman. What have you to say to that, sir?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The editor took a grip on himself. "I'm sorry, Inspector Greg. You've lost me. What exactly are you implying?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That the deceased was murdered by at least three people on the staff of your magazine."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Newspaper," corrected the editor absent-mindedly.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If you say so, sir. For all I care you can call it a comic. What I want to know is which of your staff you think might be responsible for this dastardly deed."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why should you point the finger at my staff? I am responsible only for the journalists. This building also houses <i>The Economist</i>'s management as well as six different organisations."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Inspector Greg looked at the editor sternly. "Come now, Mr Strachey. You are wasting your time and mine. Thomas St Loe Rathbone was murdered at some time between midnight and 1.30. The likelihood has to be that the murderers were in your building at the time. How else would they have known that Mr Rathbone was around and available to be murdered? Mrs Barrington tells us that if it hadn't been for all the unexpected news he'd have been gone hours earlier."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You're begging a large number of questions, inspector."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'm only a policeman, sir. Not an intellectual. Now Mrs Barrington's given us a list of who was on the premises at the relevant time. Can you confirm it?" He shoved a piece of paper at the editor, who scanned it and sighed. "Not a complete list, inspector. Julia can be forgetful. She hasn't put her husband on it, for instance. Or the security guards. Or Geoffrey Hodgskin, who spent much of the night on the 14th floor. Or even the finance editor, who, as you know, was one of those who discovered the body. And she's misspelled some names."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He amended the list and tossed it back. "You were asking which three people on that list might have had a motive."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"At least. Of course, there might have been more than three of them in it."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The editor sat bolt upright. "This is ridiculous, inspector. My colleagues are journalists, not members of the Mafia. They often have robust arguments with each other; on occasion some will get excited and raise their voices; one of them has even been known to throw a typewriter through a window. But in 153 years they've never resorted to homicide."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There's a first for everything," said the inspector genially. "Now, sir, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to take you through this list and ask you to tell me what relationship the late Mr Rathbone had with each of his colleagues. <p><img src="thuaft.gif"><br> "My head's spinning, lad. I can't take much more of this. I don't understand the half of what they're going on about."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You mean about the ideological differences, sir?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Whatever they call them. What was it that bird said?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Which one, sir?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The one that had swallowed a dictionary and kept going on about dead economists."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Ah, yes. Sophie Hamilton, you mean. She certainly seems to be a true intellectual."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"They're all bluestockings here if you ask me. The men as well as the women. But she takes the biscuit. What was all that about . . . " He consulted his notes. " . . . the revolt against classical economics? And what are Canesians and Freedmanites when they're at home? Football teams?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Asquith smiled rather condescendingly. "In <i>Economist</i> terms they are, sir. Keynes and Friedman were two of the most influential economists of this century. Dr Hamilton was explaining that their adherents on the paper had had a sharp difference over the causes of inflation, that a few young neo-Keynesians on the staff who favour an attack on high unemployment are prepared to consider an incomes policy, how the Friedmanites are still convinced that inflation is purely linked to the money supply and why . . . "<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Stow it, will you? It's bad enough being lectured in double dutch by a bossy cow in jeans who looks about 12 without having my own constable following suit."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He looked at his subordinate with ill-concealed resentment. "You should be one of them too, if you ask me, instead of working for the humble police force." He glowered. "Bloody graduates. All the same. No common sense. Nothing to beat the university of life."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Asquith, who was well used to this line of attack from his superiors, gazed expressionlessly at the table.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, all right then. I suppose you're only doing your best. But stop showing off and call in the next git."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Which git, sir?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That Geoffrey Hodgskin that had a row with the corpse on Monday. Maybe he'll make a bit more sense."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was a pity, Asquith remarked afterwards to his wife, that Hodgskin's answer to a question about why he thought Rathbone had ended a promising career underneath "Market Forces" should have led to a harangue about the invisible hand and the poetry of laisser-faire. Inspector Greg eventually erupted with rage. "Shut up," he bellowed.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a moment Asquith thought Hodgskin had been shocked into sanity, but he then leaped to his feet, cried "<i>L</i><i>&egrave;se majest</i><i>&eacute;</i>," and rushed from the room. Before he banged the door behind him, he turned and glared malevolently.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You're just like him. Meddlers. Statists. Possibly even protectionists! And not a fixed principle between you!"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As Hodgskin banged the door, Inspector Greg put his elbows on the table and clasped his head tightly in his hands. After a moment he looked up. "What was that about? As far as I could tell, he seemed to be saying Adam Smith did it."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, of course, in a sense he did," said Asquith. And then hastily, seeing Greg's face, "I think Mr Hodgskin isn't well, sir. He wasn't making any sense."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If it could have been done by one of them, we'd have him," said Greg. "He's barking." He shook his head. "But it's just not possible that he could have worked without accomplices. There's something funny going on here."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Sir, could I just . . . ?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Sssshhhh, lad. Stay quiet. Let's go and get lunch." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As they passed the reception desk, Zoe beamed cheerfully. "Found out whodunnit?"<br><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Fat chance." Greg stopped. "Are they as mad as they seem? Some of them don't seem to be on this planet."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, they're all right, most of them," she said indulgently. "It's just that they live in their heads too much. Anyway I'm sure none of them murdered Tom. Lots of them would have liked to get rid of Stuck-up Mr Superior Rathbone--including me--but they're not practical enough, for one thing."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The inspector's attention was caught by a screen on the wall behind her. "What's that."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's all part of the exhibition."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What exhibition?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We had a competition among the art schools to show the essence of <i>The Economist</i>. That's a film made up of identical photographs of James Wilson's statue that plays round and round in slow motion 24 hours a day."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"'Cos James is our founder.'<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What's the point of the film?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She took out a leaflet and read aloud: "The perceptual response of the ever-revolving loop is a metaphor for the velocity of circulation." Seeing the inspector's uncomprehending face, she added helpfully, "I think it's something to do with money. James was very interested in that sort of thing."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Was he interested in over-filled wastepaper baskets, too?" asked Greg, pointing to a large mess to the right of Wilson's statue. "Is that art as well? Or are you waiting for the garbage collectors?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Zoe was enjoying herself. "Surely you realise that's what's known as an installation. This one's called 'Paper Covered with Adam Smith's Invisible Ink'. And then out there used to be 'Fiscal Rectitude', until Geoffrey fell over it. And 'Market Forces', until it fell over on Tom. And that thing that's still standing--the giant kid's football with the question mark on top--is 'The Pursuit of Reason'."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Inspector Greg sighed. "From what I've seen of this place, they're not pursuing it fast enough. Come on, Asquith."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Shouldering their way through cameras and importunate reporters, they set off to a pub. <p><img src="xth4.jpg"><br> Mollified by a vast plate of steak-and-kidney pie and a pint of bitter, Greg beamed at his subordinate. "All right then, brains. What do you think?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I think Rathbone was murdered by just one person, sir."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How do you work that out? Is there an Arnie Schwarzenegger on the staff I haven't met yet?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"A lever, sir. You wouldn't have to be strong to lever up that sculpture and then push it over."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Greg ruminated for a moment. "You're seriously suggesting that Rathbone obligingly stood still while someone levered up that pile of metal and then shoved it on top of him?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not quite, sir." Asquith took a handkerchief from his pocket and opened it to reveal a large pebble. "I found this lying near the . . . ", he hesitated, " . . . the murder weapon."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So what? There are lots like that around the place."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"My theory, sir, is that Rathbone made a date to meet someone by 'Market Forces'. The murderer equipped himself with a crowbar, levered up the sculpture beforehand and wedged the pebble underneath. That gave him the purchase to push the sculpture over on Rathbone and disappear, knowing no one would pay any attention to a pebble."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Far-fetched."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Less so than a murderous troika, sir, if you'll forgive me."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Greg drained his second pint. "Sometimes I see the point of having graduates in the police force, son. Come on back to the Tower and let's ask about crowbars." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Summoned by Zoe, the head of maintenance went in search of <i>The Economist</i>'s crowbar and returned to announce its disappearance from its accustomed spot in the basement. "It'll be in some litter bin, somewhere, I expect," said Greg.<br><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But who'd have known where to find it?" enquired Asquith.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Put it this way, constable," said the maintenance supremo. "Anyone working here knows we're located in the basement. It wouldn't take a genius to guess we'd have a crowbar and to slip downstairs and find it after we'd gone home."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Greg nodded his thanks. "I'm going back to the board room, Asquith. Find the editor and bring him to me." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What do you mean he says no? Who does he think he is?"<br><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He's got a crisis, sir. The <font size=-1>US</font> Secretary of the Treasury's just been forced to resign over a Chinese rent-boy, Wall Street's taken a nosedive and they've got to change the first leader and give the American edition a new cover. He sends his apologies and will be with you as soon as he's sorted things out."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What about the others who were with him last night?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"They've gone home to rest: he's holding the fort."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Bugger. I wanted to hear more about Hodgskin."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Surely he's First Suspect now, sir."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You may be right, lad, but my guess is he wouldn't know a crowbar from a slide-rule."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He noticed Asquith's puzzled expression. "Don't you know what a slide-rule is? Oh, God. I suppose to you it's as relevant as a bloody abacus. Never mind. Just find Hodgskin."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No one could be found who had seen Hodgskin since late morning. The police whiled away the next hour or so taking unhelpful statements from whatever members of editorial were around. As with their colleagues that morning, there was a general consensus that <i>Economist</i> staff settled their differences at worst with rows or sulks or back-biting. No one was prepared to suggest any likely murderer, and all of them indicated that they couldn't imagine Hodgskin having the ability to unzip a banana, let alone locate a crowbar and do something murderous with it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why, he's a computer illiterate," observed Henry Lathbury, the classics double-first who informed the world what South American greybeards were doing wrong.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But we were told that he would have seen on the system that his leader had been scrubbed in favour of one by Rathbone which he'd have hated."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, yes. He could manage that. But he still used a portable typewriter. Couldn't even manage e-mail. Always barged into people's offices instead." He smirked complacently. "Too old to learn, I expect."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Greg was overwhelmed by a wave of hatred. "Thank you, young man. Now run along and tell your elders and betters how to run their affairs."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As Lathbury left, the editor came in. "Sorry about that," he said. "We're having a bad week for crises. There was just time to stop the American presses. Now how can I help you? I'd like this cleared up as fast as possible. The tabloids are going to play merry hell with our anonymity. Ever since they cottoned on to the fact that we're not all middle-aged men with pointy heads, they're trying to get together a of page mug-shots.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Now what do you want to know?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Strachey was in the midst of an impassioned defence of Hodgskin when the door opened to reveal a young woman who said breathlessly, "Edward, the foreign secretary's crossing the<br>
floor over Europe. Shall we stop the presses?"
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the editor ran from the room he called, "Sorry, but the way things are happening Deng will die just in time for us to stop our Asia edition. Come back tomorrow." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'm not happy with ideological murder, Asquith. People don't kill people over points of principle. They kill them for old-fashioned reasons like money or sex."<br><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Asquith looked shocked. "But this is <i>The Economist</i>, sir. They do things differently here."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Even intellectuals feel greed and lust, son."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not Hodgskin, from what we've seen. Or Dr Hamilton, for that matter. They seem to be pure intellects."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To Asquith's astonishment, Greg leaped to his feet and declaimed: "Hath not an intellectual eyes? Hath not an intellectual hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions?" He grinned triumphantly. "If you prick us, do we not bleed?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He fell back into his seat. "Just because I didn't go to university doesn't mean I'm completely ignorant. I do dramatic recitations at the Freemasons' charity Christmas concert. Now you mark my words, son. As Kipling said, 'The colonel's lady an' Judy O'Grady are sisters under their skins!' I'll bet my shirt the same's true of Sophie and Julia." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I know what he's getting at," said Asquith to his wife, who was a lecturer in political science. "And I'm not saying that intellectuals can't be driven by base passions. But I've been reading <i>The Economist</i>'s history, and from what I can see, Hodgskin is pretty typical. The founder, for instance, used to get his rocks off on arguments about currency."<br><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She yawned. "Sorry, Richard. I'm knackered. I had two seminars, a lecture and four distressed students today, quite apart from marking essays. And a faculty meeting to boot."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There you are. You may be an intellectual, but you've got students to keep your feet on the ground. These people get plucked out of Oxbridge or Harvard or wherever and transported to the 13th floor of the Economist Tower where they sit in cubicles so small they'd disgrace a Singapore prison, think deep thoughts and debate with each other like members of a senior common room."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He would have gone on, but his wife was asleep. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Poor kids," said Mrs Greg. "Sounds as if they don't get much fun."<br><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You're as bad as Asquith. Just because they argue about things we don't understand doesn't mean they don't have fun on the side. The kids are probably off clubbing as we speak. And I wouldn't be surprised if Dr Hamilton wasn't a right little raver when she's off duty. It's just that they've got to pretend to be serious."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In that case, why have they murdered someone because they didn't agree with him?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, never mind, dear. Let's see what's on telly." <p><img src="frimor.gif"><br> "Why didn't the security guard hear this thing falling over, Greg?" asked Chief Inspector Palgrave.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He had a hoax call around midnight from an unidentified chap claiming there was an intruder in the garage. Reckons 'Market Forces' must have been pushed on to Rathbone by the time he got back. He wouldn't have seen it, of course, in that dark corner beside Boodles."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Do we know what Rathbone was doing hanging about the plaza at that time of night anyway? Seems a funny time and place to make a date."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Indeed it does, sir. We're pursuing the matter."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Damn slowly," said Palgrave. "Get a bloody move on, Greg, and make that toffee-nosed little constable of yours shake a leg as well." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"All this praise of competition that you get here is infectious, Asquith. We'll split up. You take the intellectuals. I'll take the plebs. And I'll get the answer afore ye."<br><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Will Hodgskin be mine, sir?" asked Asquith eagerly.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Greg chuckled. "For all the good he is to you, lad. I've just had a call that he was home before midnight and safely in the arms of his landlady. She is, I'm told, a lady of mature charms who said with a wink that she'd succeeded in calming him down by the traditional methods."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You can't believe her, sir, surely?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Her next-door neighbour, a busy-body of the first order, agrees that he came home at around that time. Apparently he fell over several milk-bottles, woke her up and she rushed to the window and saw him just before he closed his front door."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Asquith swore. "Never mind, lad," said Greg gaily. "Cherchez l'intellectual. See you for lunch. <p><img src="friaft.gif"><br> "By the time they met, Asquith's spirits had recovered. "I think I've got it, sir. It's much more important than we thought. The prime suspect is the editor."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Wait until I've ordered my shepherd's pie, lad. A pint?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Just a half," said Asquith, who hated drinking at lunchtime but feared ridicule.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"OK, then," said Greg, when they had settled. "Why the editor?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He's not an economist and Rathbone was brilliant, arrogant and delighted in showing him up in front of his staff. The editor's prestige was slipping."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Couldn't he have fired him?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's not the sort of place where you can afford to fire your intellectual superiors. Everybody would know why'd he done it. According to a few of the people I talked to today who like him and think him a competent and decent bloke, the editor was getting increasingly pressurised at the Monday morning meetings as Rathbone pushed him to justify all the paper's traditional attitudes. It was like a weekly viva."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So he murdered him?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's certainly what some of them are suggesting. Apparently, he suffers from an inferiority complex because he got only a second-class degree."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We all have our crosses to bear," said Greg. "It's your round, lad." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Julia Barrington broke down under Greg's harsh questioning that afternoon. "It's all my fault he's dead. I should have known that e-mail cancelling our date wasn't his. It hadn't any quotations. If I'd kept our date he'd be alive now."<br><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Greg patted her shoulder. "Look on the bright side, love. If you'd met him, you might both be dead." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So you've won," said a disgruntled Asquith. "It was her husband, I suppose."<br><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Certainly seems like that on the face of it. You can't read people's e-mail unless you have their passwords, but the technical department would have no difficulty in cracking that."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Congratulations, sir. Simple marital jealousy, then."<br>

<h1 align=center>The wrong design</h1>


<CleverDrop>LEADERS of the European Union meet in Dublin this weekend to discuss, among other things, the budget-deficit rules that will apply to members of their planned economic and monetary union. To most readers, whether in Baltimore, Bangkok or even Brussels, this might seem an abstruse technical matter. Yet it goes to the heart of the debate over Europe's future and the prospects for its new currency. The details of the proposed "stability pact" have proved contentious, but governments seem willing to accept that tight restraints from the centre should apply to national policies on taxes and spending. That would be a far-reaching decision, and one that sets <font size=-1>EMU</font> on a wrong and dangerous course.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such a view may seem odd, given <i>The Economist</i>'s earlier support for monetary union in principle; or unduly dramatic, given that so few other voices have been raised against the stability pact. It will strike some as a reversal of our earlier stance. It isn't, and it may be useful to say why.<br>
<b><br>
</p><p><b>A design for diversity</b></b><br>
For years, since long before monetary union began to be seriously discussed, <i>The Economist</i> has maintained an unusual position on the matter. Our view has been that <font size=-1>EMU</font> could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how it is done. This has offended Euro-visionaries, eager to see monetary union proceed on almost any design, and it has disgusted Britain's minds-of-oak Eurosceptics, who think <font size=-1>EMU</font>, however conceived, is a foreign plot to enslave them.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Monetary union has long been more than an academic curiosity. Despite that, public debate on the subject has been dismally poor right across Europe. This is worrying. Without broad and informed consent, <font size=-1>EMU</font> may prove fragile--and informed consent requires proper debate. Equally, the costs of staying out, if that is what Britain or other countries choose, need to be widely understood. Far from engaging in argument, the pro and anti tribes ignore each other resolutely. Neither seems interested in the commonsense proposition that the case for monetary union turns on what kind of monetary union it is. In our view, that question--what kind of <font size=-1>EMU</font>?--remains the central issue. The budget-rules are crucial because of the light they shed on it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Before coming to that, however, what would a good <font size=-1>EMU</font> look like? It would derive the greatest gains from Europe's single market while preserving the broadest political autonomy for its nation states. There need be no conflict between those goals: it is wrong to argue that further economic integration requires further political integration. If the system's foundations were properly laid, political autonomy and economic integration could be mutually strengthening.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A truly single market in Europe, based on a single currency, could support competition among governments across nearly the full range of domestic policy--on education, welfare, taxes, public investment, labour-market regulation and more. Different ideas on particular policies, and on the overall role of the state, could be tested in a uniquely revealing way. Efforts to suppress such competition by harmonising large areas of economic policy are not just unnecessary; they militate against exploiting the single market to the full.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;You might ask, why should money be exempt from this competition among governments? Why harmonise currencies, as it were, and not those other things? The answer is simple. Allowing competition in monetary policy, which means letting currencies float, is collectively damaging. It causes volatility and misalignments in exchange rates. Coping with this consumes resources: it puts costs on business, impedes competition and retards investment. And in return for these public bads, there is no long-term advantage. In other areas of policy, differences over what works best (should labour markets be lightly or heavily regulated?) or what is right (how much should a country spend on its welfare state?) are inescapable. In these cases, diversity is good--a method of economic discovery and a necessary form of political self-expression. In monetary policy, there is no such uncertainty. Its only long-term purpose is to secure low inflation.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The advantage derived from retaining national monies is strictly short-term: the freedom to cushion a local economic slowdown by devaluing the currency. Notwithstanding Britain's experience since 1992, this freedom is much less than it is held up to be. Devaluation ends in tears (higher inflation, no lasting gain in competitiveness) far more often than in triumph, as Britain's longer-term record confirms.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this is well-trodden ground. Rather than tread it again, let us move on. Suppose that we have been right in the past to argue that there is much to be said for a monetary union of Europe's nation states. Suppose too, as we have also argued, that moving towards political union faster than the citizens of Europe want is wrong in principle and runs the risk of a bitter falling-out in due course. Supposing all that is true, why would a stability pact of the kind that Europe's leaders are contemplating be such a disturbing development?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After all, its defenders could argue as follows. Rules requiring governments to curb their debts and run small budget deficits do no more than codify good fiscal practice. Why should responsible governments feel threatened? Moreover, once <font size=-1>EMU</font> starts, there may be an opportunity for governments to borrow partly at their partners' expense. Fiscal rules are needed to guard against this. Finally, it might be argued, rules on deficits and debt leave entirely unconstrained the bigger decisions that governments make about how much to spend and on what; they require only that governments collect enough in taxes to pay their bills.<br>
<b><br>
</p><p><b>An awfully big adventure</b></b><br>
This may seem a powerful line of argument. We <a href="sf0803.html">return</a> to a detailed discussion of its economic aspects-- in particular, to the idea that rules are needed to restrain excessive borrowing. Our conclusion there is that, judged in narrow economic terms, the rules are not merely unnecessary but positively undesirable. For the moment, though, put the economics to one side and consider the politics.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The case for budget rules in Europe may be compared with the case for a balanced-budget amendment to America's constitution. Regardless of whether or not such an amendment would make sense, if the United States were ever to enact it the effect would be to set one branch of the government to restrain the others, according to a procedure that would be democratically well-grounded. What Europe is considering stands in stark contrast. Governments are to be held accountable not to separate powers at the national level but to supranational discretion; they are to be not merely restrained but, if they break the rules, punished, along with their citizens; all this according to procedures that command little or no popular consent. You could be forgiven for thinking the whole idea a plot to destroy the <font size=-1>EU</font> from within.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is possible that the <font size=-1>EU</font> will proceed by its usual methods--making progress incrementally, reacting to changing political and economic circumstances, interspersed by bursts of constitution-making by treaty. Those who argue that the stability pact is acceptable, because it won't work anyway and will eventually have to be ditched, are presumably making this assumption. At the end of that course may indeed lie the perfect Union sought by Euro-visionaries. Yet <font size=-1>EMU</font> is a far bigger and riskier adventure than any that the Union has previously embarked upon. The risk of doing so with a poor design, amid a constitutional arrangement that still lacks popular support in many member countries, is that if an economic crisis comes, pitting member against member, or member against the Union, it will come too quickly and on too large a scale to be dealt with in the usual way. When <font size=-1>EMU</font> fails that test, the entire structure could fold.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is no need to take this risk. The best course would be to fix <font size=-1>EMU</font>, rejecting both Germany's stability pact and France's counter-proposal of a "stability council", which is unnecessary and looks designed to put political pressure on the supposed-to-be-independent European Central Bank. Admittedly, if a badly designed <font size=-1>EMU</font> is indeed launched in 1999, each country will still then have to balance the costs and benefits of joining in or staying out, and that balance will vary from country to country. But such a calculation lies in the future. The priority now, for all the governments of the Union, must be to improve the design. There is still time.<br>

<h2>NATO looks east</h2>
The West's foreign ministers agreed in Brussels that next July <font size=-1>NATO</font> would unveil its plan to <b>expand into Eastern Europe</b>. It will offer more security co-operation to countries not joining. Russia's foreign minister said his country would start talks to define <font size=-1>NATO</font>-Russian relations.<p>
President Yeltsin told his defence minister, General <b>Igor Rodionov</b>, to retire from the army--but to hold on to his government post, technically making him Russia's first civilian defence minister since Trotsky.<p>
In the run-up to the summit meeting of the European Union's 15 countries in Dublin on December 13th and 14th, France and Germany argued about a "<b>stability pact</b>" to control borrowing by members of Europe's proposed single currency. <p>
Demonstrations which began two weeks ago in Serbia's largest cities continued to weaken the grip of the president, <b>Slobodan Milosevic</b>. Independent trade unions, as well as supporters of opposition parties, began to take part in the protests. No compromise was in sight.<p>
The president of Slovakia, Michal Kovac, accused the government of <b>Vladimir Meciar </b>of--among other things--perpetrating "violence and physical liquidation" and "corrupting and criminalising state organs and political life".<p>
Public-sector workers went on strike in <b>Spain </b>to protest against the government's decision to freeze their salaries for the whole of 1997. The government said most people came to work as usual.<p>
<h2>Double fury</h2>
To the fury of <b>Israelis</b>, an Israeli woman settler and her 12-year-old son were shot dead by Arabs who then fled to Ramallah. To the fury of <b>Palestinians</b>, Jerusalem's municipality gave planning permission for 132 Jewish homes in the heart of Arab East Jerusalem.<p>
After a six-year gap, <b>Iraq's oil</b> began flowing through Turkey again. Under a <font size=-1>UN</font>-sponsored food-for-oil deal, Iraq can sell $2 billion-worth of oil over six months. Iraq's dispute with the <font size=-1>UN</font> over missile engines (which is holding up any wider lifting of sanctions) was "frozen" until February. <p>
<b>Ghanaians</b> re-elected their president, Jerry Rawlings, for one more term. In a reasonably fair election, the challenger, John Kufuor, won 40% of the vote.<p>
On its 50th birthday, the <font size=-1>UN</font> <b>Children's Fund </b>(<font size=-1>UNICEF</font>) called for an end to hazardous child labour. At least a quarter of the developing world's children work, and many will continue to do so until poverty is reduced. <p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
The United States protested at the inclusion of Hiroshima's peace dome--a ruin, preserved from 1945--among 35 new <b>World Heritage Sites</b> named by <font size=-1>UNESCO</font>. Others included national parks in Nigeria and China, a barrier reef off Belize, a group of medieval towns in Mauritania, and Russia's Lake Baikal.<p>
<h2>Core competence</h2>
Defining his second-term agenda in an address to the moderate Democratic Leadership Council, President Clinton said his first priority was to balance the budget. After that, he would work on welfare reform and campaign-finance reform. He spoke of creating "a vital and <b>dynamic centre </b>that is a place of action."<p>
The American government offered a $500,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the person who bombed the Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta last summer. To avoid a libel lawsuit, <font size=-1>NBC</font> television agreed to pay an undisclosed sum to <b>Richard Jewell</b>, who was cleared in October of involvement in the bombing. <p>
For the eighth year running, <b>Los Angeles </b>was named by the Texas Transportation Institute as the most gridlocked city in America.<p>
In <b>Colombia</b>, deaths from guerrilla and paramilitary violence mounted. The government promised a crackdown on paramilitaries and a $1m reward for the capture of one notorious leader. So-called left-wing guerrillas made yet more conditions for freeing 60 captured soldiers. <p>
<b>Peru's legislature </b>passed a law, hastily put to it by President Alberto Fujimori, that freed retired General Rodolfo Robles from the military-justice system. At liberty, the general denounced the ambitions of the president.<p>
The <b>Bolivian government </b> privatised, in three chunks, parts of the state oil company, <font size=-1>YPFB</font>. It will still hold 50% of them, but through<p>
privately managed pension funds.<p>
<h2>Governing again</h2>
After nine weeks of post-election haggling, Jim Bolger begins his third term as <b>New Zealand's prime minister</b>, this time as head of a centre-right coalition. Winston Peters, who has sought curbs on Asian immigration, and has been critical of Mr Bolger's policies, became his deputy.<p>
In a Hong Kong vote by 400 prominent people chosen by China, Tung Chee-hwa, a shipping magnate, was picked to be <b>Hong Kong's chief executive </b>when the British colony reverts to China in July 1997.<p>
The lower house of Australia's federal Parliament voted to overturn a law passed in the Northern Territory allowing voluntary <b>euthanasia</b>. The Senate will take a final decision on the issue.<p>
In a battle between rival <b>taxi firms </b>in Taipei ten drivers were hurt and 60 cars were smashed. In a taxi war last year, 300 cars were destroyed and 50 drivers injured.<p>

<h2>Holding pattern</h2>
 <h4><a href="bw1.gif">(See chart)</a></h4><p>
The Japanese government is set to lift the country's ban on holding companies. American occupation authorities forbad them in 1947 so as to break the hold of the <i>zaibatsu</i> (conglomerates). The catalyst for the change is the decision to split the world's largest company, <b>Nippon Telegraph & Telephone</b>, into three--all to be owned by one holding company. The change will allow Japanese companies to spread their liabilities and also shed excess capacity more readily.<p>
Germany's <b>Hoechst</b>, one of Europe's biggest drug and chemical groups, made an FFr18.1 billion ($3.5 billion) offer for the 43.3% of Roussel Uclaf it does not already own. Anticipation of the bid had driven up the French drug group's share price by 70% this year. Hoechst also plans to merge its DM6.5 billion ($4.2 billion) specialty-chemicals operations with Clariant, a Swiss chemical firm, creating a market leader.<p>
After a week of dithering, the French government announced <b>a new plan for Thomson</b>. It now says that next year it will privatise the troubled defense and consumer-electronics company in two parts. <p>
Homestake Mining is paying $2.3 billion for Santa Fe Pacific to create a <b>gold producer </b>in North America second only to Barrick Gold of Canada. An unwelcome bid from Newmont Mining for Santa Fe was earlier rejected.<p>
Britain's Monopolies Commission is to investigate the proposed takeover of <b>Carlsberg-Tetley</b> by <b>Bass</b>. The two combined would become the country's largest brewer with a 38% share of the beer market.<p>
The Australian Senate narrowly approved the A$8 billion ($6 billion) sale of one-third of <b>Telstra Corp</b>, the country's telecoms carrier. It will be the biggest share offering in the country's history. <p>
Aiming to hang on to its 12m cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> subscribers as competition from satellite-<font size=-1>TV</font> mounts, <b>Time Warner </b>is buying 1m new digital-<font size=-1>TV</font> set-top boxes, at a cost of around $400m. The new boxes will more than treble the average subscriber's choice of channels to about 175.<p>
<h2>Question:</h2>
"How do we know when<p>
<b>irrational exuberance</b> has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions?" The answer to Alan Greenspan was a bout of rational depression which continued to upset shares during the week after the Fed chairman's speech.<p>
Russia's main stockmarket regulator scored a modest, but important, point for <b>shareholder rights </b>when it insisted that Surgut Oil and Gas, one of the country's biggest energy firms, call off a controversial share-dilution scheme.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
In the first pay-out since the <b>Bank of Credit and Commerce International </b>was closed down by regulators five years ago, liquidators are paying out $1.35 billion to over 25,000 creditors, 24.5% of their losses. The final dividend is likely to be between 30% and 40%.<p>
<b>Aon Corporation</b> agreed to buy Alexander & Alexander Services, another American insurance broker. The deal, worth $1.2 billion, will create the world's biggest broker.<p>
<h2>Consuming less</h2>
 <h4><a href="bw2.gif">(See chart)</a></h4><p>
Sluggish consumer spending in North America and Europe this year has brought a sharper slowdown than expected in the growth in <b>world trade</b>, said a report released to coincide with the first ministerial gathering of the World Trade Organisation, held in Singapore. The <font size=-1>WTO</font> made some progress in its talks on liberalising trade in telecoms and technology. China also indicated that it would lower trade barriers to gain admittance to the <font size=-1>WTO</font>. <p>
The strong dollar produced America's largest-ever quarterly current-account<b> deficit</b>. It rose to $48 billion, 19% more than in the previous quarter, as quarterly merchandise exports fell for the first time in three years. Japan's current-account <b>surplus</b> in October was down 19.6% on the year, to &#165;367.4 billion ($3.27 billion), a sharper drop than predicted.<p>
<h2>Regrets, a few</h2>
The <b>industrial-espionage spat </b>between General Motors and Volkswagen shows no signs of ending peacefully. Ferdinand Piech, <font size=-1>VW</font>'s chairman, expressed regrets over the legal costs and the "confusion and anger", but did not apologise. An apology is a prerequisite, as far as <font size=-1>GM</font> is concerned, for an out-of-court settlement. <font size=-1>VW</font> also said 1996 profits and sales would be well up on last year. Meanwhile, German prosecutors indicted four <font size=-1>VW</font> employees, including Jose Ignacio Lopez, on criminal charges.<p>
The British government said the proposed alliance between <b>British Airways </b>and <b>American Airlines </b>would not face a monopolies inquiry if the two gave up 168 take-off and landing slots at London's main airport, Heathrow. <font size=-1>BA</font> has 3,100 slots there. Other American airlines said <font size=-1>BA</font>'s concessions were not enough. <p>
After years of wrangling, nine oil and gas companies, including America's Chevron and Russia's Lukoil, and the governments of Russia, Kazakhstan and Oman signed a $2 billion agreement to build a 1,440km (895 mile) <b>Caspian pipeline </b>that will connect remote but oil-rich western Kazakhstan with the Black Sea.<p>

<h1>And what Alice found there</h1>

<p><b>Europe's road to a single currency was mapped out in the Maastricht treaty. Or so you supposed. Germany says that one or two details still need sorting out</b></p><br>
THE criteria for entry into Europe's monetary union have a looking-glass quality: try for years to reach them and the goal recedes; do nothing and you're almost there. Like Alice, voters are baffled onlookers. And for European politicians, no image seems more appropriate than the White Rabbit. Like that flustered courtier, Helmut Kohl, Jacques Chirac and others are looking at their watches and muttering "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!" as they scamper towards Wonderland. The cause of their nervousness is the timetable for <font size=-1>EMU</font> laid down in the Maastricht treaty.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The treaty's biggest loophole--a provision that allowed the start of <font size=-1>EMU</font> to be postponed from 1997 until 1999--has already been exploited. The treaty now obliges all countries that meet the convergence criteria to lock their exchange rates irrevocably on the first day of 1999, in preparation for the adoption of a common currency, the euro, in 2002. Only Britain and Denmark are not bound by the plan. For the rest, the formal position is that the big decisions have already been taken. All that remains is to tie up some loose ends and let next year's figures on the convergence indicators take their course. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To which Alice retorted, "Stuff and nonsense!" More than you might think, given the timing, the nature of Europe's proposed monetary union remains far from clear. Its character--supposing it goes ahead at all--will be decided not just by the design laid down in the treaty, but also by the various fudges that governments will undertake between now and 1999.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the most important adjustment will provoke fierce debate at the meeting of Europe's leaders which begins in Dublin on December 13th. Germany has decided that countries taking part in <font size=-1>EMU</font> must be placed under a permanent obligation--through a "stability pact"--to keep budget deficits low.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In doing this, it is stretching the terms of the Maastricht treaty. The convergence criteria specify that countries with budget deficits of more than 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> will be ineligible for membership of <font size=-1>EMU</font>--unless the deficit is (a) "close" to the target and (b) either moving in the right direction or only "temporarily" too high. The treaty also obliges all governments to avoid "excessive deficits". As with the 3% threshold, this notion is defined flexibly. The drafters of the treaty foresaw a long and tortuous procedure before sanctions are applied to violators--persistent and egregious violators, it was assumed. The treaty justified these provisions by the need not to control deficits minutely, but to avoid "gross errors" in budgetary policy.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was never envisaged that <font size=-1>EMU</font> members would be under a strict obligation to keep their deficits always (or nearly always) below 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>, or that violators would face semi-automatic and massive fines. But that is what Germany has proposed. (As Alice told the king: "That's not a regular rule: you invented it just now." "It's the oldest rule in the book," said the king. "Then it ought to be number one," said Alice.") If a rule like the stability pact were adopted at Dublin or thereafter, it would affect Europe's monetary union profoundly.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Curiouser and curiouser</b></b><br>
According to the German formula (which is opposed by other countries, notably France), governments failing to keep their budget deficits below 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> would have to place "a deposit" with the European authorities. If the excess borrowing continued, the funds would be forfeit. Fines might be calculated at the rate of 0.2% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> plus another 0.1% for every percentage point by which the deficit exceeded 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>. A deficit of 6% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> would attract the maximum fine of 0.5% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>--an enormous sum.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To be confident of hardly ever violating the 3%-of-<font size=-1>GDP</font> limit, governments would need to run budget surpluses during "normal" times, leaving room for borrowing to rise during recessions. In this way, the "automatic stabilisers" of fiscal policy would be allowed some scope to work.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Otherwise, it would be not a stability pact but a deepen-your-recession pact. Suppose a country with a deficit of 2% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> (small by contemporary European standards) began moving into recession. To prevent the deficit rising above the ceiling, the government would need to cut spending and raise taxes--worsening the slowdown and putting further upward pressure on borrowing. In thinking about the scale of the needed fiscal adjustment, recall that when Britain moved from boom to recession at the end of the 1980s, the public sector's financial balance deteriorated by ten percentage points of <font size=-1>GDP</font>: from a surplus of 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> to a deficit of 7%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the government failed to hold borrowing at less than 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>, it would then have to pay a big fine-in-waiting to the European authorities. It could hardly be allowed to meet this impost by borrowing. If the rules allowed such a manoeuvre, they would be saying, in effect: borrowing to pay unemployment benefit is not allowed, but borrowing to pay the fine for borrowing to pay unemployment benefit is. This seems preposterous, even by <font size=-1>EU</font> standards. So the government would have to cut spending and raise taxes once more--all in the midst of a recession, by command of the European Union. If that is not enough to bring anti-Brussels protest on to the streets, what is?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The great peculiarity of the debate about the stability pact is that, so far, few if any advocates of closer political integration have recognised the danger that it poses to their vision of Europe's harmonious and ever closer union. This apparent complacency may reflect the conviction that, in practice, the rules would have to be waived. That seems to be what the French want: a flexible version of the pact. Many precedents for such flexibility have been set (more on the convergence criteria shortly). Even so, it seems odd to "strengthen" monetary union by writing rules that are acceptable only because no one expects them to be enforced.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Supporters of a stability pact reply that, if credible, it would deter governments from making a fiscal mess in the first place. Moreover, they say, there is a clear need for such a pact. In part, this is a matter of politics. German voters need to be convinced that the euro will be as strong as the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark they are about to surrender; otherwise they might simply reject <font size=-1>EMU</font>. A stability pact, by calling for better-than-German standards of public finance, offers reassurance that the euro will be solid.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A pact also seems to be needed for economic reasons. The argument goes as follows: once <font size=-1>EMU</font> begins, governments will find it easier to borrow more. At present a would-be heavy borrower--Italy, say--is limited by the size of its domestic capital market. If the Italian government wants to borrow more than this market is able to supply, it must borrow in a foreign currency, which exposes the government to exchange-rate risk. But with <font size=-1>EMU</font> in place, Italy's "domestic" capital market is suddenly much bigger: <font size=-1>EMU</font>-wide, in fact. The government can borrow far more than before without taking on any exchange-rate risk.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Supporters of a stability pact claim that special arrangements will be needed to prevent this increased capacity to borrow leading to all sorts of dangers. When Italy seizes its borrowing chance, they say, the cost will be shared with its <font size=-1>EMU</font> partners. The increase in Italy's borrowing will force interest rates higher across the union. In effect, it is argued that without a pact, the other countries will end up subsidising Italy to borrow too much. Finally, if all this were not enough, there is also the question of default-risk. The markets may calculate that <font size=-1>EMU</font> provides an implicit guarantee of its members' debts. If so, any risk premium on Italian debt will disappear, again encouraging the government to borrow more. And if this overborrowing does lead Italy to default, the other governments may indeed end up bailing it out. A stability pact may seem a plausible response to these dangers--and none too onerous, you might think, given that it appears to call for no more than good fiscal practice.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Beware the Jabberwock, my son</b></b><br>
Quite how onerous it proves to be depends on the details, which await the outcome of negotiations at the summit, or later. What can be said now is that Germany's first proposal went far beyond what most governments would regard as sound fiscal practice. It would appear not only to leave less scope for the operation of automatic stabilisers than nearly all economists would regard as wise; it would also leave less than the most fiscally conservative governments (including Germany's) have adopted in practice. To tie governments' hands as tightly as that seems downright dangerous--especially considering that, with currencies and interest rates locked together, fiscal policy under <font size=-1>EMU</font> will have to carry more of the burden of cushioning recessions than it does now.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What of the argument that some fiscal rules, even if less strict than the ones Germany would like, will be needed to check the greater temptation to borrow too much? This is less convincing than it seems at first sight. It is true that the advent of a euro capital market would make it possible for countries to borrow at lower exchange-rate risk. But this privilege comes at a heavy price: that of abandoning control of your monetary printing-press.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a many-currency Europe, currency risk goes hand in hand with the opportunity to reduce the real burden of debt by raising inflation: these are two sides of the same coin. In principle, one cannot say which effect of <font size=-1>EMU</font> would be greater--the effect of less exchange-rate risk (tending to raise borrowing) or the effect of denying governments inflation as a way to service their debts (tending to reduce it). In practice, the latter may well dominate.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Suppose, however, that some governments did borrow more. Would this force interest rates higher in other <font size=-1>EMU</font> countries, as advocates of the stability pact say? The effect, if any, would be small. The world's capital markets are increasingly integrated, forming a single pool. The euro capital market would be part of it. Higher borrowing by one or more European countries would therefore raise euro interest rates only (or almost only) to the extent that it raised world interest rates. And that would not be much: Europe's economies are too small to have much effect on the global demand for capital.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What if a country overborrowed so much that the markets feared it might default? Again, there is little danger that its <font size=-1>EMU</font> partners would suffer as a result--provided they had made it clear to the markets that there would be no bail-out. In that case, the default-risk premium would be loaded exclusively on to the debt of the over-borrower; there would be no free-riding. But the no-bail-out promise is essential. The Maastricht treaty explicitly forbids governments or the European central bank to come to a defaulter's rescue. If the markets doubt this promise, the default-risk premium may be spread more widely. And if governments themselves doubt it, they may be tempted to borrow more adventurously.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But having granted this, how much does the stability pact really help? Its advocates, notably Germany, are undermining the treaty's no-bail-out rule by suggesting there is a fiscal problem that needs solution at a European level, instead of by insisting that each country's fiscal stance is a matter for it and it alone. By doing that, they are adding to the moral hazard that the treaty was at pains to eliminate. Indeed, the outcome may be worse than this. Suppose governments and markets view the pact as a sign that, in extremis, there will indeed be a bail-out; suppose also that the markets think that the pact is either too weak to be any use or too strong to be enforceable. This would be the worst of all worlds: maximum incentive to cheat, minimum protection if anybody does.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Will you join the dance?</b></b><br>
The merits of the stability pact may be dubious (at best), but Germany's determination to write new rules for the conduct of governments once <font size=-1>EMU</font> begins is easy to understand. Its problem is that the convergence criteria will not, as it might once have hoped, divide the candidates for <font size=-1>EMU</font> neatly into solid citizens on one side and troublemakers on the other. If anybody needs reminding, the criteria are to be tested on figures for 1997, available in the spring of 1998, and are as follows:<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>Inflation</b>: no more than one and a half percentage points higher than the average of the three best-performing states;<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>Long-term interest rates</b>: no more than two points above the same benchmark;<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>Budget deficit</b>: 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> or less;<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>Public debt</b>: no more than 60% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>;<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>Exchange rate</b>: observe the "normal margins" of the exchange-rate mechanism (<font size=-1>ERM</font>) for two years.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Next year, only Luxembourg will comply with all these criteria, on the strictest definition. For that reason, the criteria will be loosely applied. The need for fudge-room was anticipated in the treaty--and there is plenty. (The European Commission's attitude to the criteria is rather like Humpty Dumpty's to language: "When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean, neither more nor less.<b>"</b>) <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The public-debt criterion, for instance, may be deemed met if "the ratio is sufficiently diminishing". "Sufficient for what?" you may ask. Sufficient to let you in, obviously. The budget criterion will also let you through, provided your deficit "comes close" to the threshold. Since 1993, the <font size=-1>ERM</font> bands have been widened to plus-or-minus 15%, so nobody is sure what "normal margins" means. Britain says this criterion is defunct (a view that would protect its option to join <font size=-1>EMU</font> in 1999). To be on the safe side, Italy and Finland resolved to enter the <font size=-1>ERM</font> this year, aiming to clock up two years inside before the start of 1999.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On top of this, there is scope for all manner of accounting fiddles. The European Commission is supposed to stop such jiggery-pokery, but it rarely meets a scam it doesn't like. Of the multiple dodges so far submitted to it by France, Spain, Belgium and Italy (to name just four), it has blocked only one, a Belgian wheeze. In September it ruled in favour of the biggest and most patently bogus manoeuvre yet. France T&eacute;l&eacute;com plans to pay the French government a sum equal to roughly 0.5% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> to take on its pension liabilities. This purports to reduce the budget deficit in 1997; plainly, it does nothing whatever to improve the French public finances. Somehow, the commission thought this was all right.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given flexibility of that sort, the convergence criteria could let in almost everybody; only Greece seems beyond the pale. Barring accidents, therefore, the list of members to be drawn up in April 1998 (when Britain, by the way, will have the presidency) will be a matter of ticklish diplomatic negotiation, not disinterested statistical scrutiny.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The treaty says that the commission and the European Monetary Institute (forerunner of the new central bank) will report on whether the criteria have been met, and the commission will recommend countries for admission. Finally, heads of government will, by qualified-majority vote, make the choice. The scope for tactical voting-- for instance, Spain and Italy seeking to block France's entry unless they are let in too--promises some fine entertainment. ("<i>Everybody </i>has won, and <i>all </i>must have prizes.") Then, the decisions may be subject to challenge in the courts. Recall that Germany's constitutional court almost blocked ratification of the Maastricht treaty. The scrum of 1998 will make the Maastricht process look like a model of judicial propriety. At the end of it, Germany could have some monetary partners it would rather be without.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Sentence first--verdict afterwards</b></b><br>
Germany's doubts about its future partners may be understandable: in economic terms, the country has more to lose from monetary union than any other. Yet those doubts conspire to make a successful <font size=-1>EMU</font> much harder to achieve. The stability pact, one expression of those doubts, could easily misfire, turning popular opinion against the whole idea. But that is not the only way in which German anxieties could undermine the great German vision.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if all goes well until <font size=-1>EMU</font>'s participants are chosen in 1998, Europe's single-currency design will still be acutely vulnerable between then and 2002. According to the Maastricht timetable, exchange rates will be locked at the start of 1999. Exactly how they will be locked poses something of a dilemma. If the authorities leave the fixing of rates until the last moment, speculation may cause a lot of exchange-rate turbulence in the very months or weeks before <font size=-1>EMU</font> starts. If instead the rates were announced in advance, as some propose, everything would depend on the credibility of Europe's monetary authorities. If they retain the markets' confidence, speculation could help pin exchange rates at the preannounced levels; if not, the preannounced parities might be attacked just as the old <font size=-1>ERM</font> was--with similar results.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The problems will continue, and perhaps worsen, once exchange rates have been fixed "irrevocably", at whatever parities, at the start of 1999. The plan proposes that national currencies will then stay in circulation for another three years, until the euro replaces them in 2002. Surely, you might think, this cannot be tenable: denied even the flexibility of the old <font size=-1>ERM</font> (in which currencies were allowed some freedom to move), this system will surely yield to speculative attack. Europe's planners say it will not. By this point, Europe's new central bank, the <font size=-1>ECB</font>, will have taken command of monetary policy: national central banks will be acting on its instructions. This, it is argued, makes all the difference.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Suppose that the French start swapping their francs for <font size=-1>D</font>-marks. The <font size=-1>ECB</font> will simply order more <font size=-1>D</font>-marks, and fewer francs, to be issued. The crucial thing is that it would be willing, and perceived to be willing, to do this without limit--that is, until the entire stock of francs had been converted into <font size=-1>D</font>-marks. This prompts an obvious question: would Germany and its Bundesbank go along with this? Or do they regard the period between 1999 and 2002 as a last chance to change their minds about the whole idea? Any suspicion of the latter could give markets the incentive they need to test the system to destruction. As with the <font size=-1>ERM</font>, the expectation of a change of parities--and, with that, the end of this plan for monetary union-- would become self-fulfilling.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Is the stability-pact zeal of the German government a sign of steely confidence that <font size=-1>EMU</font> will happen, and be done well? Or is it a sign of second thoughts, an intimation that things are not turning out as Mr Kohl hoped? He himself may not yet know the answer--but a lot depends on it. As the Red Queen warned Alice: "When you've once said a thing, that fixes it, and you must take the consequences."<br>

<p><b>North-east politics</b></p>
<h1>Fog on the Tyne, Newcastle cut off</h1>

<font size=1>NEWCASTLE</font><p>
THE great iron lattice-work bridges arching across the River Tyne are Newcastle's most famous landmarks. Though outsiders do not much notice it, they also span the frontier between the city and its smaller and poorer cousin on the south bank-- Gateshead. And, lately, more than just commuters have been flowing across the bridges. Gateshead has been winning prestige projects in the north-east of England that in previous years would have gone to Newcastle as the regional capital. The divided Labour group that runs Newcastle seems incapable of putting up a united front to stop this drain.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The latest bout of irritation on the north bank has emerged with the realisation that Gateshead is inching ever closer to achieving what seemed a distant dream a few years back--creating the biggest exhibition and performance space for the contemporary arts outside London. If this happens, it will be because Gateshead Metropolitan Borough Council has stepped in while Newcastle City Council dithers. Last month, Northern Arts struck a deal with the Gateshead council to build a &#163;35m music centre to house a music school, two concert halls, and the Northern Sinfonia orchestra.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Newcastle had turned down Northern Arts, balking at the prospect of having to cough up &#163;200,000 a year for the running costs of the centre. "We didn't get a formal business plan, and without one you could run into long-term revenue problems," explains Tony Flynn, leader of Newcastle City Council. Gateshead was not given a business plan either, but nevertheless reckoned it was worth the gamble.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The money to build the centre has yet to be awarded by the National Lottery, but the signs are that it will be handed out. It also looks likely to be forthcoming for a &#163;46m scheme to convert the disused Baltic Flour Mill, next door to the music centre site, into a contemporary-art gallery. The Arts Council has already spent &#163;480,000 on a study which suggests the plan is workable.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But far from applauding these Gateshead initiatives which Newcastle's people will be able to use without paying any extra council tax, Newcastle councillors seem decidedly surly about them. Colin Gray, chairman of the finance committee, snorted in a letter to a local paper, the <i>Journal</i>, that the music centre was "the new sex symbol of the chattering classes" and that matters of "true regional significance", such as improvements to the <font size=-1>A</font>1, were being sacrificed. Other councillors have sniffed at Gateshead's plans for a footbridge to make it easier for Newcastle citizens to get to the arts centres as unnecessary and liable to damage the view of the Tyne Bridge.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Flynn protests that these comments caricature Newcastle council's official position, which supports the arts centres and the footbridge. It is simply, he says, that the council is worried about adding more burdens to its revenue budget, which had to be cut by &#163;8m this year.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other councillors, however, tell a different story, of how the ruling Labour group has split into different factions since Sir Jeremy Beecham quit in 1994 after 17 years as leader. East-end and west-end groups are fighting for more cash for their respective parts of the city, an old guard does not see eye-to-eye with new councillors, and all seem unable to unite over common interests. "There is still a power vacuum. Flynn cannot get things through the group," says one councillor. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The indecision is making life difficult for Sir John Hall, who is looking for a site to build a new stadium for Newcastle United Football Club. After various clandestine meetings between the club and different council factions, the council eventually agreed to ask Sir John to submit a plan for a stadium on part of the Town Moor, open ground to the north of the city centre.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This has been vigorously criticised by people who live nearby. Sir John, aware that council politics might scupper this scheme, has let it be known that it is looking at other sites, including one in Gateshead. George Gill, leader of Gateshead council who has known Sir John since the football-club owner made his fortune out of the Metrocentre shopping complex in Gateshead, says the two have had only an informal chat. But, he adds, "We have got the facilities for them."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sir John may only be using the threat of Gateshead to goad Newcastle into making a decision. Building arts centres is bad enough, but the mere thought of having to cross the Tyne to watch Newcastle United is enough to make any city Magpie fan sick into his brown ale.<br>

<p><b>National Lottery</b></p>
<h1>Bookies raise the stakes</h1>

THOSE Britons not hoping for a share of the National Lottery's enormous winnings seem to have their eyes fixed on the enormous profits earned by the lottery's operator, Camelot. The Labour Party has announced that after Camelot's franchise runs out, it will either cap the next operator's profits or hand over the lottery to a non-profit-making outfit. The Virgin group has long offered to hand over a higher proportion of earnings to worthy causes in an effort to secure the franchise. Many charities argue that they deserve a bigger share. Now Britain's bookmakers have devised a scheme to win back the slice of the winnings they have lost to Camelot.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since it was launched two years ago, bookmakers have complained that the lottery lures their clients away with huge jackpots, reducing their profits. A study by the Henley Centre, a consultancy, calculated that the betting industry lost nearly 3,000 employees, 400 shops and &#163;47m in profits during the lottery's first year. A reduction in betting duty in the 1996 budget offset the worst of the downturn, but did not restore earlier profit levels. So in an effort to regain some of the lost ground, the three biggest bookmakers, Coral, William Hill, and Ladbroke's, will launch a daily rival to the National Lottery on December 16th.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Doing so has not been easy. When the government devised the lottery, it took great pains to safeguard the monopoly of the franchisee. Apart from Camelot, only charities and private clubs are allowed to run lotteries. The former can sell a maximum of &#163;1m of tickets, while the latter can cater only to members. Prevented from running a lottery themselves, the bookmakers might ordinarily just take bets on the outcome of Camelot's, as they do on the result of the Irish national lottery. But the government closed that loophole too.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now bookmakers think they can get round these regulations (Camelot disagrees) with a new daily draw, called 49's. Although it follows the format of the National Lottery closely, with six winning numbers drawn from a pool of 49 (hence the name), it will not technically be a lottery, since betting shops will not sell any tickets. Instead, they will take fixed-odds bets on the outcome of the draw. This method seems to evade the side-betting ban too, because although the 49's draws may vividly resemble those of the National Lottery, they will be completely separate. Basically, bookmakers will take side bets on a lottery-style event of their own devising.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The 49's draw comes with all the trimmings. <font size=-1>SIS</font>, a company which broadcasts racing to betting shops, will televise the daily draw. Arthur Andersen, an accounting firm, is monitoring the proceedings, while Group4 will handle security. Any betting shop can participate for a weekly fee of &#163;5; about 7,000 have already signed up. The organisers aim initially to capture 2% of the industry turnover, or roughly &#163;120m a year.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thus, 49's does exactly what the government hoped it had prevented: it creates a non-charitable rival to the National Lottery. Unhampered by the financial burden of shelling out to charities, the betting-shops can offer bigger prizes than the National Lottery. They might therefore entice customers away from Camelot.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But bookies point out that many people placing side bets on the Irish lottery also buy tickets for the main event. Anyway, the British lottery is likely to dwarf 49's. Camelot brings in more revenue in two weeks than the bookmakers expect to in a year, and is starting a second weekly draw.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government might have prevented this challenge to the lottery if it had offered another cut in betting duty or simply caved in over side-betting. But 49's, once launched, is unlikely to disappear. Nor will the saga end there: as long as the National Lottery continues to make money, it will continue to attract competitors hoping to win their own jackpot.<br>

<p><b>Police powers</b></p>
<h1>Breeding bugs</h1>

THE government is full of new schemes to crack down on crime: handgun bans, stalking laws, mandatory sentencing, combat-knife regulation and so on. On top of all this, the Police bill currently making its way through Parliament will increase police powers to combat organized crime. Labour, keen to jump on the bandwagon, has lent its support. The police and public also seem to welcome all moves which promise greater security. But a handful of law lords are giving warning that the bill will hit civil liberties harder than it will criminals.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most contentious clause deals with surveillance, especially bugging. Under the new law, chief constables could authorise bugging without needing to seek a judge's approval, if they thought it might help solve a "serious" crime. The person bugged need not be a suspected criminal--just someone who might reveal some useful information. The only external supervision would come from a senior judge, who would review buggings after the event to check that the police had not exceeded their powers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bill's supporters argue that it does nothing more than give a legal footing to a common practice. In 1995 the police in England and Wales used such surveillance techniques 1,300 times, following Home Office guidelines in place since 1985. And regulating this practice is really just a precaution, they argue, since few complaints have been made against the police under the current system, and none upheld. <font size=-1>MI</font>5<t--mode> </t--mode> has similar powers, and nobody makes a fuss about that. To insist that the police get a warrant from a judge first would simply introduce an unnecessary complication into the procedure; anyway, there is always a trade-off between preserving freedoms and reducing crime.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the sceptical law lords put the opposite interpretation on the same facts. Just because bugging has gone on for a decade without any legal sanction, that is not a good reason to make it legal now. To them, 1,300 seems an alarmingly large figure, while the scarcity of complaints simply indicates how few people even realise they are being listened to. <font size=-1>MI</font>5 has to get permission from the home secretary to place a bug, whereas police officers will only need to go to their chief constable.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And on top of that inconsistency, an open police search of private property will still require a warrant, but a secret one now will not. As for the argument that applying to a judge would be too complicated, the law lords point out that the police manage to go to judges for certain warrants at the moment, and there is no reason why this should not be extended. Behind all this lies the value the objectors place on privacy, liberty and due process of law. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite these objections, the bill looks set to sail through Parliament, since both the government and opposition support it, and there is not enough cross-bench enthusiasm to scupper it in the Lords. But the issue may come back in a more embarrassing form. Liberty, a civil liberties advocacy group, believes the bill violates provisions on privacy and the right to judicial redress in the European Convention on Human Rights. So Labour, if it forms the next government, might find itself having supported a measure which violates a set of rules it has promised to incorporate into British law.<br>

<p><b>Privatisation</b></p>
<h1>Her Majesty's Shambles</h1>

THE National Audit Office, the watchdog of the nation's accounts, is about to announce that it will conduct an inquiry into the sale of Her Majesty's Stationery Office (<font size=-1>HMSO</font>), the government's 200-year-old publisher. Charges that its privatisation was a political fix are now being tossed around the City and Westminster.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These suspicions are fuelled by the eventual sale price--&#163;54m, which was at least &#163;10m lower than other final offers, and a third of the original forecast. Labour's civil-service spokesman, Derek Foster, describes the sale as "a sweetheart deal for their [the Tory government's] friends". Some disappointed bidders agree. The head of one of the consortia claims that he offered and is still prepared to pay more than double what the company was eventually sold for. "None of us felt this sale was evenly handled," he says.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The winning bid was put together by Electra, an investment trust, and Robert Fleming, an investment bank, and chaired by a former editor of <i>The Economist</i>, Rupert Pennant-Rea. It was not short of political friends. Lord King, a former cabinet minister, is on Electra's board. The investment company's deputy chairman, Lord Vinson, is a founding director of the Centre for Policy Studies, a Thatcherite think-tank. Robert Fleming employs a former Tory chief whip, Tim Renton, as a parliamentary consultant. The two companies have together donated nearly &#163;600,000 to the Conservatives in recent years.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But proof of a political fix requires more than friends in high places. The evidence suggests not so much a conspiracy as an expensive cock-up.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the government put the company up for sale a year ago at the insistence of the deputy prime minister, Michael Heseltine, the prospectus boasted that <font size=-1>HMSO</font> was "a modern business with a prestigious history" with sales in excess of &#163;375m, employing 2,900 staff in a network of offices, warehouses, print factories and bookshops. There were 14 indicative bids ranging up to &#163;175m. Four consortia were eventually shortlisted led by Mercury Asset Management, Hambros, Electra Fleming and NatWest Ventures.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then things started to go wrong. A six-week round of site visits by the short-listed bidders revealed over-staffed offices and impenetrable accounts. The company had been divided into 14 separate business units, but its accounting systems had not kept pace. A &#163;19m hole was discovered in intra-company trading accounts. Despite the efforts of several teams of accountants, nobody could find the money. One of the bidders described the company's finances as "a bloody dog's dinner".<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The disclosure in April that <font size=-1>HMSO</font> had lost &#163;3m on a contract with Uzbekistan because it had shipped goods without securing a letter of credit provided an early warning of problems. But the bidders were astonished at the scale of the chaos. A warehouse in Manchester was stuffed with 100m tax forms printed without changes that the Inland Revenue required. Personal computers were being stockpiled because too many had been ordered. Four properties turned up which were not even on the books. "The business was as badly run as any I have ever seen," said one of the bidders.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not surprisingly, the final offers were lower than the original ones. The eventual winner, Electra Fleming, is understood to have bid around &#163;70m, about &#163;5m-8m more than the consortia led by Mercury Asset Management and NatWest Ventures. But after Electra was declared the preferred bidder, a further round of negotiations led to another 20% being shaved off the price before a deal was finally struck on September 10th. This last-minute haggling has given rise to grumbles of preferential treatment. But given the state of <font size=-1>HMSO</font>'s accounts, it is likely that all of the bidders would have sought to renegotiate. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A more serious charge is that the company should not have been sold in such an unsatisfactory condition. The minister handling the sale, Roger Freeman, defends the timing, pointing out that the company's financial position was deteriorating. <font size=-1>HMSO</font>, he says, urgently needed a massive change which only privatisation could provide. But the government could undoubtedly have got a lot more money if it had not allowed <font size=-1>HMSO</font> to get into such a shambles in the first place.<br>

<h1>Copywrongs</h1>

LIKE Chicken Little waiting for the sky to fall on his head, Internet enthusiasts wander around waiting for the death of the Net. The latest threat comes from the World Intellectual Property Organisation, which is in the middle of a three-week conference to replace the outdated Berne Convention on copyright. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Three new treaties are being proposed--two about copyright of music and artistic works (which covers computer software) and one about databases. The supposed danger: the proposed changes will throttle the flow of information on the Internet, end the notion of "fair use" for educational and personal copies, and make companies that provide access to the Internet liable for copyright infringements.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So will the 156 delegates really have choked the Internet by the time they adjourn on December 20th? The answer is no. But the scaremongers include groups as diverse as the American Association for the Advancement of Science and some of America's biggest telephone companies. Most of them are frightened by the idea that temporary copies of documents--created ten-a-penny automatically during Web browsing--should, under the letter of the treaties, be treated as infringements of copyright. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Computer companies have a particular complaint. They are aghast at another article under negotiation, which proposes banning devices that might circumvent copyright-protection systems. As this could conceivably cover a typical multimedia <font size=-1>PC</font> with sufficient brainpower to manipulate sound and video information, it has enraged <font size=-1>IBM</font>, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A total ban on temporary copying is unlikely to survive in the treaty. "No one wants to stop use of the Internet," says Bruce Lehman, the assistant secretary of commerce who heads the American delegation. Some of the criticisms have been addressed: Norway and Israel have suggested amendments tackling temporary copies which (in their roundabout legalese) exclude the sort of incidental copying that occurs during Web browsing. But the central question remains unresolved: how to ensure that copyright is protected as more information travels upon computer networks without unnecessarily draconian measures?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The solution to that is unlikely to come out of Geneva. What may well emerge is a sensible framework around which future protection and exemptions to copyright can be created. The sky may, after all, stay up for a while longer.<br>

<p><b>Technopolist IBM</b></p>
<h1>Humbled, not hobbled</h1>

<p><b>The days when IBM ruled the computer world are gone, but it still dominates its rich traditional markets. So what happened to the complaints?</b></p><br>
IT WAS not long ago that the name of <font size=-1>IBM</font> was practically synonymous with the word "monopoly". The computer giant's dominance of the mainframe market it created made it one of America's most successful companies. By the early 1980s, pressure from trustbusters had forced it to split off its services arm to stop complaints that it was abusing its dominance. Yet, even as the lawyers were signing the final documents, <font size=-1>IBM</font> was losing its grip: it was being overtaken in the computing marketplace at large by the companies that grew up around the personal computer, a technology launched by <font size=-1>IBM</font> but no longer under its sway.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Today, the <font size=-1>PC</font> market is the empire of Microsoft and Intel. But the world mainframe market is still worth a tidy $8 billion a year, and is even growing again. There, <font size=-1>IBM</font> is still as dominant as ever. Despite decades of competition from two Japanese firms, Hitachi and Fujitsu, <font size=-1>IBM</font> has never had less than 70% of the world mainframe market. This year its share will be around 83%, according to Annex Research, a consultancy in Phoenix, Arizona. Its clout has more to do with the nature of the business than with any great technological superiority. Unlike <font size=-1>PC</font>s, mainframes cost millions of dollars each; so decisions, once taken, cost a fortune to reverse. Suppliers and customers therefore tend to mate for life. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dominant though <font size=-1>IBM</font> is in mainframe hardware, it is even more so in software. Indeed, were <font size=-1>IBM</font>'s software division a stand-alone company, it would be by far the biggest software firm in the world. Its mainframe software business is 50% larger than its hardware business, and had revenues of $9.6 billion in 1995 (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>). Overall, <font size=-1>IBM</font>'s software sales (including software for minicomputers and <font size=-1>PC</font>s) were worth $12.7 billion last year, almost 50% more than Microsoft's total (see <a href="wb2.gif">table</a>). <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although <font size=-1>IBM</font> is the market leader in most of the software markets it is in, from transaction processing to "groupware" (thanks to its purchase of Lotus and its "Notes" software), it has plenty of competition from other software firms such as Oracle (in databases) and Computer Associates (in system-management software). The one exception is the operating systems that run the machines. Here <font size=-1>IBM</font> has an almost total monopoly--more absolute, indeed, than Microsoft's monopoly on the <font size=-1>PC</font>. <font size=-1>IBM</font>'s <font size=-1>OS/390</font> operating system has almost all the market for <font size=-1>IBM</font>-compatible mainframes outside Japan, where Hitachi and Fujitsu sell their own operating systems.<br>
</p><p><b><b>True Blue</b></b><br>
The Microsoft comparison is apt in some ways. <font size=-1>IBM</font>'s <font size=-1>OS/390</font> business brings in $2 billion a year in annual sales--about the same as Microsoft brings in annually from its Windows family of operating systems for <font size=-1>PC</font>s. Yet there is one big difference between the two: for most of this decade Microsoft has endured almost constant antitrust investigations. <font size=-1>IBM</font>, on the other hand, has had little trouble from the trustbusters this decade: indeed, the 1983 restrictions quietly expired earlier this year. Nobody now seems to worry much about <font size=-1>IBM</font> the monopolist. Why not?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The simple answer is that the mainframe and <font size=-1>PC</font> markets are different. Microsoft's critics have accused it of modifying its Windows operating system to make its own application software look better, thus using its dominance in one market to grab another. True or not, the same accusation is rarely levelled at <font size=-1>IBM</font>. That is because <font size=-1>IBM</font> still sees itself primarily in the business of selling hardware. If it tinkered with its operating system to make it work less well with other firms' programs, its customers might simply stop buying <font size=-1>IBM</font> machines.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, <font size=-1>IBM</font> now has more competition than its market share reveals. This competition is not within the mainframe market, but outside it, in the increasing range of other machines that can do much of what a mainframe does. In the early 1980s, most big companies had little real choice. The <font size=-1>PC</font> was at best an unknown quantity, at worst an underpowered novelty. Minicomputers could not handle enough users. Yet today, top-of-the-range <font size=-1>PC</font>s, connected in "client-server" networks, can do better than both for many jobs. (These networks can even do the jobs of supercomputers: see <a href="st4096.html">page</a>)<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Throughout the first half of the 1990s, this Lilliput-like attack by <font size=-1>PC</font>s drastically reduced demand for mainframes (today sales are at just half their 1989 peak). This drove <font size=-1>IBM</font> almost to bankruptcy. But the company responded by slashing prices and developing new mainframes that shared many of their components (such as memory) with <font size=-1>PC</font>s, thus benefiting from the <font size=-1>PC</font> industry's economies of scale. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These price cuts were felt most strongly in the operating-system market--the one area in which <font size=-1>IBM</font> had appeared to extract monopoly rents. Having first given away its operating-system software for free, <font size=-1>IBM</font> took to charging for it in the 1980s with a vengeance. Prices rose by more than 30% a year for much of the 1980s, says Annex's Bob Djurdjevic, rising 19-fold over the decade. Eventually they reached a point where the average large firm might be paying more than $20,000 a month per mainframe for a licence to use the software, which remained <font size=-1>IBM</font>'s property. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since 1990, when the mainframe market began to slide, this gouging has stopped. Prices have fallen slightly. One prompt came in 1993 when Louis Gerstner became the firm's chief executive: he ordered discounts to spur mainframe sales. But the real reason for the firm's newly competitive prices is the emergence of <font size=-1>PC</font> networks as a threat to the mainframe.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now the company is trying to turn the arrival of networked <font size=-1>PC</font>s to its advantage. The most important part of a networked system is the centralised server that holds collective data and programs. High-end <font size=-1>PC</font>s can serve several dozen users simultaneously within an office, but when companies apply the same principles to their Internet connection, they often find that they need more capacity: customers and sightseers are sure to outnumber employees. <font size=-1>IBM</font> has been quick to remind them that mainframes can accommodate hundreds or thousands of users. To make the point, it now calls its mainframes "superservers".<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But to make a pitch for that market, <font size=-1>IBM</font> has had to make its machines talk to other machines more easily. Moving to "open interfaces" such as the Internet's communications standards can give mainframes a new life, but John Thompson, <font size=-1>IBM</font>'s software chief, argues that it also carries a risk. The better a mainframe fits into the rest of the computing world, the more the distinctions between types of machines blur, and the more easily any one can be replaced with another. This competition, argues Mr Thompson, helps keeps <font size=-1>IBM</font> honest: it cannot count on customer loyalty forever.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As Mr Thompson puts it, "It's not illegal to be dominant. It's illegal to abuse your dominance." Today, <font size=-1>IBM</font> looks like a model citizen in that respect. It keeps its prices down and its standards largely open. But this kinder, gentler <font size=-1>IBM</font> is a creature of pragmatism, chastened by its brush with bankruptcy. The markets it dominates are blurring into markets where it has hardly any share at all. If <font size=-1>IBM</font> looks like a benevolent monopoly today, that may be because the company is seeing its dominant position being eroded from the outside. <br>

<p><b>Supercomputers</b></p>
<h1>Divide and conquer</h1>

<p><b>Might a network of personal computers prove to be as formidable a number- cruncher as a supercomputer?</b></p><br>
THE rapacious curve of Moore's Law (expounded by Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel) states that the density of components on a silicon chip doubles every 18 months. Thus, today's <font size=-1>PC</font>s are faster and cheaper than last year's models and will, no doubt, look clunky and over-priced compared with next year's.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even so, some computing tasks will still stump tomorrow's desktop computers. The reason is simply one of speed. Some jobs (such as forecasting the weather and modelling nuclear explosions) require astronomical numbers of calculations. Performing them on a <font size=-1>PC</font> is possible in theory--but the result would arrive several million years after the weather it was intended to forecast or the war it was meant to forestall. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the moment these sorts of chores can be carried out only by giant supercomputers. These are far quicker, but also much more expensive. For instance, America's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (which, since the moratorium on real nuclear explosions, is restricted to testing bombs in cyberspace) recently ordered a new supercomputer from <font size=-1>IBM</font> that will be able to do 3 trillion numerical calculations per second. The best desktop <font size=-1>PC</font>s can barely produce one ten-thousandth of that. But 10,000 desktop <font size=-1>PC</font>s cost less than $20m. <font size=-1>IBM</font> is charging $93m for its machine.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The ideal solution, then, would be to link lots of small <font size=-1>PC</font>s so that they can perform bigger tasks together (especially as many <font size=-1>PC</font>s are idle for much of the day). At first sight this seems a simple matter of replicating a machine that already has several brains. Many of the latest supercomputers are not the single-processor machines that Seymour Cray, the doyen of the subject, once made so famous. They are "parallel computers": linked arrays of microprocessors (or "nodes") similar to those that lie at the heart of humble desktop drudges.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, making a parallel computer out of linked <font size=-1>PC</font>s instead of nodes all linked inside the same box is tricky. To begin with, the number of nodes matters (regardless of whether they are housed in one box or spread out across a network). A calculation designed to run on a computer with, say, 64 nodes typically has to be rewritten for a computer with 128 nodes. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The difficulty lies in the software. Breaking a problem into meaningful sub-problems, allocating them to different processors, co-ordinating the processors so that the answers come out in the correct order, and then stitching the sub-answers together to arrive at a conclusion, is a programming nightmare. Programming the largest of the modern parallel supercomputers, with up to 2,048 nodes, is ghastly. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Programmers, though, are rising to the challenge. In the summer of 1995 around 200 volunteers co-ordinated by Piete Brooks, at the University of Cambridge, deciphered a message encrypted using a secret code. They employed a motley assortment of machines, including Apple Macintoshes, "Windows"-based <font size=-1>PC</font>s and Hewlett-Packard workstations, to break the code in 32 hours. A single <font size=-1>PC</font> would have taken 200 times as long to do it. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the problem solved by Dr Brooks and his crew was not that difficult. It was "loosely coupled": the crackers knew that the secret code had to be just one of 1,099,511,627,776 combinations. All they needed to do was work through each one until someone reached the answer. The more volunteers, the sooner the answer could be expected to arrive.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, dividing most problems into separate chunks is less easy: the result from one part of, say, a weather forecast affects the result in another part. This is why the programs used to solve such "tightly-coupled" problems have to know in advance how many processors are available, what they are, and how they speak to each other. And, in tightly-coupled problems, the speed (or lack of it) at which processors can communicate is a serious constraint--the networks connecting <font size=-1>PC</font>s can significantly slow down inter-processor chats.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Andrew Grimshaw reckons he is close to solving these difficulties. His system, Legion, is an attempt to build a "virtual" parallel computer across the Internet. Legion's particular strength is that it can co-ordinate several different types of computers, including old-style supercomputers, modern parallel computers, workstations and desktop <font size=-1>PC</font>s. The existing system at the University of Virginia, for instance, uses more than 100 computers from several different manufacturers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Legion also looks like a single computer to its users. A set of programs, which Dr Grimshaw calls "metasystems software", hides the quirks of its constituent machines and the network connecting them. Instead, Legion works out where and when to perform particular calculations on its network. To reduce delays in communications between processors, Legion prefers its machines to have fast network connections (some of them use a proprietary system 80 times faster than a typical university network). If, however, such connections are not available, it will simply change the order in which it processes particular requests so as to minimise delays. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr Grimshaw's approach does not produce a computer that is as well-designed for solving tightly-coupled problems as a normal parallel computer. All the same, Legion has been used successfully to solve fluid-dynamics calculations--classic examples of tightly-coupled problems--which are generally difficult for networks of workstations to manage. Biochemists at the University of Virginia have been able to enlist Legion's help to discover the structure of new proteins. And above all, unlike a real supercomputer, Legion can easily grow: each new <font size=-1>PC</font> adds a little bit more to its virtual power. Sometimes the best way to become faster is to grow slowly.<br>

<h1 align=center>Spoiling world trade</h1>


BY THE sorry standards of much of this century, world trade looks in rude health. In the 1930s,
protectionism helped poison the world economy. After the second world war, tariffs and other trade
barriers fell too slowly. However, over the past decade, many of the restrictions that stifle international
commerce have been relaxed--thanks in large part to the lengthy Uruguay round of <font
size=-1>GATT</font> talks, completed in 1993. Since 1990 world trade has grown by 6% a year,
compared with less than 4% a year in the 1980s. As if to confirm the importance that governments now
attach to the subject, there is now a World Trade Organisation (<font size=-1>WTO</font>), with 126
members, to police the new regime and to take the cause of free trade further into areas where there are
still far too many restrictions, such as agriculture, services and investment.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From this perspective, the <font size=-1>WTO</font>'s first big
ministerial meeting, which starts on December 9th in Singapore, is going to seem disappointing. Ministers
are preparing to squabble publicly over all manner of things--from the pace of trade reform to the terms on
which China should be admitted to the <font size=-1>WTO</font> (see <a href="sf0797.html">pages</a>). On
the last day there will be a bland communiqu&eacute; of some sort, which will do nothing to beat back the
protectionists that lurk in America and Western Europe. However, the greatest damage in Singapore will not
be done by what is said, but what is left almost unmentioned: the threat that "regionalism" poses to global
trade.<br> </p><p><b><b>When the feasible is the enemy of the good</b></b><br> Thanks to the recent
explosion of regional trade arrangements, whose members agree to liberalise trade among themselves, the
<font size=-1>WTO</font> is just one cook among many stirring the free-trade broth. Only a handful of the
<font size=-1>WTO</font>'s members are not already part of some other local club. The European Union has
15 members and could soon have more. Some Americans are already looking for ways to meld together the
North American Free-Trade Agreement (<font size=-1>NAFTA</font>), which was formed with Mexico and
Canada, with Mercosur, a customs union formed by four South American countries. Free-trade areas are
planned in both South-East Asia and South Asia. And the 19-strong Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation
(<font size=-1>APEC</font>) forum has a grand plan for "free trade in the Pacific" by 2020.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Put this way, it sounds like something to applaud. <i>The Economist
</i>has given qualified support to many of these agreements as and when they have appeared. What is it
about their cumulative effect that should give pause for thought?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most governments and many free traders believe that regional
free-trade areas are a step in the right direction. Their defence is usually a mixture of economic principle,
practical diplomacy and visionary politics. First, they ask, how can it be possible for countries to agree to
scrap tariffs among themselves and not make trade freer? Then they argue that it is often easier to make a
deal in a small group than in the unwieldy <font size=-1>WTO</font>. And, finally, trade agreements, they
say, are politically valuable: if countries are tied by commerce, they are less likely to start shooting at
each other.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first of these arguments, plausible as it
seems, is simply false. Regional "free-trade areas" need not make trade freer. By liberalising trade only
with their neighbours, countries are by definition discriminating against those not lucky enough to be in the
local club. Some goods will be imported from other members of the free-trade area at the expense of
producers elsewhere; and members will begin to specialise in industries in which they lack comparative
advantage.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thus, the <font size=-1>EU</font> has a bloated
farming industry while many producers in poorer countries suffer from not being able to serve its markets;
and <font size=-1>NAFTA</font> has complicated "rules of origin" requirements, stipulating how much of a
car needs to be made in Mexico to qualify as "<font size=-1>NAFTA</font>n", and so enter America
tariff-free. It is always better to liberalise without discrimination than to open up only to neighbours;
sometimes, selective opening is worse than doing nothing at all.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The argument that, despite this danger, regional trade areas
represent a speedier, more practical way to proceed than does the <font size=-1>WTO</font>, is also open
to question. True, the Uruguay round lasted more than seven years, and even now governments are
struggling to finish off some outstanding negotiations, but slow progress bedevils regional arrangements,
too. Despite much talk about expansion, the membership of <font size=-1>NAFTA</font> is stuck at three.
<font size=-1>APEC</font> is moving at a glacial pace. Similarly, although the local clubs sometimes
broach subjects long before the <font size=-1>WTO</font> (for instance, <font size=-1>NAFTA</font> has
a treaty on foreign direct investment), they can also introduce possible bugbears (<font
size=-1>NAFTA</font> also contains worrying agreements on standards for labour and environmental
protection).<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, the standard against which each
regional trade pact needs to be measured has, mercifully, been raised. Back in the 1950s, the idea of a
customs union in Europe (even if it was linked to an idea as awful as the common agricultural policy) was
attractive because the alternative (no customs union at all) was plainly worse. Now, the emergence of the
<font size=-1>WTO</font> has raised the hurdle: the architects of regional agreements know they will have
to defend their plans against the charge of setting back liberal trade, and adjust their plans accordingly.
That is fine, but it raises a question: would it not be simpler, after all, to make these deals at the <font
size=-1>WTO</font>? <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That leaves the last "political"
argument--that bodies such as <font size=-1>APEC</font> and Mercosur have brought old enemies
together. So they have. Again, however, would this be any less true of broader multilateral agreements?
And there are limits to how far the goal of international amity, worthy as it is, should be used to justify
economic lunacy. Invoking France's post-war friendship with Germany seems an odd way to defend the <font
size=-1>EU</font>'s limits on imports of Argentine chocolate.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If governments paid more attention to the threat of regionalism,
that would be an excellent start. One excuse for their not doing so is that the <font size=-1>WTO</font>'s
own system for policing regional trade agreements is a mess. At present, each new free-trade area or
customs union is appraised by a committee, open to all members and with extremely vague terms of
reference. Unsurprisingly, only six of the 70-odd committees formed since <font size=-1>GATT</font>
began have ever reached a firm conclusion. It would be much better if agreements were examined by a
smaller team of independent scrutineers with a precise mandate to assess the effect on world trade--and,
in particular, the way that the new agreement treats outsiders.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It can be hard to say whether any free-trade area is so restrictive
that its costs outweigh its benefits--though Mercosur, by some calculations, fails the test, and the case for
the new <font size=-1>ASEAN</font> agreement also looks weak. Most agreements are a mixture of good
and bad. The long-term challenge for the ministers about to meet in Singapore is thus twofold: to change the
worst details in their own regional deals; and, even more important, to press ahead with multilateral trade
liberalisation in the <font size=-1>WTO</font>. Governments now have a chance to make this new
institution the strong catalyst for liberal trade which they have long said they wanted. They should seize
the opportunity.<br>

<h2>Serbia represses</h2>
Crowds remained on the streets in Serbia after the government closed down the country's last two independent radio stations. They had been broadcasting reports on 16 days of widespread protest against the annulment of municipal elections won by opposition parties.<p>
A <b>bomb</b> on a Paris commuter train killed two people and injured more than 160, many seriously. Suspicion fell on extreme Islamists from Algeria.<p>
<b>Greek farmers</b> demanding cheaper fuel and better price supports blockaded roads and railways. A crippling 12-day strike by French <b>lorry drivers</b> ended after concessions by their employers and the government.<p>
Russia's defence minister, <b>Igor Rodionov</b>, tried to sack the army's commander, Vladimir Semyonov. President Yeltsin approved the dismissal order, which accused the general of dishonourable conduct, but then withheld<p>
a presidential decree needed to put the order into effect. The general denied the accusation.<p>
<b>Russian miners</b> declared a national strike to protest at non-payment of wages. Unions said 80% of the 400,000 miners had joined the strike.<p>
Petru Lucinschi was elected <b>Moldova's president</b>, defeating the incumbent, Mircea Snagur. He had campaigned on a platform of closer ties with Russia.<p>
European Union finance ministers could not agree on a <b>stability pact</b> to curb budget deficits after the start of economic and monetary union. Although they neared agreement on the size of fines to be imposed on countries with excessive deficits, most resisted German demands that exceptions be made only for countries whose economies shrink by 2% in a year.<p>
Swiss voters rejected a liberalisation of the country's <b>labour laws </b>in a referendum. In another vote they narrowly rejected proposals to make it more difficult for asylum-seekers to enter the country.<p>
<h2>Vetoes and votes</h2>
The Organisation of African Unity, accepting America's veto, dropped its exclusive support for the reappointment of <b>Boutros Boutros- Ghali</b> as <font size=-1>UN</font> secretary-general. Mr Boutros-Ghali himself "suspended" his candidacy. On the understanding that it is still Africa's "turn", other African candidates were encouraged to come forward. The president of the <font size=-1>UN</font> General Assembly has set December 17th as the deadline for a decision. <p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
Some 85% of Algerian voters, said the country's rulers, approved changes to their constitution that banned<b> Islamist parties</b> and extended the president's powers. The regime's claim of a 79% turnout was considered implausible.<p>
Tutsi rebels in eastern <b>Zaire</b> pushed deeper into the country. They claimed to have seized Kisangani (formerly known as Stanleyville), an important town controlling the Zaire river. Hutu-Tutsi clashes increased in <b>Burundi</b>.<p>
<b>South Africa</b>'s Constitutional Court approved the final changes to the constitution.<p>
In <b>Sierra Leone</b>, government and rebels signed an agreement to end five years of savagery.<p>
<b>Israel's attorney-general</b>, Michael Ben-Yair, resigned. He had earlier questioned the use by police of physical force during interrogations of Palestinian suspects. The <b>Palestinian police</b> were accused in a report by Amnesty International of brutality to their own people.<p>
<h2>New faces</h2>
Madeleine Albright, America's ambassador to the United Nations, was set to be named as the next <b>secretary of state</b>, according to reports in Washington. The other members of Bill Clinton's new foreign-policy team were said to be William Cohen (a former senator from Maine) as secretary of defence, Tony Lake (at present national security adviser) as head of the <font size=-1>CIA</font>, and Sandy Berger as head of the National Security Council, where he is now number two.<p>
Hawaii became the first state in America to recognise <b>homosexual marriages </b>when a state judge found that its government had failed to establish "a compelling state interest" to justify its prohibition of same-sex marriages.<p>
In <b>Ecuador</b>, President Abdala Bucaram, elected as a populist, announced a plan of sober economic reform: fiscal balance, privatisation, easier labour laws, even a local version of Argentina's monetary straitjacket. <p>
<h2>Troops out</h2>
The United States agreed to close some of its <b>military bases in Okinawa </b>and return the land to the local people. A new base for American helicopters will be built on an artificial island to be constructed offshore.<p>
About 1,000 students took part in a protest in Yangon, the capital of <b>Myanmar</b>, demanding an independent union and other rights. It was the biggest demonstration of its type for eight years.<p>

an independent commission said it could not approve an offer from the Lagard&egrave;re Groupe because of
its plans to sell one part of the conglomerate, Thomson Multimedia, to Daewoo Electronics. With thousands
of workers at Thomson Multimedia in revolt at the prospect of a South Korean owner, and other labour
disputes flaring, the French government gave in.<p> Another South Korean firm, <b>Samsung
Electronics</b>, had better luck. In March the world's biggest supplier of personal-computer screens will
supply the first of 5m monitors to <b>IBM</b>, the American computer giant, in a three-year deal worth
$2 billion.<p> Two of America's biggest airlines, <b>Delta</b> and <b>Continental</b>, are discussing a
merger that would create America's biggest carrier--and probably prompt other takeovers in their
industry. If the deal goes ahead, one beneficiary could be Air France which has marketing alliances with
both carriers.<p> America's <b>Dow Corning</b>, a breast-implants maker which went bankrupt in 1995 to
limit its exposure to lawsuits claiming the implants were unsafe, produced a new settlement plan. A $600m
fund would be set up for women who settle out of court; a further $1.4 billion would be contingent on proof
that the implants are hazardous; and $1 billion would go to banks and other creditors.<p> Argentina's
growing supermarket sector attracted another outside investor. Exxel, a global investment fund, bought
<b>Supermercados Norte</b>, Argentina's second-largest supermarket chain by sales (of $1.2 billion), for
$440m and said it planned a public share offering.<p> <h2>Drink up</h2> <b>Bass</b>, a British
beer'n'leisure group, is to spend &#163;670m ($1.1 billion) creating 7,000 new jobs next year, much of it
in its pubs and restaurants, after declaring pre-tax profits up 12% to &#163;671m for 1996, a year in
which it spent another &#163;568m creating 6,000 jobs.<p> The Antique Wine Company in London sold 127
bottles of <b>Chateau d'Yquem</b>, a French dessert wine, which included every vintage produced from
1855 to 1990, to a Las Vegas hotel and casino for $1m.<p> Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a Saudi Arabian
investor whose eclectic portfolio includes both Canary Wharf, London's biggest property development, and
Euro Disney, a French theme park, announced he was buying the <b>George V</b> hotel in Paris. He is
paying Granada, a British leisure group, $172m for what he describes as "the best hotel in the world".<p>
Six officials at Japan's <b>Ministry of Trade and Industry</b> were reprimanded for failing to supervise
staff properly and accepting excessive favours from an oil broker.<p> </td><td

<b>General Motors </b>in sacking Jose Ignacio Lopez turned into more of a two-fingered salute when it
replaced him with another <font size=-1>GM</font> defector, Javier Garcia Sanz, and said that Mr Lopez
would remain as a consultant. <font size=-1>VW</font>'s share price dropped 5.7% on concerns that the
two car makers, at war since the defection of eight <font size=-1>GM</font> executives to <font
size=-1>VW</font> in 1993, would fail to reach an out-of-court settlement.<p> In what could be the first
step towards a broader alliance, on-off talks between America's two aerospace giants brought an
agreement to collaborate on a super-jumbo. Hundreds of underworked engineers from <b>McDonnell
Douglas</b>, which recently abandoned its own plans for such an aircraft, will move from Long Beach to
Seattle to help <b>Boeing</b>, snowed under with orders, develop two new versions of the Boeing 747.<p>
<b>Aeroflot</b>, Russia's state-controlled international airline, said it would buy 20 Russian-made
Ilyushin-96 long-range aircraft equipped with American jet-engines and avionics, in a deal worth $1.5
billion. The move appeased Russia's aircraft makers, which reacted angrily to Aeroflot's purchase of ten
Boeing 737 mid-range aircraft earlier this year. <p> Bowing to government pressure, <b>Avtovaz</b>,
Russia's biggest car maker, said it would double its share capital and offer the new shares to one or more
outside investors. Any proceeds would help the stricken firm meet its so-far-unpaid $500m tax bill.<p>
<b>Eurotunnel</b> won permission from health-and-safety officials to restore most passenger and car
services through the Channel tunnel. But a decision on resuming freight shuttles--one of which was the
source of a large fire which raged in the tunnel last month--will not be made until official inquiries are
completed.<p> <h2>Top dollar</h2> (See <a href="bw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>The ebullient Dow Jones went
into reverse; the index fell 79 points on December 3rd. Most European <b>bourses </b> carried on rising
buoyed by a strong dollar. The dollar's strength, plus the British government's talk-down of the pound, put
the damper on sterling's extended rally.<p> Three former executives at <b>Archer Daniels Midland</b>
were indicted by a Chicago grand jury for conspiring to fix prices in the $600m market for lysine, an
animal-feed additive. Also indicted was an executive at Ajinomoto of Japan, one of <font
size=-1>ADM</font>'s leading competitors. A South Korean company, Cheil Jedang, agreed to plead guilty
to fixing prices and to pay a $1.25m fine.<p> <b>Alan Bond</b>, currently serving a three-year sentence
for fraud relating to an Impressionist painting, pleaded guilty in an Australian court to two charges of
dishonesty relating to a A$1 billion ($800m) corporate fraud, Australia's biggest ever.<p>

<h1>All free traders now?</h1>

<p><b>In Singapore on December 9th, the two-year-old World Trade Organisation begins its first summit
meeting. Although governments profess to be committed free traders, their actions still fall short of their
words</b></p><br> "FREE trade", wrote Richard Cobden in 1857, "is God's diplomacy, and there is no
other certain way of uniting people in the bonds of peace." Few politicians since Cobden have thought of
themselves as missionaries for free trade. Yet now, an odd thing is happening: most of the world's
governments claim to be exactly that. In Singapore from December 9th to 13th, trade ministers will attend
the first ministerial conference of the World Trade Organisation (<font size=-1>WTO</font>)--and will
surely take every opportunity to parade their free-trade credentials. How justified are their claims?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the credit side, in the past few years there have been four main
achievements for free traders to cheer. First, the Uruguay round of the the <font size=-1>WTO</font>'s
predecessor, the <font size=-1>GATT</font>, went further than any previous global trade deal. Apart from
promising to cut tariffs on manufactures-- which are now down to an average of just 3.8% in rich
countries--governments agreed for the first time to some liberalisation of trade in agriculture and
services. They also forged new agreements to get rid of some non-tariff barriers to trade, such as the
spurious use of technical and health regulations to keep out imports. The round, which finished in 1993, also
established the <font size=-1>WTO</font> itself, and set up a new mechanism for settling trade
disputes.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This mechanism is the second recent cause for
celebration. Under the <font size=-1>GATT</font>, any member could veto the verdict of a panel set up to
rule on a quarrel--even if it was a party to the dispute. <font size=-1>WTO</font> panels are stricter.
They must report within nine months and their decisions can be overturned only by consensus. Countries
found to have broken <font size=-1>WTO</font> rules must either mend their ways or offer compensation;
if they do not, they may face trade sanctions. So far, the mechanism has worked well. More than 60 cases
have been brought. About a quarter have been completed. Ten of these disputes were settled without going
before a panel.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The third encouraging sign is that more and
more countries are joining the world trade club. During the Uruguay round, many developing countries
realised that freer trade was not a confidence trick by rich countries, but would actually help their own
economies. The membership of the <font size=-1>GATT</font> rose from 92 in 1986, when the round
began, to 114 when negotiations ended (see <a href="sf1.gif">chart</a>). The
<font size=-1>WTO</font> now boasts 126 members; another 30 countries, including China and Russia,
want to join.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fourth, trade has been booming. The <font
size=-1>WTO</font> estimates that world trade in goods grew by 8% in volume terms last year, four
times the growth of world <font size=-1>GDP</font>. In fact, during the 1990s international trade has
grown far faster than world output, showing that national economies are becoming ever more closely linked
(<a href="sf2.gif">chart</a>). Foreign direct investment, another gauge of international economic integration, is
also soaring: last year, estimates the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, cross-border
investment flows rose by 40%, to $315 billion.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Against such
a background, it may seem churlish to doubt governments' professions of free-trade faith. Unfortunately,
there are good reasons for such doubt. Since the completion of the Uruguay round, governments have
frequently acted much as they did under the old <font size=-1>GATT</font>: as downright protectionists on
some occasions and as mercantilists almost as a matter of course. That is to say, the main purpose of their
trade diplomacy has not been to open up their own markets to imports but to prise open other people's
markets for exports. The opening of home markets is usually seen as a concession to others, not (as
economic logic dictates) as a good thing in itself because it benefits local consumers and makes both national
and global economies work more efficiently.<br> </p><p><b><b>The sin bin</b></b><br> The clearest
example of the mercantilist tendency is the conduct of the so-called "unfinished business" of the Uruguay
round. When the round ended, agreement had not been reached on the following areas of service trade:
financial services, shipping, "movement of natural persons" (trade-speak for letting in foreigners to supply
services on a temporary basis) and telecommunications.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In
financial services the Americans, displeased by the slow pace of liberalisation promised by some Asian
countries, walked away from an agreement just before a deadline in June 1995 (though several other
negotiators, including the European Union, have kept their offers open and talks are due to restart next
April). In shipping, America's highly protected and unionised maritime industry virtually sank the talks
before they left port. The issue of letting in foreigners temporarily has become entangled by political
reservations about immigration as a whole. Few governments anywhere are keen to welcome foreign
workers. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Only with the telecoms deal is there any sign of
hope. After an earlier negotiation collapsed in April (with Europeans and Asians slow to commit themselves
to liberalisation and with America demanding better access to satellite-communications markets in
developing countries) a recent round of talks has found several groups, including the Americans and
Europeans, making more liberal offers. Negotiators reckon a deal can be reached by the new deadline of next
February.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Telecoms, though, is an exception. For the most
part, the grudging way in which some governments are keeping the promises they made during the Uruguay
round smacks of bad faith. In textiles and clothing, for example, trade has been governed for over 30 years
by a system of bilateral quotas. These quotas are supposed to be scrapped eventually and textile trade
gradually brought into line with <font size=-1>WTO</font> disciplines; meanwhile, the size of quotas is
being increased. But the process, which began in 1995, has been slow. Importing countries, which tend to be
rich, are allowed to keep quotas covering almost half their trade until 2005. Moreover, they have started
to bring under the <font size=-1>WTO</font> system only those products which are not subject to
quotas--thus delaying the effect of the deal. Not surprisingly, exporters, most of them developing
countries, are up in arms. Doing the bare minimum does not seem to be the behaviour of committed free
traders.<br> </p><p><b><b>Gauges of good faith</b></b><br> The problems left over from the past,
however, are modest compared with those which are to come. In the next few years the free-trading
commitment of the <font size=-1>WTO</font>'s members will be tested by four daunting challenges, some
familiar, others new. Each will give governments the opportunity either to make trade freer, or to hobble
it<b>.</b><br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first challenge is to continue <b>liberalising
trade in goods and services.</b> The <font size=-1>WTO</font> is already committed to some negotiations
as part of its "built-in agenda"--ie, matters begun during the Uruguay round. Negotiations on further
liberalisation of agricultural trade are due to begin in 1999 and a fresh round of talks on services is due to
start in 2000. Although both these talks are some years away, if history is any guide it is already a fair
bet that they will be difficult. Agriculture provided one of the trickiest problems of the Uruguay-round
talks-- indeed, the round nearly foundered on it. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There may
be progress, though, in an area of business that was not in those talks. American trade negotiators have
been pushing hard for an "information-technology agreement" to reduce tariffs on computers,
semiconductors, software and so forth. During last month's summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Co-operation forum (<font size=-1>APEC</font>) in Manila, the Americans won the backing of other <font
size=-1>APEC</font> countries for a <font size=-1>WTO</font> negotiation of the issue.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Americans have a chance of getting their way, but the hurdles
remain high. The highest, say American negotiators, is disagreement with the <font size=-1>EU</font> both
over how quickly the Europeans should reduce their tariffs and over the range of products any deal should
cover. In addition, some Asian countries are hesitant; in Manila, the endorsement of some <font
size=-1>APEC</font> members was lukewarm. So information-technology talks should provide a start for
the <font size=-1>WTO</font> in tackling its expanding agenda. But it is likely to be a slow one.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>WTO</font>'s second big challenge concerns
<b>China</b>: on what terms should it be brought into the trading organisation? China is the world's
eleventh-biggest exporter; without it, the <font size=-1>WTO</font> cannot claim to represent world
trade. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Incorporating China presents both technical and
political problems. On the technical side, the difficulty is to bring a vast, semi-planned, semi-market
economy into line with the <font size=-1>WTO</font>'s more-or-less free-market principles. China has
been freeing up its trade regime for the past decade, cutting tariffs and allowing foreign companies to
invest through joint ventures with Chinese firms. But it still maintains a <font
size=-1>WTO</font>-infringing array of controls, including export taxes, import quotas, trade licenses and
import inspections. The Chinese are also determined to maintain a protective shroud around some
"strategic" industries, such as cars.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font
size=-1>WTO</font> members want China's government to set out a clear, and fairly short, timetable for
the removal of all this. They also want an end to the county's habit of altering its trade regime arbitrarily.
On this last point, China has at least promised to stop making matters worse. On November 1st, its trade
minister, Long Yongtu, promised to impose no further trade restrictions inconsistent with <font
size=-1>WTO</font> rules.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The politics of admitting China is,
if anything, trickier, especially in the United States. Chinese exports to America are subject to the same
tariffs as most <font size=-1>WTO</font> members, but this privilege has to be renewed annually. Strictly
speaking, renewal depends on China's meeting a relatively-narrow criterion of not restricting emigration. 
Politically, however, the annual renewal depends on China's broad human-rights record. The Chinese regime
seems unlikely to alter that fundamentally, so the chances of <font size=-1>WTO</font> admission actually
depend on both sides agreeing not to make a fuss about what is going on. Not making a fuss has recently got
harder because China's trade surplus with America has climbed to become as big as Japan's. The result is
that protectionists are finding common cause with human-rights activists in America to oppose the
extension of <font size=-1>WTO</font> privileges to China. As an example of the potential for trade
conflict, the Chinese and Americans are already in a fight over textiles. America cut the import quota for
Chinese goods in September, claiming China had been sending extra clothes through third countries. The
Chinese are threatening to retaliate.<br> </p><p><b><b>Slippery ground</b></b><br> The third challenge
facing the <font size=-1>WTO</font> is whether, or how, to extend its remit into the so-called <b>"new
issues"</b> of trade policy: foreign investment, competition policy and labour standards. (These issues are
not in fact new: they have been discussed since before the birth of the <font size=-1>GATT</font> in
1948.)<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;None of the issues can be resolved quickly. They
arouse deep disagreement-- and it is easy to see why. Consider rules on foreign investment first. These
would take the world's trading body directly into tricky areas of national policy. It may be understandable if
an international agreement prevents one country from slapping a big tariff on the goods exported by
another. But it is less immediately apparent why one country should not offer some of its own taxpayers'
money to a company from another in order to persuade it to build a spanking new factory in the first. Nor is
it obvious why the host country should not, say, require foreign investors to employ a certain number of
local managers. What's wrong with that?<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The answer is that
such shackles and sweeteners act like tariffs or export subsidies, distorting the pattern of trade which
would have prevailed had the measures not been in place. In theory, firms can sell in foreign markets either
by sending their wares abroad, or by setting up a factory in a foreign land and serving the locals directly.
In some industries, the second of these methods is far cheaper than the first. This is especially so of many
services, such as banking, insurance and retailing. But it is increasingly common in manufacturing, too. A
car, for instance, might contain an engine made in one country and axles from another, but be assembled in
a third. According to one estimate, transactions within firms now account for about one-third of world
trade.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet despite close links between investment and trade,
the <font size=-1>WTO</font> currently has little to say on the subject. Such rules as exist are patchy.
Governments may not, for instance, limit foreign-owned factories' imports to the value of their exports or
insist that foreign investors use local inputs. <font size=-1>WTO</font> copyright rules are supposed to
protect foreign investors' intellectual property. But countries can and do protect local banks or
stockbrokers, for example, by refusing to issue licences to foreigners. They can limit foreigners' stakes in
broadcasting firms or airlines. Governments may also insist that foreign investors produce goods for
export as well as for the domestic market.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So it is not
surprising that some people, led by the Europeans and Canadians, want to beef up the rules. America is
prepared to support them, though it wants an agreement among <font size=-1>OECD</font> countries first.
Some Latin American countries are also in favour, as is the <font size=-1>WTO</font>'s secretariat, its
civil service (this body, which usually stays neutral on such matters, issued a report in October backing
the idea of a <font size=-1>WTO</font> investment accord).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Equally unsurprisingly, many developing countries, led by India,
Malaysia and Tanzania, are viscerally opposed. They say they are eager for foreign investment but want to
keep the right to set the terms of entry for foreigners. They feel under no particular pressure to sign up.
Even without a <font size=-1>WTO</font> agreement, they are not short of investment: developing
countries attracted $100 billion-worth last year (see <a href="sf3.gif">chart</a>). China alone received $38 billion. So a deal hardly looks imminent.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Prospects for an agreement covering competition policy look no
rosier. This, too, is an apparently domestic economic matter with trade implications. The <font
size=-1>WTO</font> is not out to ban all monopolies or create a universal competition policy. But some of
its members do want to apply trade principles to the regulation of monopolies and mergers: those principles
suggest monopoly policy should not discriminate against foreigners. Others think the <font
size=-1>WTO</font> should have a role because firms could run international monopolies or cartels, yet be
out of the reach of national competition watchdogs.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But, as
these differing ideas suggest, countries cannot yet agree even what facet of competition policy to discuss.
The <font size=-1>EU</font> would like to start work on a common set of principles for national
competition policies (it is always keen on harmonisation). America thinks this would be largely pointless; it
reckons co-operation between national antitrust authorities will do for now.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The argument for the third new issue, bringing labour standards
into the <font size=-1>WTO</font>, is even weaker. The United States is keen that it should be discussed.
Ultimately, it would like the <font size=-1>WTO</font> to enshrine five "core" labour standards in its
rules. These include a ban on "exploitative" child labour and a guarantee of trade-union freedom.
(Incidentally, world labour standards already exist, drawn up by the International Labour Organisation:
America has ratified only one of the five in question.)<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not
surprisingly, developing countries want none of this. They fear that, if they promised to abolish child labour
and then failed to keep their word, they would be vulnerable to retaliation under the <font
size=-1>WTO</font>'s dispute-settlement mechanism.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So for
the time being, the United States is unlikely to get its way. That may be just as well, for the intellectual
case for a labour-standards agreement is weak. If forced to improve labour standards, developing countries
would increase their costs and they would export less. That would make them poorer still, and would surely
make labour standards even worse. Not by accident, however, it would help protect some firms and
workers in rich countries.<br> </p><p><b><b>The biggest test of all</b></b><br> The fourth big issue is the
spread of <b>regional trading agreements</b>. Almost every member of the <font size=-1>WTO</font> is
also a member of such a group, whose numbers are proliferating. The <font size=-1>WTO</font> lists no
fewer than 76 free-trade areas or customs unions set up or modified since 1948. Of these, more than half
have come in the 1990s (see <a href="sf4.gif">chart</a>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Evidence of zeal for freer trade? It would seem so, especially
since regional deals sometimes cover aspects of trade that the <font size=-1>WTO</font> does not, such as
investment and competition policy. For instance, the North American Free-Trade Agreement (<font
size=-1>NAFTA</font>) has an investment code; <font size=-1>APEC</font> has some "non-binding
principles". The <font size=-1>EU</font> and an agreement between Australia and New Zealand contain
common regional competition policies.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The truth, however, is
more mixed. Yes, scrapping trade barriers within a region can encourage trade and investment among
countries within the club. But it can also divert trade and investment away from other countries. Japanese
car plants have been attracted to Britain, for example, by the thought that they can bypass the <font
size=-1>EU</font>'s restrictions on imports of Japanese cars. And while investment in Mexico has no doubt
been boosted by the thought of tariff-free entry to the United States, some of this will have been at the
expense of countries outside <font size=-1>NAFTA</font>.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No
less troubling is the danger that, just as regional deals can divert trade from one part of the world to
another, so the agreements can have the same sort of impact on trade diplomats' energies, diverting them
away from the more important business of continuing to liberalise world trade. There is still plenty to do:
on conventional trade, on new issues and on the admission of China. God's diplomats? One day, maybe; but
not yet.<br> <br>

<h1>Statistical guessing games</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><p>
A REPORT by economists on the shortcomings of statistics would not normally send politicians' pulses racing. But when it promises to cut billions of dollars from the budget deficit, statistical detail becomes big politics. The findings of a commission set up by the Senate Finance Committee to study the calculation of America's consumer price index (<font size=-1>CPI</font>), released this week, do just that. A group of five eminent academics led by Michael Boskin, a professor at Stanford University, has concluded that the <font size=-1>CPI</font> probably exaggerates true increases in the cost of living by something like 1.1% a year, although the exact figure could be anywhere from 0.8% to 1.6%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A correction of this magnitude would have enormous implications for the budget. Around a third of federal spending, mostly in retirement programmes, is directly indexed to changes in consumer prices. Through the indexing of individual income-tax brackets, a change in the <font size=-1>CPI</font> affects federal revenues, too. The Boskin commission reckons that correcting the 1.1% overstatement would save the government around $1 trillion over the next 12 years. By 2002, the target year for balancing the budget, around $200 billion could have been saved. Small wonder, then, that many politicians hope to prune public spending by simply improving statistics.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Among economists, the notion that inflation may be mismeasured is nothing new. Zvi Griliches and Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University and Robert Gordon of Northwestern University--all members of the commission--have spent years estimating the size and cause of the bias. Nor does the impact of mismeasurement affect the budget alone. Revising the <font size=-1>CPI</font> would substantially raise official measures of America's growth rate and hence of Americans' economic prosperity. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What are the problems? The basic difficulty is that the <font size=-1>CPI</font> is not really a measure of changes in the whole cost of living, but rather a gauge of price rises in a fixed basket of goods. This means that the <font size=-1>CPI</font> does not keep up with changes in the products consumers buy, or in how and where they buy them. According to the Boskin report, about a third of the mismeasurement (0.4%) is due to the fact that the official price index fails to capture important changes in consumer spending patterns. If the price of hardback books increases, for instance, people may buy more paperbacks. Or if bananas become more expensive, they may switch to apples. These switches do not make consumers feel worse off; but the <font size=-1>CPI</font> records a price increase.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A further 0.1% bias is due to the fact that Americans now do more shopping at discount outlets. But the biggest effect (0.6%) comes because the <font size=-1>CPI</font> underestimates the benefits shoppers gain from improvements in product quality and from the plethora of new products. Cellular telephones, for instance, are not yet included in the <font size=-1>CPI</font>, although 40m Americans now own one. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Boskin report makes a host of suggestions as to how some of these inaccuracies could be corrected. The main message is that the Bureau of Labour Statistics (<font size=-1>BLS</font>), the federal agency that works out the <font size=-1>CPI</font>, should explicitly try to build a cost-of-living measure. No one is exactly sure how big an improvement such a change would make, although the commission's boffins reckon 0.4% a year could be achieved fairly quickly. That would bring budget savings of around $80 billion by 2002. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the <font size=-1>BLS</font>, a fiercely independent if rather stodgy outfit, may not want to rush into dramatic changes. It is already trying hard to improve the numbers: a correction earlier this year shaved about 0.2% from the <font size=-1>CPI</font>. When the system's weights are next updated in January 1988, a further 0.1-0.2% may be won, although the updated index will still reflect only the buying patterns of 1993. And the <font size=-1>BLS</font> is introducing a new index, somewhat similar to the one the Boskin commission proposes, on an experimental basis early next year, although the agency's economists are quick to point out that the new index has drawbacks too. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Assume, for a moment, that the <font size=-1>BLS</font> is prodded into introducing such changes. Cost-of-living rises will still be overstated. And, although the report has some ideas about how to account better for quality improvements, they are likely to pare at most 0.2% from the <font size=-1>CPI</font> over the medium term. The problem is that the economy is changing too quickly for the statisticians to keep up. However much the statistics are improved, the <font size=-1>CPI</font> will still overstate true increases in the cost of living.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This leads to the bigger political point. If the <font size=-1>CPI</font>, however revised, is not an accurate guide to changes in the cost of living, should it be the index to which retirement benefits are linked? The Boskin report makes the point explicitly: Congress and the president, it suggests, must decide whether they wish to continue widespread, substantial over-indexing of benefits. In other words, if politicians are looking for budget savings, this report gives them intellectual backing for proposing that retirement benefits should be indexed to something less than the <font size=-1>CPI</font>. They could pass a law, for instance, that set future benefit indexation at a rate lower than the <font size=-1>CPI</font>, perhaps as part of a budget package. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Legislating for such a change in benefits, however, is politically perilous. Neither the administration nor Republicans in Congress wants to be seen as initiating a proposal that directly hurts America's swelling ranks of retired folk. And, given the uncertainties even now among the experts, the decision on how much to trim from the <font size=-1>CPI</font> will remain arbitrary.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although administration officials are now more willing to review the issue, they are unlikely to make a big proposal. Nor are the Republicans in Congress. William Roth, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, promised hearings on the <font size=-1>CPI</font> early next year. But he was quick to add that "reform will not be successful without President Clinton's leadership."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nonetheless, the idea already has momentum. The "Blue Dogs", a group of conservative Democrats, proposed reducing benefit indexation by 0.5% as part of last year's budget negotiations, as did a bipartisan group of centrist senators. They are likely to press the issue again this year. As budget negotiations develop, it is just possible that some such measure could become part of the final package.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That would be excellent news. Reducing the rate at which pensions are indexed would not only alleviate short-term budget squeezes, but would be a small step towards that Great Untouchable of American politics--Social Security reform. By boosting the politicians' boldness, Mr Boskin's report could prove enormously useful. But it has not, and will not, save them from the need to make some tough political choices. <br>

<h1>The real slick Willie</h1>

IN THE middle of November, Willie Brown apologised. It made headlines. The mayor of San Francisco had called Elvis Grbac, a quarterback in the 49ers football team, "an embarrassment to humankind" for the way he was playing, ignoring the fact that Mr Grbac had problems at home that were distracting him. San Franciscans were appalled at the mayor's disloyalty to the home team, and the mayor--hot back from a trip to Paris-- went to the practice field to say he was sorry in person. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This was uncharacteristic. Ever since he became mayor in January this year, Mr Brown has been so lionised that his occasionally brutal remarks have gone almost unnoticed. Nobody much minded when he accused California's attorney-general of "Gestapo tactics" for busting a marijuana shop on Market Street, or when he cancelled a conference on the homeless at the last minute on the ground that homeless activists were going to try to steamroller him. Certainly no apology was needed. His approval ratings in San Francisco have been consistently higher than 70%. He has been on the cover of <i>Newsweek</i>, together with Rudolph Giuliani of New York, as one of "the 25 most dynamic mayors in America"; and he has been in a fashion advertisement in <i>Esquire</i>, confidently perched on a motorbike. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why has Mr Brown been getting all this national attention and local affection? A one-word answer: style. Mr Brown has bags of it, and he knows how to put it on public display. Whereas Mr Giuliani is racked by jealousy, and Richard Daley of Chicago is about as interesting as a city budget, Mr Brown is everybody's favourite dinner companion. He dresses impeccably, in $400 shoes, starched shirts and $3,000 Armani or Brioni suits. (A local joke has it that San Franciscans think Brioni is Italian for brown.) "Da Mayor", as he likes to call himself, is an incessant socialiser, moving easily between black-tie functions on Nob Hill and block parties in the Tenderloin; he is also a regular feature of the city's night clubs and restaurants, with a table permanently reserved at the Top of the Mark. In a city that thinks of itself as the embodiment of style, all this goes down like a dream. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Brown has a raffish side to him too, which also matches San Francisco's image of itself. He was recently given the Cancer Society's Humanitarian of the Year award, despite having received more money in campaign contributions from cigarette companies than any other politician in America, including Jesse Helms. He squires a succession of beautiful women around town, despite being married with three children. On becoming mayor he complained that it was impossible to live on his salary of $140,000 a year, and the parties he throws are fabulous. For his inauguration he invited 100,000 people, sweet-talked 70 restaurants into donating food, set up soup kitchens all over the city, and hired Huey Lewis and Santana to play. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Above all, Mr Brown is an American success story. He was born into a chaotic family in a segregated town in Texas and started work as a shoe-shine boy; yet he rose to become speaker of the Assembly in the nation's most populous state and then mayor of its most beautiful city. He also has luck on his side. Just as term limits were about to end his career in the state legislature, the job of mayor of San Francisco fell vacant. When it looked as if San Francisco was having second thoughts about embracing a flashy political boss as its mayor, his chief opponent, Frank Jordan, decided to liven up his image by appearing naked in a shower with two disc-jockeys, killing his campaign dead. San Francisco's recent economic recovery has also meant that Mr Brown has been able to avoid bringing in the job cuts and tax increases that had become routine in recent years. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet luck and style are not all the city needs. San Francisco has the highest proportion of <font size=-1>HIV</font>-positive people in the country, a dismally visible homeless problem, and a chaotic transport system. Culturally, the city is an island of 1960s liberalism in an increasingly conservative country. Mr Brown seems to represent the most irresponsible side of his city: San Franciscans, having realised that their problems are intractable, have decided to have a party. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the surface, that charge may seem hard. Mr Brown has attacked the jobs-for-life system that clogs up the city's bureaucracy; he has got rid of several notoriously incompetent officials, some of them black; he has handed over the running of the housing department and the probation service to the federal government (though without much choice), and he has improved safety on the buses by using reformed gang members as guardian angels. Above all, he has inspired a new enthusiasm for civic affairs. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Mr Brown clearly relishes the process of politics far more than the humdrum business of administration. He loves playing interest groups off against each other and brokering deals between them. (This is, after all, the man whom Bill Clinton complimented as being "the real slick Willie".) Boasting better national connections than most other mayors, he has brought a cavalcade of Clinton cabinet members through the city; he is also hand in glove with Diane Feinstein, one of the state's senators. He understands the importance of projecting a positive image of the city, and this is good; but the running of any city cannot be simply a process of cocky salesmanship.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A year into his term, Mr Brown's plans to reform the city's management are little more than clich&eacute;s. He has neither Mr Giuliani's ability to think the unthinkable--that the tide of crime and casual lawlessness that was engulfing New York could be reversed--nor Mr Daley's relentless appetite for detail. Part of him still clearly dismisses his job as nothing but "street lights, dog doo and parking meters". A little more appetite for the daily realities of city life would do Mr Brown no harm. And a little humility, as seen unexpectedly on the 49ers' practice field, might make a good basis on which to start.<br>

<h1>Push, pull and paralysis in India</h1>

<font size=1>DELHI</font><p>
THE United Front government in India has lasted seven months. Many are betting that it will not last seven more. Its main foe is an old man in a hurry, Sitaram Kesri, who at the age of 78 has recently taken over the presidency of Congress, the largest opposition party. Mr Kesri wants to be prime minister and, at his age, he does not want to wait too long.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The coalition government, a rag-tag collection of 13 leftist, regional and minor parties, came to power soon after the general election in May. The biggest winner in the election was a group of Hindu-nationalist parties, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (<font size=-1>BJP</font>), which took 195 of the 543 seats in Parliament. The <font size=-1>BJP</font> formed a minority government, but was isolated by the secular parties and quickly lost. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Congress, which had ruled India almost continuously since the country's independence, came second, but with only 140 seats, compared with 232 in the previous parliament, so it was seen as the big loser. Accordingly, it was left to 13 other parties with 178 seats between them to cobble together a "United Front" government, the unifying cement being their shared determination to keep the <font size=-1>BJP</font> out. With similar feelings about the <font size=-1>BJP</font>, Congress agreed to support the minority government.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Quarrels have divided the United Front from day one. The leftist parties oppose privatisation and think that Deve Gowda, the prime minister, has been too soft on Narasimha Rao, his Congress predecessor, who faces a variety of corruption charges. But these quarrels, though noisy, are unlikely in themselves to cause the government's collapse. The four left-wing parties, which are the most fractious, have only 52 seats and none of the regional parties in the coalition has more than 20. The government could survive defections from the leftist or the regional groupings, so long as Congress continues to vote with it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is the big if. Before Mr Kesri came on the scene, Congress leaders seemed prepared to bide their time, since they saw little prospect of improving their fortunes in a fresh election. But after Mr Rao was charged with corruption, he resigned as president of the Congress party. In September, he was succeeded by Mr Kesri, who does not disguise his desire to become prime minister. He has a four-stage plan to manipulate himself into power.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;First, he needs to reunite all the splinters of Congress, making it the largest single party in Parliament, with 165 seats (the <font size=-1>BJP</font> has only 160). Second, he needs to replace Mr Rao as leader of the Congress parliamentary party. After this, he plans to withdraw support from the United Front, and wait for the president to ask him, as head of the largest party, to form the next government. Lastly, he hopes to seduce most regional and minor parties from the United Front and so win a majority.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;None of this will be as easy as it sounds. Mr Kesri has won back two Congress splinter groups, but what really matters, because it holds 20 seats in Parliament, is the splinter in the state of Tamil Nadu. The trouble is that this lot owes its success there to its conversion into a regional party. It would lose much of its support if it rejoined Congress. Moreover, it already holds two cabinet posts, including the finance minister's, and Mr Kesri cannot offer it much more. But, without it, Congress cannot become the largest party in Parliament.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor will Mr Kesri find it easy to dislodge Mr Rao from his remaining job, as leader of the parliamentary party. Although Mr Rao has led Congress to defeat and has now been charged with corruption, his party has no tradition of removing a sitting leader. He will not go quietly, and Mr Kesri dare not push things to a split, which would ruin his chances of inheriting a united party.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if the first three stages of Mr Kesri's scheme went according to plan, it is by no means certain that the regional and minor parties would give their support to him. Why should they, when Congress is their main rival in their states?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So the fall of the United Front could lead to parliamentary deadlock and a fresh election, in which the <font size=-1>BJP</font> would probably make the biggest gains. Nonetheless, many in Congress expect Mr Kesri to make his move in mid-1997. However small his chance of making the history books, it is his only chance.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the government, all this is proving paralysing. No big economic changes have taken place, or are in prospect. But that does not mean that all is well, especially on the budget front. The central government's budget deficit was 5.9% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> last year. Add the borrowing of state governments and public-sector corporations, and the combined deficit was close to 10% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>. The finance minister has promised to cut the central deficit to 5%, but is getting no co-operation from other ministers. He wants to raise oil prices (which are government-controlled) in line with world prices, but his coalition partners have said no, because it would make them unpopular. In consequence, state oil companies will be in debt to the tune of almost $3 billion (1.5% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>) by the end of the fiscal year in March.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In India, any government under threat puts off hard decisions and tries to buy popularity. The finance minister is trying to limit giveaways, but without much success. The railway and telecoms ministers have granted additional bonus payments to their employees, and state governments are likely to follow suit. Fertiliser and food subsidies are certain to be above budget. Economic liberalisation is not under threat, but fiscal discipline certainly is.<br>

<h1>All quiet on the eastern front</h1>

<font size=1>DELHI</font><p> SOME called it weak-kneed, most said it was pragmatic statesmanship. India
has many complaints about China-- that it has occupied Indian territory, given missiles and nuclear
technology to Pakistan, and supported the Pakistani position on Kashmir.
Yet the Indian government rolled out the red carpet for Jiang Zemin, the president of China, when he visited
Delhi on November 28th and signed an agreement for confidence-building measures which could lead to the
partial demilitarisation of their disputed border.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two
countries agreed not to attack one another; to limit or reduce troops and weapons in a zone to be worked out
on both sides of the "line of actual control" (<font size=-1>LAC</font>); and to ban combat aircraft within
ten kilometres (six miles) of the <font size=-1>LAC</font> except with prior notice.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Below the surface, this is an agreement to disagree. Both sides
have territorial claims on the other. China has offered to make the <font size=-1>LAC</font> the official
border, which means it would give up its claims in the eastern sector in return for India giving up its claims
in the western sector. But no Indian government could agree to a deal like that; it would be accused of
treason by all opposition parties. So demilitarising the <font size=-1>LAC</font> is an interim measure to
reduce tension, the chances of a military clash, and defence spending, without any surrender of
territory.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two sides disagree even on where the <font
size=-1>LAC</font> runs, though they have not pursued their disagreement violently since an ugly military
clash in 1987. The current aim is to avoid any further fighting till the <font size=-1>LAC</font> is
formally demarcated, a task that has so far proved elusive. Troop reductions have also been discussed in
the past, but without success. The Chinese side of the border is a plateau on which troops can be quickly
moved, whereas the Indian side is steep, landslide-prone mountainside. China would like both sides to
withdraw an equal distance, but India says that would enable the Chinese to reach the border faster. The
issue is unlikely to be resolved quickly.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some Indians argued
that their government should have refused to receive the head of a country it accuses of supplying <font
size=-1>M-11</font> missiles and nuclear-weapons technology to Pakistan. But the government, though it
stridently accuses Pakistan of threatening Indian security, has chosen not to make an issue of China's role.
It has decided to live with China's weapons sales, which it thinks are motivated by commercial rather than
strategic considerations.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though some Indians worry that
China may be trying to "contain" India by fostering ties with Pakistan, Myanmar and Bangladesh, the Indian
government is less suspicious. The Chinese attack of 1962 is now a distant memory in India. Deng Xiaoping's
China looks less threatening than Mao's. Indeed, an invasion by Chinese businessmen now seems more likely
than an invasion by Chinese troops. Trade between the two countries is a mere $1 billion, but growing at
30% each year. India will back China's entry into the World Trade Organisation, and China will back India's
entry into the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum. Modest beginnings, but not to be sneered at in a
region where international tensions still run high.<br>

<p><b>Litigation</b></p>
<h1>Reading, writing and writs</h1>

IF LITTLE Johnny flunked his exams, his parents used to send him to his room in disgrace. Now they send for the lawyers. As two 17-year-olds who got lousy <font size=-1>GCSE</font> results began proceedings against their school, teachers trembled at the thought of a flood of litigation.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the British public, after years of pooh-poohing the Americans for demanding millions of dollars for being scalded by a cup of coffee, seems to think it is not such a bad idea. Despite the government's efforts to restrict legal aid for personal-injury actions, the gross bill in England and Wales for such suits rose from &#163;77m in 1991-92 to &#163;200m in 1994-95. However, damages are not yet American-style: judges, who try most British actions, do not award the astronomic sums handed out by American juries.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government is partly responsible for this development. By promoting the Citizens' Charters and pushing public services to publish performance records, it has supported the idea that those who do not meet measurable standards, such as school league tables, should pay compensation. In the exam case, the lawyer, Jack Rabinowicz, will draw on inspection reports which said their two schools had failed to provide an acceptable standard of education.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The exam case is also the consequence of judgments by the House of Lords. In July 1995, in three cases concerning the special needs of dyslexic children, their lordships decided that schools and local education authorities could be sued for failing to carry out their duty of care. Mr Rabinowicz subsequently won a &#163;30,000 out-of-court settlement last month for an ex-pupil bullied for three years at a school in London.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where does this trend lead? Litigation leads to insurance, which risks driving some businesses to the wall. Parts of America, for instance, are short of obstetricians because the risks of litigation have made delivering babies prohibitively expensive. But in moderate doses, it may be beneficial. So, anyway, argues Peter Watson, a Glasgow lawyer who acted for the relatives of victims of the Piper Alpha oil platform disaster and the Lockerbie air disaster. He says that American-style lawsuits are an effective force for change. "The traditional British method of forming a committee, passing a few health and safety regulations which fine a defaulting company tuppence-halfpenny, is a waste of time," he says. In both cases, he says, the companies ignored regulations and safety procedures.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The threat of litigation is raising the costs of bad decision-making, but it does not necessarily make it clearer how people should do their jobs. Environmental health officials delayed publishing lists of shops selling meat which caused the current food poisoning outbreak in Lanarkshire, fearing legal action by a wrongly-identified shop. Health officials, more concerned to stop the death toll (seven by December 5th) from the <i>E. coli</i> 0157 bug, over-ruled them.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The courts may eventually decide who was right. On December 4th, lawyers acting for seven children in Stoke-on-Trent poisoned by <i>E. coli</i> in a separate incident said they were going to sue the government for not properly publicising information about the bug.<br>

<h1>Working miracles</h1>

BRITAIN'S "flexible" labour markets are increasingly held up as a model for the inflexible rest of Europe to
follow. Research published in December's issue of <i>Labour Market Trends</i> was claimed in support of
this conclusion by Tory ministers. But on closer inspection it raised as many questions as it answered.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Certainly, unemployment has fallen more quickly during the
economic recovery of the 1990s than it did in that of the 1980s. Nor has this triggered a rise in
wage-inflation. This suggests that Tory reforms to weaken employment rights such as job protection and to
curb trade-union power, thus encouraging employers to hire new workers sooner as demand increases,
have paid off.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But, says the new research, that is not the
whole story. Several other factors contributed to the change. In the 1990s more people opted out of the
workforce--into higher education, early retirement, or invalidity--than in the 1980s. Job growth was
spread more evenly across the country, so it took longer for shortages to occur in any one area, making it
easier to contain wage pressures.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As our <a
href="br1.gif">chart</a> shows, Britain's job creation record was better in the 1990s than in the 1980s, both in
absolute terms and in comparison with America and Germany. Of all the Group of Seven rich countries, only
France had a similar improvement. Yet Britain's record still only matched Germany's. That was better than
in the 1980s, but hardly justifies Tory boasts about Britain's superior labour-market policies. For
American-style jobs-growth, Britain, and the rest of Europe, need more than flexibility: they need better
education and a social-security system that does not actually discourage working, for a start.<br>

<p><b>Disability law</b></p>
<h1>Crippling?</h1>

WHEN America passed the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, sceptics said it should really be called the lawyers' retirement act. The language was a lawyers' dream: it included such notions as common sense, reasonable accommodation, essential functions, undue hardship and readily achievable goals. Businessmen predicted a litigation nightmare.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain's Disability Discrimination Act has come into force this week, and many British businessmen have similar fears. Some disability campaigners, meanwhile, have been protesting that it does not go far enough. The American experience suggests that the disabled will end up better off than they were, though not completely satisfied, and the new regulations will not prove too burdensome to business.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both the American law and the British one prohibit discrimination against disabled people in hiring, firing and promotion. This in effect extends civil rights protections to the disabled. The laws also require restaurants, shops, libraries and so on to make efforts to serve the disabled-- perhaps by reading out the menu to blind diners. Both laws are intentionally vague: the idea was to establish broad principles.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The problem, say American businessmen, is that they don't know how they are required to respond until they are hit with a complaint. A survey in 1995 of 35,000 employers by the National Federation of Independent Business found that two-thirds wanted the law clarified. For instance, the definition of disability remains murky. Some 49m Americans--or more than one in six--are considered disabled under the act, an implausible figure. Among those included are former drug addicts, a categorisation employers dispute, and there is worry that the obese and smell-sensitive will litigate their way in as well.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A second complaint is that some regulations are too broad. The Los Angeles school district, for example, hesitated to fire a teacher who had killed a woman and spent ten years in a hospital for the criminally insane: under the law, former mental illness is not a ground for firing. There is also concern that the "reasonable accommodation" standard can be unreasonably applied. A self-serve car wash in Michigan had to install a $12,000 lavatory for the handicapped, even though the site is visited by employees for only half an hour a week.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the feared litigation frenzy has simply not happened; the Department of Labour records 650 suits nationwide in the first five years. Moreover, the experience has been that much "reasonable accommodation" is cheap and easy--putting a desk up on bricks, perhaps, or installing large-print software. Employment rates in America among disabled people have been increasing. The act can probably take some credit for that.<br>

<p><b>Rail privatisation</b></p>
<h1>New rail barons</h1>

THREE more passenger rail franchises were awarded to private companies this week--Great Eastern to FirstBus, Anglia to <font size=-1>GB</font> Railways, and West Anglia and Great Northern to Prism Rail. Only a third of the original 25 franchises remain unsold. Unless an election intervenes, they will be sold within the next four months.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet already the government's blueprint for the industry is in the bin. The government had hoped that by splitting British Rail into more than 100 different companies it would promote competition. But the lesson of other utility privatisations--that what ministers split, the market reassembles--is being repeated.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;John Seurat of Symonds Travers Morgan, a transport consultancy, says that rail is likely to follow the pattern of the bus industry. Deregulation of buses led to the appearance, and then the disappearance, of 500 separate companies. The industry is now dominated by a handful of operators--three of which (Stagecoach, National Express and FirstBus) are among the leading contenders for rail franchises.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Stagecoach has already got two franchises, South West Trains and the Island Line, and is one of three preferred bidders for the Inter City West Coast line. It is now bidding to take over Porterbrook, one of three leasing companies. This move, if approved, will be the first step towards the vertical integration of the rail industry.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is worried about whether to allow bus companies to dominate the rail industry. It is therefore looking attentively at bids by Stagecoach for ScotRail and by National Express for Midland Main Line; but both are likely to be approved.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other key players in the franchise race are Connex, owned by the Compagnie G&eacute;n&eacute;rale des Eaux, Sea Containers, a ferry and container operator, and Virgin, part of the consortium which runs the Eurostar passenger trains. Between them, the five companies already control nearly half of all rail passenger revenues, a proportion likely to increase in coming months. Industry sources also expect that the three franchises awarded to management buy-outs-- <font size=-1>M</font>40 Trains, Victory Railways and Great Western--will also attract bids.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The City, not surprisingly, has contracted rail fever. Porterbrook was privatised for &#163;527m and bought from its managers by Stagecoach for &#163;825m seven months later. Shares in Prism Rail, a small train operating company which has the London-Tilbury-Southend franchise, have quintupled in six months from the &#163;1 offering price. Railtrack's shares, which were floated earlier this year at 190p, have also nearly doubled in value. Its first pre-tax statement after the flotation reported that profits had leapt by 77%, to &#163;173m.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The expectation of big profits lies behind this stockmarket performance. The new operators are promising new rolling stock, smaller subsidies and even lower fares. Their confidence is based partly on the belief that increasing road congestion will drive people on to trains.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are some signs that their optimism may be justified. Most franchisees are reporting a sharp rise in passenger volumes, maybe because even travellers seem to be benefiting. According to the first performance figures from eight privatised routes, seven were more punctual than they had been before privatisation, and all eight were more reliable in running scheduled services.<br>

<p><b>London's development</b></p> <h1>Jubilation?</h1>

WHEN the Docklands development crashed in the early 1990s, investors
blamed the lack of proper infrastructure. Narrow roads, the tiny
capacity of the Docklands Light Railway (<font size=-1>DLR</font>) and
the encircling Thames had, developers said, left large-scale commercial
or residential complexes too inaccessible to be attractive. The
government's response, along with an upgrade for the <font
size=-1>DLR</font> and a revamping of the roads, was a rambling
extension of London Underground's Jubilee line from the West End to
south and east London.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The
construction of the Jubilee line extension, the biggest development in
the capital's transport system for over two decades, has clogged
London's traffic for a year and maddened Londoners. Now that it is
nearing completion, however, things seem to be looking up for the
Docklands.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Office occupancy has risen
from 62% in 1993 to 75% this year. In the riverside area of Southwark,
where four of the 11 new Jubilee line stops will be located, the number
of planning permissions granted has tripled since 1992. Housing sales
have hit their highest level since the 1980s. Chic waterside apartments
now routinely sell a year before their scheduled completion. Citibank
and <i>Readers</i>' <i>Digest </i>are moving to Canary Wharf. Add the
extra impetus of the Jubilee's arrival in March 1998 to falling
unemployment and rising rents, and it looks as though Docklands is
poised for a second 1980s-style boom.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Docklands today is not the wasteland
it was in the early 1980s, when Tower Hamlets had a higher proportion of
residents in public housing than did the Soviet Union. The London
Docklands Development Corporation (<font size=-1>LDDC</font>), set up by
the government to by-pass left-wing councils and promote private-sector
development, once owned swathes of derelict land. Now, the only large
vacant tracts are in the remote Royal Docks (see <a
href="br2.gif">map</a>).<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the
Victoria line came to Brixton in 1971, the increased accessibility sent
property prices soaring. But along the Jubilee's route through Southwark
a sea of dilapidated council estates rubs shoulders with cheap and
cheerful low-cost housing built by the <font size=-1>LDDC</font> as a
sop to local objections that it was doing nothing for the poor. It is
not the stuff of estate agents' fantasies.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Surely, if property prices soar, all this
could be replaced by higher-value housing? It could, except that
planning authority in Docklands will soon revert from the <font
size=-1>LDDC</font> to the local borough councils. Southwark takes over
Surrey Quays later this month, and Tower Hamlets regains the Isle of
Dogs next year.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All the local councils
are Labour. The hard left has mostly gone; and council officials,
between enthusiastic references to "housing choice", "efficiency" and
plans to eliminate 95% of unnecessary bollards, privately welcome any
scheme which will bring wealthier residents to areas which are still
among the poorest in London. But indigenous Docklanders have always been
suspicious of East London's gentrification. One popular grafitto
rechristens the <font size=-1>LDDC</font> "Locals Don't Dig Cobbles".
Local politicians cannot publicly support replacing poor people's
housing with houses and offices for the rich.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Certainly, local residents will benefit
from better transport. Local businesses are less certain to. Good
transport can bring people into an area; but, as Brixton learned, it can
also free them to do their shopping elsewhere. Brixton's shopping centre
died once the Victoria line shipped people off to Oxford Circus.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The one sure winner from the Jubilee line
extension is Canary Wharf. The new station there will handle over 15,000
people every hour at peak times, with capacity for many more. The
current owner of the Canary Wharf development, International Property
Corporation, not only stands to see the value of the existing complex
increase; roughly 8m of the 10m square feet of office space in the area
with planning permission are in two further planned towers on the
development.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Seeing Canary Wharf's
huge potential profit from the Tube access, the government insisted in
1993 that the then owners pay &#163;398m towards the projected &#163;1.2
billion cost of construction. But although Canary Wharf's contribution,
spread out over 25 years from 1998, will be hugely discounted by
inflation, the cost of the extension has risen to &#163;2.6 billion in
today's money. It has proved an expensive way of remedying an

<p><b>The other technopolists</b></p> <h1>Bigger, faster, better ears</h1>

<p><b>Internet folk are famously opposed to the proprietary standards that made Microsoft and Intel so
dominant. So how did Cisco Systems win 85% of the Internet's richest market--and become worth the same
as General Motors?</b></p><br> ALL this year the computer industry has been hotly debating which
company, Microsoft or Netscape, will win the Internet software market. But there has been no such debate
on the hardware side, because there is no contest. The undisputed leader in this market is Cisco Systems, a
maker of network equipment. Thanks to its soaring share price, Cisco has a market capitalisation of over
$40 billion (much the same as General Motors), yet the firm has barely attracted the notice of the average
computer user, much less the antitrust authorities. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Part of
the reason is that the Californian firm's market is as obscure as it is fast-growing. Cisco makes computer
networking equipment of all sorts, but most of its profits come from selling specialised computers called
"routers" that direct traffic at the intersections of the Internet's many routes. These are machines that the
ordinary user never sees, nor much cares about. Like the switches of a telephone network, these devices,
provided they are doing their job properly, are in effect invisible. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Each e-mail message or transmitted Web <dest="makes"
ref="page"> its way from sender to receiver by being automatically bounced, pinball-like, from one router
to the next. The wires that connect the Internet's routers are just dumb pipes; all the magic of the network
lies in the routers. It is they that enable the Internet to weave together seamlessly thousands of smaller
networks, or send a message around the world without specifying anything more than a few characters. As
the Internet doubles in size each year, so does the demand for ever more, ever faster routers. And 85% of
these are made by Cisco.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This dominance of one of the hottest
high-tech markets has lifted Cisco into the ranks of the computer industry's most successful firms. The
company is big (sales in the past financial year exceeded $4 billion, and this year are expected to pass $6
billion) and highly profitable (net profits were nearly $1 billion last year), and it has been almost doubling
in size each year for most of this decade (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>). Yet while Cisco may share
with Microsoft and Intel some of the financial rewards of market domination, it got there in a very
different way.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most quasi-monopolies in technology markets
owe their position to their ownership of a standard. Because so much of technology is about one gizmo
connecting to or working with another gizmo, they usually need a common language for talking to each
other. Sometimes that language is open and free for all to use; but often such standards were created and
are owned by one company which, either through might or luck, has managed to persuade the rest of the
industry to do things its way.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Owning such a de facto standard
is the surest way to become a technopolist, as Microsoft proved with its <font size=-1>PC</font> system
software, and Intel with its <font size=-1>PC</font> processor chips. But the Internet has, since its start,
been a creature of open, non-proprietary standards. Part of the reason for this is that communications
technologies need ubiquity for maximum impact; the more people you can communicate with, the more
useful the technology becomes. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No company owns an accepted
Internet standard. Cisco can use every trick and secret in the book to make its routers faster than the
competition or easier to use, but where they connect with the rest of the Internet they must stick largely
to open Internet standards. Even when Cisco invents a way to improve upon those standards, it must submit
it to an independent standards committee and make it available to other firms before customers will accept
it. Networking companies expect equipment to be "interoperable", so they can unplug a Cisco router and plug
in one from a competing firm, such as Bay Networks or Ascend Communications, in its place. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The consequence of this devotion to open standards is that network
operators enjoy what economists call low switching costs: changing suppliers is relatively easy. It is this
that makes Cisco's dominance so surprising. Much of Microsoft's hold on the software market is due to high
switching costs. If you abandon Microsoft's Windows for another company's system, many of your other
programs, which cost a packet and took weeks to learn, may well stop working, or you may be cut off from
the next hot software innovation. Likewise, Intel dominates the microprocessor market because it sets the
standard and enjoys a monopoly on its newest chips for years before competitors figure out how to clone
them.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unlike them, Cisco keeps its dominance the
old-fashioned way: it simply makes routers that are better than the competition's. It created the router
market in 1984, when Sandy Lerner and Leonard Bosack, a husband-and-wife team of Stanford academics,
set up the firm to market machines they had cobbled together at their university. And it has managed to
stay ahead of its competition ever since by running faster.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From the beginning, Cisco distinguished itself from bigger
companies by retaining its local connections and listening to its customers. Firms such as <font
size=-1>IBM</font>, <font size=-1>AT&T</font> and Proteon were already in the network-equipment
business, but missed the significance of routers--and router-based networks such as the Internet. "The
number of companies that gave away this business is remarkable," says Mike O'Dell, head of technical
operations for <font size=-1>UUN</font>et, which uses Cisco routers to run much of its global Internet
network. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With its close ties to the universities and companies
developing the Internet, Cisco could evolve along with it. But, as the company grew, it found that it
sometimes had to choose between its own technical goals and the wish-lists of its customers. On one side
was Ms Lerner, who put herself in charge of a "customer advocacy" group. On the other were the
professional managers the firm had brought in. In 1990, after the firm went public, its two founders
left.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite that clash, and despite its tremendous growth
since then, Cisco has managed to keep its reputation for knowing its customers better than the competition.
That allowed Cisco to foresee how the market would develop, because the staid corporate networking
market tends to trail Internet trend-setters by a few years. And its customer focus helped Cisco to sell a
lot of boxes without much promotion. It did not buy its first advertisement until 1992, when it already had
more than $300m in annual revenues. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Internet service
companies have a close interest in telling Cisco what they need, because the very fabric of the Internet
depends on the company being able to come up with faster routers quickly enough to keep up with the
network's soaring traffic-demands. This information flow helps the firm to stay a technology hop ahead of
its competition. The Internet is, in effect, Cisco's research and development laboratory.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Only as good as your last byte</b></b><br> What could go wrong? In fact, Cisco's
quasi-monopoly may be more fragile than its admirers on Wall Street believe. The company's position rests
on little more than its ability to listen better, innovate faster and employ better people than its competition.
If another rival starts to do all of these things a little bit better, or too many brainy people leave Cisco, the
advantage could disappear overnight. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And, naturally, Cisco is
facing the usual risks of domination: complacency, conservatism and excessive concentration on the most
profitable markets. Already some customers are mumbling that other firms seem to have more compelling
technologies for the next generation of even faster routers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Cisco's usual reaction to having missed a beat in this fast-moving
market is to buy a company with the necessary technology-- since 1994, it has spent more than $5 billion
on such acquisitions. But such takeovers have their administrative costs. Other hardware firms have often
got into trouble because they have bitten off something bigger than they could chew. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the Internet's booming market, where service providers are
constantly upgrading to better routers to stay ahead of demand, Cisco cannot count on customer loyalty
alone to sustain its lead. Switching suppliers is never easy, but it is certainly easier for Cisco's customers
than, say, Microsoft's. A dominance based simply on being better at guessing the way forward than other
firms and getting there faster is never as safe as one built on owning an industry standard. Even the best
legs eventually get tired, and the best hearing grows faint.<br>

<h1>Germany's Herr Handy</h1>

<p><b>Is a pinch of telecoms enough to spice up an old-fashioned, feudal European conglomerate? Georg
Obermeier hopes so</b></p><br> ONE of the more fashionable things to do if you are a slightly stodgy but
rich European utility is to branch out into telecoms of one sort or another. It is not just that the phone
market seems to be growing whilst most other public services look a little sluggish. It is also a question of
sex appeal: who wants to be in the boring old business of delivering electricity, pumping water or bringing
commuters to work when there are things like satellite telephony and multimedia in the air? And, even if it
takes a little time to make money, there is always the hope that some of that snazzy new culture will infect
the more dowdy parts of your organisation.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this explains
why Britain's regional electricity companies have got together to form Energis, a telecoms firm that uses
their lines. A group of the continent's national railways have set up Hermes, a telecoms consortium.
Compagnie G&eacute;n&eacute;rale des Eaux, a French water company, is also now in the telecoms
business. But few are pushing in as aggressively as Georg Obermeier, the irascible 55-year-old Bavarian
who runs <font size=-1>VIAG</font>.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In many ways <font
size=-1>VIAG</font> is a caricature of a regional monopoly. Although it was privatised in 1986, its largest
shareholder is the Bavarian state government, and it makes most of its money from electricity generation
in that state. Now it is run very much as a personal fief by Mr Obermeier (his latest "disagreement" was
with his finance director, whom he has not yet replaced). Mr Obermeier has helped tighten up <font
size=-1>VIAG</font>'s finances (its head office has only 100 people); but it is still a sprawling group with
interests in businesses like packaging and freight. The performance of <font size=-1>VIAG</font>'s shares
has lagged behind those of both <font size=-1>RWE</font> and Veba, two other utility-based German
conglomerates that have been more aggressive about reshuffling their business (see <a href="wb2.gif">chart</a>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now Mr Obermeier scents salvation in his country's notoriously
poorly-served telecoms market, which is still largely monopolised by Deutsche Telekom. Although Germans
flocked to buy shares in the company when it was partially privatised last month, they are disenchanted
customers. Many would switch to another telephone company, especially one offering lower prices and
greater flexibility. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>VIAG</font> hopes to woo
them through mobile telephony. Germany's internationally minded businessfolk have given their favourite
gadget an English name: <i>das Handy</i> is the German for mobile phone. Handy they may be, cheap they
are not. A talkative business user can expect to pay around DM487 ($311) a month, according to Analysys,
a consultancy; his British counterpart would shell out only &#163;85 ($140). Mr Obermeier wants to
change this. He aims to make the gadget into a <i>Volkshandy</i>--cheap enough to tempt millions of
households to abandon conventional phone lines altogether.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>VIAG</font> is set to get its mobile phone licence in
February, in a joint venture with Britain's <font size=-1>BT</font>. It will begin operating in early 1998,
just when Germany's telephone market is due to be liberalised. Its strategy should give it a head start:
while other new entrants are having to use Deutsche Telekom's local circuits, at great expense--or, even
more expensively, dig up the streets to put in new lines--<font size=-1>VIAG</font> will avoid all this
trouble by using wireless transmission rather than cables. Even better, it will be using a higher radio
frequency than its mobile competitors, meaning better-quality sound and greater capacity (which will be
useful for customers using modems and other gadgets). And whereas its rivals are putting their main effort
into setting up new long-distance networks, <font size=-1>VIAG</font> will save money by renting what it
needs.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But <font size=-1>VIAG</font>'s advantages may look
more slender as the months go by. Belatedly, a price war is now raging in mobile phones, between
Mannesmann, a big engineering company which has already thrashed Deutsche Telekom to become market
leader, and the third network, <font size=-1>E</font>-Plus, which has several owners including Veba. By
early 1998, <font size=-1>VIAG</font>'s promised cut-price rates will probably look less spectacular.
Meanwhile, the price of ordinary telephony will also probably fall, as Deutsche Telekom comes under
pressure from <font size=-1>RWE</font> and Veba. Much will depend on the expertise of <font
size=-1>VIAG</font>'s British partner and on how Mr Obermeier's somewhat feudal management style
adapts to the task.<br> </p><p><b><b>A sideshow with a meaning</b></b><br> Mr Obermeier's advance
into telecoms has all the makings of an exciting tussle. But <font size=-1>VIAG</font> shareholders might
wonder whether he is putting too much effort into the project. In five years' time, telecoms are expected to
contribute sales of only DM2 billion, rising to DM5.5 billion by 2008. By contrast, group sales for 1996 are
forecast at some DM43.8 billion, most of which comes from electricity. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From this perspective, the foray into telecoms might indeed help
spice up some of <font size=-1>VIAG</font>'s other businesses (trying to wrest the cellular telephony
business from Mannesmann will be a far more cut-throat affair than, say, selling nuclear power in
Bavaria). But <font size=-1>VIAG</font> is in so many businesses that it is hard to see how all of them can
be infused with this entrepreneurial spirit. And the telecoms fuss may prove a distraction to the harsher
matter of selling off its more lacklustre businesses and, perhaps (whisper it very quietly), making <font
size=-1>VIAG</font>'s boss a little more accountable. The leonine Mr Obermeier's eyes glint dangerously
as the topic of his management style is raised. "Very fast decisions are the key to our success," he purrs.
The telecoms battle will be a good test of that.<br>

<h1>Hail to the mighty pound</h1>

<p><b>Sterling was the strongest of the world's major currencies until it dipped this week. Is this the end
of its rise, or just the beginning?</b></p><br> THESE are halcyon days for the British pound. Between
August and early December, sterling soared from $1.54 to $1.68, &#165;164 to &#165;193, and DM2.28
to DM2.64. Its trade-weighted value (which reflects the pattern of Britain's trade with different countries)
was over 14% up on a year earlier (see <a href="fn1.gif">chart</a>). This is heady stuff indeed for a
currency which has been falling in value for most of the past 50 years. And it is only four years since
sterling was pushed into a withdrawal from Europe's exchange-rate mechanism (<font size=-1>ERM</font>)
that deeply embarrassed the government. But what happens next to the pound--and with it, the British
economy-- is now in the balance. Is the strong pound back for good? <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To many Britons, the pound's long-term fall from global reserve
currency to small change symbolised their country's broader decline from industrial superpower to an
also-ran struggling to keep up with the likes of Singapore and Italy. That is why some British nationalists
oppose joining the planned single European currency, the "abolition of the pound" being, for them, a final
admission of economic defeat. Yet sterling's recent revival has not led the average Briton to walk taller. It
seems to have been greeted with a mixture of indifference and ambivalence.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Soon after winning the 1992 British general election, John Major,
the prime minister, said that his goal was for sterling to replace the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark as
Europe's strong, stable currency. But now, with sterling still some way beneath the exchange rate it had
with the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark then, Mr Major's government seems uncertain about what to make
of the pound's new-found strength. Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, has argued that the
rising pound will dampen inflationary pressures, so reducing the need for him to raise interest rates before
next year's general election. But, more recently, he has echoed the fears of "large numbers of British
industries" that sterling is getting too strong.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sterling's exit
from the <font size=-1>ERM</font> soon after Mr Major pledged to out-muscle the <font
size=-1>D</font>-mark sharply changed British attitudes towards a strong pound. Instead of pushing up
inflation and thus prolonging recession, as was predicted, the weaker pound boosted the international
competitiveness of British firms, helping exports to soar. Britain became a cheap place to visit and to do
business. Huge amounts of foreign investment poured in, reviving bits of the economy as moribund as the
film industry, which has been inundated with work from Hollywood studios attracted by its low production
costs. And all this coincided with huge problems in the big continental economies, especially France, whose
politicians complained endlessly about Britain's "unfair advantage" of cheap sterling.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The stronger pound seems to threaten all this. Will
<i>Newsweek</i> still call London the "world's coolest city" if its high prices, in dollars, scare off
American tourists? Might foreign investors divert their cash elsewhere? According to the British Screen
Advisory Council, Britain is now less expensive than America in only two of the seven main elements of
film-making, compared with five in August. And who will buy British? The Confederation of British Industry
claims that the strong pound is hurting exports. Some analysts in the City of London recently cut their 1996
profit forecasts for leading British exporters by two percentage points.<br> </p><p><b><b>Revaluation or
aberration?</b></b><br> For now, such fears are overdone. It is easy to exaggerate how important cheap
sterling has been to the economy since 1992. The recession of the early 1990s was already over when the
pound left the <font size=-1>ERM</font>. Foreign investors come to Britain as much for its access to
Europe's single market, its flexible labour laws and its English-speaking workers as its weak currency.
Also, although cheap sterling helped exporters, many took the opportunity to pad their profit margins
rather than increase the volume of export sales; their sales need not suffer now if they trim margins again.
Britain's main export markets are likely to grow faster during the next few years than in the recent past,
and this extra demand should make up for any sales lost because of a strong pound.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even after this year's surge the pound seems pretty fairly valued.
Economists disagree greatly about what a "right" exchange rate is. But most estimates suggest that the
pound's trade-weighted value is roughly right. Britain's current account is almost in balance: a far cry
from 1988, when sterling was too strong, hitting exports and boosting imports. The pound's real exchange
rate (the nominal rate adjusted for differences in inflation between countries) is still below its average
over the past 15 years.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For Britain's economy, the central
question is whether the pound's rise is a short-term aberration or a fundamental revaluation. Predicting the
foreign-exchange markets is hazardous. Economic theory sheds some light on long-term exchange-rate
movements, but is useless in forecasting either the direction or timing of short-term changes. No one is
absolutely sure why the pound has been so strong this year, which makes it hard to say whether it is still
rising, on a plateau or riding for a fall.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is Britain's growing
inflationary pressures that most probably explain the rise of sterling, reckons David Mackie, an economist
at J.P. Morgan, an investment bank. Investors, including the notorious hedge-fund speculators, have been
buying the pound like hot cakes because Britain is one of the few countries where interest rates are
expected to go up reasonably soon. The currency markets seem to be pricing in a rise of one percentage
point. Meanwhile, rates in America and Japan look stable, and continental Europe's may be ready to fall.
That greater-than-expected differential in interest rates means greater returns for investors who own
pounds. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One alternative explanation pins the pound's rise on
expectations that Britain will, after all, join in the single European currency that may start in 1998. That
interpretation looks misguided, since both Britain's main political parties are increasingly lukewarm about
abandoning sterling-- and British voters overwhelmingly oppose doing so. Yet another story in the markets
has sterling in much demand, along with the Swiss franc, as a haven for investors who think the new single
currency will prove inflation-prone. That explanation also strains belief: the money markets expect
inflation to be higher in Britain than in most of the countries likely to join monetary union, so investors
would be more likely to dump sterling than to hold it.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;None of
this technical stuff will trouble ordinary Britons, few of whom have yet noticed that the pound in their
pocket is for once going up. They will soon catch on to the pleasures of cheap imports and affordable foreign
travel. But those who puff that the pound's recent strength is a long-term "reward" for Britain's improved
economic fundamentals may end up disappointed.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The main
reason for long-term changes in exchange rates is differences in inflation rates. British inflation is at its
lowest in decades, but is still higher than in America, Japan and much of continental Europe. There are signs
it will soon rise--particularly if the British government repeats the errors of the late 1980s by using a
strong pound to excuse lax monetary policy. Keeping the pound mighty may take more hard work than
Britain is willing to put in.<br> <br>

<h1>Trade and wages</h1>

<p><b>What effect does freer trade have on the gap between skilled and unskilled workers'
pay?</b></p><br> TRADE is frequently blamed for fuelling wage inequality in rich countries. As tariff
barriers fall and imports rise, goods produced by cheap labour in poor countries compete with those made
by better-paid workers in wealthy ones. Some factories close, others slim their payrolls to cut costs. At
the same time, however, liberal trade causes exports to increase: new factories open, others increase
their payrolls to expand production. Working out the net effect on the pay of different workers is a subtle
problem.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A theory first developed in the 1940s is frequently
applied to the question. Known as the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, it is a cornerstone of modern thinking
about trade. Paul Samuelson and Wolfgang Stolper predicted that removing trade barriers would have
different effects in different countries. If a country has lots of skilled labour, its exports will tend to be
intensive in skilled labour, and skilled workers will gain from more trade. But if unskilled labour is more
abundant, its exports will be intensive in unskilled labour, so workers with skills will lose.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rich countries have relatively more skilled labour, so freer trade
should raise the wages of skilled workers and lower the wages of the unskilled. Accordingly, many
economists argue that trade accounts for at least some of the growing wage disparity between high-and
low-skilled workers in America, Britain and other advanced economies.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The changing distribution of income in rich countries, especially in
America and Britain, has been widely noted. Less well known is the fact that similar changes have occurred
in some developing countries. Pay differentials between skilled and unskilled workers are often high (see <a
href="fn2.gif">chart</a>); a skilled industrial worker in Thailand, for example,
earned around $7,100 in 1995, according to <font size=-1>UBS</font>, a Swiss bank, while an unskilled
building labourer earned barely one-quarter as much. Since tariffs have been lowered, the gap has widened
in some countries. In Mexico, for instance, the difference between a typical university-educated worker's
pay and that of an unskilled worker rose by a third between 1987 and 1993.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What makes these figures intriguing is that, on the face of it, they
contradict the evidence from rich countries and refute the Stolper-Samuelson theorem. Why? Because the
theory suggests that freer trade should reduce inequality in poorer countries, just as it increases it in rich
ones. In effect, the theory says that whatever sort of labour is most abundant in the economy before
liberalising is the one that prospers most as a result of trade. Poor countries have lots of unskilled labour.
They should therefore export goods that are intensive in unskilled labour, pushing up its wages.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Adding to the puzzle, if the Stolper-Samuelson theory works
anywhere, it should work in the third world. Trade often plays a much more important role in many
developing economies than it does in rich ones, and many poor countries have recently undertaken radical
trade liberalisations. The average tariff in Latin America, for example, has fallen from 45% in 1985 to
13%. Yet Donald Robbins, of Harvard University, finds that wage disparities increased after trade
liberalisation in Chile, Uruguay, Colombia and Costa Rica, as well as Mexico*.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It would be rash to draw firm conclusions from this handful of
countries. (Unfortunately, few others publish the detailed information on individual workers that is required
to track wage inequalities.) Nonetheless, Mr Robbins's findings demand an explanation. What has gone wrong
with the theory? There are three possible answers:<br> <font size=-1><li></font> <b>Other factors drive
wages</b>. In every case, much else will have changed during the span of time over which wage inequality
is being compared--a change in the trade regime is only one of many differences. In general, growth is going
on. This means that countries are accumulating capital and new technologies, a process that will itself have
a big effect on the distribution of income. Many other disturbances may play a part. In Latin America, for
instance, countries have wrestled with high inflation, deep recessions and huge swings in foreign-capital
flows. Any of these shocks could have influenced wages and overshadowed the direct impact of trade.<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>Trade raises the demand for skills.</b> Traditional trade theory makes two
big assumptions--that both rich and poor countries use the same kind of technology, and that capital is
internationally immobile. The question is not whether these assumptions are false: they obviously are. The
question is how much it matters. By reducing its trade barriers, a country may be able to import more new
capital equipment. This will bring new technology, which will raise the demand for higher-skilled workers
to use it. Thus freer trade will raise the premium paid to skilled workers in a way not envisaged by
Stolper-Samuelson.<br> <font size=-1><li></font> <b>The China effect.</b> Trade theory traditionally
lumps all developing countries together as having relatively unskilled workforces. But there are substantial
differences among them. China, for example, has hundreds of millions of unskilled workers and relatively
few with skills. Many middle-income developing countries that compete with China in world trade
(Colombia, say, or Chile) have relatively high average skill levels. In such countries, trade liberalisation
might be expected to cause the wage gap to rise in the same way as in rich countries.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The evidence on wage inequality in the third world will be greeted
by many as "further confirmation" that trade hurts the poor. That would be wrong. Greater inequality may
mean only that higher incomes are rising faster than lower ones, not that lower ones are falling. Beyond
that, far from confirming anything, the results only deepen a mystery. They challenge the theory which
seemed, to some, to explain why trade harmed low-income workers in rich countries. If that theory does
not fully explain wage changes in the third world, it may also be deficient when applied to rich countries.
The main explanation for widening wage inequality in rich and poor countries may lie not with trade, but
elsewhere.<br> </p><a name="foot"><br></a><font size=-1>*"Evidence on Trade and Wages in the

<p><b>Water on the moon</b></p>
<h1>In a cavern, in a canyon . . .</h1>

WHEN astronomers first turned their telescopes towards the moon they saw what they thought was a familiar pattern. The light, mountainous regions were obviously land. The dark, smooth ones were clearly water. And so they were named: Ocean of Storms; Bay of Rainbows; Sea of Tranquillity. Unfortunately, when Apollo <font size=-1>11</font> landed in the latter, it confirmed what had, by then, been known for a long time--that these "seas" are actually just dusty deserts. Apart from a flutter of excitement at the discovery of some orange soil during Apollo <font size=-1>17</font>'s visit (it might have been water-containing rust, but turned out to be little beads of glass), there has never been the slightest indication of water on the moon.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For those romantics who would like to set up lunar colonies, this has always been something of a disappointment. Having a bit of water around would mean that much less in the way of raw materials need be lugged up from the earth. Such romantics have always hoped against hope that there might be some corner of the moon where water--or, at least, ice--did linger. Their best chance was that it might be found in some deep crater where the sun never shines and the temperature is therefore so low that ice would not evaporate. Now, a paper published in <i>Science</i> suggests that this fantasy may, just possibly, prove to be true.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The crater in question is the Aitkin basin, at the moon's south pole. This has long been regarded as the most likely place to find ice because, at the poles, the sun is so low in the sky that the bottom of a deep hole might well be in permanent shadow. And the Aitkin basin is, indeed, deep-- about 13km (8 miles) at its lowest point. Some 15,500 square kilometres of its floor is reckoned to be in perpetual darkness.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1994 this area was probed with radar by <i>Clementine</i>, a scientific spacecraft unusual in that she was built by America's Department of Defence, rather than the civilian National Aeronautics and Space Administration (though <font size=-1>NASA</font> scientists have been heavily involved). <i>Clementine'</i>s  mission was to test a set of optical instruments developed for the "Star Wars" strategic defence initiative of the 1980s. These instruments had, by the 1990s, found themselves more or less redundant for their original purpose, but the defence department was still anxious to try them out, and a mission to the moon seemed a publicity-friendly way of doing it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, the ice was detected not by one of these flashy cameras, but by an experiment dreamed up as an afterthought. Since <i>Clementine</i> was not actually fitted with a proper radar (or any other instrument that could have probed for ice in the unlit polar regions), a group led by Stewart Nozette, of the American Air Force's Phillips Laboratory in Alexandria, Virginia, thought of using the craft's radio transmitter as a makeshift.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After assessing which areas seemed to be in permanent shade, Dr Nozette and his colleagues pointed the beam from the transmitter towards the moon's surface at such an angle that the reflection could be picked up on earth by one of <font size=-1>NASA</font>'s Deep Space Network radio telescopes. Ice and rock reflect radio waves differently. Rock is as opaque to radio as it is to light. The reflection is therefore fairly clean. Ice, however, is partly transparent. Some of the radio waves are reflected straight back while others bounce around inside it a bit first. This smears the signal.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such a smeared signal was detected only from the part of the zone in permanent shadow. Nearby areas exposed to the sun's rays, and similar areas at the moon's north pole, looked, as expected, like bare rock. On the other hand, the smeared signal looks very like that from icy comets, and like that from similarly unilluminated areas of the planet Mercury, which are also thought to contain pockets of ice. Dr Nozette's results suggest that about 1% of the unilluminated area in the Aitkin basin is covered by ice--possibly to a depth of several metres.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where such ice (if ice it be) might have come from is unclear. It almost certainly did not leak out of the moon itself--the rocks brought back by the Apollo missions suggest that the moon has always been bone dry. Most probably it was plastered on to the surface by collisions with comets, and has simply stayed there.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This opens up an interesting possibility. If the moon has stayed put in its orbit, the ice could have been building up at the bottom of the Aitkin basin since its formation, about 4 billion years ago. Each comet that landed nearby would have added a new layer to this particular ice-cream sundae. Examining the area with a drill, then, could yield a valuable record of how comets may have changed during the history of the solar system.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite the noises emanating from the publicists at <font size=-1>NASA</font> and the defence department, though, the discovery is not of much use in any plan to build manned bases on the moon. To be useful, such bases would best be sited at the moon's equator, where the maximum amount of sunlight is available to power them. Dragging snow balls from the pole to feed them would not be much easier than making water from the local rocks, or even bringing it from earth. It is one of nature's many little jokes that the only place on the moon where there could possibly be any water is the one place where it is of almost no use at all.<br>

<h1>The philosophers thatSophie skipped</h1>

<p><b>In a world without ideology, people's appetite for philosophy is growing. But the English-language variety is attacked for being scholastic, over-technical and abstruse. Is it?</b></p><br>
"SOPHIE'S WORLD", a history of philosophy written in the form of a novel, has sold at least 9m copies in 36 languages by offering philosophy without tears. What its Norwegian author, Jostein Gaarder, also offers is philosophy without the 20th century. His tour begins 2,600 years ago, and ends, in effect, in the late 1800s. The past century is reduced to a few cups of caf&eacute;-philosophy distilled from Jean-Paul Sartre, a dose of pop physics and one passing reference to a remark by Bertrand Russell about a doomed chicken. Perhaps this was wise. There is, after all, a widespread belief that today's philosophy is bunk. Many people say that "analytical" philosophy--which dominates English-speaking universities, and which has become the main philosophical movement in the West--is a mixture of trifling semantics and impenetrable mathematical squiggles. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet here is a funny thing. Who was it who complained about "the over-refined linguistic quibbling of some philosophers"? And who whinged that "mathematics has come to be the whole of philosophy for modern thinkers"? The first complaint is from Galen, a doctor who wrote long before the fall of the Roman Empire. The second is even older: it comes from Aristotle. The fact is that such criticisms are as ancient as philosophy itself. They are the sort of thing which thinkers in every century have tended to say about the philosophers of their own times. Maybe the 20th century is not so very different from what came before. Philosophy is always liable to look trivial and misguided until it is old and seen through spectacles fogged by nostalgia for some past age of intellectual greatness. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But an even larger obstacle to any proper appraisal of present-day thinking in the English-speaking world is often sheer unfamiliarity. Today's philosophy is much abused but little understood. For a fairer view, it may help to take a closer look at the thinkers with whom 20th-century philosophy began. The story opens as a tale of two cities: Cambridge and Vienna. In 1898, a Cambridge mathematician, Bertrand Russell, fell under the sway of a classicist, G.E.Moore. Both men had turned to philosophy, and Moore was aghast at what he found. He could barely believe that the Hegelians who then dominated the British scene meant what they said. Like the honest boy in Hans Christian Andersen's tale, Moore came to the conclusion that the emperor had no clothes. "What <i>on earth </i>do you mean by that?", he would gasp incredulously in discussions. He wrote that the disagreements which had dogged philosophy "are mainly due to a very simple cause: namely to the attempt to answer questions without first discovering precisely what question it is which you desire to answer." What philosophy needed, according to Moore, was more careful analysis and fewer ridiculous statements.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Russell agreed that philosophy required a firmer footing, and when he went to a mathematical conference in Paris in 1900, he thought he had found it. There he met an Italian, Giuseppe Peano, whose work set new standards of logical rigour. Russell thought that Peano had uncovered the true nature of mathematics and had thus answered a puzzle which had baffled philosophers for centuries. This gave Russell an idea. It seemed to him that 19th-century mathematicians had resolved "many of the topics which used to be placed among the great mysteries--for example, the natures of infinity, of continuity, of space, time and motion." Perhaps philosophy could borrow their methods of analysis and finally start to make progress.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This idea was worked up in a vast tome, "The Principles of Mathematics" (1903). While writing it, Russell discovered the work of Gottlob Frege, a German mathematician, who had taken Peano's sort of work even farther. Frege tried to show that part of mathematics was really a branch of logic (and in doing so developed the mathematical logic from which today's computer languages come). Though Frege had no interest in applying his methods outside mathematics, Russell thought they could be the model for a revolution in philosophy as a whole. The "logical-analytical method", he said, amounted to "the same kind of advance as was introduced into physics by Galileo: the substitution of piecemeal, detailed and verifiable results for large untested generalities recommended only by a certain appeal to imagination." Here at last was the sort of philosophy that would not arouse Moore's incredulous gasps. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The Principles of Mathematics" unveiled key methods and tools that shaped 20th-century philosophy. One was the "theory of descriptions", which purported to solve a problem that Plato had wrestled with, namely how one can think and speak of non-existent things. The theory showed how various tricky propositions could be translated into something more perspicuous and less puzzling; it soon came to be seen as a model of how to philosophise. Even more important was the "doctrine of types", which was designed by Russell to deal with some mathematical paradoxes. It proposed a "definite set of rules for deciding whether a given series of words was or was not significant." By specifying a technical criterion of meaningfulness which mathematics had to satisfy, it eliminated the paradoxes. To some philosophers it also suggested the possibility of something broader. Perhaps there could be a general criterion of meaningfulness, which would eliminate not only mathematical paradoxes but a whole host of philosophical problems. This idea was enthusiastically taken up in Vienna. <br>
</p><p><b><b>Logical negativism</b></b><br>
In the 19th century there was a tradition in the German-speaking world of mixing physics and philosophy. Ernst Mach, one of the main influences on Einstein, was an early example. This tradition was the foreign soil in which Russell's "logical-analytical method" grew most impressively; and it was one of the later occupants of Mach's chair in Vienna, Moritz Schlick, who did the most to tend the seedlings. Schlick earned his <font size=-1>P</font>h<font size=-1>D</font> in physics under Max Planck, one of the founders of quantum theory; then he turned to more philosophical matters. In 1918 he published a study of knowledge which aimed at "correctly interpreting the achievements of the sciences". It sought not only to analyse scientific results, but also to philosophise in accordance with a scientific method. This was philosophy in Russell's style, and with many references to Russell. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet Schlick and his colleagues soon added a twist of their own. In 1924 Schlick founded "the Vienna Circle for the Dissemination of the Scientific Outlook", a discussion group whose members were mainly scientists and mathematicians. By the early 1930s, the group had formed alliances with like-minded thinkers in Berlin, Poland, the Netherlands and Scandinavia. They called their approach to knowledge "logical positivism", though in fact it was rather negative as far as philosophy was concerned. "All real problems are scientific ones," wrote Schlick, "there are no others". What used to be called "philosophical problems" were fated to disappear. Some of them would be "shown to be mistakes and misunderstandings of our language and the others will be found to be ordinary scientific questions in disguise."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to the positivists, there was to be a strict division between all-conquering science and the dwindling ancillary discipline of philosophy. Philosophy could talk about the meanings of statements, but it was up to science to decide if these statements were true. The most useful thing philosophers could do was pack up awkward bits of intellectual furniture so that the scientific removal-men could come and take them away.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Russell disagreed. Philosophy was "more critical and more general" than science, but not radically different from it. He wanted to apply scientific methods of analysis to some of the ancient problems of philosophy, not to abolish that venerable discipline. As we shall see, Russell's approach won out in the end. But several other things happened first.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Inspired partly by the success of Russell's "doctrine of types" in mathematics, the positivists tried to wield a mighty axe called the Verification Principle. This was supposed to provide a general criterion of meaningfulness for all statements of fact, and any which did not meet it were condemned as nonsense. Whatever was empirically unverifiable had to go, so it was farewell to most of traditional philosophy--and much else. This negative aspect of the Vienna Circle's doctrine owed much to their reading of the "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus", which had been published by Ludwig Wittgenstein, a former pupil of Russell's, in 1921.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Bewitched-genstein</b></b><br>
In fact, Wittgenstein had less in common with the positivists than they thought. Russell, too, interpreted Wittgenstein's work in his own slanted way. Everyone had his own version of Wittgenstein in those days, and the only point of agreement was that Wittgenstein was a genius.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Wittgenstein was the offspring of one of Europe's mightiest industrial barons. In 1908 he left his native Austria to fly kites in Derbyshire, for aeronautical research, and then went to Manchester to study engineering. He became interested in the work of Frege and Russell and came to Cambridge to study under Russell in 1911. After a short period during which he thought that Wittgenstein was mad, Russell soon came to the conclusion that he would shortly be eclipsed by his pupil. Wittgenstein's criticisms of some of Russell's work on mathematical logic were brilliantly penetrating; his views on logic were powerfully original. Russell and Moore thought that the next breakthroughs in philosophy would come from Wittgenstein. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Neither of them realised just how unusual Wittgenstein's agenda was. Russell and Moore held that the job of philosophy was to analyse the world, but Wittgenstein believed that its job was to analyse language. Most philosophy, he maintained, is fuelled by a dangerous temptation to transgress the limits of language and say the unsayable. Proper philosophy should instead offer a "critique of language", which would reveal these limits and then maintain a dignified silence.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, Wittgenstein was vehemently opposed to the optimism and scientific spirit of Russell. "I have no sympathy for the current of European civilisation and do not understand its goals," he later wrote. It was a delusion, Wittgenstein believed, to think that science and industry could solve man's problems. To philosophise in a scientific spirit--as Russell and the positivists did in their various ways--was a symptom of this delusion. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Wittgenstein left Cambridge in 1913 and returned 16 years later. In between, he fought in the first world war, wrote his "Tractatus", gave away his fortune, spent six years as a village school-teacher, designed a house for his sister and met a few members of the Vienna Circle. By the time he came back to Cambridge in 1929, he was evolving a new, therapeutic conception of his "critique of language". The Oxford movement that came to be called "ordinary-language philosophy", and had its heyday from the late 1940s to the early 1960s, was influenced by this new approach.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to Wittgenstein's revised outlook, philosophical problems are to be solved "by looking into the workings of our language . . . not by giving new information, but by arranging what we have always known. Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence . . ." The main cause of this alleged bewitchment was language, though it was not the only cause. Another was people's "craving for generality". A third was scientism--that is, a misplaced confidence in purely scientific ways of thinking. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The new therapy was supposed to work by examining what people say and thereby revealing the rich diversity of linguistic behaviour. Appreciating this diversity would prevent us from falsely assimilating one "language-game" to another. Wittgenstein had read very little of the philosophy of previous centuries, but he was convinced that this sort of thing was relevant to it. For example, his linguistic therapy showed (or so he thought) that it was a mistake to look for some sort of proof of the existence of physical objects, as many philosophers since Descartes had done. To try and provide such a proof revealed a misunderstanding of how we use words such as "know". We cannot meaningfully question the existence of physical objects, so we should not speak of "demonstrating" their existence either. The language-game of "proof" could not be played in this context.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Much of Wittgenstein's therapy concerned the way people talk about mental states. It was this topic which produced some of the best-known work of the Oxford school. Gilbert Ryle's "The Concept of Mind", which sought to exorcise "Descartes's myth" of "the ghost in the machine", is one example. It argued that to talk about human intelligence and consciousness was, in effect, to talk about publicly observable behaviour, not ghostly, inner events. The book's contents and approach are broadly Wittgensteinean.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Wittgenstein acknowledged that his way of doing philosophy was a radical departure. But this seemed to him to be entirely appropriate: "Why", he asked, "should philosophy in the age of airplanes and automobiles be the same as in the age when people travelled by coach or on foot?" Russell was not convinced. He accused Wittgenstein and the Oxford school of having abandoned serious intellectual work. He was not the only critic to do so.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although the Oxford men officially denied that the analysis of language provided the last word on any philosophical subject, it did seem to take up much of their time. They sometimes substituted an obsession with language for the much-derided obsession with science. (Most were trained as classicists, so they were simply doing what they knew best.) One pupil recalled handing a draft of his thesis to J.L. Austin, a leader of the school, whereupon Austin opened the file at the <dest="of" ref="page"> contents and "proceeded to spend the next three hours discussing the differences between 'contents', 'list', 'index', 'table', etc." The pupil experienced "a Zen-like illumination". But it faded in minutes.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Vienna Circle had broken up just before the second world war, and most of the top positivists from the continent emigrated to America. They had mellowed somewhat; the harsh Verification Principle had been largely abandoned by 1950. But they retained their focus on science and mathematical logic. Their continuing work had an enormous impact on American philosophy, and eventually succeeded in reinstating Russell's original conception of philosophy as a partner of science.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Russell's revenge</b></b><br>
From about the mid-1970s, the transatlantic trade in philosophy began to reverse its flow, and America became the great exporter of ideas. British philosophers went as pilgrims to America rather than vice versa. Willard Quine, a Harvard philosopher who had visited the Vienna Circle as a student, and who had worked closely with positivists and ex-positivists ever since, became the most-discussed figure among English-speaking philosophers. Quine propounded a crucial argument that helped to combat the influence of Wittgenstein and to bring philosophy and science closer together. Many people, on both sides of the Atlantic, disagree with the argument, but philosophy is now largely pursued as if it were correct.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Quine argued that the difference between matters of fact and matters of meaning is a difference of degree, not a difference of kind. "All bachelors are unmarried" is true in virtue of its meaning; "Bill Clinton is married" is true in virtue of fact. Quine developed a "holistic" philosophy of language according to which truths of fact blend into truths of meaning, so that there is no absolute distinction between the two. Because Wittgenstein, the early positivists and the Oxford analysts had all asserted that philosophy was concerned with meanings, whereas science was concerned with facts, the barriers which they erected between philosophy and science began to crumble.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As if to reflect this change, many philosophers have been mingling with psychologists, biologists, computer scientists and theoretical physicists, especially in America. Insofar as their work remains distinctively philosophical, it is so largely in Russell's sense of being "more critical and more general" than everyday scientific work. It is more likely to look askance at fundamental presuppositions and to try to relate work in different fields.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, this is a blurring of the boundaries, not a wholesale merger, and by no means all of today's philosophers specialise in questions that have much connection with any scientific research. Nevertheless, most branches of philosophy now have closer links with other subjects--political theory, economics, jurisprudence, for instance-- than they had in Wittgenstein's time. Very few philosophers now think of their subject as entirely cut off from all others. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The other big change in philosophy since Wittgenstein's day is that there is much more of it. This too has affected how it is done, and in ways that Russell would largely have approved of. According to a forthcoming study by Tom Baldwin of York University, there are now about 480 professional philosophers in Britain, compared with 122 in 1947. There are about 8,500 in America, according to the Philosophy Documentation Centre (<font size=-1>PDC</font>) in Ohio, and the number of philosophy <font size=-1>P</font>h<font size=-1>D</font>s granted in America grew from 83 in 1949-50 to 255 in 1988-89. The result is increased specialisation and the division of labour. The replacement of "large untested generalities" by detailed piecemeal results, which Russell called for, have now been delivered, partly because of changes in academic life.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But are there perhaps now too many detailed piecemeal results? The <font size=-1>PDC</font> records no fewer than 320 philosophical journals currently published in English, of which 184 are American. Privately, and unsurprisingly, many philosophers confess that not all of these outpourings are worthwhile. Yet something similar is true of all academic disciplines. The "logical-analytical method" which Russell advocated, and which the majority of English-speaking philosophers still practise in some form, has become a professional tool like any other. This is presumably what Russell would have wanted. If "analytical" philosophy really is very different from more traditional varieties, it is largely in virtue of being more professional.<br>

<h1 align=center>Latin America's backlash</h1>


AMALAISE is abroad in Latin America. In Mexico, guerrilla groups pop up in dirt-poor rural parts. Argentina's trade-unionists take to the streets against plans to cut welfare and ease labour laws. Brazil's landless clash with its trigger-happy police. Peruvians lose faith in their tough and reforming president; Ecuadoreans elect a proclaimed populist as theirs. Almost everywhere both rich and poor feel less secure, as drugs, guns and violent crime take an ever-stronger hold on the shanty towns that ring so many cities.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not all these troubles share a common cause: Colombia's guerrillas, far more numerous and nasty than Mexico's, have been active for 40 years. Yet one thread runs through them all (see <a href="sf0784.html">page</a>). A decade of democratic regimes broadly committed to low inflation, free economies and open trade has not, except in Chile, brought sustained growth; and, while laying the groundwork for that, it has both made old woes more visible and added some new ones. The region stuck to its chosen path through the buffeting of Mexico's 1994-95 currency crisis. But the rewards are still fairly meagre: it may grow by only 3% this year, and, with luck, by 4-5% next. And little of such growth as there is finds its way to the poor. For many, the wrenching changes brought by privatisation, trade opening, and monetary and fiscal prudence have meant bankruptcy, unemployment or the loss of state handouts. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So is the region on the brink of a populist or authoritarian upheaval? Probably not. There is growth, after all: both Mexico and Argentina are recovering from recession. Income distribution has improved a bit--not before time--in Brazil, with the defeat of hyper-inflation. Ecuador's president, once elected, is forgetting some of his wilder promises. In Paraguay an attempted army coup last April was quashed. A recent poll region-wide found only 27% of respondents judging their own country's democracy as working well; yet 61% still see that as the best form of government. The voices of discontent have been unable to articulate more persuasive ways forward.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet they cannot be ignored. Discontent springs from huge social needs. Sustained growth will in time do much to meet these. That means sticking firmly to market-opening. But there is much else to do on the long road from here to there. <br>
</p><p><b><b>The ways ahead</b></b><br>
The challenge is to make both governments and markets more efficient. Beneath the impressive technocrats now managing most Latin American economies, most government agencies remain what they were before: overstaffed and undercompetent bureaucratic disaster-zones. In the creation of wealth, businessmen--and especially would-be businessmen, until they too learn who best to bribe--face networks of red tape. Over-regulation of labour markets hits job-seekers. Employment taxes hit employers, workers and would-be workers alike. Speedy, honest and open civil justice is needed both to ensure the enforcement of contracts and so--perhaps even more important--the confidence that they can be enforced; in practice, nearly all courts are slow-moving and too many corrupt.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the communal use of wealth, the bureaucrats' work would often be better handled by the private sector: pensions, say, or the upgrading of infrastructure. Outright privatisation has brought a rush of capital into telecoms; private concessions can--and in some countries do--improve ports, railways and (though Mexico mishandled its attempt) busy parts of the road system. But in poor countries most of such core areas as education, health care, water and drainage will remain, unavoidably, government's job. The trouble usually is not that it spends too much, but that it provides little value for money. Many tasks now done centrally should be devolved to lower levels of government (provided, notably in Argentina and Brazil, that these are subject to fiscal discipline). Devolution can go far: some Brazilian states have handed budgets directly to schools and parents--and got better education. In partnership with government, the region's multiplying self-help community groups can improve anything from primary health care to housing to environmental protection.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alongside such practical matters, Latin America badly needs to build confidence in the institutions of public life. It is trying to combine democracy with market economics in deeply unequal societies. That can never be easy. It is made harder still by widespread, and often justified, cynicism. The immediate winners from privatisation are usually the well-off; bad enough, in the public eye, but still worse if they are also the president's cronies. Police forces and law courts will seldom be popular; much worse if everyone knows that crime will go unpunished (or be committed) because their officials can be bought. The world, rightly, will never believe in the purity of politics; but at least parties and politicians need not be left free to prove blatantly how right that cynicism is. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Habits and institutions cannot be transformed overnight: look at the opposition Mexico's president has faced in his steps away from one-party rule. Some countries' rigid constitutions, born as they rediscovered democracy but not yet market forces, make change even harder: Brazil's almost dictates bureaucratic inefficiency and fiscal laxity, while encouraging an anarchic party system that leaves law-making easy prey to special interests. But politicians and the powerful can be subjected to independent scrutiny. Outside Mexico, autonomous electoral bodies and free media have made most Latin American voting surprisingly fraud-free. The appointment of judges, enforcement of human rights, auditing of public accounts, conduct of privatisations and subsequent regulation--all can be improved by similar means. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A populist reversal of Latin America's course is far from imminent, but the malaise is real. It should put governments and politicians under notice: they must complete their macroeconomic revolution, and complement it with speedy microeconomic and institutional reform, or risk seeing their hard-won gains eroded by cynicism and discontent.<br>

<h2>Unsettling move</h2>
While Palestinians--later joined by the French government--condemned Israel's planned <b>expansions of existing settlements</b>, Binyamin Netanyahu paid a visit to one. "Not constructive," said even the State Department. Responding to Yasser Arafat's recent claim that he would proclaim a state when the "interim" stage of the peace process is due to be over, Israel's communications minister said that, if so, he himself would propose annexation of the land concerned.<p><p>
The United Nations and <b>Iraq</b> came close to agreement on activation of a deal allowing Iraq to export oil and buy food. The United States said it would not object. Iraq said it would be ready to start pumping 0.8m barrels a day. Oil prices stayed high. <p>
<b>Algerians </b>voted on November 28th on a new draft constitution. It would ban Islamist parties. They boycotted the vote and Islamist terrorist groups threatened to kill anyone who voted.<p>
Argument over military intervention in <b>Zaire</b> went on. Rwanda said its territory could not be used. Uganda said its Entebbe airport could. Canada talked of an airdrop of relief supplies; a "last resort" said <font size=-1>UNHCR</font>, the <font size=-1>UN</font> refugee agency.<p>
An <b>Ethiopian Airlines jet </b> which ran out of fuel after being hijacked, crashed in the sea off the Comoros Islands, killing 127 of the 175 people on board. Doubt remained whether the three hijackers were alive or dead.<p>
<h2>Higher and higher</h2>
A magistrate in Rome asked for Italy's centre-left prime minister, <b>Romano Prodi</b>, to stand trial for alleged abuse of office when he was chairman of a state company, <font size=-1>IRI</font>, in 1993. Italy's right-wing opposition leader, Silvio Berlusconi, also faces corruption charges.<p>
<b>French lorry drivers </b>continued their strike, and their blockades, paralysing many of the main roads in France. Neighbouring countries began to feel the effects. Danish lorry drivers protesting at a tax ruling, blockaded ports and border crossings, causing chaos in their own country.<p>
Russia's president, Boris Yeltsin, signed a decree ordering all Russian troops still in <b>Chechnya </b>to withdraw before January 27th. Communists and nationalists in parliament denounced the move and threatened a no-confidence vote.<p>
Ignoring a Russian-brokered compromise between himself and members of his parliament, <b>Belarus</b>'s authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenka, won a referendum to extend his term of office and have more power over parliament and courts.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
Croatia's president, <b>Franjo  Tudjman, </b>faced mounting pressure from his own ill-health and from demonstrators in the capital, Zagreb, who protested against the muzzling of an independent radio station.<p>
Big demonstrations in Belgrade are undermining Serbia's president, <b>Slobodan  Milosevic</b>, who had persuaded courts to overturn opposition victories in local elections. <p>
<b>Cuba </b>refused to accept a new ambassador from <b>Spain</b>, which has become less friendly to Fidel Castro since a conservative government led by Jose Maria Aznar came to power in Madrid.<p>
A reform-minded economist, <b>Gediminas Vagnorius</b>, has become prime minister of Lithuania, after the defeat of ex-communists in a general election earlier this month.<p>
<h2>APEC agrees</h2>
The 18 leaders of the <b>Asia-Pa cific Economic Co-opera tion</b> forum, meeting in the Philippines, endorsed a proposed agreement that will "substantially" free trade in information technology by the end of the decadeSouth Africa said it is to end its diplomatic ties with <b>Tai wan </b>and recognise China instead. President Mandela said recently that it would be "immoral" to drop Taiwan, which helped to pay for his election campaign, and has invested heavily in the country. But South Africa is keen to improve its trade with ChinaThe <b>Hong Kong </b>government proposed to introduce an anti-subversion law, in the hope of deterring China from passing a harsher one when it takes over the British colony in July 1997Despite protests about the contest from India's feminists, Marxists and Hindu nationalists, Miss Greece, Irene Skliva, was elected <b>Miss  World </b>in Bangalore<h2>Juice squeezed<p><p><p><p><p></h2>
<b>O.J. Simpson</b>, on the stand for the first time in his civil trial, denied "absolutely" that he killed his ex-wife, Nicole, or her friend, Ronald Goldman, in 1994. He could not, however, account for his and Nicole's blood in the Ford Bronco in which he fled from his house. <p>
The Justice Department decided that <font size=-1>FBI</font> agents should interview contributors to the Democratic National Committee in connection with <b>questionable donations</b> to this year's election campaigns.<p>
<b>Canada's </b>native peoples may get a fairer deal. In a huge report, a royal commission proposed many economic and political steps, including recognition of them as a "third order of government".<p>

<h2>A single step</h2>
The <b>Italian lira</b> re-entered Europe's exchange-rate mechanism. Finance ministers insisted on a strongish central rate of 990 lire to the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark; in subsequent trading the lira strengthened. Keen to adopt the single currency at the first stage, Italy must keep the lira in the <font size=-1>ERM</font> for two years.<p>
(See <a href="bw1.gif">chart</a>)<br><b>The pound </b>rose to its highest level in four years against the dollar, driven by hopes that British interest rates would rise. This week's pre-election budget reinforced these expectations.<p>
The Russian government showed its confidence in maintaining the value of <b>the  rouble </b>by setting an annual range for the currency against the dollar instead of the usual six-monthly band. The rouble will start 1997 in a range of 5,500-6,100 roubles to the dollar and decline to 5,750-6,350 roubles.<p>
<h2>Taking stock</h2>
<b>Union Bank of Switzer land</b>, beset by bad loans, will report its first full-year loss since the second world war and take a one-off charge of SFr3 billion ($2.3 billion), leaving it with a loss for 1996 of about SFr500m. Standard & Poor's, an American credit-rating agency, put a watch on its <font size=-1>AAA</font> rating. Like other banks hurt by Switzerland's prolonged recession, <font size=-1>UBS</font> will also restructure its domestic operations.<p>
A Detroit judge ruled that <b>General Motors </b>could pursue racketeering charges against Jose Ignacio Lopez, who is accused of taking secret documents with him when he left <font size=-1>GM</font> to join <b>Volkswagen</b>. Opel, <font size=-1>GM</font>'s subsidiary in Germany, denied reports that it was in talks with <font size=-1>VW</font> over an out-of-court settlement. Any deal, it said, would require the firing of Mr Lopez, payment for damages, and a public apology.<p>
American shares soared, taking the <b>Dow Jones </b>above 6,500 for the first time and helping seven European markets to reach new records before dropping back. Bond prices rose.<p>
<b>ABN Amro</b>, the Netherlands' largest bank, bolstered its position as the biggest foreign bank in America with a $1.95 billion purchase of Standard Federal, the mid-west's biggest savings bank.<p>
Germany unveiled a bill to improve <b>shareholders'  rights</b>. Among the proposals: companies will be allowed to buy back up to 10% of their shares; supervisory boards will be limited to 12 members; and schemes limiting shareholders' voting rights will be banned.<p>
Malaysia's overcrowded banking sector is being shaken up by a complex deal to form a huge Malaysian financial-services company. <b>Rashid Hussain</b>, a big stockbroking firm and property developer, paid M$2.16 billion ($855m) for a 75% share of Kwong Yik Bank, which will later merge with <font size=-1>DCB</font> Holdings, Rashid Hussain's banking operations.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<b>Skandia</b>, a Swedish insurance company, and <b>Stadshypotek</b>, Sweden's biggest mortgage bank, are to merge, creating a financial-services group with a market value of SKr45 billion ($6.7 billion). An angry government, whose proposed sale of its 34% stake in Stadshypotek triggered the talks (of which it was not aware), insisted its stake would go to auction.<p>
Following the lead of Japan's biggest stockbroker, Nomura Securities, which recently bailed out its lending unit, <b>Daiwa Securities</b>, the second biggest, will inject &#165;120 billion ($1.1 billion) of capital into Daiwa Finance to write off bad property loans. Other Japanese stockbrokers are likely to follow suit.<p>
Russia raised $1 billion from a debut Eurobond--twice as much as originally planned. It also agreed with the French government to pay $400m to French holders of <b>Imperial  Russian bonds</b> in default since 1917--a deal derided by the bondholders, who had claimed $30 billion.<p>
<h2>Smoke damage</h2>
<b>Eurotunnel</b> shares dived on news that the damage caused by a fire in the Channel tunnel could delay the resumption of a full rail service for months. They recovered when the company said that this would not affect its restructuring.<p>
In America's biggest gas-and-utility merger, <b>Duke Power</b>, a North Carolina electricity utility, agreed to buy <b>PanEnergy</b>, a Texan natural-gas concern, for $7.7 billion.<p>
<b>Olivetti</b>'s new boss said that his struggling company's plan to sell assets might be delayed. He gave a warning that a proposed investigation by parliament could precipitate Olivetti's closure.<p>

<h1>Gestures against reform</h1>

<p><b>In dribs and drabs, a populist reaction is gathering pace against the bold free- market reforms of Latin America</b></p><br>
BEFORE Eastern Europe, Latin America was the region that first saw the ascendancy of free-market democrats over authoritarian protectionists. In just a decade, well-educated, market-minded civilians arrived in power everywhere (bar Cuba), shoving aside the protectionists and brass-hats who had long run the place. In some countries radical free-marketeers have been in charge (Argentina, Mexico); others have been run by more gradualist reformers (Brazil, recently Chile). But everywhere, the direction of policy has been the same: to chop back the over-mighty state. And everywhere, the results have been similar: inflation is down; foreign investment is up; dictatorships are out.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet (as in much of Eastern Europe) the liberal ascendancy stopped short of triumph. And now a backlash is appearing. From the rugged sierras outside the Mexican resort of Acapulco, the People's Revolutionary Army (<font size=-1>EPR</font>) has been running a vicious bombing campaign in half a dozen states. Maximo Gomez, the priest of Atoyac de Alvarez, a scrubby town in rebel country, thinks that "90% support the guerrillas in their heart . . . if the government does not act soon, this place will explode."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rise of the <font size=-1>EPR</font> is a small but worrying part of wider regional reaction against the new generation of free-market reformers. The great expectations that accompanied their bold reforms have come crashing down. Unemployed and angry voters have looked to populists--only to find the easy solutions they profferred also disappear. The resulting disgust with all politics is coinciding with rising violence of all kinds, from guerrilla action to crime.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This rising discontent represents the greatest challenge yet faced by the continent's reformers. Chile's President Eduardo Frei seems to have got the message. Earlier this month, he got the annual summit meeting of Latin American and Iberian leaders to focus on "governability for efficient and participatory democracy". In plain English, rulers too are frustrated by the pace of reform. They are looking for new ways to encourage growth and speed up the delivery of its social benefits. Time does not seem to be on their side.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given the sweeping nature of the reforms, that is hardly surprising. For decades, Latin America was mired in state controls, bouts of hyperinflation and slump. Hope dawned in the late 1980s, when a new generation of brash, foreign-educated leaders embraced the so-called "Washington consensus", a heady mix of privatisation, financial liberalisation and trade reform which sought to balance the books and end the power of a corrupt and paternalistic state.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite bumps along the way--most notably Mexico's currency and banking troubles of 1994-95--the gains are undeniable. One is the slaying of inflation, that most insidious of taxes on the poor, which fell from a regional mean of 196% in 1991 to just 19% last year. Fiscal discipline has slashed the average budget deficit by two-thirds, from 5.5% of <font size=-1>GDP </font>in 1988 to 1.8% in 1995.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most impressive has been the embrace of freer trade. Protectionist barriers have tumbled unilaterally or as part of accords which doubled intra-regional exports to $32 billion in the five years to 1994. <font size=-1>NAFTA</font>, the North American Free-Trade Agreement, has linked Mexico with the giants to its north. In South America, Mercosur is edging Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Brazil the same way. In December 1994, Latin leaders pushed the United States and Canada to agree to negotiate a Free-Trade Area of the Americas by 2005. The opening of the region's economies has spurred exports; they grew 6% a year during the early 1990s, up from 1.8% a year during the mid-1980s.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This first wave of reform was popular, as liberalisation boosted growth. Along came an expansion of credit and a flood of cheap imports, which pleased consumers, and propelled reformers such as Peru's Alberto Fujimori and Argentina's Carlos Menem to re-election. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the reforms' popularity was based partly on unrealistic expectations. They were liked not because they laid a foundation for a far brighter future than had seemed possible during the "lost decade" of the 1980s. Rather, voters liked reform because it was accompanied by spurts of growth. Alas, these boomlets were not "the pay-off for reform", as Ricardo Hausmann of the Inter-American Development Bank (<font size=-1>IDB</font>) argues. Rather, many of them were fuelled partly or largely by one-off inflows that resulted from the return of stability. In Mexico and Venezuela short-lived booms ended in banking crises; Brazil's boom escaped that, but not by much; Argentina's was killed by sudden monetary contraction after the Mexican crisis.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fundamental economic outlook is favourable. But the poor cannot eat "fundamentals". What they see is that the region's traditionally wide gap between incomes is widening further. The reforms of the early 1990s did reduce the percentage in poverty, but population growth ensured that the absolute number soared (see <a href="sf1.gif">chart 1</a>). Real wages have fallen. Unemployment in most countries is now higher than in 1990. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reforms have not yet delivered the kind of sustained growth needed to wipe out poverty. True, the region's <font size=-1>GDP</font> grew 3.5% in 1991 after the reforms started. But growth fell to 0.8% last year after Mexico's crash. From about 3% this year, it may reach 4% next year. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not bad, but it may not be enough. Many economists reckon growth of 6% will be needed to reduce poverty as populations continue to rise. A year ago, Shahid Burki, until recently the World Bank's top Latin America man, thought regional growth might reach 6% soon. No longer. In a candid and controversial assessment, he argued that the ripple effects of the Mexican crisis have exposed the fragility of banks from Mexico to Argentina. He worries that it will take another decade to achieve a stable growth rate of 6% or so. Will voters wait that long?<br>
</p><p><b><b>Abajo neoliberalismo!</b></b><br>
The answer may be no. In recent months, the golden boys of reform--Messrs Menem and Fujimori--have seen their popularity plummet. Everywhere, polls show citizens have an exceptionally low opinion of politicians and parties (see <a href="sf2.gif">chart 2</a>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What seems to be happening is that middle-class folk are joining the backlash of the poor. A remarkable revolt took place at a recent assembly of Mexico's ever-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (<font size=-1>PRI</font>). Furious that unpopular market reforms had resulted in electoral defeats, hardliners rebelled. "Down with neo-liberalism!" rang the cries as they voted to stop privatisation and ban technocrats from high office. The public cheered the rebellion. Middle-class anger at cuts in utility and energy subsidies helped drive Venezuela's Carlos Andres Perez from office in 1993. And Nicaraguans were so disgusted with six years of <font size=-1>IMF</font>-encouraged reform that nearly 40% (on the official count) voted for the ex-Marxist Sandinists in the recent election. The Sandinists did not win the election, but the warning was plain.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This backlash may, however, bring disappointment and frustration. In Mexico, the reaction against reform was led by the dinosaurs of the <font size=-1>PRI</font>, who, if their record in office in the 1960s and 1970s is any guide, are more likely to stuff their pockets once in power than to help the poor.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In more pluralistic countries, the backlash is no more likely to lead to leftward policy shifts. By and large, the Latin left has failed in opposition. Alvaro Vargas Llosa, the son of Mario Vargas Llosa, a Peruvian writer and defeated presidential candidate in 1990, explains why in a controversial book, "The Idiot's Guide to Latin America". The left, he says, blames the <font size=-1>CIA</font>, multinational companies and the <font size=-1>IMF</font> for the region's woes. Leftist leaders have not come up with any coherent alternative to the prevailing free-market agenda.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Old-style populists are no better at defusing voters' discontent, though for a different reason. Venezuela's Rafael Caldera portrayed himself as an outsider who would end unpopular reforms; he won in 1993. In Ecuador, the populist to end all populists, Abdala Bucaram, swept into office last July with a campaign featuring rock <font size=-1>CD</font>s, strippers and pork-barrel politics. Yet in office both returned to their senses. Mr Caldera is now implementing <font size=-1>IMF</font>-style reforms, while Mr Bucaram has taken advice from Domingo Cavallo, the architect of Argentina's reforms. Presidents Menem and Fujimori both traversed a similar path. <br>
</p><p><b><b>Enter the caveman</b></b><br>
The resulting victory of sound policies over populism is good news for the economy. It may give the policy reforms a little more time to work. But if so, the extra time may be bought at the expense of further political disillusion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Guerrilla insurgencies, which many thought would subside with the Central American civil wars of the 1980s, are back. Colombia, where peace had seemed not far out of reach a year ago, has seen guerrillas unleash attacks of such fury that some compare the past few months to the early days of <i>la violencia</i>, the terrible civil war of the 1950s which claimed nearly 300,000 lives. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Colombia is the worst case but not the only one. Peru's Shining Path has shown, through recent horrific attacks, that the capture of Abimael Guzman, its mastermind, has not dealt it a death blow. Mexico has both the telegenic masked Zapatists and the <font size=-1>EPR</font>, the "cavemen of the left", as Denise Dresser, a Mexican political scientist calls them, roaming the countryside.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is easy to dismiss this--as some officials do--as merely a tale of bandits in remote regions. Certainly, guerrilla violence is nothing like as bad as it was in the 1960s and 1970s. Nor are guerrillas any longer the proxy warriors of a cold war fought in Uncle Sam's backyard. Yet if their ideology does not amount to much, their willingness to resort to violence does. For guerrilla activity is just part of a much broader escalation of violence. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nearly every city in Latin America is more dangerous today than it was ten years ago, before the reforms began. The region's murder rate, already six times the world average, is surging (see <a href="sf3.gif">chart 3</a>). Kidnappings are rife; half of all the world's abductions take place in Colombia, where rich and poor pay a combined total ransom of $100m a year to get their loved ones back. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The root causes of violence are complex, ranging from drug trafficking and consumption to income inequality, mega-cities without services, and corrupt police and courts. But, according to Luis Ratinoff of the <font size=-1>IDB</font>, discontent with the political order has contributed to the recent spurt in violence. He thinks that the demise of traditional purveyors of hope--from radical clergymen to Utopian parties and trade unions-- means that those frustrated by the reforms may be more willing to resort to violence. Even in Mexico, traditionally one of the region's more peaceful countries, a poll by a daily newspaper, <i>Reforma</i>, showed that nearly a third of the population believes armed violence is justified.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Institutional breakdown</b></b><br>
Contributing to this strain on the rule of law is the weakness of institutions. With few exceptions, courts are inefficient and corrupt; in many countries, policemen and former policemen engage in murder.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The spiral of violence has produced a spiral of spending on private security, which often contributes to more crime, as private armies turn into paramilitary squads. All told, the region spends an astonishing 13-15% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> on security expenses (both private and public). That is more than total welfare spending. It represents a crippling burden on the economy. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rich and the middle classes may be able to afford this for a while. But the poor cannot. They are turning to mob justice. In the past few months, there have been televised lynchings of suspected criminals by villagers in Ecuador, Mexico and Guatemala.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Frightened by the violence, governments are calling in the military. The army has been given special powers in chunks of Colombia. Several Mexican states have a heavy military presence. Over a dozen of Peru's departments have been under army rule for years. One of Mr Bucaram's first acts as president was to give the Ecuadorian army a role in public security. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One worry is that these armies may not be under full civilian control. In Chile, General Augusto Pinochet today cannot be sacked by the civilian president. In Venezuela, the soldiers who launched two bloody coup attempts in 1992 have been granted a pardon. In Paraguay, a seditious general nearly toppled the civilian government earlier this year. By and large, though, the threat is not (at least, not now) the old Latin American one of the <i>caudillo</i>, the army strongman. It is that, in dealing with security problems, too many armies think they can do more or less as they like.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Civilian rulers, in short, are failing to strike a balance between democracy and efficiency--and the answer, some people think, is to have less democracy. "Right or wrong," says Peter Hakim of Inter-American Dialogue, a think-tank, "the public blames democracy for the current outbreaks of criminal violence." Some technocrats are beginning to wonder whether too much democracy is a reason why reforms have been so slow to bear fruit.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Peru and Argentina, presidents have got the constitution changed to allow themselves immediate re-election. The presidents of Brazil and Ecuador are thinking about following suit. There are arguments for this trend, which is anyway very different from the old military authoritarianism. Civilians are still in charge and are still submitting themselves to the test of electoral opinion. Nevertheless, in the context of widespread discontent, growing violence, and military rule in some areas, there are risks. The consequence may well be to shift attention away from the painstaking business of building up institutional democratic bulwarks (political parties, the courts, an accountable civil service) and towards the personalisation of power.<br>
</p><p><b><b>A Santiago consensus</b></b><br>
If that danger is to be avoided, some policy shifts may well be needed. John Williamson, formerly of the Institute for International Economics, muses that a powerful president may be best for governability and growth. That is remarkable coming from the father of the Washington consensus, whose followers have tried to get the state out of almost everything. He now says: "Policy needs to shift from cutting back a state that had become bloated to strengthening a number of key state institutions whose efficient functioning is important for rapid and/or equitable growth." Call this policy shift the Santiago consensus:<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>Strengthen the state.</b> In their zeal to end the overbearing state, some reformers fear they went too far. Devolution of central power can allow local elites to derail reform. It is clear that tackling profligate state governors in Brazil and Argentina, or drug barons in Mexico or Colombia, requires a strong president. <br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>Heighten supervision</b>. Privatisation and deregulation have sometimes ended in corruption or corporate crisis. Mr Williamson recommends the setting up of institutions similar to America's Securities and Exchange Commission to improve supervision. Many argue for independent central banks. <br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>Bolster institutions</b>. Disregard for the law has made reform of the judiciary and police essential. Already, America's <font size=-1>US AID</font> is helping train new police forces in Haiti and El Salvador. The World Bank is helping overhaul Venezuela's secretive and inefficient judicial system. <br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>Target social spending where it is  most needed.</b> Latin America spends more of its <font size=-1>GDP </font>on social services than the Asian tigers, but lags behind in standards of primary education and basic public health. A main reason, suggests the <font size=-1>IDB</font> in its new annual report, is that social spending is run by centralised bureaucracies which are corrupt. It argues that local governments and non-governmental agencies should be permitted to provide social services. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given the populist backlash, the authoritarian temptations and the economic obstacles ahead, can Latin America stick with market reforms and democracy? Paul Krugman, an eminent American economist, argued last year that the zeal for reform "may usefully be thought of as a sort of speculative bubble" and that Mexico's crisis marked the beginning of its deflation.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That may be too pessimistic. Latin American leaders, at any rate, seem determined to stay the course, if only because their room for manoeuvre is restricted both by financial markets and the glare of publicity (in Mexico, <font size=-1>NAFTA</font> and the American television spotlight it throws on the country was a big reason why the army did not try to crush the Zapatists).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In short, the most likely outcome of the strains and stresses of reform remains a long, hard slog towards stable growth. A shift towards new ways of maintaining a social safety net could help calm the violent backlash and recoup some of the support for reform free-marketeers once enjoyed. Even then, it will not be easy. Sebastian Edwards of the University of California, Los Angeles puts it this way: being a reformer in Latin America is rather like running up a down escalator: you have to keep running to stand still.<br>

<h1>The great O.J. replay</h1>

<font size=1>LOS ANGELES</font><p>
TWO and a half years after the murder, and 13 months after an extraordinarily protracted criminal trial had found him not guilty, O.J. Simpson finally took the witness stand on November 22nd. His testimony was the central act in a civil case brought against Mr Simpson by the victims' families for the "wrongful deaths" of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman outside Nicole's house. Deeply familiar as the story is, the case has lost none of its power to transfix, divide and unite Americans. Even though the judge has barred cameras from the courtroom, Mr Simpson is once again the talk of every bar-room and dinner-table in the country. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Simpson case touches on three great American obsessions: celebrity, crime and, above all, race. Johnnie Cochran, Mr Simpson's leading lawyer in the criminal case, deliberately made race, rather than murder, the subject of that trial. He made sure that the majority of jurors were black women, since it had been suggested that black women were even more likely than black men to believe that Mr Simpson was innocent. And he painted Mr Simpson, who had hitherto moved almost exclusively in white society, as a victim of racial oppression.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Cochran's tactics even included redecorating Mr Simpson's house before a visit by the jury, substituting pictures of his relatives for those of his white girlfriends and hanging a copy of Norman Rockwell's painting, "The Problem We All Live With", in which a black girl walks to school surrounded by federal marshals, outside his bedroom. And he accused the Los Angeles Police Department of a large-scale conspiracy to frame a black hero. The result was that, when the verdict came, the nation was sharply divided on racial grounds, with blacks regarding the outcome as a vindication and whites seeing it as a travesty of justice.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The civil trial differs from the criminal trial in four important ways. Mr Simpson will lose his fortune rather than his freedom if he is found guilty. The proceedings are less skewed towards the defendant: the burden of proof is not quite so heavy, and the judge does not have to bend quite so far to protect his rights. The majority of the jury are white rather than black women. And Mr Simpson (who exercised his constitutional right not to testify in the previous trial) has no choice but to take the stand.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His appearance there sent the media into a frenzy. The big news networks employed teams of tame academics and lawyers and produced regular updates throughout the day. The E! channel (which specialises in celebrity trivia) tried to make up for the ban on cameras in court by putting on nightly dramatisations of the proceedings. On talk radio, the talk is of little else; newspapers and magazines are once again filling up with details about Ford Broncos, bloodied gloves and Italian shoes. The media have virtually mounted an assault on the Santa Monica courthouse, masterminded from a mass of news-trucks nicknamed "Camp O.J.", and would-be spectators arrive at four in the morning to compete in a lottery for courtroom seats. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the three days he had him on the stand, Daniel Petrocelli, the plaintiffs' leading lawyer, subjected Mr Simpson to a blitz of scornful, rapid-fire questions, intended as much to rile him into losing his temper as to expose weaknesses in his argument. Addressing him as "sir", but in a voice tinged with contempt, he once got so close to Mr Simpson that he had to be asked to step back. Mr Simpson stood up well to this barrage, keeping his temper under control, speaking in a clear, emphatic voice and, after a shifty start, making eye-contact with the jury. Yet after three days of questioning his position was weakened.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Simpson admitted he had no idea how the victims' blood ended up in his car and house, or how his own blood turned up at the crime scene. (His lawyers will no doubt offer some explanation as the trial progresses.) He also admitted that he had no idea how he got a deep gouge on his hand on the day of the murders. He swore that he had never hit, struck or slapped his ex-wife. But Mr Petrocelli placed an enlarged photograph of Nicole's bruised and beaten face on the wall behind Mr Simpson, and reminded him that he had entered a plea of no contest to a charge of battering her in 1989. Mr Simpson denied retrieving a "Dear John" telephone message from a girlfriend on the night of the murder. But Mr Petrocelli produced telephone bills proving that he had listened to the message.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Petrocelli's aim is, first, to persuade the jury that if Mr Simpson can lie about hitting his wife or receiving telephone calls from his mistress, he can also lie about murder; and, second, to provide an explanation of why he acted as he did. He is trying to present him as a jealous and abusive husband who finally cracked in May 1994, when Nicole made it clear that she no longer wanted to see him and returned a $6,000 birthday present.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Petrocelli succeeded in introducing three new pieces of evidence. The first was the fact that, shortly after his arrest, Mr Simpson's defence team had given him a polygraph test and produced a score so dismal as to suggest "extreme deception". The second was a telephone conversation with the police during the famous slow-motion car chase in 1994. Mr Simpson told the police (whom he later accused of framing him) that "I know you're doing a good job" and said that "No one's going to be hurt. I'm the only one that deserves it." The third was a photograph of Mr Simpson wearing Bruno Magli shoes--the type of rare, expensive shoes that left footprints at the scene of the crime. Mr Simpson has always denied owning such "ugly-ass shoes" and maintains that the photograph is a fake.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The dynamics of the civil trial are turning out to be very different from those of its predecessor. The plaintiffs have learned the importance of keeping things concise and focused: they are likely to make their case in six weeks, compared with the six months the prosecution took in the criminal trial. The judge, Hiroshi Fujisaki, has added to this businesslike atmosphere. Nicknamed the "anti-Ito" because he is as intolerant of rambling as his predecessor was indulgent of it, he dismissed a juror on November 26th because she passed a favourable comment on a tie worn by a member of the prosecution team.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More important still, he has done his best to keep the race card out of the trial. He has forbidden the defence to harp on about the testimony of Mark Fuhrman, a former detective whose unrelated remarks about "niggers" did much to scupper the criminal trial, or to indulge in "far-fetched hypothesising" about racist conspiracies. This will make it hard for the defence to argue, as it did in the criminal case, that Mr Simpson is the victim of an anti-black plot. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The biggest worry about the trial is not that the judge is ruling out important evidence, but that Mr Simpson is being subjected to double jeopardy. Critics argue that, after two and a half years of non-stop commentary on the subject, no jury will be able to come to a fair verdict on Mr Simpson, particularly as so many of the leading commentators have proclaimed that the criminal trial was a travesty of justice. But against the fear of double jeopardy should be set the fact that a growing number of high-profile cases are now going to a second trial, simply because the first trials were ruined by a mixture of racial politics, media pressure and courtroom charisma.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the Rodney King case, four police officers were acquitted of beating up a black motorist because the case was tried before an all-white jury, and because one of the accused policemen, Stacey Koon, put up a compelling performance. A jury failed to convict the Menendez twins of murdering their parents--despite the fact that they admitted to killing them--because their lawyer selected the jurors carefully and played on their emotions like a master. But charismatic performances are difficult to repeat, and moving a trial to another district can make it harder to play the race card. In a legal system that is being distorted by race and celebrity, perhaps it takes a little double jeopardy to remind Americans that judicial procedure is a serious thing.<br>

<h1>Where are they now?</h1>

<font size=1>LOS ANGELES</font><p>
AS THE second Simpson trial gathers pace, we catch up on the careers of the leading players in the first: <ul><p>
<b>The "dream team" of defence lawyers</b> has broken up.<b> Johnnie Cochran </b>thrives, trotting the world giving lectures on civil rights and appearing endlessly on radio and television. He is the author of "Journey to Justice", and his legal career booms. <b>Robert Shapiro </b>has tried to reintegrate himself into the white world of west Los Angeles. His recent book, "The Search for Justice", elaborates his thesis that "not only did we play the race card, we dealt it from the bottom of the deck." The two men no longer talk.<p>
<b>Marcia Clark</b>, the leading prosecutor, received a $4m advance for a book on the trial. This is believed to be the third-biggest non-fiction advance in publishing. <br>
<b> </b><br>
<b>Lance Ito, </b>the judge, continues to try cases. His second most famous case also ended in disaster: a federal judge overturned the conviction in California of Charles Keating, a financier involved in the S & L debacle of the 1980s, because Judge Ito instructed the jury erroneously.<p>
<b>Kato Kaelin</b>, the house-guest whose name became synonymous with freeloading, has acquired a fan club and become a talk-show star. To judge from his evidence in the current trial, he has also learned how to use verbs. <p>
The <b>Ford Bronco</b> has been put up for auction, but was priced too high and attracted no bidders.</ul><br>

<p><b>The economy</b></p>
<h1>Consuming passion</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><p>
THE Thanksgiving turkey digested, Americans perform a favourite rite: they go shopping. The day after Thanksgiving marks the beginning of the retailers' holiday season, the busiest shopping day of the year. But are Americans today in the mood to consume?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Much hangs on the answer to this question. After spending furiously during the first half of the year, consumers suddenly held back over the summer. Since consumer spending--on everything from cars to haircuts--makes up around two-thirds of overall demand, the result was a sharp slowing in the economy's pace. According to the Commerce Department's latest estimate, released on November 27th, America's <font size=-1>GDP</font> rose by an annualised 2% between July and September, well below the booming 4.7% of the second quarter. Were it not for a sizeable rise in business inventories, the growth rate would have slipped further. Whether this was simply a much-needed moderation of pace or the beginning of a more marked slowdown depends a great deal on what American consumers do over the next few months. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are several reasons to expect consumption to recover. Unemployment remains extraordinarily low, and real incomes are rising strongly. Wall Street is also behaving spectacularly: the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen 8% since the election alone, and is up 70% since the beginning of last year (see <a href="fn6502.html">page</a>). Higher share prices make shareholders feel richer, and perhaps inclined to spend more. In the past two years the soaring stockmarket has added more than $2.3 trillion to household portfolios. Although most of these shares are held by the richest, millions of ordinary Americans now have mutual funds and retirement accounts. A boom on Wall Street could therefore affect consumption more than it used to.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, people say they are confident. The two indices of consumer confidence most closely watched by economists both show Americans feeling bouncy. The Michigan index of consumer sentiment, released earlier in November, has hit its highest level since 1986. The Conference Board survey on consumer confidence (see <a href="am1.gif">chart</a>) shows that Americans are more upbeat about current business conditions than at any time in the 1990s, although they are slightly more worried about the future. Put these factors together, the optimists argue, and you will get exactly the kind of moderate rise in consumption the economy needs for "Goldilocks growth"--not too fast and not too slow. Although the actual fourth-quarter <font size=-1>GDP</font> growth figures may look anaemic as firms reduce some unwanted inventory, the stage will be set for the expansion to continue into the indefinite future.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not everyone shares that view. Pessimists point to the fact that consumers are heavily indebted and the growth of new consumer credit has been slowing. Both factors might suggest that Americans will save rather than spend more. This analysis is right, to a point. Total household debt (including mortgages and other consumer credit) now amounts to 84 cents out of every dollar of after-tax personal income, the highest level ever. More important than the stock of debt is the burden of servicing it. Measured correctly this, too, is high. For example, many Americans now lease their cars rather than buying them. Including car-lease payments as well as car-loan instalments brings total household debt service to 18 cents out of every dollar of income, about the same as it was at its peak in 1989. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Less clear, however, is how far all this debt will weaken consumption. Debts have been rising for some time, but did little to dampen demand earlier this year. A greater risk is that consumption may rebound too strongly, pushing the economy to grow too quickly. Any sign of rapid acceleration or whiff of inflation might prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, a move some people had expected in September. That is something that financial markets and most Americans have stopped worrying about. They may come to regret that.<br>

<h1>The ghosts at the EMU feast</h1>

<font size=1>BRUSSELS</font><p>
<p><b>The lira's re-entry into the exchange-rate mechanism has increased the  chances that most of the European Union's countries may join a single cur rency on January 1st 1999. But pitfalls still strew the path</b></p><br>
IT WAS just like old times. A Saturday summons of monetary officials to Brussels, a row, then a tortured finance ministers' negotiation that ran almost until the markets reopened on Monday. It could have been any of the myriad realignments of Europe's exchange-rate mechanism in the 1980s and 1990s. This time, however, it was a case of readmitting, not devaluing, a currency: the Italian lira, which was ejected by the system, along with the British pound, in September 1992. Surely this should have been a matter for celebration. So why the row?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the answers to that question are to be found some hard truths, not about the <font size=-1>ERM</font>, but about Europe's prospective passage towards its single currency, the euro. The ostensible argument over the weekend of November 23rd-24th concerned the lira's parity. Italy, whose economy has flourished since its currency fell from its old <font size=-1>ERM</font> central rate of 802 lire to the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark, wanted the new parity to be fixed no stronger than 1,000. It expected the French, who say they have suffered badly from what they call Italy's earlier "competitive devaluation", to fight for a stronger lira. In the event, it was the Germans who fought harder--but settled for a central rate of 990.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since <font size=-1>ERM</font> currencies can now fluctuate by as much as 15% either side of their central rates, this will make little practical difference--which is why the French were quite relaxed. The Germans, however, had a different agenda. They wanted to stress publicly how strict they would be, not just about the <font size=-1>ERM</font> but, more importantly, about the single currency. After the deal was done, the president of Germany's Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, swiftly made plain that although Italy had now rejoined the <font size=-1>ERM</font>, its qualification for the single currency was far from assured.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Tietmeyer has reasons to worry. When the Maastricht treaty was negotiated in 1991, the Germans insisted on tough criteria to ensure that countries seeking to join the new currency should have low inflation rates, low long-term interest rates, stable exchange rates within the <font size=-1>ERM</font>, and low public-sector deficits and debt. For a while, it seemed that such rules would narrow the starting cluster to the Benelux countries, Austria, Germany, France and perhaps Ireland--and even that would have required a flexible interpretation of the debt criterion for the Irish and the Belgians.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More recently the picture has changed. Earlier this month the European Commission forecast that no fewer than 12 of the Union's 15 countries--that is, all except Britain, Italy and Greece--might, broadly, meet the Maastricht criteria in 1997 (see <a href="eu1.gif">chart</a>), including the toughest one of all, the ceiling for budget deficits at 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>. Since then both Italy and, this week, Britain have put forward budgets that they claim will bring them below the 3% ceiling. With Finland and Italy both now inside the <font size=-1>ERM</font>, only Sweden, Britain and Greece could be said not to comply with the exchange-rate criterion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such a rapid change has seemed incredible to many, notably the Germans, who dismissed the commission's forecasts as over-optimistic and complained that the 1997 budgets of several countries included a host of one-off measures and dodgy accounting fiddles. Most striking are: France's plan to count a one-time transfer of cash from France T&eacute;l&eacute;com to the government, which in turn will take on the company's pension liabilities; Spain's tactic of using privatisation receipts to pay for losses in other state-owned industries; and Italy's planned "euro tax", which is to be partially refunded in future years.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The sums involved are significant: the France T&eacute;l&eacute;com ploy is worth 0.5% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> and the euro tax 0.6%. Sceptics also point to a report of the European Monetary Institute, the precursor of a European central bank, which was published the same day as the commission forecasts and asserted that "progress in fiscal consolidation has generally been too slow." The <font size=-1>EMI</font>, much less bullish than the commission, noted that in 1996 only four countries' budget deficits were below the 3% limit.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the commissioner for monetary affairs, shrugs off such criticisms. The reason that so many countries' figures cluster conveniently close to the 3% ceiling, he says, is that governments have made heroic efforts to get them there. As for the one-off measures, controversial ones have to be approved by the independent European statistical office (run by a Frenchman). In any case, when it comes to its evaluation early in 1998, the commission will, he promises, look not just at actual figures for 1997 but also at forecasts for 1998 before opining on which countries have "durably converged" and should thus qualify for the currency.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All the same, the process of choosing, in early 1998, which countries should join the new currency will be fraught. The Maastricht treaty provides that a European Council of heads of government must decide, country by country. The council may be guided by the treaty criteria, by the commission's recommendations or even by the opinions of the European Parliament; but in the end each decision will be taken by qualified majority vote. With Britain, which may well opt out of the single currency, in the chair, the task of assembling the necessary majorities will be delicate. The whole exercise could degenerate into ugly political horse-trading, with a risk of court challenges to follow. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given the uncertainties of all this, and in particular the risk (as they see it) that Italy and Spain might be let in, it is not surprising that the Germans are insisting so fiercely on a "stability pact" that would, they hope, prevent participants in the single currency from borrowing excessively. They want the pact to provide for sanctions, including fines of up to 0.5% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>, to be applied automatically; and they want "exceptional circumstances" that could justify a temporary deficit of more than 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> to be tightly defined in advance.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The commission and most other member states, though they accept the principle of a stability pact, want it to be less rigorous. This argument looks unlikely to be resolved before next month's European Council meeting in Dublin, and maybe not even then. It has been complicated by a row in Britain over parliamentary scrutiny of pact documents--even though the pact will apply only to members of the new currency, and the council has agreed that countries not in the single currency do not have to rejoin a revamped <font size=-1>ERM</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But other ghosts loom. Many people in many <font size=-1>EU</font> countries are still queasy about the whole project. A recent opinion poll in Germany found only 21% favouring a single currency as soon as 1999. The French are a bit keener than the Germans, but worries linger and the franc is under pessure again. <br>
</p><p><b><b>Watch that franc</b></b><br>
Recently Val&eacute;ry Giscard d'Estaing, a former president, called for a weaker franc to help fight unemployment. In fact, the franc is probably not overvalued. Over the past eight years, French unit labour costs have risen more slowly than those in the rest of Europe. French unemployment, as elsewhere in Europe, owes more to excessive labour-market regulation than to a strong franc. More arguable are fears that the euro itself could become overvalued against the dollar, especially if central banks around the world switch some of their reserves out of dollars and into euros.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet, as Mr de Silguy observes, the strength of the euro will depend largely on financial markets, not government intervention. Indeed, there may yet be concerns about the confidence of the markets in the single currency--and in the untried European central bank. This week the European Parliament endorsed the choice of Wim Duisenberg, who has won a good name as boss of the Dutch central bank, as the new bank's prospective head. But even he may find it hard to cope with the long transition from 1999 to 2002, when the euro will exist alongside national currencies--giving the markets plenty of time to test the commitment of governments, especially Germany's, to the single currency.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a speech in Dublin this week, Jacques Santer, the commission's president, declared that the single currency was now an irreversible project and that the euro would definitely begin on January 1st 1999. He denounced scares about the euro--such as claims that some countries in the single currency might be forced to pay for others' unfunded pension liabilities--as so many "ghosts" that should not be believed in.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The betting is getting stronger that the euro will be born on time, little more than two years from now. But, despite Italy's <font size=-1>ERM</font> move this week, it is still questionable whether the new currency will manage to embrace the lira or the peseta in the first round. And enough genuine spectres still lurk that might spoil the currency feast.<br>

<h1>Fissiparous fortunes and  family feuds</h1>

<font size=1>HONG KONG</font><p>
<p><b>As Asia's business empires have grown and diversified, many have begun to  hit the limits of the founding family's ability to manage. But for the moment,  family squabbles are just as likely to split them as business logic</b></p><br>
FAMILIES are the bedrock of Asian business. Paternalistic firms have carefully cultivated their personal connections, darted into every business opportunity and amassed some of the world's largest fortunes by assembling some of the world's most convoluted conglomerates. But as competition increases, the pressures for change are growing. From South Korea to Indonesia, Asian families are now thinking about restructuring their empires. Some have already begun.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A spate of listings on Hong Kong's roaring stockmarket has shown that some of the region's businessmen are now willing to split up their conglomerates. In October New World Development, a listed property, hotels and telecoms giant controlled by the Cheng family, floated off a separate company called New World Infrastructure. Its shares have soared and the Chengs are now considering listings for a construction firm and also for their property business in China.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Are the Chengs simply cashing in on a bull market? No, says Henry Cheng, the group's managing director. The intention is to give subsidiaries managerial and financial independence, allowing New World Development to concentrate on what he describes as its "core activity", investing in the Hong Kong property market.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other Hong Kong tycoons are thinking in this way. On November 29th Citybus, one of the more profitable bus companies in the colony, will be spun off from <font size=-1>CNT</font>, a listed firm controlled by the Tsui family, who aim to concentrate more on expanding their large but loss-making paint business. In December, the family owners of Tem Fat Hing Fung, a big listed jewellery maker and property developer, will obtain a separate listing for their gold-bullion business. They believe that splitting the company will make it simpler for investors to understand (see <a href="wb8480.html">page</a>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Interest in restructuring and reducing the portfolio of family businesses has spread to Taiwan, too, according to Chu Tian-cho of the Hong Kong office of McKinsey, a firm of management consultants. One reason companies hesitate, says Mr Chu, is that they dread making workers redundant. In a family-run firm, both workers and owners tend to assume that jobs are guaranteed for life. Families hate being seen to abandon that guarantee. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even South Korea's conglomerates, known as the <i>chaebol</i>, have begun spinning off subsidiaries. On November 20th Hyundai listed its electronics division, one of the world's biggest producers of memory chips. It followed a similar listing by the electronics division of the <font size=-1>LG</font> group. The subsidiaries of many other South Korean firms are starting to lead lives increasingly independent of their parent companies-- and even of their founding families.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the moment, though, most Asian businessmen believe the conglomerate is well suited to the region. A big group, they reckon, has more clout with governments, which in Asia still dole out many lucrative business concessions. Diversification, they add, permits a firm to take risks (and gain rewards) it might not otherwise have been able to afford. Could Samsung, they ask, have gone into the car business if it had not already been one of South Korea's biggest groups? Or could Charoen Pokphand, an enormous company from Bangkok, have become one of China's biggest foreign investors if the family-run firm had not previously diversified from chicken feed into myriad activities ranging from pot noodles to motorcycles?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Scepticism about the value of core businesses is particularly rife among the ethnic Chinese who migrated to East Asia from the mainland. They founded most of the region's largest conglomerates, and many still run the companies they created. These so-called "overseas Chinese" dominate the ranks of the region's billionaires. They control eight out of ten of Indonesia's top companies, for instance; a similar proportion of Thailand's leading firms; and numerous corporate giants in the Philippines. They are also the biggest investors in China. <br>
</p><p><b><b>Bamboo network</b></b><br>
In these businesses, the family is particularly strong. There may be a veneer of modern corporate governance, but contracts can be sealed by a handshake without a lawyer, accountant or consultant in sight. And even though parts of the family group may be listed on one or more of the region's stockmarkets, most of the really lucrative bits are still closely held. Assets are shuffled at will. Published sets of consolidated accounts are as rare as rickshaws. Harvard Business School gurus may preach that Asian conglomerates are doomed to become bit-players in the global marketplace unless they specialise in a core activity. Chinese patriarchs ignore them.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The dominance of the family endures because, whatever the gurus say, the system works--up to a point. Even the most patriarchal overseas-Chinese firm is a "fast and extremely efficient opportunity-seeking machine," says Gordon Redding, a professor of management studies at the University of Hong Kong. The firms are not burdened with bureaucracy. They have fast and inexpensive access to market intelligence and investment cash through a "bamboo network" of relatives and business contacts. Yet the limits to the family conglomerate are the size and complexity of the business it can manage. Those limits are starting to matter more.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many of Asia's business empires have begun to outgrow the ability of their founder to manage them, as they become ever more complicated to run. The need to delegate is urgent, but the patriarch is often unwilling or unable to do so; and even the largest family has only so many sons and cousins capable of managing, and only so many management slots they can usefully fill.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, it is because Chinese businesses find it so hard to separate management from ownership that they tend to avoid industries that require the complex integration of many different skills, such as car making or aerospace. These businesses require a great deal of delegation in order to encourage the talent needed to research and develop new products, organise large numbers of subcontractors and plan international marketing campaigns. There are simply too many important decisions for family members to take on their own. Although some South Korean, Malaysian and Indonesian groups have ventured into such industries (well protected by import barriers), Chinese entrepreneurs would rather stick to what Professor Redding calls "machine bureaucracies": businesses such as property, shipping, hotels, and telecoms which are easier to run.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even here, though, many of Asia's family-run conglomerates are building an internal lobby for change, as they acquire a cadre of professional, western-educated managers. More and more Asian managers, including the sons (and occasionally daughters) of the owners, have been to American business schools. South Korea's <i>chaebol</i> have recently been energetically recruiting business-school graduates, whatever their nationality. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But in the end, the main threat to Asia's family-run conglomerates may be something much more old-fashioned: succession squabbles. Sometimes, the handover goes smoothly: Anthony Salim, the youngest son of 79-year-old Liem Sioe Liong, a Chinese migrant who built Indonesia's Salim group into one of the region's biggest conglomerates, is taking charge of that empire. And in Hong Kong, even 68-year-old Mr Li Ka-shing, the colony's best-known tycoon, is talking of retiring in 1988 and handing on his flagship company, Cheung Kong, to his eldest son, Victor.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet even Asia's supposedly strong "family values" cannot guarantee that a business will survive in the same family beyond the third generation. Some may not get even that far. In Taiwan, the family that controls the country's biggest company, Formosa Plastics, is embroiled in a vicious feud. It began a year ago when the firm's elderly founder, Wang Yung-ching, banished Winston, his eldest son and heir apparent, from the company for 12 months for allegedly having an extramarital affair. The thrice-married Wang <i>p&egrave;re</i> now seems intent on extending the ban, even if it tears the firm apart. Family feuds are not something management gurus know much about.<br>

<h1>Glittering prizes</h1>

<font size=1>HONG KONG</font><p>
ONE day in 1946 Chan Muk-tim, a merchant sailor, visited a gold mine while on shore leave in South Africa. Ignoring the order to extinguish cigarettes, Chan held his cigarette, cupped, worker's style, in his palm. It took so long to reach the bottom of the shaft that the cigarette had burnt down to his fingers. If people went to such lengths to mine such small amounts of gold, he thought, it must be a commodity worth having. Three years later, he started a gold business that is now one of Asia's biggest. That business, Tem Fat Hing Fung, has been the best-performing share on Hong Kong's roaring stockmarket this year, rising fourfold in price.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now run by Chan Muk-tim's two sons, the company has thrived in the confluence of two trends. People in Asia have developed a seemingly insatiable desire to possess ever more gold. At the same time, the world's central banks are keeping more of their reserves in interest-bearing bonds. As they have dumped their unwanted gold on the market, dealers such as Tem Fat Hing Fung (the name means Bountiful Increase) have been snapping them up. "Gold", says Tem Fat's chairman, Raymond Chan, "has gone from being a trading commodity to becoming a consumer product."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Chan's ambitions do not stop at metal. Like many Hong Kong companies, Tem Fat is involved in property. A state-owned Shanghai copper company asked Tem Fat to invest in its plant. Mr Chan refused, but offered $10m for its site, bang next to a smart hotel. The copper firm used the proceeds to build a new plant on Shanghai's outskirts, and Tem Fat developed 26,000 square metres (279,860 sq feet) of prime downtown property. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That deal may partly explain the prodigious rise in the company's share price this year. Tem Fat shares are selling for 22 times current earnings, compared with around seven times earnings at the start of the year. That is hardly explained by post-tax profits, which in the year to April were flat, at HK$106m ($13.7m). Instead, the shares have been variously seen as a hedge against inflation and a cheap bet on Shanghai's property market.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Chinese property connection has worried bankers who lend to gold-bullion dealers. That is one reason its gold-bullion operations are to be floated on the Hong Kong stockmarket on December 2nd.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet with a faith that has accompanied a dozen earlier bull markets in Hong Kong, Mr Chan sees only rosy times ahead. What with Christmas and Chinese New Year sales running briskly, gold stocks in Hong Kong are reckoned to be down to just two weeks' worth of demand. And Hong Kong's return to China next year will bring a stream of new customers. But what most excites Mr Chan is the prospect of access to millions of tons of scrap jewellery lying, unused and unsold, in China. "Imagine: 50 years' worth of supply, and they don't even have a refinery."<br>

<p><b>Intel and microchips</b></p>
<h1>Squeeze, gently</h1>

<p><b>Nobody needs reminding that Microsoft dominates its markets. But it is far  from unique in that. In the first of a series on other firms that dominate differ ent parts of the high-technology business, we look at Intel</b></p><br>
INTEL, the world's largest semiconductor company, and Microsoft, the world's largest software firm, each have an extraordinary grip on the market for personal computers. Microsoft's Windows accounts for some 90% of the market for operating-system software. Thanks to the Pentium chip and its siblings, Intel accounts for about the same share of <font size=-1>PC</font> microprocessors. The two firms' core products account for the single largest chunk of the cost of most <font size=-1>PC</font>s. Combined, they sell some $25 billion-worth of their wares a year, making nearly $6 billion profit in the process.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some people lump the two companies together, dubbing them the "Wintel monopoly" (see <a href="wb1.gif">table</a>). Yet, in one crucial respect, the firms are different. For most of this decade Microsoft has been under investigation by trustbusters in America and Europe. In 1994 it settled one complaint by America's Justice Department, only to find the agency weighing in again the following year to stop it from buying Intuit, a financial-software firm. Hardly a day goes by without new calls from competitors to stop the firm's march to global domination.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Intel, on the other hand, was briefly investigated by America's Federal Trade Commission in 1992 and given a clean bill of health the next year. The trustbusters still watch it, but show no sign of intervening. Its two main competitors, Advanced Micro Devices (<font size=-1>AMD</font>) and Cyrix, dropped some lawsuits against the firm (in the face of huge legal bills) nearly two years ago, and now seem content to live on scraps from the giant's table. "We've made our peace with Intel," says an <font size=-1>AMD</font> spokesman. Most of the "Wintel" grousing is aimed at Microsoft, which is feared and loathed by many in Silicon Valley. Intel, on the other hand, is more admired than despised.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why? Intel claims that it is careful to, for example, train salesmen not to tie the sale of one generation of chip to a promise of preferred treatment with the next. But such practices are only the most obvious form of monopolistic abuse.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A more subtle concern arises when a firm with a dominant position in one market uses it to "leverage" its way into adjacent markets. Microsoft has expanded greatly from making operating systems into more general software, from its word processors and spreadsheets to entertainment and education programs. Its critics claim its success in such markets is largely due to the advantages in technology, marketing and financial clout that it gains from its dominance of operating-systems. Their constant griping is one reason why America's antitrust investigators continue to hover over the firm. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Intel, too, has spread its tentacles from its core market. Improving technology means that each new generation of chips includes many more transistors (the building blocks of digital electronics) than the previous one. To put them usefully to work, Intel has gradually folded the work of other chips into the processor. In its next-generation chips, it is building in 57 "multimedia extension" functions, which will let the processor take on other jobs, from video processing to the communications work of a modem. This will inevitably take some business away from firms that sell stand-alone chips that do the same thing.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the same time as Intel has been expanding the definition of a processor, it has also been reaching outside the chip. Three years ago it started selling its processor as part of an entire "motherboard", the guts of a <font size=-1>PC</font> (and something that <font size=-1>PC</font> makers used to produce themselves). Intel now leads the market in such boards, and even makes some complete <font size=-1>PC</font>s for other firms.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Just a chip shop</b></b><br>
So why, if Intel mimics some of Microsoft's tactics, is it not seen as such a threat to its rivals? One answer is simply that it has fewer rivals to make complaints. Software is a much easier business to enter than semiconductors. All it takes is a <font size=-1>PC</font> and a few programming skills. In contrast, making a microprocessor to rival Intel's can be a billion-dollar proposition; its competitors in this market number fewer than a dozen. Nevertheless, higher barriers to entry is normally a reason for worrying more about market dominance, not less.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So a better explanation of why competitors seem less concerned about Intel than about Microsoft boils down to ambition and motivation. Microsoft's ambitions are boundless: it has a finger in everything from office software to joysticks and keyboards, and from financial programs to games. Recently it has started a cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> news channel, a network of regional news and entertainment sites on the Internet, a virtual travel agency, and even an on-line magazine that will be printed out and distributed in coffee shops (the company, after all, is based near Seattle).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Intel, on the other hand, is still content to stick to chips, and mostly to the relatively costly processors used in <font size=-1>PC</font>s rather than the cheaper components used in video-players or other consumer-electronics devices. One reason for this caution, reckons Alex Balkansky, head of C-Cube, another semiconductor firm, is that Intel has stumbled badly before, whereas Microsoft has not. Intel started out making commodity memory chips, but was driven out of the market in the 1980s by Japanese competitors. By 1986, it was losing money. Since then, it has concentrated on top-of-the-range processors, where margins are fatter. Such other chips as it makes are used more to find work for its older manufacturing plants than to find new markets.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second difference is that Intel has largely chosen to grow not by fighting its rivals for a bigger chunk of the <font size=-1>PC</font> pie, but by expanding the pie itself. It reckons that anything it can do to help the industry sell more <font size=-1>PC</font>s will be of greater benefit to it than conquering that last sliver of the microprocessor market it does not already control. And if rivals gain more than it does from the growth, then so be it. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Microsoft, in contrast, is frequently perceived as more domineering. In a recent interview in <i>Red Herring</i>, a technology magazine, Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape, a software firm locked in a bitter battle with Microsoft, claimed that its giant rival "would rather eliminate a 10% market share competitor than grow the market by 50%". <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At first glance, Intel's foray into motherboards invites the same sort of complaints. In 1993, the firm was worried that <font size=-1>PC</font> makers were dragging their heels in adopting its new Pentium chips, which were by far its most profitable ones. So it started shipping them on cheap motherboards it designed to exploit every speed advantage the Pentium had over its competition. <font size=-1>PC</font> makers had little choice but to use them; if they waited to design their own boards, someone else would beat them to market with Intel's. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Initially, this infuriated <font size=-1>PC</font> makers. They feared that Intel was trying to steal the last bit part of their business that did not involve simply assembling other firms' parts. But most of those complaints have now died down, in part because Intel has scaled back production of motherboards between new generations of processors, returning more of that market to other firms. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Intel can afford such restraint because it makes so much money from its core processor business. While other parts get cheaper, Intel's processors are getting more expensive: from $50 for an average 286 chip in 1985 to $200 for today's much more powerful Pentium. Given that the price of memory chips--the other expensive part of a <font size=-1>PC</font>--has plummeted, Intel can now push up its processor prices again without raising the overall cost of a computer. Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, reckons that the average price of Intel's processors will rise to $300 over the next two years: with 80m <font size=-1>PC</font>s expected to be sold a year by 1998, that extra $100 per chip could add $8 billion to the firm's sales. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This may seem like unimaginable wealth, but it pales beside the potential riches of the media and services markets Microsoft has in its sights. Intel's decision to stick to its knitting keeps it out of trouble with regulators, but also limits its ambitions. Microsoft is willing to risk antitrust suits (and $1 billion in investments) in its quest for domination of more markets. But with that risk comes the chance for greater returns--one reason why the software firm's price-to-earnings ratio is almost twice Intel's. In the rapacious computer industry, "finite greed" (a term Microsoft's boss, Bill Gates, once used to explain a competitor's hesitation) has its price.<br>

<h1>Now, bondmania</h1>

<p><b>Fast-rising stockmarkets are eye-catching. But bond markets around the  world are also enjoying heady times. Too heady, perhaps</b></p><br>
WALL STREET'S rise has been mesmerising. It took the Dow Jones Industrial Average a mere 30 trading days to rise from 6,000 to more than 6,500, a mark it reached on November 25th. The market has risen by 8% since the presidential election. So it was only natural that investors should focus most of their attention on sky-high share prices. Other stockmarkets have been dragged to records by America's bullish lead. Seven European markets, as well as Hong Kong, touched new highs along with the Dow.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But another bull market is equally deserving of attention. With few exceptions (Britain a notable one), bond markets around the world are enjoying an astonishing boom (see <a href="fn1.gif">chart</a>). In their exuberance, investors are signalling that there is a strong consensus. Interest rates will stay the same or continue to fall almost everywhere, the markets are saying, and there is almost no risk that they will rise. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This euphoria is widespread. The yield on America's 30-year Treasury bond has fallen to around 6.4%, more than three-quarters of a percentage point lower than its level in July. Canada, still worried by fears of secession in Quebec and mired in economic gloom, has seen interest rates on ten-year bonds drop below their American equivalents, a phenomenon last witnessed nearly two decades ago. Spanish short-term bonds are at 6%, a record low. On November 21st post-communist Russia's first ever bond issue was wildly oversubscribed. Even Japanese bonds have managed a small rally, fooling those who doubted that investors would go for ten-year government bonds yielding less than 2.7%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This global case of fixed-income fever rests on three main assumptions. Should any of them prove wrong, today's bond rally will become tomorrow's bear market. <br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>Steady growth, low inflation.</b> The markets are assuming that the world economy will continue on its current, even keel. The evidence: in many countries, long-term bonds now yield little more than short-term bonds, an indication that investors expect inflation to remain quiescent.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, points out that current bond prices will not be justified should growth in leading industrial countries pick up sharply next year. If that happens, interest rates in big markets, such as America and Japan, are more likely to rise than to fall, sending bond prices tumbling. That happened as recently as 1994, when a sharp rise in interest rates knocked $1 trillion off American bond values over a few months.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Is a revival of growth likely? Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, thinks it is. Several industrialised countries, notably Britain, Germany and Sweden, are showing signs of new strength, while emerging economies in Asia and Latin America are likely to grow faster in 1997 than they have this year. True, the third-quarter <font size=-1>GDP</font> figures in America have just been revised downwards. All the same, that slowdown may not continue and consumer spending looks strong (see <a href="am3148.html">page</a>). If growth around the world proves stronger than bond markets expect, that would suck money away from bonds. <br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>EMU goes ahead.</b> Confidence that Europe's economic and monetary union (<font size=-1>EMU</font>) will start, as planned, on January 1st 1999 has contributed to the bond rally. Italy's re-entry on November 25th into the exchange-rate mechanism, something that is essential if it is to qualify for <font size=-1>EMU</font>, drove that country's short-term bond yield below Britain's. There has been a remarkable narrowing of the gap between bonds issued by Europe's traditionally more spendthrift countries, such as Spain and Italy, and those of famously prudent countries, notably Germany. A year ago, the spread between Italian bonds and German ones was greater than five percentage points. Now, the gap is less than two points.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The markets seem to be expecting a wave of economic conservatism. Qualifying for <font size=-1>EMU</font> will require Italy and Spain to slash spending and bring down inflation. So far, they seem willing to do it. Italy's inflation has fallen to a 27-year low of 3%, barely half the level of a year ago. In Spain, the inflation rate has dropped by one-third, to 3.5%, since April 1995. Budget deficits in both countries have fallen sharply.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such improvements lend weight to the idea that a combination of steady growth and fiscal tightening leave little scope for inflation in Europe. Indeed, a virtuous circle operates: falling interest rates slash debt-servicing costs for indebted governments, reducing budget deficits further.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet things could easily go wrong. Several countries may be massaging their budget numbers to meet the Maastricht criteria. If Germany insists that those criteria are observed strictly, then investors might lose confidence in budget projections that they are willing to endorse at the moment. Italy's 1997 budget purports to reduce the deficit by 63 trillion lire ($42 billion), for example, but 60% of this reduction is due to come from "new revenues" which include a partially refundable one-off tax. In a less bond-friendly climate, such legerdemain could go wrong. But if Italy were kept out, then the tensions over <font size=-1>EMU</font> membership would rise sharply.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For bondholders this is a minefield. If only France, Germany and a few other nations constitute the initial core of <font size=-1>EMU</font>, Spanish and Italian bonds will quickly lose their lustre. But if entry criteria are fudged to bring Italy (and Spain) aboard, the bonds of less deficit-ridden countries may well suffer from fears that Europe's single currency will begin life as a weakling.<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>No more business cycles.</b> This is the least tangible, but perhaps most profound of the assumptions made by today's bond enthusiasts. Thanks in equal parts to America's prolonged expansion and to the quiescence of inflation, it has become accepted wisdom in some circles that rich countries have entered a near-permanent condition of low-inflationary growth. Central banks merely have to remain vigilant in order to maintain Nirvana.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Proclamations that the business cycle is dead fly in the face of economic history. It is true that there have been important structural changes in economies around the world, partly driven by the spread of information technology. But at best the economic effects of such changes are poorly understood. And the chances that the world economy could be disrupted by, say, governmental economic mismanagement or a rise in oil prices, have not diminished simply because businesses now manage their affairs with computers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Will bonds nosedive tomorrow? No one can know. But rarely has so much money come flooding into the bond markets so quickly. And rarely have investors been so ready to play down risks that their predecessors would have taken for granted. Amid America's bear market in the early 1980s, almost any piece of economic news was automatically deemed bad for bonds. Today, investors seem intent on finding only good news.<br>

<h1>Alger Hiss</h1>

WITHOUT Alger Hiss, would there have been a Joe McCarthy? It is a fair question. The investigation, trial and conviction of Alger Hiss--and surely there was never a better name for a spy--provoked Senator McCarthy's charge a month later that the American State Department was "infested" with communists. After all, where there was one commie rascal, there were bound to be more-- say, 205. That accusation launched the red scare that deadened American cultural life for a decade and turned the perfectly defensible goal of prosecuting communist spies into a national disgrace. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the process, anti-communism became seen as mean-spirited and tacky--a reputation that lingered until the Berlin wall fell. To a degree, it deserved this reputation. Cool intellectuals such as Mr Hiss drove rougher sorts like McCarthy to distraction, a distrust that later found memorable expression in George Wallace's contempt for "pointy-headed intellectuals". In effect, the trial of Mr Hiss drew the line between anti-communism and anti-anti-communism that became so strong a feature of American life.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This divide was, from the beginning, as much aesthetic as ideological. Take a look at Whittaker Chambers, who in 1948 told Congress that Mr Hiss had spied for the Soviet Union in the 1930s. Chambers had terrible teeth, bad suits and a paunch; radio listeners could almost hear the gravy stains on his tie. Lean and sauve, Mr Hiss carried himself like an aristocrat. He wasn't, at least not by birth. But through diligence and a capacity to impress the great and the good, he had led a gilded life. After a brilliant academic career, he became a clerk at the Supreme Court. At the State Department, he was an adviser at the Yalta conference that in 1945 divided Europe between the Soviet Union and the West, and organiser of the conferences that sculpted the United Nations.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Enter Richard Nixon</b></b><br>
Alger Hiss cut so impressive a figure that when he first testified to deny Chambers's charges, Congress gave him a standing ovation. Unfortunately for him, an ambitious new congressman, Richard Nixon, insisted that the claims be investigated. The tide turned. In 1950, Mr Hiss was convicted of perjury (under the statute of limitations he was not tried for spying). After 44 months in prison, he was freed to begin his lifelong effort at vindication.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In this, he had many sympathisers; the Hiss trial became an ideological litmus test (liberals for him, conservatives against). Again, the judgment seemed partly aesthetic. Defenders of the British spy Kim Philby felt disbelief, until he took up residence in Moscow, that "one of us" could be "one of them". So it was with defenders of Mr Hiss. Add the fact that Nixon had a key role in the investigation: clearly, Alger Hiss must be innocent. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two men loathed each other, but their destinies were entwined. Mr Hiss's confrontation with Chambers was the first televised congressional hearing. This was the same forum later used to force Nixon out of the presidency--an office he admitted he never could have won without the Hiss investigation to launch his career. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Hiss used Nixon's downfall in 1974 to attempt his rehabilitation, with some success. The Massachusetts bar re-admitted him to practice in 1975. On the lecture circuit he offered himself as a modern Dreyfus, a French army officer wrongly convicted of treason. Then came the publication in 1978 of "Perjury", which concluded that Mr Hiss was guilty. The author, Allen Weinstein, was so clearly "one of us"--a liberal academic who had set out to prove that Mr Hiss was framed--that the 700-page book made a great impact. Mr Hiss lost the support of much of liberal America; his defenders are a dwindling band.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the evidence has never been quite conclusive enough to clinch the case in the public mind. The end of the cold war has not lessened the ambiguity of Alger Hiss. In 1992, General Dmitri Volkogonov, chairman of the Soviet archives, said he had found nothing to indicate that Mr Hiss had been a spy. But he later back-pedalled, noting that many files were destroyed after Stalin's death, that he had not searched very hard, and that he did not have access to military intelligence archives. The case for the prosecution was bolstered by the release this year of Russian cables intercepted by the National Security Agency that seemed to refer to Mr Hiss; scraps from Hungarian archives suggested that he was a spy well into the 1940s. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now that he is dead and communism has lost, the question of Mr Hiss's guilt or innocence is of less importance. What is still remembered is the stunning effect his trial had on America, bringing the cold war into the home. In an irony he would hate, Mr Hiss can take much of the credit for bringing Joe McCarthy and Richard Nixon to prominence. And in an irony he might appreciate, the excesses in the pursuit of communist spies that his trial launched did much to make anti-communism anathema in the West. In this sense, at least, Alger Hiss surely served the interests of the Soviet Union.<br>

<html><head><title>A foreign policy for America</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" width="78" height="39" alt="The Economist" border=0></p>

<h1 align=center>A foreign policy for America</h1>


ONCE upon a time, the world viewed from Washington seemed a simple place: there were good guys, and bad guys, and the rest. The good guys were America's friends, the bad guys were communists, and the rest were unimportant. Then, after the Berlin Wall came down, the world looked even simpler. Suddenly, there was only one superpower, which, freed of all constraints, was now able to set about creating a "new world order", swatting flies like Iraq as it did so. The illusion lasted only a moment, but it was replaced neither by a new, more complex view of the world nor by any sense of urgency about the need to find one. For the past four years, America has juggled a variety of different (and sometimes inconsistent) foreign policies, each reflecting a different (and sometimes inconsistent) view of the world. Fortunately, the price paid has not been great. But in his second term, Bill Clinton may not be so lucky.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fortune has smiled on Mr Clinton partly because the world remains relatively quiet. The American troops now preparing for a stint in Bosnia or central Africa may question that. Yet relatively quiet it is, despite the ethnic squabbles that afflict the Balkans and many parts of Africa besides Rwanda, Burundi and Zaire. Some of these disputes, and others from Chechnya to Sri Lanka, are a consequence of the triumph of democracy. Where communists once sat on national aspirations, people now feel free to burst forth. Where tribes and nations long resented colonial borders or dominance by other groups, they can now assert their independence, invoking as they do so the tenets of self-determination.<b><br>
</p><p><b>Attend and co-operate</b></b><br>
These rows will not go away for a while. They will need to be managed, and managed better than Yugoslavia was during Mr Clinton's first 1,000 days. But the record of the past year in Bosnia shows that, when the administration gives its full attention to a foreign-policy question, and works with its allies, not against them, it can produce results.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That has been apparent from the outset with the most immediate set of issues arising out of communism's collapse: how to ease the transition to democracy and market economics in Eastern Europe and, most importantly, in Russia. Here the policy has been coherent: offer conditional financial help to governments anxious to reform their economies, and security help--at first through <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s Partnerships for Peace--to those who fear their neighbours; meanwhile, cajole and subsidise to control arms, especially nuclear arms. The administration has done this well. But note that luck, too, has played a part: Russia today might well look frightening had Boris Yeltsin not managed, against most expectations six months earlier, to win re-election last July.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America's policy towards Asia has shown less coherence: the administration sees the region variously as trading opportunity, trading threat, security worry and human-rights abuser. At the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum in the Philippines next week, Mr Clinton will, if he is wise, be publicly talking trade and privately reassuring nervous Asians that America will stay around in their region--so long as they are welcoming. Meanwhile, in Beijing this week, his outgoing secretary of state, Warren Christopher, has been trying to tell China that America wishes to engage it economically, without uncritically backing its bid to join the World Trade Organisation. The Chinese, however, well know that at the start of his term Mr Clinton wanted to link China's most-favoured-nation trade status to human rights. Though the link was eventually abandoned, they remain mistrustful, all the more so in the light of America's subsequent friendliness towards Taiwan: first the granting of a visa to its president, then the show of naval force in March during China's attempts to force Taiwan to toe the one-China line.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other problems inevitably absorb the energies of America's policymakers. The Middle East still soaks up a lot of diplomatic effort. Iran and international terror remain a worry. So does North Korea, Iraq and other states that may be acquiring weapons of mass destruction. Haiti and Cuba, thanks to proximity and electoral pressure, loom large in the view from Capitol Hill, if not from Foggy Bottom. Still, most of these places remain low on the list of Washington priorities until a crisis--a threat, a bomb, an invasion--puts them on the front pages. Then, panic past, they are allowed to slip away again.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b></b>This approach to foreign policy is unlikely to be adequate for long. The world is still in an unnatural post-cold-war condition. America remains the only superpower but, despite the boys in Bosnia and the battleships in the Taiwan Strait, suspicions remain that it is gun-shy. Soon the challenges will come not from Somali warlords but from full-fledged countries, growing in economic might and maybe military bravado.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is safe to assume, for instance, that Russia's external ambitions are not satisfied, merely temporarily suppressed. Other countries will surely try to secure the gamut of weapons Saddam Hussein had failed to acquire when he snatched Kuwait. In many places, Islam seems to offer the only ideology to challenge the new orthodoxies of liberal politics and economics. And it is far from clear whether an ever-richer China will be a benign or a belligerent actor on the world stage.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So the new foreign-policy team in Washington--and it had better be a team, not a group of rivals--needs to keep Russia, proliferation, Islam and China constantly in mind. On none of these issues does it need a radical change of policy. On Russia, the elements are all in place, so long as <font size=-1>NATO</font> enlargement goes ahead sensitively but firmly. On proliferation, the problem is to keep up the pressure on would-be renegades and others tempted to help them. Islam requires coolness, not panic, a readiness to see that the religion in itself poses no threat and that different Islamists therefore need to be treated discriminatingly. And on China, perhaps the most difficult issue, America at last seems to have discovered the right mix of engagement and containment. But the Chinese should be left in no doubt that America will not tolerate aggression.<b><br>
</p><p><b>Invest in allies</b></b><br>
Rather than design new policies, America needs now to apply its existing ones consistently and in concert with others. Consistency is needed because oscillations suggest weakness (China) and undermine allies (Bosnia). Co-operation is needed because America cannot always act alone, even if it sometimes thinks it wants to, and it certainly does not want to pay alone. In fact, though allies can be awkward, it is very much in America's interests to put alliances in place to deal with difficulties when they crop up, as they will. That is why Mr Clinton is foolish to waste so much goodwill by pursuing a vendetta against the current <font size=-1>UN</font> secretary-general and by persisting with the Helms-Burton law on trade with Cuba.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where is America to find its allies? Where it can, of course, among democracies old and new, especially in Asia, where Chinese expansionism is already being felt. But the friendship likeliest to prove useful is the old one with Europe, often tested but always liable to be taken for granted. Four times this century--in two world wars, Korea and the Gulf--America has fought alongside Europeans. They know that undeterred aggression means war and, if they stop to think, that deterred aggression means peace: the big war they did not fight was the nuclear one with Russia. If the next 50 years are to be as relatively unbloody as the past 50, America will have to be just as resolute as it was with Soviet communism. And it will need every bit as much help from its friends.<br>

<h2>Going home</h2>
At least 500,000 <b>Rwandan refugees </b>in eastern Zaire went home after their camps were attacked by rebels. But former Rwandan soldiers and Hutu militiamen fled further into Zaire. Plans for outside military intervention were thrown into confusion when Rwanda said none was needed and America scaled back its commitment.<p>
At the <b>United Nations</b>, 14 Security Council members backed a second term as secretary-general for Boutros Boutros-Ghali. The United States vetoed him.<p>
President Frederick Chiluba of <b>Zambia</b> easily won re-election. A leading rival, ex-president Kenneth Kaunda, had been banned from standing. His party and some others boycotted the poll.<p>
<b>Israeli </b>television showed an amateur video of border police beating Palestinians. Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, called the beatings "unpardonable". Palestinians talked of "racism".<p>
<h2>Tough customers</h2>
Opposition members of Belarus's parliament threatened to impeach the country's president, <b>Alexander Lukashenka</b>, if he went ahead with a referendum that would lengthen his term and extend his powers. But both sides hinted that compromise was possible.<p>
Romania's president, Ion Iliescu, a former communist, lost his bid for a third term, marking the country's first peaceful democratic shift of power. The new president will be <b>Emil Constantinescu</b>, a centrist academic.<p>
Six ministers from the junior partner in <b>Estonia's</b> governing coalition quit to protest a co-operation agreement signed by the prime minister, Tiit Vaehi, and the leading opposition party.<p>
An alliance opposed to Serbia's government won the mayorality of the country's capital, <b>Belgrade</b>. It accused the government of suppressing the results of elections in other municipalities.<p>
In <b>Moldova</b>, the incumbent, Mircea Snegur, took the lead in the first round of voting for president. But he faces a tough fight in the second round against Petru Lucinschi, the speaker of parliament.<p>
At least 68 people were killed by an <b>explosion</b> in a block of flats in the southern Russian republic of Dagestan. Most were border guards and their families, prompting speculation that local gangs might have taken revenge for a crackdown on arms-and caviar-smuggling.<p>
A parliamentary commission recommended that Belgium's highest court investigate allegations that a deputy prime minister, Elio di Rupo, has engaged in <b>paedophile activities</b>. Mr di Rupo denies the allegations.<p>
Italy's public-works minister, <b>Antonio Di Pietro</b>, the driving force behind the "clean hands" anti-corruption campaign, resigned. He complained of being victimised after becoming a target of investigation himself.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
Italy and Greece approved measures designed to help them qualify for Europe's <b>single currency</b>. Italy's parliament passed a tight budget and the government spelled out details of a "tax for Europe". Greece's cabinet approved a series of new taxes, including levies on banks and state securities.<p>
An unmanned Russian space vehicle, intended to reach <b>Mars</b>, fell into the South Pacific after a booster rocket failed to carry it clear of its Earth orbit. The rocket was carrying scientific equipment for 20 other countries. <p>
A fire in the <b>Channel tunnel</b> between Britain and France sent eight people to hospital and disrupted service.<p>
<h2>Old blood</h2>
Thailand's general election produced a <b>new prime minister</b>,<b> </b>Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, a former general, but the coalition government he is putting together looks a lot like the failed previous one.<p>
The <font size=-1>IMF</font> cancelled a $20m loan to Cambodia because of the country's failure to control <b>loggers </b>who are destroying forests.<p>
A fire in an office block in <b>Hong Kong</b> killed about 40 people and injured about 80.<p>
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees suspended most of the agency's activities in <b>Kabul </b>because four of its staff had been arrested by the Taliban, which captured the Afghan capital in September.<p>
<h2>Close encounters</h2>
Two <b>unlikely visits </b>were announced for 1997. The pope met Fidel Castro in Rome and is to visit Cuba. Bill Clinton is to go to Brazil, his first presidential visit to Latin America.<p>
In <b>Mexico's </b>Congress, the <font size=-1>PRI</font>, President Ernesto Zedillo's party, rammed through legislation on electoral reform--shorn of key points that had been accepted in all-party talks inspired by Mr Zedillo. <p>
In <b>Colombia</b>, despite pressure from President Ernesto Samper, congressional committees yet again dawdled over legislation rendering drug-traffickers' profits liable to forfeiture.<p>
A former <font size=-1>CIA</font> station chief, Harold Nicholson, was charged with selling <b>secrets</b> <b>to Russia</b> for the past two years. He is the highest-ranking <font size=-1>CIA </font> officer to be charged with spying. His lawyer says he will plead not guilty.<p>
<b>John Huang</b>, the Democratic Party fund-raiser at the heart of the controversy over solicitation of foreign funds, lost his job at the Democratic National Committee. A spokesman said he was simply one of 105 people who were laid off after the election.<p>

<h2>Well-connected</h2>
(See <a href="bw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>Shares in <b>Deutsche Telekom</b> were floated in the second-largest initial public offering ever. The price of the shares, which attracted 2m German investors, leapt from DM28.5 ($19) to over DM33 in the first few hours of hectic trading. Germany's government confirmed plans to sell its 35.7% stake in<b> </b>the national airline, <b>Lufthansa</b>, worth nearly DM3 billion.<p>
American banking regulations were eased further, increasing the <b>powers of commercial banks </b>to expand into selling insurance and underwriting securities.<p>
<b>Unocal</b> agreed to sell its petroleum-refining and marketing business to Tosco, another American oil firm, in a deal worth around $2 billion. Unocal will use the proceeds to pay debts and expand exploration and production, particularly in Asia.<p>
Yasuo Hamanaka, the trader who lost $2.6 billion for Japan's<b> Sumitomo Corporation</b> through unauthorised copper dealing, claimed through his lawyer that his former boss had been involved in dodgy trading. Sumitomo posted a net loss of &#165;212.1 billion ($2 billion) for the half-year to September.<p>
The French government fired the head of<b> Groupe des Assurances Nationales </b>(<font size=-1>GAN</font>), a big state-controlled insurance group. The sacking of Jean-Jacques Bonnaud came less than a week after the privatisation of <font size=-1>GAN</font>'s banking subsidiary, <font size=-1>CIC</font>, had been halted after meeting resistance from within. Mr Bonnaud refused to go.<p>
<b>Russia</b> made ready for its long-planned debut Eurobond issue. It also confirmed plans to merge two state-run telecoms firms, Rostelecom and Svyazinvest, possibly in preparation for privatisation.<p>
As the Bank for International Settlements warned that the introduction of electronic money could shave billions of dollars off central banks' note-and-coin-issuing revenues, MasterCard, a payment-card group, said it had agreed to take control of<b> Mondex</b>, an electronic-cash firm.<p>
<h2>Pipes and drums</h2>
A group of ten international oil companies and the governments of Russia, Kazakhstan and Oman settled their remaining differences over the construction of a $1.5 billion <b>pipeline</b> that will help western oil ventures in Kazakhstan to export their crude. An agreement should be signed early next month.<p>
Russia's largest company is to shake itself up.<b> Gazprom</b> said it will sell peripheral activities (eg, farms) to focus on gas, moving further into distribution and appointing a new finance director.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
America's Pentagon picked Lockheed Martin and Boeing to design and build prototypes for the <b>Joint Strike Fighter</b>, the biggest-ever military-aircraft contract. The two will together get $2.2 billion and four years to produce the final design. The decision dealt a blow to McDonnell Douglas, which had teamed up with British Aerospace and Northrop Grumman.<p>
Despite its good news,<b> Lockheed Martin</b> said it will close eight American plants and lay off 1,600 workers. The move was prompted by a reduction in American defence spending and Lockheed's recent purchase of Loral, a defence-electronics firm.<p>
The committee overseeing the investigation into<b> </b>Swiss banks' holdings of <b>assets deposited by holocaust victims</b> picked three accountancy firms--Arthur Andersen, <font size=-1>KPMG</font> and Price Waterhouse--to conduct the search. Swiss bankers and politicians said they might create a fund for victims of Nazism.<p>
American Airlines was poised to announce an order for several hundred<b> Boeing</b> jets worth around $6 billion. Boeing confirmed an order for ten 777 aircraft from Air France.<p>
The World Trade Organisation agreed to the European Union's request to set up a panel that will decide whether America's<b> Helms-Burton law</b> (which penalises foreign firms that invest in Cuba) violates trade rules.<p>
Sources within Sony said that the Japanese group's president, Nobuyuki Idei, plans to float its troubled American film studio, <b>Sony Pictures</b>, which owns Columbia and TriStar Pictures.<p>
<h2>Black gold</h2>
Oil giant Texaco ended a 2.5-year-long <b>racial discrimination case </b>by agreeing to pay $175m to 1,400 black employees, some of whom had complained of being passed over for promotion and pay rises. The company still faces a federal investigation. A Texaco official was charged with obstruction of justice.<p>
Chiroscience, one of Britain's largest <b>biotechnology</b> firms, announced a $200m takeover of Darwin Molecular, a Seattle-based firm of which Bill Gates owned 14%. <p>
Thousands of savers flocked to withdraw their money from <b>Bulgaria</b>'s State Savings Bank after it emerged that the bank had been using deposits to finance the government's hefty debts.<p>
Japan's ministry of finance shut down <b>Hanwa Bank</b>, a small regional bank--the first government-ordered bank closure in post-war Japan.<p>
There were smiling faces at <b>Euro Disney</b>. The Paris-based theme-park operator made net profits of FFr202m ($40m) in the year to September 30th. Reduced entry prices helped produce a 9% rise in visitors, to 11.7m.<p>

<h1>Good intentions</h1>

<p><b>Bill Clinton has another four years to set the world to rights--if only he can keep his concentration</b></p><br>
"IN AN increasingly interdependent world Americans have a growing stake in how other countries govern, or misgovern, themselves. The larger and more close-knit the community of nations that choose democratic forms of government, the safer and more prosperous Americans will be, since democracies are demonstrably more likely to maintain their international commitments, less likely to engage in terrorism or wreak environmental damage, and less likely to make war on each other." <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Those fine, even provocative, words come from Strobe Talbott, deputy secretary of state (and President Clinton's chief adviser on Russia), in the latest issue of <i>Foreign Affairs</i>. But will they define a "Clinton doctrine" by which the rest of the world will temper its behaviour over the next few years? Or will they be soon forgotten, as a second-term presidency continues the ad hoc habits ("photo-op foreign policy" and "foreign policy as social work" are among the biting, if facile, criticisms) of the past four years?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The questions matter because America is so obviously the world's leader--its biggest economy, its most powerful warrior and, thanks to the demise of the Soviet Union (President Reagan's "evil empire")--its only remaining superpower. Whatever the crisis, America, it seems, must play the decisive role. In the past year it has brokered a sort of peace in the Balkans; kept Arabs talking with Israelis; and sent its navy to support Taiwan against the bluster of China (see <a href="sf1.gif">map</a>). Even France, whose Gaullist tradition presumes more than a <i>soup</i><i>&ccedil;on</i> of anti-Americanism, acknowledges if not America's leadership at least the need for its help: this month's offer of French troops for Zaire was contingent on the presence of Americans, too. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The difficulty is to be sure of the answer. Just as foreigners are ambivalent about America, often relying on its power while also resenting it, so is America about the rest of the world.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, historically, America's attitude has always been one of deliberate distance. It should, said Thomas Jefferson, seek honest friendship with all nations, but "entangling alliances with none". Hence, before the second world war, America's every entrance on the the global stage was followed, sooner or later, by its withdrawal. For all the 1960s' talk of American imperialism, fostered by covert action round the world and overt war in Vietnam, the truth is that America has had no territorial ambitions since the end of the 19th century. Only Latin America, "Uncle Sam's backyard", has real cause to see the United States as a menacing quasi-imperialist, meddling either to protect its trade or to repel the alleged threat of communism.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Seen against that background America's role in Bosnia conforms to a pattern begun in the French Revolution and continued in the first and second world wars: Europe in a crisis looks to the United States for help--and has to wait. The difference is that the pattern is now interwoven with so many others. Count the value of America's proliferating foreign investment, or the ethnic links of its citizens to other countries, or its obligations under various international treaties: the truth, <i>pace </i>Jefferson, is that America's isolationist instincts must henceforth be limited; for better or worse, the country is permanently entangled. In which case, can non-Americans hope for the better from a second-term Bill Clinton?<br>
</p><p><b><b>Backyard blues</b></b><br>
Start with America's backyard. For decades its complaint was that the United States interfered too much in affairs south of the border (witness the downfall of Salvador Allende in Chile or Manuel Noriega in Panama). Now the grouse is the opposite: not only do Latin Americans feel misunderstood, they also feel ignored.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They have a point. Two years ago in Miami, Mr Clinton, still reasonably fresh from winning approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement (<font size=-1>NAFTA</font>), played host to the first "hemispheric" summit with all the region's leaders bar Cuba's Fidel Castro (a perennial pariah). They set the goal of a hemispheric free trade agreement by 2005; and Mr Clinton agreed to support a broader <font size=-1>NAFTA</font>, together with the spread of similar accords to the Caribbean and Central America. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So much for good intentions. The first disappointment stemmed from the Mexican currency crash of 1994. Though Mr Clinton braved domestic opposition to put together a financial rescue package, he was unable to win approval from a protectionist-inclined Congress for more trade deals.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second setback was the hijacking of the administration's Latin American policy (such as it was) by Mr Clinton's need to get re-elected. He approved the Helms-Burton law, which imposes sanctions against foreign companies "trafficking" (ie, investing) in Cuban assets seized by Castro from American citizens, in order to win votes in Florida, and sought to neutralise criticism that he was "soft" on drugs by hounding Colombia's President Ernesto Samper, who was alleged to have received election money from the Cali cocaine cartel. Mr Samper's American visa was cancelled and the administration refused the certification, necessary to qualify for American aid, that Colombia was co-operating in the war against narcotics. How sad for Colombia. All America's vendetta has really achieved is to destabilise Colombia's central authority to the benefit of narcotics-linked guerrillas.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But, putting their complaints aside, what do the Latin Americans really want from Uncle Sam? The less-than-simple answer is some positive understanding: let America adopt a policy of "constructive engagement" towards Cuba, encouraging the foreign investment that would ensure economic liberalisation, and with it political reform. Similarly, in terms of the drugs war, let America recognise that the problem is a shared one, with the consumers as guilty as the suppliers. Most of all, let Mr Clinton seek "fast track" approval from Congress to extend <font size=-1>NAFTA</font><t--mode> </t--mode>to Chile and to negotiate a Free Trade Agreement of the Americas for 34 countries in the hemisphere. Not everyone in the region wants such a deal; but "fast track" would signal America's involvement, and help stop the inclination of Mercosur, the trade-group led by Brazil, to go down a protectionist route.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the Latin wish-list will come true. But the optimists are few. After all, in his first term of office Mr Clinton travelled the globe--and never once set foot in Latin America (belatedly, a visit to the region is now scheduled for next year).<br>
</p><p><b><b>Misleading Asia</b></b><br>
To neglect Asia, with three-fifths of the world's people and several of its potential nuclear flashpoints (think of North and South Korea, India and Pakistan, China and India or Russia and China), would clearly be a mistake of a much greater order. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Couple security concerns with America's trading relationships with both Japan and China, and it is hardly surprising that Mr Clinton began his presidency by emphasising Asia with a fervour that alarmed America's hitherto complacent allies in Europe. The Seattle meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum (<font size=-1>APEC</font>) in November 1993 was upgraded, at Mr Clinton's prompting, into a summit of heads of state; and the following May China was informed that its most-favoured-nation trade status would no longer be held hostage to its human-rights record. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But where, Asia wonders, was the follow-up? America's secretary of state, Warren Christopher, quickly became obsessed with the Middle East (critics note his visit to Beijing this week was his first for two years), and the crucial relationships with Japan and China were soon soured by trade rows, with America aggressively insisting on greater market access. The low point came in November last year, when Mr Clinton cancelled his trip to the <font size=-1>APEC</font> summit in Osaka. Admittedly Mr Clinton had a good excuse--a budget crisis had shut down his government--but Asia's leaders were beginning to ask how much they could rely on an apparently inconsistent America.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton, of course, says their reliance can be absolute. This week, while visiting Australia, he used his first big foreign-policy speech since the election to promise the continued presence of American troops in the region. Moreover, he had reassuring words for China: "The United States has no interest in containing China. That is a negative strategy. What the United States wants is to sustain an engagement with China . . . in a way that will increase the chances that there will be more liberty and more prosperity."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Mr Clinton's latest message to China only serves to highlight the problems of his Asia policy. Earlier this year, mixed messages from America about wanting to engage, not contain, China played their part in the China-Taiwan crisis. Miffed by Taiwan's determination to hold its first fully democratic presidential election, and led to believe, from all the talk of engagement, that America would turn a blind eye, China set out to intimidate Taiwan, even firing missiles close to its busy shipping lanes. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To its credit, America's response, orchestrated from the Pentagon, not the State Department, was swift: two aircraft-carrier battle groups sent to "observe" China's actions and to ensure that Taiwan came to no harm. Shortly thereafter, America and Japan agreed to reinforce their bilateral security treaty.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though neither America nor Japan says it publicly, one of the future "risks" facing East Asia is precisely that a more muscular China will continue to refuse to play by the rules. Like it or not, America's role in constraining China will be crucial. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In which case, the administration might consider a change of tone. The Clinton team came to power saying America's economic interests would be at the centre of its foreign policy. The result was to advance the Commerce Department at the expense of the State Department--and to allow trade-dispute brinkmanship to endanger carefully balanced security relations. When he goes to Manila for next week's <font size=-1>APEC</font> summit, Mr Clinton will need to promise consistency as well as friendship if he is to reassure his Asian counterparts.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Old faithfuls</b></b><br>
Ironically, given Mr Clinton's initial preference for the transpacific rather than the transatlantic, Europe now needs little reassurance. In part this is a "better the devil you know" reaction; in part it is because most European governments reckon Mr Clinton has improved over time. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But it is also because Europeans have had to recognise their own failings: the Dayton accords on Bosnia, for example, would not have happened without Mr Clinton's special envoy, the bullying Richard Holbrooke. It was the same Mr Holbrooke, bluntly accusing the Europeans of literally sleeping through the night at a time of crisis, who this summer defused a dispute over some rocks in the Aegean that threatened to propel Greece and Turkey-- <font size=-1>NATO</font> "allies"--into armed conflict. Whatever the European Union's ambitions for a common foreign and security policy, in the meantime it clearly benefits from having America on hand--and an America that supports the idea of European integration.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That idea means different things to different people, and affects the way they view America's support. France has always tended to think of an integrated Europe as a counterweight to America. Indeed, its government spokesman, Alain Lamassoure, greeted Mr Clinton's victory with the comment: "It makes progress toward European unity more necessary than ever, so as not to leave American power alone like some kind of gendarme or judge over the affairs of the world." Hence France's determination to secure a European role in the Middle East peace process, or in the reordering of Africa. Yet at the same time France is deeply nervous at the idea of an American withdrawal from the world. President Chirac was not simply flattering his audience when he told Congress in February: "Today, as yesterday, the world needs the United States."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Germany has no such contradictory feelings: European integration and the transatlantic alliance are mutually reinforcing in Chancellor Kohl's mind. Indeed, he puts Germany's rapport with America almost on a par with the Franco-German alliance.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By contrast, feelings in Britain, obsessed by its internal debate over Europe, are confused: Eurosceptics, hankering hopelessly for the old "special relationship", see the <font size=-1>EU</font> as the enemy of transatlantic friendship-- to which the Europhiles reply by pointing out that Britain alone, without Europe, is no longer worthy of America's attention.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Designing the architecture</b></b><br>
In the end, be it in trade or security, America and Europe are mutually dependent, and the task is to ensure the relationship has as few irritations as possible. At the moment there are several: the Helms-Burton legislation; the squabble over Boutros Boutros-Ghali's tenure as <font size=-1>UN</font> secretary-general; differing views on how to deal with Iraq; the flagging momentum of the Middle East peace process; and so on.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The true challenge will be to manage two much bigger, and interconnected, issues: the expansion of <font size=-1>NATO</font> and the relationship of the West with Russia. In many ways America has handled <font size=-1>NATO</font> with diplomatic deftness, ensuring its survival after the end of the cold war had removed its original <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> and agreeing with the Europeans on the "combined joint task force" concept to allow Europe to use <font size=-1>NATO</font> assets without America's involvement. One litmus test for the future, however, certainly for France, will be America's willingness to cede <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s southern command, with its headquarters in Naples, to a European.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Americans have been similarly deft in ensuring approval for the notion that <font size=-1>NATO</font> must expand its membership both to promote Europe's security (not least by giving Germany a buffer between it and the old enemy, Russia) and to reward Central and Eastern Europeans for their rejection of communism. Putting notion into practice, however, will not be easy--and the European Union is not impressed by the idea that difficult cases such as the Baltic states (militarily indefensible) could find an alternative home in the <font size=-1>EU</font>. Why, mutter some southern Europeans, provoke Russia with ill-judged measures, be they for <font size=-1>NATO</font> or the <font size=-1>EU</font>?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One plausible answer is that Russia, at least for the time being an incapacitated country, no longer needs to be handled with kid gloves. Indeed, cynics say that all Russia really wants from America is large amounts of money with no strings attached. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That may be true, but America's agenda with a Russia that has nuclear arms and unstable borders can hardly be dismissed so lightly. The original agreement after the collapse of the Soviet Union was that all its nuclear warheads should be repatriated to Russia. So far Kazakhstan has obliged, as has Ukraine. By contrast, Belarus has not-- and its present political unrest could end with it rejoining Russia. That would not be a tragedy unless Russia used it as a precedent for recovering Ukraine, a country which if threatened should definitely receive America's support.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton's real priority in Russian policy, fortified by last year's extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the near-global agreement this year on the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty, is to push on with arms control.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The American-funded programme for the dismantling and safe storage of Russia's nuclear weapons needs to be accelerated-- possibly by a president-to-president prod. So, too, the effort to eliminate Russia's chemical warfare stocks and its (illegal) biological weapons programme. To show good faith, however, America's Senate had first better approve the Chemical Weapons Convention. Meanwhile, to encourage the Russian Duma finally to ratify the <font size=-1>START II</font> agreement on reducing strategic weapons, perhaps America might dangle the carrot of a <font size=-1>START III</font>--one in which the Americans humour the Russians by scrapping good weapons while the Russians junk bad ones.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Towards engagement</b></b><br>
Assume all of the above happens, from Latin America to the Far East; assume, too, an American-inspired breakthrough in the Middle East; imagine, improbably, that America will allow its trade rows to be solved through the World Trade Organisation rather than by threats of unilateral retaliation. That will still, for some critics, not add up to a consistent and comprehensive foreign policy.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps they are right. But they should remember that America's foreign-affairs budget has halved in real terms since 1984, and is unlikely to increase with the penny-pinching and jingoistic Mr Helms back in his place as head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Maybe that is why some Clintonites like to stress "transnational" issues, where America has a role because no other country will take the lead: not just arms control but also the environment; or terrorism; or international crime, from drugs to computer-fraud.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, the most important quality America brings to the world scene is its sheer capacity to get things done. Americans might often wish to be respected for moral fervour in foreign policy; but recent history has shown that, as in Somalia, moral impulses are dangerous if not accompanied by a sense of pragmatic self-interest. Besides, a capacity to make things happen--to bang heads together, convene summits, apply pressure, provide a forum for enemies to shake hands--should not be underestimated. If America only engages, there is no limit to what it might get done. Engagement is all.<br>

<h1>My Wal-Mart 'tis of thee</h1>

<font size=1>CULPEPER, VIRGINIA</font><p>
THIS is not the standard Wal-Mart story. The standard story is about the noisy protests when the world's biggest retailer moves into a small American community. In January 1995, for example, Wal-Mart opened one of its giant new Supercenters on the outskirts of Culpeper, a quaint town in a lovely part of north-western Virginia. Culpeper is a friendly place, where visitors are greeted warmly and waitresses call customers "honey" and "sweetie". It also prides itself on its heritage, from its historic town centre to its role in both the American revolution and the civil war. In Culpeper, as elsewhere, many locals saw Wal-Mart as a threat to the very fabric of American life.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But to get a sense of American life, there is now no better place than a Supercenter. While Bill Clinton's famous bridge to the 21st century is still in the planning stages, the arguably more significant monument of another (adopted) Arkansan, Wal-Mart's late founder, Sam Walton, is already in place. To walk into the Culpeper Wal-Mart, past the red lawnmowers and log-splitting machines lined up outside, is to enter a living museum of modern America--open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first impressions are obvious but overwhelming. The place, like the country, is big. The Supercenter spreads over 201,000 square feet, the size of four American football fields. Man (or, in this instance, a young woman) resorts to technology to conquer distance: she is employed to whizz around on roller-skates, fetching and returning goods. To judge from the variety of customers--of all colours--the space is a giant melting-pot. This is a place where people from trailer parks mingle with people from designer homes, just as a couple of cappuccino-makers are on sale alongside the ordinary coffee machines. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The sense of abundance (some 100,000 different product lines) evokes Bill Clinton's phrase, "the age of possibility". Attached to the handle of each shopping trolley is an electronic calculator, together with a little advertisement for some product or other. Some slogans posted around the store stress value for money ("We sell for less", or "Wal-Mart. Always the low price"); others speak to a lofty idealism. Here, a basic right is not merely the pursuit of happiness, but its attainment ("You Must Be Satisfied. Our Policy Guarantees It!"). Patriotism is prized ("We Buy American Whenever We Can. So You Can, Too. Together We Can Do It."). So is local boosterism ("Virginia Proud. Wal-Mart Salutes Our Neighbours Who Make the Products You Buy."). There is also a preachy environmentalism ("Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. Together We Can Make a Difference."). A note on the signs points out that they are made out of 89.3% reprocessed plastic.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Wal-Mart, as in America, the tension between competing values can be fascinating. Patriotism, for example, is not always compatible with the commitment to low prices. By the stacks of fishing rods--at least 80 different types--a salesman explains to a customer that, although Wal-Mart really tries to buy American, "when it comes to quality and price, they're going to buy whatever's better." <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Just as striking is the clash between the cultures of fitness and of gluttony. The sports section is one of the biggest. There are exercise machines, vast numbers of bicycles and equipment for just about every sport. Tellingly, the space devoted to soccer balls is now about as big as that for American footballs, although basketballs are way ahead of both. Yet over at the food market customers are lured towards an offer of 24 glazed doughnuts for $3. Doughnuts and other indulgences help to explain why the busiest section for women's clothes is the one selling so-called Plus sizes. "There are a lot of big women in Culpeper," says the saleswoman there. Plenty of them can be seen with trolleys at Wal-Mart. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most intriguing of all is the juxtaposition of extreme freedom and Orwellian controls. On the freedom side, take the ease of buying guns. Wal-Mart's gun counter is below a display--duly credited to Lacy's Taxidermy of Culpeper--of two stuffed deer heads, a bear's head, a bass, an otter and a duck. Two dozen rifles and shotguns are on display in a glass case, the cheapest model priced at $74.67. The counter is constantly busy with customers, all men, occasionally in camouflage jackets.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Buying a gun is little harder than signing up at the local Blockbuster video store. All you need is a photo <font size=-1>ID</font> with a Virginia address, plus a second document (a utilities bill, say, or a cheque book) with the same address. The store charges $2 for a call to the state police for a background check, which may take 45 minutes or less ("I got one this morning that took all of five seconds," says a salesman, who also volunteers that handguns, although not on sale over the counter, can be ordered within a week). Customers are reminded that they need pay only 10% straight away, with the balance due within 60 days. So it is possible to walk away with a lethal weapon within minutes for about what it costs to buy a compact disc.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the compact disc section, meanwhile, words and images are considered too dangerous to be sold without prior vetting and, where necessary, censorship. A young customer, complaining that megastores "suck" but that there is nowhere else nearby to buy music, points out that the artwork of Nirvana's "In Utero" has been adjusted so as to obscure the fetuses on the original version, and the title of one of the songs has been changed from "Rape Me" to "Waif Me". Other discs are marked "Sanitised for your protection". A recent <i>New York Times</i> article reported that the mere prospect of being kept out of Wal-Mart, America's biggest retailer of pop music, is sometimes enough to make artists tone down their output. An outraged media critic, Jon Katz of HotWired, has called on freedom-lovers to boycott Wal-Mart stores. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Protectiveness towards children and the elderly, prominent themes in the 1996 election campaign, are Wal-Mart themes too. A notice board for The Missing Children's Network has details of lost or abducted children from Honolulu to Florida ("We never stop trying to bring them home," the store boasts). At the pharmacy, a notice apologises to retired federal employees for a new 20% charge by the insurers on their prescriptions, and tells them to protest against the charge: the Medicare controversy in microcosm.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other social issues are alluded to in the application forms for people wanting to work at Wal-Mart, which employs more than 600,000 Americans. Applicants are informed that they must undergo a drug test, unless this is prohibited by state law. They must also be able to prove their legal right to work in America.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The 450 or so employees in the Culpeper store are disproportionately female, as is increasingly the case in the new American economy. They are also unfailingly friendly and helpful. Wal-Mart staff, known as "associates", are encouraged to practise the "ten-foot attitude" preached by Sam Walton: anybody coming within ten feet of a customer should look him in the eye, greet him and ask if they can help him. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Forms and a ballot box at the service desk enable customers to choose the "most helpful associate". So Wal-Mart customers can not only shop but vote, as well as go to the bank, the hairdresser, the optician, the McDonald's franchise. One of the few things they cannot find there is a church. When it comes to religion, the competition is simply too great, with more than 100 Baptist and Southern Baptist churches alone listed in Culpeper County.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the store does sell bibles--Catholic ones, Protestant ones, bibles with big type for senior citizens and "special interest" bibles for "children of colour". And for many, Wal-Mart has become an integral part of the Sunday ritual. The place is quiet before noon on Sundays, says a chatty check-out lady; but "right after church, we really get busy."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like America itself, Sam Walton's monument excites strong reactions. People are wary of this superpower. They mistrust its motives, fear its cultural clout, deride its brashness and scoff at its contradictions. Yet they also marvel at its convenience and admire its success. And, as with America, the people keep coming.<br>

<p><b>India and Russia</b></p>
<h1>Brothers in arms</h1>

<font size=1>DELHI</font><p>
THE old Delhi-Moscow defence relationship has been revived after a gap of five years. Last weekend, India decided to buy 40 <font size=-1>SU-30</font> fighter aircraft for $1.8 billion. More could follow. Russia has also offered to sell India jet trainers, an aircraft carrier, submarines, tanks and howitzers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For some 30 years, India depended on the Soviet Union for most of its arms. Both countries had a common foe in China, and the men in Moscow offered India arms at low prices, as well as cheap credits. They also took payment in rupees. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, so did the defence relationship. The new Russian state was hard up and insisted on payment in dollars. Moreover, deliveries were delayed, and India concluded that Russia could not be relied on as a supplier.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Russia now seems more settled, and it has completed deliveries of an old order for ten <font size=-1>M</font>i<font size=-1>G-29</font>s. Its prices have gone up, but are still lower than those of comparable western arms. Last year the two countries started negotiations, and India chose the <font size=-1>SU-30</font> as the aircraft for its air force in the coming decade. The Rao government made an advance payment in dollars and now the United Front government has confirmed the order. After initial purchases of the <font size=-1>SU-30</font>, India is likely to produce under licence another five to six squadrons, each with 20 aircraft, with Russian technical assistance. And it is likely to buy 70 to 100 <font size=-1>M</font>i<font size=-1>G-AT</font> jet trainers, which have many features in common with the <font size=-1>SU-30</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since its financial crisis of 1991, India has slashed defence spending. Expensive defence purchases in the 1980s were one reason for the 1991 crunch. Pakistan was getting military aid from America, and India wanted the capability to take on both Pakistan and China. But the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan ended American arms aid to Pakistan. At the same time the collapse of the Soviet Union hit supplies to India, and the two armies rusted in unison.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;India's senior officers have complained for years that they need to modernise ageing equipment. Besides, the air force has lost 82 aircraft in crashes since April 1993, mainly because of pilot errors and birds (birds sucked into engines have brought down more aircraft than India has lost in warfare). Now that India's budget deficit has come down from 8.3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> in 1991 to 5.5%, the defence chiefs believe their chances are better.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The cheapest option is to upgrade the avionics and weaponry of India's old <font size=-1>M</font>i<font size=-1>G-21</font> squadrons (mostly made domestically). At first, India approached America for this, but was turned down. Indian defence chiefs believe this proves that America is biased towards Pakistan, and reckon therefore that Russia, with all its limitations, is a more reliable partner. Besides, the Russians have agreed that India will maintain and repair Russian aircraft being supplied to Malaysia. This helps.<br>

<h1>Russia eyes the world</h1>

<font size=1>MOSCOW</font><p>
<p><b>Under the guidance of its foreign minister, Yevgeny Primakov, Russia has been carving out a tougher yet more pragmatic foreign policy</b></p><br>
THE main surprise about Russian foreign policy is that Russia seems at last to be arriving at one. After years in which anything seemed possible, two main principles are beginning to emerge. First, expect no more concessions that further diminish Russia's assets and influence, such as they are. Second, expect Russia to be warier of embarking on fresh adventures.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the West, the first of those principles--"no concessions"--is clearly the less attractive. It means Russia will stand by dangerous or dubious friends such as Iraq, Iran and Serbia. It promises a harshness towards countries of the former Soviet Union in which Russia feels its interests are not being recognised or fully protected. It implies a willingness to court public friction with America, still the only power against which Russia likes to measure itself. Russia's widespread hostility to <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s planned expansion is but one expression of such friction-courting. It has been evident, too, in the refusal so far of Russia's Duma, its lower house of parliament, to ratify the <font size=-1>START-2</font> arms-reduction treaty with America.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Russia's resurgent nationalism that has fostered this renewed readiness to say <i>Nyet</i> has been enhanced both by a year of election campaigning and by the illness of President Boris Yeltsin. For until and unless he recovers fully from his recent heart operation, an early presidential election will seem possible and would-be successors will go on outbidding each other in jingoism.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The latest and biggest victim of this crude Russian mood has been Ukraine. This month, hope for an end to the long-running argument over the division of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet was yet again dashed when the Duma decided that Ukraine must cede sovereignty of the Crimean port of Sebastopol to Russia rather than agree to lease it. At the last minute Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's prime minister, called off a visit to Kiev, Ukraine's capital, for fear of being branded "the man who lost Sebastopol".<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second principle Russia seems to have adopted--"no adventures"--is better news for the rest of the world. It was tested last month when General Alexander Lebed, briefly Russia's national security adviser, pressed for Russia to stoke up resistance in northern Afghanistan to the new Taliban government in Kabul. But he was talked down by Yevgeny Primakov, a former spymaster who became Russia's foreign minister in January. In the combustible Caucasus, where Russia has already "persuaded" governments to let it keep military bases (in Georgia and Armenia), Mr Primakov is treading warily. As for Chechnya, though still technically a domestic matter as it is constitutionally part of the Russian Federation, most Russian ministers probably accept--not publicly, of course--that the rebel republic will slide away into independence.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The new sense of coherence--and of limitation--in Russia's diplomacy is largely Mr Primakov's work. Not that he thinks Russia should do less abroad. Rather, he is taking a more realistic view of the slimmer means at its disposal. His main aim is to persuade the world that Russia is a great power that is passing through a mere phase of weakness--from which other countries would try to profit at their peril.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To help sustain that illusion it is essential for Russia to avoid the sort of sabre-rattling and even sabre-drawing that serve more to advertise its weakness. Whereas Russia's generals, including this week the defence minister, Igor Rodionov, have blown hot and cold on <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s expansion, Mr Primakov has opposed it consistently and relentlessly, but without threatening any specific retaliation should it occur, as it probably will.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Primakov's command of this delicate issue--the main focus of Russia's diplomatic engagement this year with America and the West--has reflected his authority within the Russian government. The foreign ministry is back in charge. Its revived professionalism has won Mr Primakov steadily improving reviews abroad, even from western sceptics horrified at first by his previous job as boss of the Russian foreign intelligence service, and by his 25-year friendship with Saddam Hussein. At home, too, Mr Primakov has a surprisingly wide range of admirers. His background gave him credibility from the outset with communists and nationalists. His pragmatism has since given liberals little to carp at. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When Mr Yeltsin's failing heart put him in hospital at the start of his second term in July, Mr Primakov's globe-trotting barely faltered. That signalled a huge change from the days of Andrei Kozyrev, his less wily predecessor, who, lacking friends in government and Duma alike, ended up as little more than a presidential messenger. When even Mr Yeltsin disowned him, as he did from time to time, foreign governments were left thoroughly confused about Russian foreign policy and who was making it.Where Russia can get away with it, its policy in the "near abroad"--the bits of the former Soviet Union that Russia lost--can be pretty rough, with the foreign ministry often content to see the Duma do the bullying. Ukraine is not the only former Soviet state still feeling the heat. Moldova, which does not even share a frontier with Russia, is another. This month the Duma declared the Russian-occupied Transdniestria, sandwiched between Moldova's main body and its border with western Ukraine, a "zone of special strategic interest"--and demanded that Russia's 14th Army should stay there permanently. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Over Belarus, too, Russia's empire rebuilders have been smirking. Not that Russia can afford to draw this troubled republic fully back into its orbit. But Mr Yeltsin has been happy to play cat-and-mouse with President Alexander Lukashenka, politely noting his ambition to unite the country with Russia without actually helping him to achieve his aim. All the same, Russia, and especially its raucous Duma, sees virtue in Mr Lukashenka: the more unstable and oppressive Belarus becomes, the less it will attract the West as a strategic partner.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In some places, Russia's harsh diplomacy has actually lowered tension--by grinding down other countries into settling on Russia's terms. This month, for instance, Mr Primakov gave his nod to a border treaty with Estonia, which, chilled by the thought of dealing with a President Lebed or a President Zyuganov, withdrew its main demands. Latvia seems ready to follow suit--though Russia's Duma may yet make trouble. Stubbornness is also winning Russia ground in the struggle for control of the Caspian and its oil pipelines.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This week Mr Primakov turned his attention to Russia's Pacific neighbours. On a visit to Japan, he proposed that the two countries should set aside their dispute over ownership of the southern Kurile islands (the Northern Territories, as Japan calls them) and jointly promote investment there. Japan said it would think about it--and freed $500m in soft loans to Russia that had been frozen for five years.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Next stop for Mr Primakov was China, a still trickier conundrum for Russia, which cannot decide whether to view its teeming neighbour as its greatest prospective ally or as its enemy. Russia even half-fears the Chinese investment it is publicly courting, lest China gain too much of an interest in the sparsely populated and mineral-rich Russian Far East. For all Mr Primakov's talk earlier this year of seeking a foreign policy that is more "balanced" between east and west, Russia so far seems merely to be temporising.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such jostling at Russia's Siberian end does not much alarm Western Europe or America. Russia, for sure, is a power in Asia. The sooner it and Japan come to an accommodation, the better for both. And it may be no bad thing if a would-be expansionist China has an ungainly but equally big neighbour breathing heavily down its northern neck.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The more ticklish area is still Russia's western flank. But there most of the old Warsaw Pact satellites are growing stronger by the day; there is little that Russia can do about it. So long as Russia does not threaten the independence of the Baltic states or Ukraine, and does not too flagrantly fan the flames under the Caucasus cauldron, western governments are not likely to complain much about what Russia does elsewhere in its former empire.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, a big worry is that, even under Mr Primakov's relatively sophisticated tutelage, Russia seems unable to break free of its view of the world as a sort of zero-sum game in which countries become strong only by making other countries weak. In the near abroad, where it counts for something, Russia pursues that logic with hard cynicism. Presumably, it would do the same in the more distant abroad if it only had the chance. Mr Primakov is calm, he is calculating, he can be amusing. But there is something chilling in his Lubyanka-tinted eyes.<br>

<p><b>British Museum</b></p>
<h1>Poverty in the treasure-house</h1>

"A SENSATIONAL piece of marketing" is how Lindsay Stainton, former curator of the British Museum's prints and drawings, describes the decision 243 years ago to open a collection of artefacts to the public and call it "the British Museum". And it works. While Londoners regard the <font size=-1>BM</font> rather as an ancient and charming relation, to be visited only occasionally, the tourists flock in. The <font size=-1>BM</font> gets 20% more visitors than New York's Metropolian Museum; in the league of the world's most popular museums and galleries, it is second only to the National Air and Space Museum in Washington.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Attracting people is not the <font size=-1>BM</font>'s problem. The <font size=-1>BM</font>'s problem is attracting money. The government is cutting its grant, and at the same time the museum is losing the rent it used to get from the British Library, which is moving to new premises. The effect, by 2000, will be a cut in revenue of 24% after allowing for inflation. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After two-and-a-half peaceful centuries, the <font size=-1>BM</font> is poorly equipped for dealing with financial crises. The curators who run its departments tend to be individualists, chosen not for their management skills but for their scholarship. "The place is full of primadonnas," according to an insider. Finance is frowned upon. The top financial officer has the status of a keeper, which is lower in the hierarchy than a curator. And the place lacks a clear mission: it is part-university, producing fine research on art and archaeology, and part-gallery, catering to its visitors.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>BM</font> hopes to persuade the government to make up the money it is losing from the British Library. But even then, it would still be left with a large gap. There are two ways to fill it: cut costs or make money.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Certainly, costs can be cut. Research could be slashed without affecting the service provided to visitors. But does the <font size=-1>BM</font>'s scholarship matter less than providing a warm resort for tour groups?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It could make more money. Thanks to Britain's 19th-century adventurers, who plundered some of the world's most wonderful ancient treasures--the Elgin marbles, King Ashurbanipal's carved lion-hunt from Assyria, the head of Rameses II from Egypt, turquoise-inlaid skulls from the Aztecs--the <font size=-1>BM</font>'s collection is a valuable resource. In the past, its curators sniffed at commerce, as is evident from its cramped little shop. However, the <font size=-1>BM</font> is waking up to its potential: it has opened a shop at Heathrow, which is doing well, and when the British Library moves out, shops and restaurants will be part of the Great Court development being designed by Sir Norman Foster, an outstanding British architect.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The big question, though, is whether to charge for admission. That is the solution favoured by Andrew Edwards, a former Treasury deputy secretary, who was commissioned by the <font size=-1>BM</font>'s trustees to report on the current crisis. The museum's director, Robert Anderson, disagrees. Charges, he says, would change the public's relationship with the <font size=-1>BM</font>. It would become less like public property, and more like visiting a country house. And charging would cut numbers. When the Victoria & Albert Museum introduced a "voluntary" charge in 1985, attendance fell from 1.7m to 1.02m in the following year (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One option short of a general admission fee would be to charge foreign tourists, who make up around 60% of the visitor numbers. That is the practice in some Spanish and Russian museums. But, practicalities aside, there is a difficulty in principle in charging Greeks, Iraqis or Egyptians to see the treasures which Britons lifted from their civilisations in the first place. "This is a very international museum," says Mr Anderson delicately.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the root of the problem is a nonsense for which the government is responsible. Museums have always faced the conundrum that people are willing to give them chunks of money for the Bloggs Wing or the Himmelfarb Gallery, but nobody wants to finance the security guards or the building maintenance. The government is now exacerbating that problem. Lottery money, like private donations, is for capital projects. And while the government promised that lottery money would not replace Treasury money, that is evidently what is happening. The British Museum has got two chunks of lottery money for capital projects--&#163;30m for the Great Court scheme, which will make use of the space vacated by the British Library, and &#163;8m for a "study centre"--at the same time as its revenue for current expenditure is being slashed. If the old thing is in a tizz, it is not surprising.<br>

<h1>Debt and taxes</h1>

"STUNNINGLY good" was how economists at Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, described the news on November 18th that the government repaid &#163;4.4 billion of debt in October. This view was echoed by many other City of London economists, who on average had expected a paltry &#163;2 billion repayment.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If October's figure sets the trend for the rest of 1996-97, the public-sector borrowing-requirement (<font size=-1>PSBR</font>) will total around &#163;23 billion for the financial year, &#163;4 billion less than the Treasury forecast in July (see <a href="br2.gif">chart</a>). Many economists reckon that this frees Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, to cut taxes by more than anyone had thought possible in the budget on November 26th--without even seeming reckless.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is a danger in all this of a solitary swallow being mistaken for summer. Chris Giles, an economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research group, points out that much of October's repayment was the making-up of ground lost earlier in the year. The big surprise was the strength of corporate-tax revenues. But these are notoriously lumpy and unpredictable. Moreover, firms paying taxes in October come disproportionately from the booming financial sector; a truer test of whether the corporate-tax take is rising comes in January, a big tax-paying month for firms from less-buoyant bits of the economy. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Richard Jeffrey, an economist at Charterhouse, an investment bank, says that even if October's good news did reflect an improved trend for the <font size=-1>PSBR</font>, that would not be a green light for bigger tax cuts. The likeliest reason for any such fall in borrowing is not a smaller structural deficit (borrowing unrelated to the economic cycle)--which might give grounds for tax cuts--but faster-than-expected economic growth. More evidence of this came on November 20th, with data showing retail sales up by 4.1% in the year to October, and broad money expanding at an annual rate of 10.3%. Rather than justifying tax cuts, warns Mr Jeffrey, a shrinking <font size=-1>PSBR</font> should be regarded as a sign of excessively fast growth, and a warning of the urgent need to raise interest rates, or taxes, to prevent inflation rising.<br>

<p><b>Education</b></p>
<h1>Thinking lessons</h1>

IT WAS bad-mark week for British education. An international study found that British teenagers are low down the league table of ability in maths (see <a href="br3.gif">chart</a>). Results of this year's national tests on 11-year-olds, while better than last year's, show that only 54% passed in maths and 58% in English. The tests were set at a level that 75% of 11-year-olds should be capable of reaching.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What is to be done? The teachers say the government must spend more money. The government says the teachers must return to old-fashioned methods. That is how the argument always goes. But there are other, less-discussed possibilities. Educational researchers are coming up with better methods for helping children learn:<font size=-1><li></font> Children can be taught how to think, concludes a new study by King's College, London. The five-year study looked at schools which gave pupils special lessons in which they had to work out for themselves the basic thought processes behind science and maths. A typical lesson started with the question "Does a cup of tea taste different if you put the milk in first or last?". In the course of their inquiry, pupils learnt about the principles behind statistics.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pupils being taught how to think did significantly better in their <font size=-1>GCSE</font>s than conventionally-taught pupils. They even got better grades in English--although the special "thinking" lessons were designed only to help in maths and science.<font size=-1><li></font> Computers can be used to speed up pupils' progress in reading and writing. There is nothing new about using technology in education--Edison predicted in the 1920s that instruction by radio and films could eventually replace teachers--and plenty of recent studies have shown that interactive computer "games" can help with maths.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now, a study in 15 east London primary schools suggests that computers can also help children learn to read and write faster. In one of these schools, before the project began, seven-year-olds were progressing at less than half of the normal speed for their age. With the help of their computer-based lessons, they made 19 months' progress in one year.<font size=-1><li></font> After years of trying, the idea of "family literacy" is showing some promise. This aims to help under-achieving children by giving lessons to their parents, who often did badly at school themselves, and so cannot help their children to read and write. Earlier this year, the National Foundation for Educational Research evaluated four pilot schemes in Cardiff, Liverpool, Norfolk and Tyneside, and found that the children were still making progress six months after their parents' courses ended.<font size=-1><li></font> A simple idea whose effectiveness is supported by several American studies is to get bright sixth-formers to teach struggling 11-year-olds to read during lunch breaks. David Reynolds, professor of education at Newcastle University, says some British schools are now trying this out.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trick is to enthuse the older pupils. Teachers do this by playing on their social consciences ("you are on your way to a bright future at university, these poor kids are heading for the dole or worse") and limiting the coaching sessions to, say, six weeks at a time so they do not become a bore.<br>

<h1>Dealing with Dennis the Menace</h1>

IF THE recent bunfights over disruptive pupils achieved anything, it was to ensure a wide and receptive audience for a clutch of new reports showing how incompetently the problem of badly behaved children is being dealt with. Children expelled from school tend to be those most in need of education, but they often end up with next to none.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While some schools go to great lengths not to expel disruptive children, sacrificing the education of other pupils and making teachers' lives a misery, others exclude children at the slightest excuse. This is one of the damning conclusions of a new report from Ofsted, the schools inspectorate for England.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Everybody reckons that exclusions are rising, but nobody has been keeping track of the problem until recently. New research by Christ Church College, Canterbury, shows that 13,400 children were expelled from schools in England last year, up 8% on the previous year. Some get a place in another school (often after weeks or even months of negotiations) but then get chucked out again. About 40% of expelled pupils get a place in a council-run "pupil-referral unit" (<font size=-1>PRU</font>). These usually provide only a part-time education, and a pretty poor one. An earlier Ofsted report said the standards in <font size=-1>PRU</font>s were "alarming". <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Around 27% get home tuition, but often for as little as two hours a week. All in all, says a study to be published next week by the Commission for Racial Equality (<font size=-1>CRE</font>), those expelled from school get, on average, one tenth of a full-time education in the year of expulsion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That leaves plenty of time for mischief. Youth crime costs &#163;1 billion a year, and a new Audit Commission report points out that 42% of those sentenced in youth courts have been expelled from school. The <font size=-1>CRE</font>'s report reckons that each excluded pupil who turns to crime costs the police &#163;2,000 to deal with.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So even though a full-time place in a <font size=-1>PRU</font> can cost up to six times the &#163;2,300 annual cost of a typical secondary-school place, there is a growing realisation that more such places must be provided and their standards must be improved. It is also becoming clear that it is time to rethink the consensus which has prevailed for the past 20 years, which says that almost all children, whatever their behavioural problems, should go to mainstream schools.<br>

<p><b>National Health Service</b></p>
<h1>Handing out the rations</h1>

FOR the past 50 years decisions about who would live and who would die were mostly taken behind closed doors by consultants. In theory, access to treatment was determined solely on the basis of clinical need. In practice, it was often determined by age, geography, marital status and the personal prejudices of the consultants making the decisions.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This will no longer wash, according to "Rationing and Rights in Health Care", a study published on November 20th by the Institute for Public Policy Research (<font size=-1>IPPR</font>). There are several reasons why. The purchaser-provider split, central to the government's health reforms, has made purchasing decisions more transparent. The Patients' Charter, which lays down maximum waiting times for operations, has also focused public attention on lack of resources. Many health authorities have had to make drastic changes to their priorities to reduce queues for operations. One in six authorities now excludes certain treatments such as cosmetic surgery, sex change and tattoo removal. Berkshire Health Authority has specifically excluded 12 treatments from <font size=-1>NHS</font> provision, among them treatment of varicose veins, snoring, and the removal of wisdom teeth.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Access to the most expensive care, such as fertility treatment, depends largely on geography. In some parts of Britain, <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation is provided free of charge. In others, such as Somerset, couples have to pay &#163;500-&#163;1,500 per treatment. Different places have different age thresholds. In Liverpool, treatment is restricted to women under the age of 35, in Humberside to those under the age of 40. Care for terminally-ill patients varies widely. Ealing and Hammersmith, for instance, provide in-hospital care for all patients who are diagnosed as likely to die within a year; in Bromley, by contrast, the threshold is two weeks.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The more sensitive the rationing decisions, the more covert they tend to be. In some health authorities, if your kidneys fail and you are over 65, you will quietly be allowed to die. Only 8% of patients receiving renal dialysis in Britain in the mid-1980s were aged over 65, compared with a quarter in Germany, France and Italy. There is no clinical justification for such ageism. The five-year survival rate for pensioners on renal dialysis is 62% compared with 44% for those aged 55-64, according to a study published in the British Medical Journal. Similar unjustified discrimination on age grounds can be seen in treatments for certain types of cancer and heart disease.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is a strong case, as the <font size=-1>IPPR</font> study argues, for bringing such decisions out into the open. "Priority setting", as the politicians prefer to call rationing, involves many, often <i>ad hoc</i>, decisions taken by ministers, health authorities, hospital consultants and doctors. The <font size=-1>NHS</font> spends &#163;100m every day. Those who pay for it have a right to know rather more than they do about how this money is being spent, and why.<br>

<h1>Citizen Gates</h1>

<p><b>Microsoft has made a fortune from software. Why is it so keen to risk much of it in the media business?</b></p><br>
EVERY few years, the titans of technology seem to fall under a strange spell. No matter how successful their own businesses may be, they begin to lust after the media market, driven by the vague notion that "content is king". In the late 1980s the spell lured Japanese consumer-electronics firms to Hollywood. In the mid 1990s America's telephone firms were bewitched into investing in television. All emerged poorer and wiser. Now it is the turn of Microsoft, the giant of the software industry.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This year Microsoft will spend some $400m on media projects, ranging from Web sites on the Internet to a cable-television news channel and a film studio. Its founder and boss, Bill Gates, has said he is prepared to lose $1 billion on such investments in the next few years. Microsoft will remain a software firm but with a big media sideline. As he often remarks, media firms, such as Disney, have built themselves into some of the greatest brands in modern history.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the face of it, this ambition seems strange. Last year Microsoft made profits of $2.2 billion on revenues of $8.6 billion. That dwarfs the profits of even the best media companies. The biggest of them, the Disney empire, earned $1.4 billion last year, while Rupert Murdoch's fearsome News Corp made just under $1 billion. Even the richest newpaper empires make less than half that. At best, media firms achieve margins of less than 12% and enjoy 15% annual growth; most live with single digits for both. By comparison, Microsoft has been growing by over 30% a year, and consistently enjoys net margins of over 25%. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So why would Microsoft taint its balance sheet with something as sluggish as media? The simplest answer: because it can. Microsoft has an astounding $7 billion in cash looking for a home. Rather than return the money to its shareholders, the company is entrusting it to the vision of Mr Gates. He reckons that one way or another software and content will merge: Microsoft's best bet is to hurry it along.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Anyway, he argues, the sort of media Microsoft is investing in are, for the most part, not the stodgy stuff of paper and film. Mr Gates is investing in "interactive content": as he puts it, <font size=-1>CD</font>-<font size=-1>ROM</font>s, Web sites, Internet services and the like. Such things are booming, at least in terms of the number of on-line readers and offerings, both of which are doubling each year (though no big Web publishing venture is making money yet and even <i>Wired</i>, the cybernaut's bible, is losing a fortune). Moreover, Microsoft knows a bit about this market, having executed a remarkable turnaround in the past year to become one of the leaders in Internet software.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Gates reckons that there are more similarities than differences between the software business his firm is good at and the new media it is developing. Both are driven by technology in which Microsoft excels. Both are brand-name businesses. And both share the economies of scale of digital reproduction and distribution. All sound familiar? Exactly: Japanese electronics firms said much the same things when they were throwing money around Hollywood. <br>
</p><p><b><b>Subscriptions, not synergies</b></b><br>
In fact, Microsoft's real financial justification for diving into media is not to search for synergies. Instead, it wants to take advantage of the new commercial opportunities the Internet opens up. And there it sees a chance to gain the main economic advantage that the media business has over software: subscriptions. Microsoft makes its money when consumers buy a new <font size=-1>PC</font> (which comes with a Microsoft operating system already installed); when they buy a box containing Microsoft programs (be it a word processor or an educational <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>); or when they upgrade a program with a newer version. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This limits Microsoft in two ways. First, it is hard--and getting harder--to win repeat sales. Computer programs are like tools: bought once and used many times. Microsoft has to persuade customers to keep throwing old tools away. But customers are becoming fed up with what they call "bloatware"--unnecessary features added to encourage them to upgrade. Increasingly, they are sticking with the tools they already have.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Second, traditional software ties Microsoft's growth to the fortunes of the <font size=-1>PC</font> industry. Since the company already dominates most of the biggest software markets, growth will tend to come not from new markets but new <font size=-1>PC</font> owners. Their numbers will rise by only 16% or so this year. To keep its shareholders happy, Microsoft needs to grow twice as fast.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Subscriptions--or "recurring revenues"--are one way to do that, by continuously milking existing <font size=-1>PC</font> users for more money, rather than simply waiting for new customers to come along. Microsoft is already selling some of its office software on subscription, with an annual fee guaranteeing support and upgrades. It offers subscriptions to some of its <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> titles. But most software buyers, who are not used to working this way, have been unimpressed.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So Microsoft is looking for more subscription businesses, and the natural choice is media. News changes constantly, and entertainment usually has a shelf life of days. This sort of business can generate a steady flow of cash. Microsoft is prepared to blanket the market with offerings in its search for gold. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Its efforts range from <i>Slate</i>, a political magazine available in both on-line and paper versions, to <i>UnderWire</i>, a Web site aimed at women. With <font size=-1>NBC</font>, an American television network, it runs <font size=-1>MSNBC</font>, a 24-hour news service, available both as a cable <font size=-1>TV</font> station and as a Web site (see <a href="wb1.gif">table</a>). The Web sites and on-line services are aimed at Microsoft's existing market of <font size=-1>PC</font> owners. But the hope is that <font size=-1>MSNBC</font> and Microsoft's investment in DreamWorks <font size=-1>SKG</font>, a new film studio, will reach a new--and potentially bigger--audience. And Microsoft reckons that the more compelling the media products it can put on the Web, the more people will want to buy <font size=-1>PC</font>s to get them, boosting all its businesses. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Seen as a loss-leader, new media may look a reasonable bet. But as a business in its own right, it is far riskier. Like most other new-media pioneers, Microsoft has no idea where, or when, it might make money from its on-line ventures. Take <font size=-1>MSNBC</font>: its cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> part works just like a normal cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> station, taking subscriptions and advertising. Its Web site, however, has a harder task: viewers on-line are reluctant to pay for subscriptions when so many other sites are free, and paying advertisers are still sceptical about the Web.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At least <font size=-1>MSNBC</font> can tap into traditional media markets. <i>Slate</i> has a harder task. It too has many rivals on the Web, most of which are free. For <i>Slate </i>to earn enough advertising revenue to pay its way, Microsoft insiders reckon that the cerebral weekly will need a regular readership of 400,000. That is about ten times as many as the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> has managed to draw with its massive daily on-line offerings. And charging for <i>Slate</i> (which Microsoft intends to do next February) is liable to chase away most of its readers. That, at any rate, has been the the experience of other Web magazines.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But, unlike its rivals, Microsoft has two big advantages in this new market. The first is its $7-billion war chest--and the fact that its boss is prepared to put a great deal of this on the line. <i>Slate</i>, <font size=-1>MSNBC</font> and their siblings can afford to lose money for years. No rival can claim as much.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second is that Microsoft can market its services through its ubiquitous Windows operating system. An icon on new computer screens already puts most users a single click away from <font size=-1>MSN</font>. In its next version of Windows, Microsoft plans to make the link even tighter, weaving Web content--anything from news to advertising-- into the <font size=-1>PC</font> "desktop". Already it has divided <font size=-1>MSN</font> into "channels" along such themes as entertainment, cars and travel. Ultimately, it hopes to take the broadcast analogy further, delivering a television-like stream of Microsoft content to <font size=-1>PC</font> screens.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Plenty of other firms aim to dazzle consumers the same way, although they may not have the same technological edge. Firms such as Pointcast created a market for such Internet "broadcasting" and are sure to adopt Microsoft's new technologies nearly as fast as it does. Others, such as <font size=-1>C/NET</font> and HotWired, are creating channels of their own, and even sometimes producing cable-television programmes to show on them. Microsoft is launching Web sites for local information (starting with listings of entertainment)--but so are two competitors called CitySearch and Yahoo, while local newspapers are moving in too.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ultimately, the new media market will not be won by technology. Just as magazines distinguish themselves by the quality of writing rather than the speed of their printing presses, so the media victors will be those with the most creativity and talent. If these are qualities that can be bought, then Microsoft's greatest advantage will be its bank account. If not, Mr Gates's media ambitions may eventually join yesterday's newspapers in the bin.<br>

<h1>No Mickey Mouse business</h1>

THE media business is full of glamorous companies, but there is only one real star: Walt Disney. Last year, Disney made a profit of $1.4 billion on revenues of $12 billion, far outshining other entertainment firms. One of its biggest fans is none other than Bill Gates, the boss of Microsoft, the world's biggest independent computer-software firm.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So it is ironic that Microsoft may soon come head-to-head with Disney on what Microsoft might consider its own turf: cyberspace. On November 19th Disney launched a Web-based shop selling hundreds of bits of Disney paraphernalia from Winnie-the-Pooh pyjamas to 101-Dalmatians watches. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The shop is not Disney's first foray on to the World Wide Web: the company has launched several Web sites tacked on to its various businesses, such as one for "Toy Story", an animated film, and another for Disneyland, an amusement park. Last autumn, it set up a new division to develop products for the Internet. And in two weeks' time, it launches family.com, an advertiser-supported Web site aimed at families. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the biggest clash may be yet to come. According to <font size=-1>C/NET</font>, a trade magazine, Disney will launch its own on-line service early next year, to offer access to the Internet as well as to feature its own content and characters. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That should frighten America Online, CompuServe and <font size=-1>MSN</font>, Microsoft's newly relaunched network. These online services make much of their suitability for children (<font size=-1>MSN</font> even has an area dedicated to the youngest surfers). Disney, with its strength in home entertainment and warm, furry family values, looks an ideal partner to help children (and their parents) through the hazards of the Internet.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many of Disney's other electronic ventures have succeeded. A couple of years ago it started selling educational software. In the first half of this year, four of the top six <font size=-1>PC</font> educational programs were produced by Disney, according to <font size=-1>PC</font> Data, a research firm in Virginia. Disney now holds more than 10% of a fragmented market. If Disney can do as well on-line (and it probably will), Mr Gates may wish that Donald, Mickey and their friends were not quite the impressive characters he so admires.<br>

<h1>Japan's Lou Gerstner</h1>

<p><b>Tadashi Sekizawa runs Fujitsu, Japan's biggest manufacturer of mainframe computers. Can he cope with the PC revolution?</b></p><br>
WALK into any Japanese office these days and you fall over empty boxes at every step. The reason is <font size=-1>PC</font>s. Nearly 6m of them were bought in Japan last year, up an awesome 70% from the year before. Two-thirds of them were bound for offices rather than homes. When offices in the United States went through the transition from mainframes to networked personal computers in the early 1990s, it created havoc at <font size=-1>IBM</font>, the world's largest computer maker. Now Fujitsu, the second largest, has begun to face much the same pressures. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>IBM</font> has been resuscitated over the past three years by Lou Gerstner, in one of the more dramatic corporate turnarounds of recent years. Tadashi Sekizawa, the dour 64-year-old telecommunications engineer who has run Fujitsu for the past six years, is altogether a different proposition: neither a marketing wizard nor a management guru. But he has been showing some equally impressive surgical skills. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Sekizawa has had some advantages denied to Mr Gerstner. For one thing, he had longer to prepare for the crunch. The domestic market has traditionally accounted for more than 80% of Fujitsu's business. Its large customers were locked into Fujitsu software running on Fujitsu mainframes. In addition, Japan's protracted recession discouraged Japanese companies from replacing their ageing mainframes with <font size=-1>PC</font>s. Even if they had wanted to do so, it would have been hard to find the <font size=-1>PC</font> software. Only lately has software such as Windows 95, Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Office become truly Japanised.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Luckily for Fujitsu, Mr Sekizawa saw what lay ahead. He has forced through a change in corporate culture almost as dramatic as Mr Gerstner's revolution at <font size=-1>IBM</font>. By Japanese standards, he has axed jobs brutally, cutting 10% of Fujitsu's 40,000 employees in the past three years. He has also moved vigorously into the cut-throat <font size=-1>PC</font> business. That has meant overcoming Fujitsu's snobbish dislike of manufacturing abroad. Fujitsu's new range of <font size=-1>PC</font>s is made in Taiwan, and up to 90% of the parts for its <font size=-1>PC</font>s are bought from suppliers in South-East Asia. That has cut manufacturing costs by 20-30%. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Sekizawa's other advantage over Mr Gerstner is that Fujitsu is broader than <font size=-1>IBM</font> was at its nadir. Last year, a third of its &#165;3.8 trillion ($39 billion) of consolidated sales and a similar share of its &#165;63 billion in net profit came from telecoms and microchips (Fujitsu is Japan's second largest supplier of telecoms equipment and fourth biggest microchip maker). It is thus a big beneficiary of Japan's new passion for cellular telephones. While overall profits may slide 40% or more this year, Fujitsu may well double its operating profit from cellular telephones and telecoms gear (see <a href="wb2.gif">chart</a>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, the key to Mr Sekizawa's vision of <font size=-1>PC</font>s is his background as a telephone engineer. He thinks <font size=-1>PC</font>s are becoming appliances like telephones. What he really wants to sell his customers is not so much the "handset", but the infrastructure that connects <font size=-1>PC</font>s together; services and software to make the tedious technology easier to use; and content that will coax subscribers to stay on line. He is enthralled by the Internet, and wants Fujitsu to be getting 30% of its revenue from Internet-related activities within two years. He has allocated almost half of Fujitsu's &#165;385-billion budget for research and development to ensure that it does.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Flights of fancy</b></b><br>
All this may turn out to be an expensive distraction from the task ahead. No one yet has found a way to deliver a reliable flow of revenue from surfing the Internet. Mr Gerstner understood that, and built his success at <font size=-1>IBM</font> on tackling problems in the most pedestrian of ways--ruthlessly cutting costs, rationalising the business and building on what he had.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Sekizawa may yet reach the same conclusion. Fujitsu's earnings are likely to be down sharply this year (from &#165;63 billion to perhaps a mere &#165;35 billion--though the company is forecasting &#165;50 billion) as the semiconductor slump continues. Last year Fujitsu invested massively in new chip-making factories in a bid to catch up on its rivals. The market promptly fell apart.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition, the company's mainframe sales abroad are making heavy losses. After losing $580m in 1993 and making a small profit in 1994, Fujitsu's American mainframe subsidiary, Amdahl, lost a further $288m in the first half of this year alone. <font size=-1>ICL</font>, the British mainframe maker that Fujitsu bought in 1990 for &#163;700m ($1.2 billion), made a &#163;194m loss last year and a further unspecified loss in the first half of this year. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Sekizawa's riskiest decision so far has been to dump <font size=-1>PC</font>s on Japan's domestic market at prices that have left rivals squealing with outrage. Industry watchers believe Fujitsu is losing up to 15% on every personal computer it sells in Japan (at a cost of more than &#165;100m a day). As an effort to retain its share of the market, the ploy is succeeding. Last year, Fujitsu leapfrogged from fourth to second place in the domestic <font size=-1>PC</font> market, more than doubling its share to 18.4%. That is still well behind <font size=-1>NEC</font>'s 40%, although Fujitsu is gaining so fast that the two companies could be neck and neck within a couple of years. But few believe it can go on losing money on its <font size=-1>PC</font> sales at the current rate. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fujitsu is now where <font size=-1>IBM</font> was three or four years ago. The restructuring has begun. The agony lies ahead.<br>

<p><b>Internet offerings</b></p>
<h1>On-line capitalism</h1>

<font size=1>NEW YORK</font><p>
<p><b>For small companies, selling stock has been a hugely expensive undertaking. The Web may change that</b></p><br>
EARLY next year, Ray Dallavecchia, the boss of a small toy and foam-products firm, plans to do something uncharacteristically daring. He will attempt to raise around $5m of equity capital. But he will not take the traditional route to market offered by venture capitalists or investment bankers. Rather, he intends to launch a do-it-yourself share offering on the Internet.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He will join a growing band of bosses from small firms who think that they have found in the World Wide Web a perfect way to sidestep the perils of Wall Street. Around 30 companies are in various stages of following the lead set by Spring Street Brewing, a New York beer maker, which pioneered Internet share offerings when it raised $1.6m last February. By appealing directly to investors via the Net, firms can raise money without spending a fortune on expensive underwriters. They can even sign up with a growing number of fledgling electronic stockmarkets, so that their shares can be traded. Already some 15 online investment banks are vying to help firms use the new technology. This trend could one day prove a potent threat to every sort of financial activity, from banking and accountancy to legal services, venture capital and share-dealing.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To understand why, consider the intriguingly named Poof Products, which Mr Dallavecchia has owned since 1991. The firm employs 45 people at a plant in Plymouth, Michigan, and sells more than $10m-worth of foam sports balls, puzzles and toys each year. But its industry is consolidating as retailers demand more products and broader marketing efforts than small firms can provide. Poof needs extra capital if it is to be an acquirer rather than someone else's acquisition.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hot-shot investment bankers are hardly knocking on Mr Dallavecchia's door. "Our funding needs are just too small to be of interest to most underwriters," he says. The few underwriters or venture capitalists who raise money for small firms such as Poof are astonishingly rapacious. A $5m offering might see as much as $700,000 eaten up in costs. The Internet offers an alternative. For $1,200 Mr Dallavecchia has bought a computer program called CapScape, which automates the tedious process of compiling an offer document. By using the program and then offering shares directly to investors over the Internet, Poof Products expects to raise its money at a cost of less than $100,000.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The savings offered by CapScape are formidable. The American government reckons that, on average, a share prospectus takes 900 hours to complete. CapScape's interactive worksheets shrink that to just 11 hours or so. The completed form must then be shown to a lawyer for review. But the professional fees involved in such an offering are relatively tiny: a few thousand dollars against perhaps $200,000 for a conventional prospectus for an initial public offering. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like the lawyers and accountants, the financiers too have plenty to fear from the new technology. Those who now specialise in raising money for small companies, particularly banks and venture capitalists, will face unaccustomed competition. Ben Ezra Weinstein, the investment-advisory firm from Albuquerque, New Mexico that developed CapScape, intends precisely that. Hence its choice of a toll-free phone number: 1-888-<font size=-1>VC-GOAWAY</font>.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Bypass operation</b></b><br>
Should Wall Street tremble? Not just yet, reckons Andrew Klein, a savvy lawyer who is the boss of Spring Street Brewing. "The biggest beneficiaries of this will be small and fast-growing companies," he says. "Potential Internet issuers are not likely to be complaining about the quality of the coffee at Goldman Sachs or other big investment banks. They will be firms that want to by-pass venture funds."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alongside his brewing interests, Mr Klein has started Wit Capital, an investment bank that also aspires to become an electronic stockmarket on which the shares of Internet offerings will be traded. By combining discount stockbroking with the underwriting of share issues, Mr Klein thinks he can widen the pool of investors who have access to newly-issued equity. In time, that could change how the stocks perform. New issues have a deserved reputation for volatility. On average they jump in price by nearly a fifth in the first hour of trading. That is because underwriters carefully control the pricing and direct the flow of shares to favoured customers, who then have the privilege of selling for an immediate premium. Investors who buy during that post-issue frenzy often end up with losses when prices tumble. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Imagine instead that shares in a new offering are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, as Wit Capital intends. Small investors would have the same chance as big institutions of getting in on the ground floor. The offering price would reflect true market demand, letting the issuer collect every penny of the shares' value rather than giving windfalls to a few lucky investors. Michael Weinstein, joint boss of Ben Ezra Weinstein, thinks that many of the small investors who would be drawn to a fairer market would want to hold onto their shares rather than sell them for a quick profit--an additional benefit to the issuer.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not that cyberspace share-dealers will have an easy ride. Existing fund-raisers are quick to point out that any smart crook can make an Internet offering. How might investors tell the real from the fake? A few Internet sites, such as the one run by Mr Klein and another by Clay Womack, a Californian entrepreneur, address this issue by promising to do thorough checks on companies that list shares for trading. Mr Womack has formed the Small Business Capital Acquisition Association, an independent body that will offer to guarantee the integrity of companies that list their stock on the Web. But, as in the physical world, money will attract crooks and the lure of fat returns will trap the gullible.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This will not deter Mr Dallavecchia, however. The commercial logic of Internet share offerings is so compelling that he is committed to the idea. Might his company's shares thereby be condemned to trade only on some obscure electronic bulletin board? Maybe. But Mr Dallavecchia is unconcerned. If nothing else, he should have investors who want to hold his shares as a long-term investment. No captain of industry could ask for more.<br>

<h1>Junius Jayewardene</h1>

AT A conference in San Francisco in 1951, called to discuss a peace settlement with Japan, Junius Jayewardene spoke for magnanimity towards the old enemy. It was an unexpected sentiment at the time. Japan's cruelties in the 1930s and in the second world war, which even now, many years later, continue to be a disturbing subject, were then fresh in people's minds. Mr Jayewardene, appealing especially to Asians at the conference, asked them to extend "the hand of friendship" and close "this chapter in the history of man". His speech, the shortest at the conference, was received with acclamation. The Japanese prime minister, Shigeru Yoshida, usually an impassive figure, burst into tears.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some would call Mr Jayewardene an opportunist who appreciated that Japan, backed and protected by America, was rapidly rising from its ashes. Not for nothing was he known as "the old fox", a nickname he rather relished. Certainly, Japan never forgot his gesture in San Francisco, and has treated Sri Lanka with generosity ever since. But, equally, it can be claimed that Mr Jayewardene had vision, looking beyond the world of the moment.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Asia, he said, had to put aside the past and find solutions to the daunting problems of the future. The most important of these was how best to make a living. Today, the free market and privatisation are everyone's ideology. But in 1977, when Mr Jayewardene at last became prime minister of Sri Lanka and was able to put his ideas into practice, liberalisation was new, especially in Asia. He ended the protectionism of the previous socialist government under Mrs Sirimavo Bandaranaike, dismantling controls on imports and foreign exchange. "Let the robber barons come in," he said happily. Since then, much has changed in Sri Lanka. It has had to endure a civil war. Mr Jayewardene's party has lost power to a coalition led by Mrs Bandaranaike's daughter, Chandrika Kumaratunga. But the economy continues to be run mostly as Mr Jayewardene would wish.<br>
</p><p><b><b>HisScottish governess</b></b><br>
For the first 40 or so years of Junius Jayewardene's life, Ceylon, as Sri Lanka used to be called, was still ruled by the British. The Jayewardenes had prospered. Mr Jayewardene's father, a judge in Ceylon's Supreme Court, believed the British empire would last for a thousand years, a view shared by other eminent Asian families who took on themselves a bit of the empire's grandeur. Young Junius had a Scottish governess, a Miss Munroe, and later kept a picture of her on his desk.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He became a lawyer, as his forebears had done for four generations. But politics lured him. One of his heroes was Benjamin Disraeli, a Victorian politician who did much to turn Britain into a world power. Mr Jayewardene helped to found the pro-western United National Party, and after independence in 1948, with his party in power, he held a number of ministries. But he had to wait until he was almost 71 to become prime minister and to reform the economy. The gains were immediately apparent, but from 1983 Sri Lanka saw its resources, including its young men, increasingly wasted in a conflict, still going on, between the Hindu Tamils, a minority who live mainly in the north, and the Buddhist Sinhalese.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Jayewardene, a Buddhist, is blamed by some Sri Lankans for misjudging the conflict. His economic reforms did not benefit the Tamil areas. While the rest of the country prospered, the Tamils continued to live in a poor ghetto. But it is uncertain whether, as some believe, the Tamils could have been wooed away from their demand for independence. The Tamil guerrillas, known as Tigers, have never wavered from their demands for a separate homeland. Generous offers by the present government, of autonomy within a form of federalism, have been rejected by the Tigers. India may be more to blame for the viciousness of the conflict. During Indira Gandhi's rule the Tigers were trained and armed by India. That policy was ended by Rajiv Gandhi, Indira's son and successor (who was later to be murdered by the Tigers). In 1987 India sent 50,000 troops into Sri Lanka as "peacekeepers", but they withdrew after suffering heavy casualties from the guerrillas they had trained too well.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A desperate Sri Lanka could have become a military dictatorship, the fate, for long periods, of its South Asian neighbours Pakistan and Bangladesh. Mr Jayewardene was often accused by opponents of being a dictator, particularly after he put through constitutional changes that made him executive president on the French model. But he believed that strength at the top was needed to keep Sri Lanka from falling into anarchy. Mrs Kumaratunga has clung to the presidency, although in opposition she promised to restore the British-style system. Junius Jayewardene retired without fuss in 1989 after ruling for 11 years. Afterwards, politicians and others often came to his home (called Braemar, his governess's birthplace) to get his thoughts. He would welcome them, even his critics. "There is nothing," said the old fox, "that gentlemen cannot discuss over a drink."<br>

<h1 align=center>Into Zaire</h1>


AT LAST help seems to be on its way. Despite their early reservations, the United States and Britain are lending their support to the proposed intervention force for Zaire. With luck, this Canadian-led force will enable aid agencies to go into eastern Zaire and help more than 1m refugees and thousands of local people facing starvation. For many it is already too late. The world has wilfully stood by as a disaster has unfolded. Now that it is belatedly stirring, it had better not repeat the mistakes it committed when, two years ago, it first watched a genocide in this part of Africa and then tried to mop up after it. The trouble is that, this time, everything will be even harder than before.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No one can say this crisis came unheralded. For months many voices have been warning of catastrophe and calling for the United Nations to act. This week in New York the Americans and the British delayed sending a <font size=-1>UN</font> force, first by saying intervention was unnecessary, then by blithely requesting more information. Their nervousness is understandable, though not their tardiness in overcoming it. The difficulties involved in trying to give help are huge, but it is cynical to pretend that they have not been apparent for months. The Americans in particular know that without their logistical--and financial--support, fast and effective intervention would be impossible. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even with American help, this cannot be a straightforward humanitarian operation (see <a href="ir6038.html">page</a>). Delivering food and medicine among rebels and refugees, some innocents, some guilty of genocide, has tortuous political and military implications. The only route for aid is through Rwanda. Understandably, but unforgivably, the Rwandan government is trying to dictate who joins the force and which aid agencies should be allowed to cross its borders. It does not want the removal of the new buffer zone created by its allies in eastern Zaire. Nor does it want the occupants of the Zairean refugee camps, among whom are Hutus who helped carry out the slaughters in Rwanda two years ago, to reassemble elsewhere in Zaire. Were they to do so, the new camps would become bases for attacks across the border.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These Hutus are not the only armed groups with an interest in controlling events. Some Zaireans are trying to get a slice of the action by demanding that all aid should go through the capital Kinshasa. Fortunately, they can be ignored: their army in the distant east of the country has virtually dissolved and, with the two main airports in rebel hands and no roads to send in reinforcements, central authority in the region is nil.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rebels in Zaire are more serious. They want food for themselves and--to help them gain political support--for displaced local Zaireans. But they do not want food to reach the mass of refugees or soldiers of the former Rwandan army and Hutu militiamen who hide among them. As for the militiamen, they want food for themselves and their families, and control over the distribution of aid so as to maintain their power over the other refugees. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The problem of the former Rwandan soldiers and Hutu militiamen arises largely because they were not disarmed, still less arrested and brought to trial, when the camps were set up two years ago. Separating them from the other refugees is one of two essential tasks for the intervention force--beyond the provision of security, shelter, food and medicine. Ideally, it should arrest the ringleaders and send them for trial at the international genocide tribunal in Tanzania. But, in the circumstances, keeping armed men out of the refugee camps may be as much as it is reasonable to expect.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second task is, in due course, to return the refugees to Rwanda. Had this been done before, the current troubles would be much simpler to deal with. One difficulty is that the better the camps are run, the more refugees will want to remain inside them. Another is that, even if the camps are dreadful, they may seem safer to frightened Hutus than returning to their villages. Separated from the extremist militiamen bent on revenge, the ordinary Hutu peasants may be more easily persuaded to go home. But, to persuade anyone to go back to such a turbulent country, it will be necessary to show them that a close watch will be kept on the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan government lest it sanction persecution.<br>
</p><p><b>Havens, not Utopias</b><br>
Outsiders, however well intentioned, cannot solve all, or maybe even any, of the political disputes in this part of Africa. The people of Rwanda and Burundi--85% of them Hutus and nearly all the others Tutsis--are likely to be quite literally at each others' throats for years to come. For that reason, Rwanda's Tutsi-led government cannot be considered stable in the long term. Zaire's government is already largely a fiction: the president is in France, stricken with cancer, and large areas of the country have long been running themselves with minimal interference from Kinshasa. It is little wonder that the rebels in the east have proved so successful.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Against this background, outsiders can hope only to alleviate the suffering, and avoid making political problems worse. If this intervention force is not to be followed by another in a couple of years' time, it should at least do its utmost to ensure that the camps it creates are short-term havens of peace, not long-term training grounds for killers.<br>

<h2>No survivors</h2>
<p>A Saudi Airlines Boeing 747 with 312 people aboard was in collision near Delhi with an Ilyushin freighter from Kazakhstan carrying 37 people. There were no survivors in the world's <b>worst mid-air crash</b>. </p>
<p>A car containing Myanmar's opposition leader, <b>Aung San Suu Kyi</b>,<b> </b>and her aides was stoned by youths, apparently on the orders of the military government. The United States said it was "outraged".</p>
<p>Bangladesh's opposition Nationalist Party began an indefinite <b>boycott </b>of parliament, claiming that its members were being prevented from speaking on national problems.</p>
<p>China said it was opening, for "education in patriotism", eight sites where Japanese soldiers committed <b>atrocities </b>in the second world war.</p>
<h2>New team </h2>
<p>Bill Clinton made his first <b>new cabinet</b> appointment, choosing Erskine Bowles, a North Carolina banker, to be White House chief of staff. Despite his vigorous defence of entitlements in the campaign, Mr Clinton told the leaders of the new Congress that he was keen on a balanced budget. </p>
<p>Riots broke out in St Petersburg, Florida, after a grand jury refused to bring criminal charges against a white policeman who had killed a black motorist.</p>
<p>The American army announced an investigation of <b>sexual harassment</b> at training bases after a survey revealed that 61% of army women said they had encountered it. </p>
<p>Official results confirmed conservative Arnoldo Aleman, with 51%, as winner of <b>Nicaragua's </b>presidential election, far ahead of Daniel Ortega, with 37.7%. But the Sandinist former president still refused to concede.</p>
<p>Meeting in Chile, Latin American and Iberian leaders agreed that free speech and free elections were essential to democracy. <b>Fidel Castro</b> signed up.</p>
<p><b>Guatemala's</b> government and rebels agreed to sign a peace deal, after 36 years of civil war, on December 29th.</p>
<p>Riots shook <b>French Guiana</b>, in theory part of France.</p>
<h2>Talking hunger</h2>
<p>Some 80 heads of state and government attended a five-day <b>World Food Summit</b> in Rome, sponsored by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. They promised to halve the 840m people facing chronic malnutrition--15% of the world's population--by 2015.</p>
<p>A <b>bomb</b> killed 14 people at a memorial service for the head of an Afghan veterans' group in Moscow. The attack was linked to tax privileges for the group, which is controlled by organised crime. </p>
<p>Turkey's interior minister, Mehmet Agar, resigned after a gangster, a police chief and a former beauty queen were killed together in a car crash. </p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>Silvio Berlusconi, leader of Italy's right-wing opposition, led more than 500,000 protesters in a <b>demonstration</b> against a government plan to raise taxes to help Italy qualify for Europe's single currency. Italy said it wanted to bring the lira back into Europe's exchange-rate mechanism, which limits currency fluctuations, by December. </p>
<p>Germany approved DM3 billion ($2 billion) of <b>emergency spending cuts</b> to hold the budget deficit in 1997 below 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>, the ceiling for countries that take part in Europe's planned economic and monetary union. The Christian Democrats and Free Democrats, partners in the ruling coalition, agreed to put off resolving a dispute over taxes that had threatened to wreck the coalition.</p>
<p>The European Union's auditor criticised the <font size=-1>EU</font> and its member governments for <b>lax financial management</b>. The Court of Auditors said in its annual report that fraud and other errors had amounted to $5.1 billion of the $95.8 billion budget.</p>
<p><b>Slovenia</b>'s Liberal Democracy party, led by Janez Drnovsek, the country's ex-communist prime minister, won the biggest block of seats in parliamentary elections. But an alliance of right-wing parties may unseat him. </p>
<p>Bulgaria's prime minister, <b>Zhan Videnov</b>, won a vote of confidence from leaders of his Socialist Party after its defeat in presidential elections. But Foreign Minister Georgi Pirinski quit, saying the government did not have enough support to remain in power.</p>
<p>Biljana Plavsic, president of the <b>Bosnian Serb Republic</b>, sacked the army chief, Ratko Mladic, an alleged war criminal. Military police opposed to Mr Mladic's removal detained the defence minister, Milan Ninkovic.</p>
<h2>Zaire mission</h2>
<p>America agreed "in principle" to send troops for a Canadian-led multinational force to protect humanitarian aid for more than 1m refugees in <b>eastern Zaire</b>. Britain has also offered troops. The <font size=-1>UN</font> said that thousands were already dying of starvation and thirst. After two days of negotiation with rebels in Goma, relief workers began distributing food on Wednesday but came under shell fire from one of the camps of Rwandan Hutu refugees. </p>
<p>With a <b>Palestinian-Israeli</b> deal on Hebron seemingly only hours away, Binyamin Netanyahu postponed a visit to Washington. The deal was not made. Earlier, Israeli troops fired on Palestinians demonstrating against a land seizure, killing one and wounding 11.</p>
<p>For the first time since the cold war, the United States government is to give allies military aid to help overthrow a hostile neighbour. Almost $20m worth of equipment is to be sent to Uganda, Ethiopia and Eritrea for use against the Islamist government of Sudan.</p>

<h2>Time and motion</h2>
<p>(See <a href="bw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>The European Court of Justice ruled that Britain must obey European Union rules imposing a <b>48-hour week</b> on member states. John Major, Britain's prime minister, argued that such rules would aggravate Europe's unemployment problem. He said that Britain would disrupt <font size=-1>EU</font> business in other areas unless the rules were overturned.</p>
<p>Zhu Jiazhen, China's labour vice-minister, predicted that <b>China's loss-making state firms</b> will sack some 14m workers over the next five years in order to cut their costs, and that roughly 130m peasants will stop farming and drift to the cities. Chinese newspapers warned him that the country's urban unemployment rate could leap from 2.9% to 7.4% by the year 2000.</p>
<p>Albert Dunlap, the boss of <b>Sunbeam</b>, an American household-appliances firm, lived up to his reputation as "Chainsaw Al". Mr Dunlap promised to halve the firm's 12,000-strong workforce, to shut 39 of its 53 factories and offices, and to discontinue 87% of its products.</p>
<p>Once one of America's most diversified conglomerates, <b>Westinghouse Electric</b>, said it would spin off the rest of its industrial businesses and move into cable-<font size=-1>TV</font>. The company is already America's biggest broadcast television and radio group.</p>
<h2>A new tone</h2>
<p>America and Europe inched closer to a deal that would liberalise their <b>telecoms</b> and <b>information-technology</b> markets. At a meeting of American and <font size=-1>EU</font> delegates, America promised to liberalise underwater cable services to the United States and both Europe and America agreed to abolish tariffs on many high-tech products by the second half of 1997. </p>
<p>Carlo Ciampi, Italy's treasury minister, is ringing the changes in the country's telecoms market. He announced that <b>Stet</b>, a state-controlled telecoms holding company, is to merge with Telecom Italia, its main operating unit. The government plans belatedly to privatise the new firm next autumn.</p>
<p>Yet another British regional electricity company (<font size=-1>REC</font>) is likely to end up in American hands. East Midlands Electricity accepted a &#163;1.3 billion ($2.2 billion) bid from <b>Dominion Resources</b>. Several other American utilities have bid for <font size=-1>REC</font>s. </p>
<p><b>Deutsche Telekom</b> decided to increase the number of shares to be issued in its forthcoming initial public offering from 500m to 600m.</p>
<h2>A new policy</h2>
(See <a href="bw2.gif">chart</a>)<br><b>AXA</b> and <b>Union des Assurances de Paris</b>, two French insurers, announced a $7.8 billion merger, which will create the world's second-largest insurer ranked by premiums. <font size=-1>AXA</font>'s chairman, Claude B&eacute;b&eacute;ar, who will run the merged group, promised to share his firm's "profit-minded" culture with <font size=-1>UAP</font>, whose shares have fallen 47% since the beginning of 1994.</p>
<p></td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>The Austrian government's six-year struggle to find a buyer for its 70% stake in <b>Creditanstalt</b>, the country's best-known bank, may soon be over. First Austrian, a savings bank, has rejoined a foreign consortium that would like to buy the stake. This should reassure those who want Creditanstalt to remain in Austrian hands. </p>
<h2>Digging deep</h2>
<p>British investigators joined a French probe into suspected <b>insider dealing</b> in the shares of Eurotunnel, which runs the Channel tunnel. An earlier investigation by the London Stock Exchange reportedly failed to uncover any evidence of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>A scandal temporarily shut down the <b>Athens stock exchange</b>. Most of Greece's 65 stockbroking firms said they would boycott the bourse until its clearing house settles outstanding trades left by Delta Securities, a small broker that collapsed after allegedly manipulating share prices and bouncing 2.6 billion drachma ($11m) of cheques. Arrest warrants were issued for three Delta executives.</p>
<p>A Swiss banking ombudsman said a nine-month search for dormant accounts belonging to <b>Holocaust victims</b>, which relatives of the dead claim contain billions of dollars, had unearthed a mere $8,750. The World Jewish Congress called his efforts "pathetic".</p>
<p>Ron Baker, the former head of derivatives trading at <b>Barings</b>, a British merchant bank that collapsed last year, was cleared of most of the charges brought against him by the Securities and Futures Authority, the securities industry's regulator. Mr Baker had been accused by the regulator of failing to show "due skill, care and diligence" in supervising his employees.</p>
<h2>Tokyo's bang</h2>
<p>The Japanese government unveiled an ambitious plan to <b>liberalise Japan's financial sector</b> by 2001. Barriers between the country's banks and securities firms are to be swept away, as are fixed stockbroking commissions and controls on insurance premiums. The finance ministry hopes that this will help Tokyo's capital markets to catch up with those in London and New York. </p>
<p>The Tokyo prosecutor's office charged <b>Yasuo Hamanaka</b>, the copper trader who lost Sumitomo Corp $2.6 billion this year, with forgery. Mr Hamanaka, who faces up to five years in jail if he is convicted, is also threatened with a civil suit from his former employer.</p>

<h1>Clinton II: The Strategy</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><p>
TWO days after the election, Bill Clinton slept the relaxed sleep of the victor, waking up past noon. He had proclaimed a mandate for the "vital centre" of American politics; his Republican opponents, newly reconfirmed in their control of Congress, had said they would be delighted to serve the centre too. On all sides, there was talk of bipartisan co-operation. Then, on the third day, the president rose up and gave a press conference. The Republicans pounced.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The press conference, and the reaction to it, suggest how different this transition is from the one that followed Mr Clinton's election four years ago. Then, Mr Clinton had issued a list of large campaign promises--a tax cut, a stimulus package, more jobs, more health insurance, welfare reform--with little thought given to how these could be implemented: Mr Clinton was agonising over his priorities right up until inauguration day. This time, however, Mr Clinton has won election on a more modest programme, and has few doubts about his priorities. But, in contrast to four years ago, he faces a Congress controlled by the opposing camp.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both at the press conference, and again in a television interview two days later, Mr Clinton declared that balancing the budget is at the top of his agenda; spreading tertiary education, making a success of welfare reform, extending health insurance in small increments and cleansing campaign finance follow. Already, reducing the deficit from $290 billion to $107 billion stands out as the big achievement of his first term in office. Other presidents have ended slavery or vanquished foreign dictators. Mr Clinton wants to be the first president since 1969 to balance the government's books.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is more than a little irony in this. Until just over a year ago, Mr Clinton disdained Republican calls to eliminate the deficit. He then changed course, seeing political advantage in fiscal virtue; but he nonetheless spent much of the election campaign denouncing Republican budget cuts as too harsh. Now, smiling genially, he marvels at how little difference there is between Republican proposals and his own. He declares that a budget-balancing deal could be done in "next to no time"--indeed, that it is "easily achievable" next year.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Republicans will come to relish these comments if Mr Clinton fails. And the obstacles are daunting. For one thing, the impressive progress on the budget in Mr Clinton's first term is due mainly to the tax increases of 1990 and 1993 and to the strong economy. Mr Clinton is not going to raise taxes again, and the economy is unlikely to remain robust for ever. In the absence of bold spending cuts, the deficit will grow rather than disappear.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And politics will make cutting tricky. Mr Clinton wants to laugh off his campaign assault on the cuts proposed last year by the Republicans, but the Republicans are not amused. On November 12th Mr Clinton invited the leaders of Congress to the White House, hoping to mark out common ground on the budget. But the Republicans conceded nothing. Having borne the brunt of Mr Clinton's attacks, they are determined that he should take the responsibility for suggesting cuts this time--cuts that Republicans can denounce at the next election. "We're in this boat together and we have to paddle it together," the president had pleaded earlier in the day. You steer, was the Republican reply. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This exchange may set the pattern of the next few months: the president longing for congressional Republicans to join him in policy-making, the Republicans politely coy. The Republicans hope that, if Mr Clinton is forced to take the lead, he will damage his reputation as much as he did during his first years in power, when his crusade for a tax increase and for health reform cost his party control of Congress in the 1994 election. Yet the Republicans' waiting game may not work much better than the president's genial smiles. For there are big differences between now and 1993-94.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unlike four years ago, there are few signs that Mr Clinton will veer to the unpopular left after his election. Rather than mulling a tax increase, he is committed to tax cuts. Rather than seeking a dramatic increase in the federal government's role in health care, he is set on modest advances. A month ago, it seemed possible that the trade unions' contribution to the Democrats' congressional campaign might force the new administration leftwards. But the unions' ads proved less effective than many had expected, freeing Mr Clinton to ignore their ideas.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is reflected in Mr Clinton's choice of second-term officials. Several of his more leftish advisers are on their way out: Robert Reich, the labour secretary; George Stephanopoulos and Harold Ickes, two White House officials; and possibly Henry Cisneros, the housing secretary. Meanwhile Mr Clinton's treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, and his new chief of staff, Erskine Bowles (see <a href="am3127.html">page</a>), are both conservative investment bankers. To cap it all, the president has let it be known that he hopes to appoint Republicans to his cabinet. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If Mr Clinton stays on the centre ground, the Republicans' refusal to support his policies may look petty. On campaign finance, for example, Mr Clinton has declared his support for a bill that would offer candidates free television ads in exchange for voluntary spending limits, and would control the flood of cash to national parties. The Republican leadership, by contrast, scoffs at this bill, preferring to attack Democrats' fund-raising from foreigners. But the bill is sponsored, among others, by Senator John McCain, a respected Republican. On this issue, voters may give Mr Clinton credit for reaching across party lines while Republicans played politics.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The other issues on Mr Clinton's agenda may draw similar verdicts. It will be hard for the Republicans to block the president's education plans without looking mean. Nor can they object to incremental health reform; one law of this sort, to which many sound objections could have been raised, passed the Senate unanimously this summer. Even welfare, once a good issue for Republicans, may yet embarrass them. In the past, Republicans could attack Mr Clinton for blocking schemes that would make the supposedly indolent poor earn their own keep. Now that the new welfare law requires poor mothers to get work, Mr Clinton is demanding only that jobs should be found for them. Republicans can hardly object to that. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the end, all the squabbles over these parts of Mr Clinton's second-term agenda will matter less than the big one on the budget. Yet here, too, the Republicans may be on weaker ground than they suppose. If they wait for Mr Clinton to propose his own budget cuts, they will undoubtedly get ones that promise progress on the deficit, but which nonetheless preserve the president's claim that he is less harsh than his adversaries. The Republicans will then be faced with a tough choice. If they pass the budget, they will allow the president to claim victory for his plan; if they block it, they allow him to accuse them of reckless obstruction. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because of this, the Republicans may not stick to their waiting game for long. They will strive, instead, to come up with their own agenda for a second term, and to push it in parallel to the president's. This may bring them some success. On November 11th the Republicans let it be known that, by their count, the election had given them the votes to pass a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. This had an immediate effect: the next day Mr Clinton softened his old opposition to the measure. Their appetites whetted by this easy victory, Republicans may soon be pushing other schemes. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All of which suggests a paradox. A week ago, when the election results came in, Americans seemed to have voted for gridlock. They had not liked either party's schemes, and so they had sought to block both sides by dividing power between them. And yet, if the Republican waiting game does backfire, the opposite of gridlock may transpire. Mr Clinton may find that his policies sail through Congress; the Republicans may find that many of their ideas win Mr Clinton's support. Instead of one activist government, America might just get two of them.<br>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><p>
ALL presidents tend to develop a growing sense of the importance of good management. As an aide to President Kennedy once said, "Everybody believes in democracy until he gets to the White House, and then you begin to believe in dictatorship, because it's so hard to get things done." Jimmy Carter at first thought he could get by without a chief of staff, but discovered the hard way that he was wrong. From the contrast between Mr Clinton's first chief of staff (his old Arkansas friend Mack McLarty, a nice man but a Washington novice) and his second (Washington-wise Leon Panetta, a huge success), Mr Clinton has had a clear lesson in what a vital post it is.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So vital that the president chose as his first post-election task the replacement of Mr Panetta, who wants to return to California. With some effort, Mr Clinton persuaded Erskine Bowles, a banker who learnt his trade with Morgan Stanley, to drop his new banking venture in North Carolina and return to Washington. The choice drew a warm reaction even from two usually hostile Republicans, Senators Jesse Helms and Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina. They respect Mr Bowles not only for his business acumen, but also for his pedigree: his wife, Crandall, is from a prominent local textile family and his father grew up with Mr Helms in Monroe, North Carolina.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton met Mr Bowles only four years ago, when Mr Bowles was raising money for the 1992 campaign. They quickly bonded, not least on the golf course. Appointed to head the Small Business Administration, Mr Bowles set about reducing the voluminous paperwork for <font size=-1>SBA</font> loans to a single sheet. Then, as deputy chief of staff, he reorganised the president's schedule to allow more time for thinking. Even after he left the White House last January, Mr Clinton still turned to Mr Bowles for delicate tasks such as handling the resignation of Dick Morris, the president's political consultant, in the midst of a sex scandal.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Businesslike" and "focused" are the words used to describe Mr Bowles by people who have worked with him. You will not hear from him any dreamy talk of bridges to the new millennium. Instead, in a deliberate southern drawl, you hear the sort of phrases found in business textbooks: "I believe in having an administration that has clearly defined goals, objectives and time lines such that it and its people can be held accountable." The Bowles regime promises few thrills and much discipline.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Which is how it should be. Without the prospect of an election to concentrate the presidential mind, the need for discipline in the White House is all the greater. Bowlesian management should help with agenda-setting, too. For the past two years, Mr Clinton has proved himself to be brilliant on the counter-attack against a Republican Congress. But now the policy initiative is back with him. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unlike Mr Panetta, Mr Bowles does not have years of experience on Capitol Hill to help him in the delicate task of dealing with Congress. But he does have a keen sense of time-management, at a stage when time is precious. To put it in the language of the new administration, Mr Clinton's stock is now up, but typically the bull market for second-term presidents does not last long. <br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>Hello, world</h1>

WHAT a rude interruption. Bill Clinton had hardly had time to celebrate his election victory. He was in the process of trying to put together a new foreign-policy team, one that could help him earn a distinguished place in the history books. He was about to set off to the Pacific for a bit of rest and a bit of diplomacy. And what should intrude? A foreign-policy crisis.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With memories still fresh of America's humiliation in Somalia early in Mr Clinton's first term, hurried decisions over sending troops to another African disaster area were not what the president would have wished for as an immediate post-election challenge. The situation in Zaire has all the potential for the sort of trouble that Americans are so wary of: complicated lines of command, the possibility of mission creep, fuzziness of objectives and of exit strategy. Awkwardly, the costs will complicate the administration's budget-balancing efforts. And embarrassingly, just as Mr Clinton was hoping for a second term marked by "indispensible" American world leadership, here was America struggling to keep up with an initiative promoted and headed by Canadians. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In truth, America was caught napping. First there was the distraction of the election, not a time when a president wants to talk about putting American soldiers in harm's way. Then there was the distraction of personnel changes. The president's top foreign-policy priority was reshuffling his team. The secretary of state, Warren Christopher, his sights on his own exit, set off on a final diplomatic journey. The Pentagon, whose boss, William Perry, is also on the way out, had the added diversion of a growing sexual-harassment scandal at army training camps.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the world does not wait obligingly for Americans to get their administrative house in order before posing its problems. Zaire is not the only matter calling for urgent attention. In Bosnia, which this week has seen the worst outbreak of fighting since the Dayton peace agreement nearly a year ago, decisions loom on the commitment of American troops for the longer term. Other issues--from <font size=-1>NATO</font> enlargement to the appointment of the United Nations secretary general, from the currently scratchy relations with France to the perpetually fraught policy towards Cuba--are crowding in.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this is complicated by the outcome of last week's election. Many of the senators who knew and cared most about the world have now left Congress. But one cantankerous presence remains as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: Jesse Helms, the senior senator from North Carolina. Mr Helms is not only stingy to a fault on the budget for foreign policy, meddling in his attempts to reorganise agencies and determined to intensify the cold war against Cuba. He is also deeply hostile towards the <font size=-1>UN</font>. In a recent article in <i>Foreign Affairs</i>, he argued that that this "power-hungry and dysfunctional organisation" was a threat to American national interests and that its bureaucracy needed to be cut at least by half; if it failed to reform, according to Mr Helms, America should withdraw from it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet in another sense the conditions for grappling with foreign-policy decisions are more benign than they have ever been under the Clinton presidency. When Mr Clinton first came to the White House, he tended to see such issues as an unwelcome distraction from his busy domestic agenda. Over the past four years, through many a stumble, he has gained experience and credibility. And now, with a relatively slim agenda at home, foreign policy offers a bigger field for Mr Clinton's energies, a worthy challenge for a maturing second-term president.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He should therefore welcome the intrusion of the outside world, with all its complications. A new foreign-policy team--in particular, a more dynamic secretary of state--can signal a new sense of activism. But an effective team needs strong leadership from its captain, the president himself.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In part, the president's task is one of salesmanship. He has to sell the idea of foreign troop deployments, for example, to an inward-looking nation and a sceptical Congress. Further trade liberalisation, of the sort he will be discussing with America's Asia-Pacific partners, is also a hard sell, which is why so little was said about it during the election campaign; but it would be a worthy second-term crusade, which could begin with an effort to persuade Congress to expand the North American Free-Trade Agreement to allow the entry of Chile. The president will have to convince Congress to approve the extension of <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s security guarantees to new members in Central Europe. He will need to make allies see the seriousness of America's security concerns (in their dealings with Iran, say) and make sure that enemies (such as Iraq) appreciate the serious consequences of any misbehaviour. Not least, there is the job of persuading Congress to provide adequate money for the conduct of foreign policy. Leadership does not come cheap.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Effective salesmanship is difficult if it comes in the context of a foreign policy conducted on a case-by-case basis. That has been the approach taken by Mr Christopher, on the assumption that the post-cold-war world remains too confusing, and its security challenges too diffuse, for any overarching vision or doctrine to have much practical value. It is high time to question that assumption and to work out a clear ordering of American interests, along with a clearer rationale for the resources needed to pursue them. That would facilitate the task of salesmanship-- and it would make America's foreign policy less reactive and more creative.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No one would pretend that such clarity of purpose can come easily. It requires a formidable investment of time and effort. That is why Mr Clinton's designated time-manager--the next chief of staff, Erskine Bowles--should make sure that plenty of presidential "thinking time" is set aside for foreign policy. Too bad that it takes an African tragedy and Canadian prodding for America to wake up. But with the election out of the way, at least Mr Clinton is beginning to give foreign policy the attention it deserves.<br>

<h1>The world makes up its mind(s) about Zaire</h1>

<font size=1>KIGALI</font><p>
SHAMED by Canada, the United States at last this week declared its willingness to send troops to Zaire--albeit, it said initially, only "in principle" and "in a limited fashion". Its commitment will help clear the way for a United Nations mandate under Chapter 7 which will allow the force to deal firmly with anyone who obstructs it. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Memories of American deaths in Somalia, the presidential election, the end of a reign at the State Department and anxiety about the cost of an open-ended military commitment in a political quagmire, all contributed to American hesitation. But in the end the humanitarian imperative once again is dragging in the armies of the rich, even before their screens have been filled with images of disease and death among the 1m-plus refugees in eastern Zaire. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Zaire is no Somalia, but the core of the mission, protecting humanitarian aid in a war zone, is similar. The rest of the world may want to see starving children saved, but this is not necessarily a priority for the region's governments, rebels and warlords. So what are the local agendas that an intervening force will bump up against? <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Zaire itself, for example, the government spokesman has called it treason for any aid agency to negotiate with the rebels in eastern Zaire, demanding that all aid go through Kinshasa. Top of any normal Zairean politician's agenda is his own rake-off; second, his future when President Mobutu Sese Seko has gone. Zaireans are also watching anxiously for other uprisings in parts of Zaire with a history of secession, though so far even the traditionally rebellious provinces of Shaba and Kasai are quiet. The eruption in Kivu seems to have united Zaireans in nationalist fervour against a "Rwandan invasion" which, they say, is aimed at establishing a Tutsi empire. Too bad that years of neglect of the region that is now so dear meant that no roads were built to it, so that Zaire's defeated troops in Kivu cannot be reinforced. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rebels too have strong views on food aid. Laurent Kabila, their leader, wants it for local Zaireans, so long as he can be identified with the distribution. But he does not want food to reach the Hutu refugee camps north and west of Goma that his troops are now attacking. On his mind is the prospect, or fantasy, of sweeping across Zaire and overthrowing the government in Kinshasa. His immediate task--vigorously under way on Thursday--is to defeat the remains of the old Rwandan army and the Hutu militiamen in the camps. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What do these Hutus think about food aid or multinational force? They are hard pressed by the rebels and must be desperate for food. Their fears that an intervention force may try to disarm or even arrest them are likely to prove false. But they have few friends. The Zairean government, which once supported them, is now out of reach and their former French allies will not help them unilaterally this time. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rwanda, the Americans' local ally, is the real winner in eastern Zaire. Despite appeals for the refugees to return, the Kigali government may not care whether they live or die, so long as they stop coming back across the border as guerrillas. It knows many took part in the 1994 genocide, and it might be happier if all disappeared in the jungles of Zaire. Its worry is that an intervention force will let the Hutu militiamen escape or regroup in new refugee camps. At the moment, with a buffer zone created by its allies, the Zairean rebels, Rwanda feels secure. Burundi too. Its military regime, pressed by international sanctions and Hutu guerrilla infiltrations from Zaire, has been given breathing space. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So much for regional politics. The outsiders are not neutral either. The French, once the only major foreign power in the region, are still hurt at criticism of their intervention in 1994, which saved lives but also--unavoidably, but not by mere coincidence--helped the perpetrators of genocide to escape to Zaire. They are bitter about the anglophone takeover of Rwanda, and further complain that the United States is giving unqualified support to a regime in Rwanda which is dominated by a minority, took power by force and shows no sign of allowing much democracy. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the crisis broke more than two weeks ago, the United States, like the Rwandan government, opposed sending even food aid, hoping that the trouble would drive the refugees back into Rwanda. Only last weekend the American ambassador to Rwanda asserted that military intervention was unnecessary. "The Americans are playing a power game," said a European diplomat in Kigali this week. "It matters much more to them to keep this Rwandan regime in power than to help the refugees." <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rwanda is the latest in a chain of African countries stretching south from Eritrea that have become close allies of the Americans. It has had vital military aid from them. Last week it emerged that three others, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda, were to be given $20m worth of military equipment to fight Islamist Sudan. America may be reluctant to put its troops on the ground, but it has its ideas for the region.<br>

<p><b>Politics</b></p>
<h1>Polls apart</h1>

IF YOU read the <i>Sunday Times</i>, you recently learnt that Labour's lead over the Tories had "fallen to its lowest for nearly three years". If you read the <i>Guardian</i>, the Tories received "a powerful boost" with a five-point cut in Labour's poll lead. If you read <i>The Times</i> you were first told that "Blair surges ahead" but then that "Tory support has jumped". If, however, you read the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, an "ominous black cloud" still hangs over the Tories.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Divergent findings are not good for polling firms' credibility--and after their failure to predict the Tory win in the 1992 general election the polls do not have credibility to spare. The pollsters are therefore worried. <font size=-1>MORI</font> reacted to criticism of its first <i>Times</i> poll, which showed an unlikely-sounding 28-point Labour lead, by putting out a table of recent polls, published and unpublished, claiming most were in line with its<i> </i>finding. However, it also conducted a second poll for <i>The Times</i>, published on November 14th, which showed Labour's lead down from 28% to 17%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The problem is compounded because different firms publish results compiled on different bases. Some pollsters believe that crude results exaggerate Labour's lead. They argue that those who refuse to answer their questions include a disproportionate percentage of Tories, reluctant to admit the fact in today's hostile climate. They also point out that, when you ask people how they voted in 1992, more say "Labour" than "Tory", although the Tories won the election. This suggests that their samples may be biased towards Labour. They try to correct for these factors.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such adjustments are not yet proven to produce more accurate figures. So other pollsters prefer not to make them. Of the controversial recent polls, two (by <font size=-1>ICM</font> and <font size=-1>NOP</font>) which show the Tories doing well headlined their adjusted figures. The other three (the two <i>Times</i> polls by <font size=-1>MORI</font> and one by Gallup) did not. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, adjustment does not fully explain the differences. Even when you compare like with like, the results are all over the place. The adjusted Tory vote is put at between 30% (<font size=-1>MORI</font> 1) and 34% (<font size=-1>ICM</font> and <font size=-1>MORI</font> 2); Labour at between 47% (<font size=-1>NOP</font>) and 53% (<font size=-1>MORI</font> 1); the Labour lead at between 13% (<font size=-1>ICM</font>) and 23% (<font size=-1>MORI</font> 1). Two polls had Labour sharply up on the month and three had it down.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This may be a run of bad luck. Over time, most samples will more or less accurately reflect the whole population, but individual samples may not. Internal evidence casts doubt on some of this month's samples. <font size=-1>ICM</font>'s, for example, showed that an unusually high proportion of those questioned said that they had voted Tory in 1992, while <font size=-1>MORI</font> 1's had an unusually high proportion saying they had voted Labour then. <font size=-1>ICM</font> scaled down its usual adjustments to allow for this, but it may be that they just happened on an unusually pro-Tory sample and <font size=-1>MORI</font> 1 a pro-Labour sample in the month.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the moment, all polls agree on one finding: Labour is miles ahead. As the election approaches, however, the margin seems sure to narrow. Pollsters will secretly pray that the margin between their findings narrows too. Otherwise voters may start to switch off polls just at the stage in the political cycle when they ought to be of greatest interest.<br>

<font size=1>EDINBURGH</font><p>
UNIONISTS like to warn nationalist-minded Scots of the awful things that would happen to their vulnerable economy, should they be silly enough to vote for devolution or independence. But a stockmarket index of Scottish companies' performance which became available on November 11th shows that Scotland's indigenous companies have performed better, over the past decade, than those of Britain as a whole.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The index has been compiled by the <i>Scotsman </i>newspaper, Reuters, a news and financial data agency, and <font size=-1>HSBC</font> James Capel, a stockbroking firm. They have tracked the share performance of the biggest 50 Scottish companies (those which have Scottish head offices or do most of their business from Scotland) quoted on the Stock Exchange from 1985 (see <a href="br1.gif">chart)</a>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Scottish firms are pretty small-- the index has a market capitalisation of &#163;32 billion, compared with the <font size=-1>FTSE</font> 100's &#163;670 billion. Banks and insurance firms (35% of the index) are over-represented; pharmaceutical firms and telecommunications companies are not represented at all. Yet despite these weaknesses, while the Scottish index closely followed the ups and downs of the <font size=-1>FTSE</font> index, the value of the Scottish companies has steadily grown at a faster pace: &#163;300 invested in Scottish firms in 1985 would now be worth &#163;1,000, whereas a similar sum invested in the <font size=-1>FTSE</font> 100 companies would have risen to &#163;800.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite Tory claims that Scottish nationalism frightens the markets, politics does not seem to have much effect on the index. Between August 1991 and March 1992, when opinion polls claimed to show that Labour was likely to win the 1992 election and when devolution and even independence were high on the Scots' agenda, the Reuters/Scotsman 50 index fell by 10%. But the <font size=-1>FTSE</font> 100 index also dropped by 8% over the same period.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Takeovers make more difference. In 1987, when <font size=-1>BP</font> bid for Britoil, a Glasgow-based oil firm, the Scottish index leapt up by 38%, three times more than the <font size=-1>FTSE</font> 100 index rose. This particular takeover, while it cheered investors, dismayed many Scots who feared that control of too many Scottish firms might be draining away to distant boardrooms, leaving a vulnerable branch economy north of the border.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But privatisation (also much deplored by Scots) has helped to reverse the takeover trend. Six of the companies in the index are former state-owned businesses which have all expanded by buying up rivals. Two, Scottish Power, an electricity generator, and Stagecoach, a bus operator, have snapped up enough firms in England to make them feared predators rather than juicy targets.<br>

<p><b>Civil service</b></p>
<h1>Mission impossible</h1>

SIR ROBIN BUTLER, the cabinet secretary, has a mission to resist the politicisation of Britain's non-partisan civil service. His latest target is Michael Heseltine, the deputy prime minister.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This summer, Mr Heseltine instructed Whitehall civil servants to identify "cheerleaders" among providers of government services to speak up for the government's public-service reforms--ie, defend the Tories. One cabinet minister who learnt of the instruction ordered officials to bin it. Then, at Sir Robin's behest, Mr Heseltine withdrew. "A blatant abuse of government power," said John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, when news of the incident emerged this week. "No minister will tolerate the politicisation of the civil service in this country," Mr Heseltine retorted.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Allegations of politicisation keep popping up all the same. This summer the First Division Association, the mandarins' union, reported more than 20 complaints from members who had been asked to do work which might compromise their political neutrality. Examples included preparing material for election manifestos, altering official reports to provide a party political slant, and briefing for public-relations events during party conferences.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In theory, mandarins are better protected against this kind of thing than they have ever been. The rules set out in "Questions of Procedure for Ministers" say that ministers must not use public resources for party-political purposes. A new civil-service code protects civil-service ethics, and gives civil servants the right of appeal to Sir Michael Bett, the independent First Civil service commissioner, if they feel they have been asked to act improperly.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Detailed instructions govern their relations with journalists. Yet more instructions lay down what civil servants may and may not do to cost Labour proposals. Roger Freeman, Mr Heseltine's deputy, on November 11th proposed further protection for them, offering to co-operate with Labour to put a new Civil Service Act on the statute book. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So why do allegations of impropriety keep surfacing? The immediate cause is the approach of the general election. Ministers are more and more desperate to win the propaganda war with Labour, and want Whitehall to provide the ammunition. Whitehall knows it may soon be serving new masters, and does not want to prejudice its acceptability to them. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But there is a longer-term trend at work too. Thirty or forty years ago, the line between government and party matters was clearer. Politics intruded less into ministerial lives. They governed largely according to the advice of their civil servants, only rarely taking to the platform or the airwaves to score political points. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All that has changed. In their new book, "The State under Stress" (Open University Press, &#163;16.99), Sir Christopher Foster and Francis Plowden chart the increased politicisation of government. Ministers often take decisions without civil service advice. The system of cabinet committees has atrophied in favour of government by <i>ad hoc </i>cabals of ministers. Ministers allow themselves to be directly lobbied by <font size=-1>MP</font>s who are themselves often directly in the pay of commercial organisations. Moreover, a successful minister is a minister who is on <font size=-1>TV</font>--and when he is, his party expects him to score partisan points.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We thus have a world where the "government of the day", headed by ministers, is far more political than it used to be, and where partisan politics becomes ever more intense. No wonder civil servants find it harder and harder to draw lines between their duty to serve the government loyally and their equal duty to be non-partisan. Acts, appeals and codes cannot resolve such tensions--which may mean that Sir Robin's mission turns out to be impossible.<br>

<p><b>Complementary medicine</b></p><h1>The new-age NHS</h1><br><p><b>Unorthodox remedies such as aromatherapy and healing are becoming available on the NHS as doctors find they can do miracles for their budgets</b></p><p>AN ELDERLY woman goes to her doctor complaining of arthritis in her knees. He gives her some tablets but the next week she is back in the surgery complaining that the pills give her an upset stomach. She is given more tablets to treat this side-effect but is soon back again saying that the second set of pills made her ankles swell. She is in turn given tablets to treat this, which cause muscle cramps, requiring a fourth set of pills, and so on. By now, the woman feels sicker than when she started.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This sort of case, not uncommon, is one reason why the medical profession is abandoning its customary conservatism and becoming less dismissive of "new-age remedies", from osteopathy (which is on the verge of becoming orthodox) to faith healing (which is not). Even though most doctors still doubt the scientific validity of such treatments, they are increasingly prepared to use them, because they seem to work better on some types of patient than stuffing them with pills--and often at a lower cost.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The medical authorities have gradually adopted a softer line on their use, and many such treatments are now available on the National Health Service (<font size=-1>NHS</font>). Since doctors are prescribing them alongside the orthodox ones they learnt at medical school, they are now officially described as "complementary medicine". Until quite recently doctors could be struck off if they prescribed unconventional treatments. As recently as 1986 the British Medical Association (<font size=-1>BMA</font>) dismissed them as a "passing fashion". However, an exception has long been made for homoeopathy: this has been available on the <font size=-1>NHS</font> since its foundation in 1948, partly because of the royal family's patronage.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The increasing use of complementary therapies has mostly been the result of individual doctors acting on their own initiative. In order to study the implications for the <font size=-1>NHS</font> as a whole, the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts recently launched a detailed study of why doctors are prescribing complementary therapies, how much they are spending on them, and what they are doing to measure their effectiveness. A preliminary survey, in 1993, found that the <font size=-1>NHS</font> was spending at least &#163;1m a year on complementary medicine, but the new study is expected to show that the actual figure is far higher.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last year, a survey by Sheffield University of 760 general practicioners found that 40% were offering some form of complementary therapy on the <font size=-1>NHS</font>, especially acupuncture (an ancient Chinese method which aims to cure patients by sticking needles into them), homoeopathy (the use of extremely dilute extracts of natural substances which cause symptoms similar to those being treated), osteopathy and chiropractic (which both involve manipulation of the joints). One doctor's surgery, in Cullompton, Devon, employs a healer who believes her powers come from God. The Royal Liverpool University Hospital offers aromatherapy (massage with plant oils) and reflexology (massaging points on the feet and hands which are supposedly linked to other parts of the body) to treat kidney, bowel and ear complaints.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Edzard Ernst, professor of complementary medicine at Exeter University, says that, apart from osteopathy and chiropractic, there is little convincing evidence that there is anything to most complementary therapies other than the placebo effect, a phenomenon long recognised by doctors: patients can get better simply because they believe their treatment will work, even if they are given pills without any active ingredients. Studies of some treatments have been done, but often the methods used in such studies are flawed and open to bias. It may be that most, perhaps all, of the effectiveness of complementary therapies is attributable to the placebo effect.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And yet doctors have come to realise that the placebo effect itself can be a valuable therapeutic tool. Dr Vivienne Nathanson, head of ethics at the <font size=-1>BMA</font>, says conventional western medicine has not been much help in treating chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. So doctors are taking the pragmatic view that if a treatment seems to work, and has no harmful effects, then it is worth a try.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is the approach of Michael Dixon, the doctor whose surgery in Cullompton employs a healer. Dr Dixon says that, although the healer believes she is passing some form of divine energy to the patients, he carefully avoids expressing an opinion on the matter. As well as helping patients for whom no other treatment has worked, Dr Dixon has found that the healer has a soothing effect on his budget: in a rough survey of 50 patients who visited the healer, about a third needed fewer drugs, saving the <font size=-1>NHS</font> up to &#163;1,500 a year between them. The government's <font size=-1>NHS</font> reforms, which allow general practitioners to take over the funding of their patients' treatments, have given doctors a little more freedom over which treatments to choose. More importantly, the reforms have made doctors think harder about the costs and benefits of rival courses of treatment.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While softening its stance on unorthodox therapies, the <font size=-1>BMA</font> has also been pressing for the compulsory registration of those practising them. So far it has succeeded only with osteopathy. In February the government set up the General Osteopathic Council. When it is granted its full powers (probably some time next year), practising osteopathy without a licence from the council will become illegal. Until registration is extended to the other complementary therapies, it is unclear how far doctors and other medical staff can go: a health authority in south London recently found that tarot cards were being used at one of its drug-dependency clinics--it quickly put a stop to this. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Clearly a line has to be drawn somewhere. The medical profession should certainly not get involved in pretending there are mystical forces at work in complementary therapies. And if, in future, rigorous studies find that a particular treatment has no scientific basis, patients should be told this. Human nature being what it is, many will probably be happy to give it a try nevertheless.

<h1>Cable television's long march</h1>

<font size=1>DENVER AND NEW YORK</font><p>
<p><b>The advent of the railway turned Britain's Victorian canal builders from technological leaders into industrial curiosities. Will satellite television have the same effect on John Malone and the rest of America's cable-TV barons?</b></p><br>
OPEN a copy of <i>USA Today</i> and your eye is likely to be caught by vast advertisements for satellite television. "Up to 60 pay-per-view movies every night", they promise, along with oodles of sport, a crystalline picture, and several hundred television and radio channels. All this for a mere $199 purchase of a pizza-sized satellite dish and a subscription not far out of line with the price of basic cable television.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such blandishments have had a disastrous effect on the shares of the cable-television industry--including those of Tele-Communications Inc (<font size=-1>TCI</font>), the firm with the largest cable systems (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>). Only three years ago, Bell Atlantic, a regional Bell telephone company, offered to pay $35 a share for <font size=-1>TCI</font>, and John Malone, <font size=-1>TCI</font>'s boss, was being touted as the most powerful man in American media. Now the shares trade at just $13.50--"dirt cheap" according to Mr Malone, who points out that this valuation is more than covered by <font size=-1>TCI</font>'s non-cable assets: "Our cable company is selling at negative equity."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many critics say such a stockmarket valuation is fair. History is littered with examples of expensive capital assets that quickly became obsolete, just as Britain's canal network did within 30 years or so of being built; or that were worth owning only once the cost of constructing them had been largely written off, as is likely to be the case with Eurotunnel, which runs the Channel tunnel. In a world of fast-changing technology, the fixed networks of the cable systems look vulnerable. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Worse, unlike America's telephone companies, which also have extensive fixed networks, cable firms have huge debts. For each of its 14.5m subscribers, <font size=-1>TCI</font> has accumulated $1,000 of debt: a total of $14.5 billion. Time Warner, the second-biggest cable firm--and one in which <font size=-1>TCI</font> has an indirect 9% stake--has debts of more than $17 billion (see <a href="wb8445.html">page</a>). As Richard Parsons, its president and a down-to-earth former banker, points out, debt is a liability. "We have low inflation, moderate interest rates and a healthy economy. But what if that changes? All of a sudden, that debt's going to eat you up."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the past, the most worrying thing about the cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> industry for most bankers was that it was too successful (Congress periodically demanded that it cut rates). Now the success of satellite-<font size=-1>TV</font>, which since its launch in 1994 has won nearly 4m customers (maybe half of them from the cable industry), looks a more realistic threat. Put simply, satellite television is cheaper to deliver than cable-<font size=-1>TV</font>, and because--unlike cable--it is digital, it provides more choice.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The start-up costs for a satellite company are relatively low, notably because viewers themselves buy and erect the receiving equipment. For their investment, customers get up to 200 channels (whereas a cable system typically offers around 50-60); significantly better picture and sound quality; and, in the case of Direc<font size=-1>TV</font>, the market leader, an exclusive package of football games across the country. Satellite-<font size=-1>TV</font> thus appeals to sport and film fans, who are big spenders. No wonder Mr Malone grumbles that "satellite is a cherry-picking, cream-skimming technology."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That said, it is hard to think of how the cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> barons could have played their hand worse. For years, they have blathered on about offering 500 channels of television, various interactive services, high-speed Internet access and so on. None of these has yet come to pass. They can hardly blame viewers for choosing a future that they themselves have advertised. All the same, the outlook for their industry is not quite as bleak as the stockmarket thinks.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From the cable firms' point of view, the forthcoming war can be divided into two battlefields: defending their franchise in multichannel television and trying to win one for various interactive services. A glance at the numbers suggests that some of the gloom in the television market is overdone. Arthur Gruen of Wilkofsky Gruen, a New York firm of media analysts, notes that in 1995 cable added 2.2m subscribers, compared with 1.5m for satellite and 200,000 for wireless television--another rival, promoted by the telephone companies.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is partly because satellite-<font size=-1>TV</font> has its own drawbacks. For a start, each television set in a home needs its own expensive receiving equipment (an important flaw, according to Tom Wolzein of Sanford Bernstein, a Wall Street stockbroker, seeing that 55% of cable homes have more than one set). Cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> also offers local programming; satellite, at least for now, offers only a national package. The cable companies are also beginning to close the gap between the number of channels that they and their airborne rivals can offer. The big barrier is that much of their network can currently carry only analogue television; converting that to higher-capacity digital fibre would cost a fortune (roughly $250 per home).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now <font size=-1>TCI</font>, Time Warner and <font size=-1>US</font>West (which is buying Continental Cablevision, America's third-largest operator) are developing ways to push more channels through their existing systems. This month, for example, <font size=-1>TCI</font> launches a digital-television service that uses a proprietary compression technology called Imedia to double the current 55 or so channels that the company carries. Digital channels, delivered this way, will be available to most <font size=-1>TCI</font> customers by the end of 1998. Unlike satellite customers, boast <font size=-1>TCI</font> bosses, their cable customers will not have to pay extra to buy or lease receiving equipment.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The aim is not only to halt the drift to satellite, but also to persuade existing subscribers to spend more, especially on pay-per-view services. So far, says Emily Green of Forrester Research, a consultancy in Boston, most of the rise in cable revenues has come from extending systems rather than from squeezing higher revenues from existing customers. (By contrast, satellite services, which offer a simple point-and-click way to order a film, have boosted pay-per-view revenues considerably). Mr Malone hopes that there will be a "huge surge of pay-per-view activity." <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The signs are that cable customers buy more if they are offered more. In Atlanta, where <font size=-1>US</font>West Media has recently begun offering 100 channels, including 20 pay-per-view options, Doug Holmes, the company's chief financial officer, says that pay-per-view revenues have risen by more than 10%, and the proportion of homes that sign up for cable television is up from 60% to 65%.<br>
</p><p><b><b>A new vision</b></b><br>
Fighting a rearguard action (even a successful one) against satellite-<font size=-1>TV</font> is not quite the glamorous multimedia future that Mr Malone envisaged a few years ago. The only way that cable firms will begin to seem exciting again is if they can show that their networks can be used for interactive services. After all, why squabble over coaxing people into spending another $5 a month for films if they can be persuaded to pay $35 a month for high-speed Internet access, or even more for telephone calls?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once a cable system has been upgraded it should be able to offer all types of interactive services. But upgrading networks is costly, particularly if you are already knee-deep in debt. The cable firms are showing unfamiliar caution. <font size=-1>TCI</font> will eventually offer its new digital-<font size=-1>TV</font> customers an Internet service, for a few dollars a month, based on the World Wide Web. They will be able to order video shots of local news and weather, and take advantage of local advertising promotions. A smaller number of customers, whose networks will be expensively upgraded to offer high-speed Internet access first, will be carefully chosen-- from, for instance, university towns, full of wealthy computer addicts.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Local telephony, which the cable firms are now free to enter, offers a bigger target, but also requires even more investment. The idea of house-to-house combat with a cash-rich Baby Bell is far from enticing for most cable operators. However, this procrastination cannot last for long. Local cable firms are now ideal takeover targets (or "partners", as they prefer to put it) for long-distance telephone companies and Baby Bells from other areas who want to force their way into local telephony. <font size=-1>US</font>West, for instance, views its acquisition of Continental and its stake in Time Warner's well-clustered cable systems partly as a cheap way to break into other local markets.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the end, the problem for the cable barons is financial, not commercial. At the operating level their cash flow is strong; but they have too much debt to be able to make the most of their position. (Pointedly, <font size=-1>US</font>West boasts of being the only cable company with an investment-grade credit rating.) Many smaller cable firms will vanish into the maw of the telephone companies. As for Mr Malone, he mutters about buying back the cable side of <font size=-1>TCI</font> himself. Given current valuations, that may be a bargain.<br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>Time for a change</h1>

<font size=1>NEW YORK AND ATLANTA</font><p>
WHILE all cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> companies are battered by competition from satellite channels, Time Warner, the second-largest, has a further big headache of its own: its corporate structure. Roughly half its 12m cable subscribers belong to networks that are owned by Time Warner Entertainment (<font size=-1>TWE</font>), a company in which Time Warner has a 75%<b> </b>stake and <font size=-1>US</font>West, a local telephone company, the remainder. One side effect of this is that Time Warner does not have direct access to some of the cash flow that is the main attraction of owning cable firms. Its Warner Brothers studio and Home Box Office, a profitable pay-television business, are also tied up in <font size=-1>TWE</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The stockmarket hates this messy structure almost as much as it dislikes Time Warner's involvement in cable. Could both problems be solved in one go? Only if Gerald Levin, the company's chief executive, can overcome his emotional attachment to cable. Mr Levin comes from the cable business and has long invested heavily in cable-TV assets. However, others within the company do not share his enthusiasm. "At the core, Time Warner is a content business," says Richard Parsons, the firm's president. "Cable is an enormous consumer of capital, and the capital it is consuming is not necessarily related to our content business." <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Parsons is not a lone voice. The managers brought into the company from Turner Broadcasting, Ted Turner's television empire, which Mr Levin has just bought for $7.5 billion, also seem dismissive about cable's long-term future. John Malone, the boss of <font size=-1>TCI</font>, an even larger cable network that now holds a non-voting 9% stake in Time Warner, argues that the firm's shares "would do miraculously better if they spun off the cable business to their shareholders. So instead of owning a programming company that owns a cable company, I would own a programming company <i>and</i> a cable company." <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the cable side of <font size=-1>TWE</font> were to be spun off, it could probably take with it roughly half of Time Warner's current debt mountain of $17.5 billion. But such a solution requires the agreement of <font size=-1>US</font>West. That relationship has been soured by Time Warner's acquisition-- without consulting the telephone company--of Turner Broadcasting.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the face of it, <font size=-1>US</font>West can demand a high price for agreeing to a solution. Mr Parsons, who is supposed to charm the telecoms company into a deal, claims that if <font size=-1>US</font>West will not co-operate, Time Warner could simply sell off "a big chunk" of its other cable holdings to pay off its debt. But this would not unscramble the relationship with <font size=-1>US</font>West. And there is an even bigger drawback to jettisoning cable. "To be a major programmer with no distribution isn't the greatest thing in the world," observes Mr Malone dryly.<br>

<h1>A Big Bang for Japan</h1>

<font size=1>TOKYO</font><p>
<p><b>The Japanese government has announced its intention to reform the financial system. Should its proposals be taken seriously?></b></p><br>
WHEN Japan's voters returned the Liberal Democratic Party to power in October after a three-year interregnum, most people assumed that the victors would quickly forget their election promises of "administrative reform"--shorthand for taking power over the economy out of the hands of Japanese bureaucrats. For once, the sceptics may be wrong. On November 11th Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's prime minister, promised that his government would undertake a sweeping deregulation of the country's financial system by 2001. Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, the new finance minister, called the proposals "the equivalent of London's Big Bang".<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In search of a good, if hackneyed image (earlier this year South Korea used the same phrase to describe its own financial-reform package), Mr Mitsuzuka may have been overstating his case. Few of these proposals are new; many were proposed by a government committee in August. Detail is lacking. Some important areas for reform have been ignored. And there will be opposition from vested interests, especially Japan's big securities firms, to those reforms that the government has proposed. But for all that, the prime minister has set a deadline and given his pledge. This time, at least, there seems to be the political will for serious reform. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;About time too. Bureaucrats and politicians alike appear to have realised at last that the glacial pace of Japan's previous financial reforms has strangled the country's economic recovery and thwarted Tokyo's pretensions to be an international financial centre. While it has been mired in red tape, the world's two other big financial centres, London and New York, have roared ahead. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tokyo also faces a growing challenge from Hong Kong and Singapore, which would both like to become Asia's main financial hub. Fed up with Japanese bureaucracy, some financial folk are already moving to Singapore and other centres with a lighter regulatory touch. They are not the only ones leaving town: over the past three years, 54 companies have delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. "Shock therapy is necessary. The alternative is for Tokyo to become a local market," a senior bureaucrat at the finance ministry told foreign journalists this week.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Japan's over-regulated and compartmentalised financial system is a product of both accident and design. After the second world war, the Americans imposed a version of their own Glass-Steagall act, which separates commercial and investment banking, in the shape of Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Law. But bureaucrats also designed the financial system to make it easier to channel savings into favoured industries: the more segregated the various parts of the financial sector were, the easier it was to control the institutions through which savings were channelled. For example, long-term credit banks made long-term loans to industry. In addition, they were given a monopoly on issuing fixed-rate debt. Commercial banks took deposits and lent at floating rates. All interest rates were set by the finance ministry.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Much of this apparatus is still intact. Banks face fierce competition for corporate business, especially now that big companies can tap the capital markets themselves. But the regulations prevent bankers from meeting this challenge by underwriting equities. They are also barred from selling insurance. Other sorts of financial firms also have their hands tied: securities firms cannot offer banking or insurance services, and insurance firms cannot go into banking or securities.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Still too tight</b></b><br>
The sharp divisions between businesses have been relaxed a bit, but only gradually. Interest rates began to be liberalised in 1984. At the end of 1993, banks were finally allowed to underwrite corporate bonds (though not equities) through subsidiaries. And from the beginning of October, life and non-life insurers have been free to enter each other's business, again via subsidiaries. In spite of all this, the boundaries that remain between businesses are still substantial.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such tight control has become not just redundant, but positively harmful. To enable financial firms to earn a crust, bureaucrats have allowed the cost of many financial products and services to remain high by approving cartels and discouraging aggressive competition. Insurance premiums are fixed by bureaucratic fiat. Two decades after they were scrapped in America, and a decade after they disappeared in Britain, fixed commissions on all but the biggest share trades still raise the cost of buying equities in Japan.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Hashimoto now says that he wants to do away with this rigid financial system. Insurers, banks and securities firms, he promises, will be allowed to enter one another's business. Legal barriers separating the different sorts of banks are to be scrapped. Stock commissions and insurance premiums will be deregulated. The asset-management business will be opened up and the detailed rules that govern how pension funds allocate their money will be abandoned for a more general prudential requirement.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Light the fuse. . .</b></b><br>
That is not all. The quality of financial information disclosed by companies will be improved by the adoption of accounts "consistent" with those of other developed countries. In short, assets will be valued at their proper market price, not the price at which they were bought. Pension funds will have to do this from next April. (Given the precarious state of many Japanese banks, however, the government will surely give them much longer to make a change that will make their financial situation appear far gloomier.) <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With a list of reforms this long, it would seem churlish to quibble that the government is not planning to do enough. Yet conspicuously absent from its "to do" list is any mention of the privatisation of the banking operations of the post office. Japan's post office is the world's biggest bank. Since it does not have to worry about shareholders, it can offer higher rates than the banks. And its deposits are fully guaranteed by the government. Small wonder, given fears about the health of private banks, that its deposits have grown by over 11% since 1994. Banks claim, justifiably, that a publicly-owned post office distorts competition. On November 11th Shunsaku Hashimoto, the chairman of Japan's bankers' association, chastised the government for not tackling this question. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such carping aside, the government's deregulatory proposals are generally excellent in intent. Does it have the stomach to push them through? The finance ministry claims that it has. As evidence, it says that a bill to scrap the law that allows only licensed banks to deal in foreign exchange will be introduced in the next session of the Diet (parliament). This, however, is fairly uncontroversial. Few, if any, institutions will be put out of business. Other steps will be implemented only if the government is prepared to put up with the squeals of pain from those whose profits are threatened by deregulation. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Chief squealers will be Japan's 230 securities firms. Their income comes from commissions on share-trading and from selling mutual funds. They are already suffering from a sluggish Japanese stockmarket: turnover has fallen 75% since the late 1980s. Deregulation of stockbrokers' commissions, and the entry of big banks and insurers with lots of branches into the equity and mutual-fund business, will put many brokers out of business. The prime minister says that he will tolerate such bankruptcies. Perhaps he will. But a fear of letting firms fail probably means that the government will shy away from scrapping the Article 65 restrictions altogether. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Instead, the authorities are likely to go for a more convoluted solution. To "moderate" competition throughout the financial industry, it seems likely that firms will be allowed to enter markets from which they have hitherto been excluded only by setting up a new business under the umbrella of a holding company. First, however, holding companies, which were banned after the second world war, will have to be legalised. Even then they will prove attractive to financial firms only if the government introduces a consolidated tax system, so that profits in one part of a company's operations can be offset by losses in another. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Implementing all of this in five years and making sure that vested interests do not neuter the proposals will be a Herculean task. A lot of people think that the government is not up to it. There have been many deregulatory promises unkept in the past. And when change has occurred, it has been frustratingly slow. But there now seems to be a consensus among politicians and bureaucrats that the Japanese financial system needs root-and-branch reform. It is surely telling that a top official at the finance ministry, the country's most powerful bureaucracy, says that, in effect, Japan should have a more freewheeling financial system before its current one makes the country an also-ran. <br>

<h1 align=center>Now tell the truth</h1>


O ZYMANDIAS built his colossus in the desert; Mitterrand filled Paris with fantasies in glass; Franklin Roosevelt erected a welfare state. The chance of political longevity turns the mind to grandiose things. Before his re-election, Bill Clinton promised to build a bridge to the 21st century. Will this be another of his glittering rhetorical constructions, with spans of hot air and no visible means of support? Or could it be, against expectation, a solid and useful monument? <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Much will depend on Mr Clinton's estimate of how much America loves him. His 49% of the popular vote was an improvement on 1992; but it was neither hearty, nor a mandate. The fact that the Senate and the House remain Republican shows the limits of public trust in Mr Clinton and his party. Surprisingly, the divided government of the past two years proved rather productive; more important, it brought out a vein of responsibility in the president. Americans seem to want to make sure that a second-term Clinton preserves that virtue, and eschews both hubris and leftish Grand Designs. Yes, they like Mr Clinton; but not that much.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The president, who could never be accused of insensitivity to the public mood, comes into his new term knowing that flexibility has brought his presidency back from the dead. He knows, too, how to make people love him more. His last campaigning year has brought a succession of small presents to the virtuous middle class from a benevolent government: parental leave, college tuition credits, <font size=-1>V</font>-chips to protect children from video nastiness. A hundred such tiny bricks might build a Clinton monument. But it might not be enough for him; and it would certainly not be enough for America.<b><br>
</p><p><b>Unpalatable subjects</b></b><br>
All through the dreary campaign of 1996, certain issues went virtually unmentioned. They are the ones America's people and politicians find hardest to face. They are not amenable to minimalist measures, and offer no immediate return of popular gratitude. Mr Clinton hates that. But the beginning of a second and last term is the best chance--indeed, the only chance--for this shifting and ingratiating character to try to bring America face to face with the facts. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Top of the list come the inner cities, where a bundle of different social pathologies are combining to produce a deeply demoralised, unemployable and even criminal population. A Democrat of the Johnson school might suppose that only massive federal investment could save these places. Mr Clinton knows he does not have that option. But the country is full of local experiments in ghetto housing, welfare, transport and day care which, with visible presidential encouragement and a little well-directed federal money, could be applied more generally. Mr Clinton will have no giant government programmes to announce; but he could make sure that America does more than turn its back. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Part of this policy might involve reforming America's public schools: an issue Mr Clinton has recognised, but without much courage. Despite the tiny federal share of the education budget, the president is not powerless as an advocate. He could lend his support (underlined by careful disposition of existing federal funds) to charter schools that are properly independent, not suborned by his friends in the teachers' unions; to experimental voucher plans; and, most of all, to a standardised system of national examinations. And he should do so with one end in view: to persuade Americans that they are behind in the race to produce competent workers, and that this is a danger to the country's economic health.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor need straight talk end there. During the campaign, the economic and fiscal cycles greatly helped Mr Clinton. But the recovery is already showing signs of slowing down, while the deficit is set to rise again. This means that Mr Clinton can no longer dissemble over where his spending cuts must fall if he wants, as he claims, to leave the legacy of a balanced budget. He should name departments, agencies and programmes; and, most of all, he must tackle middle-class entitlements. This year, he screwed up his courage to end the biggest entitlement for the poor; but the poor are easily dealt with. Mr Clinton's name would ring more loudly down the years if he could revamp Social Security and cut the soaring cost of Medicare, two jealously protected programmes that are on the brink of failing to provide for their dependants. <b><br>
</p><p><b>The necessary focus</b></b><br>
The list could go on. It could include trade (show that America has laid the ghost of protectionism by abandoning talk of "fair trade" and pushing for <font size=-1>NAFTA</font> expansion); racial quotas (admit that current programmes have caused as much resentment as progress, and that they should be either ended or recast to help the poor); and foreign policy (persuade Americans that their involvement in Bosnia, or in other unstable but deserving places, must last if necessary beyond the election cycle and their own comfort level). It is a long agenda. But it is not entirely new. Mr Clinton had already started on some of it, before getting fidgety or hamstrung by his need for the love and gratitude of the voters. Now that that love has been more or less returned, what is needed is a focus on hard facts.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tricky words indeed for the glowing re-elected president: "focus" and "hard facts". Neither has ever been his strong point; and even as he celebrates, he knows that Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater special prosecutor, also has those two themes in mind. Grand strategies and bridges may soon tumble down in partisan strife, or may never be erected. Yet forthrightness about his private dealings, if it comes to that, might not doom him, as some suppose; and forthrightness about the country's failings would be a positive service. Bill Clinton's skill so far--his consummate skill--has been to persuade Americans that by nimble repositioning and soothing rhetoric they are being well-governed. This is not wholly implausible: <i>faute de mieux</i>, it got him re-elected. Now, however, he has a chance to do something really great: to tell the truth.<br>

<h2>Yes, he won</h2>
<p><b>Bill Clinton </b>won the American presidential election with 49% of the popular vote against Bob Dole's 41%, and 31 states against his 19. He becomes the first Democrat to be elected twice since Franklin Roosevelt. But the Republicans held on to both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Ross Perot won 8% of the vote. Less than half of the eligible voters cast their ballots, a record low.</p>
<p><b>Warren Christopher</b> resigned as secretary of state, but will stay on until Mr Clinton's inauguration in January. Several other team members, including William Perry, the defence secretary, Mickey Kantor, the commerce secretary, and Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, are also to go. </p>
<p>Voters in California approved by a large margin a proposition to end <b>racial quotas </b>in state contracting and employment.</p>
<p>In <b>Nicaragua</b>, expecting official (but still provisional) results of its October 20th elections on November 7th, the Sandinists accused the seemingly victorious Liberal Alliance of fraud. They demanded a fresh vote in two big provinces, and called a day of "civic protest"--peaceful, apparently--on November 8th. </p>
<h2>Hell in Zaire</h2>
<p>All parties in the war in eastern <b>Zaire </b>have agreed to accept a multinational force to save refugees, but few countries have offered troops. France wants military intervention; European Union aid ministers met to discuss proposals. More than a million people, mostly Hutu refugees, have been left without food or shelter after aid agencies were driven out of the region by fighting. Having seized part of eastern Zaire, rebels offered a three-week ceasefire. </p>
<p>Leaders of big <b>third-world countries</b>, meeting in Zimbabwe, accused rich countries of trying to dictate rules of world trade. One big gripe: rules on labour conditions, seen by the poor as a way of negating their lower wages. But Bangladesh, which supplies half of Europe's <font size=-1>T</font>-shirts, said it no longer used child labour in its textile factories. </p>
<p>Israel's infrastructure minister, Ariel Sharon, unveiled a plan to settle 100,000 more colonists in the occupied <b>West Bank</b>. Not a government plan, said a spokesman.</p>
<p>In <b>Algeria</b>, Islamist guerrillas seized ten women and three children at a village and slit their throats. Later, in another village, 31 more people were murdered the same way.</p>
<h2>Interregnum</h2>
<p>Russia's president, <b>Boris Yeltsin</b>, took back presidential powers less than 24 hours after handing them over to his prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, to undergo a heart operation. Doctors said the seven-hour quintuple bypass went well.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>Robert Tatum, an American businessman, was<b> murdered in Moscow</b>. He had been seeking control of the city's Radisson-Slavyanskaya hotel. In Ukraine Evheny Sherban, a prominent businessman and member of parliament, was also murdered.</p>
<p><b>Russia's trade unions </b>said that up to 2m workers went on strike to demand payment of $7 billion in unpaid wages by federal and local governments. Some parts of Russia are running short of food and fuel as winter approaches.</p>
<p>The European Commission said 12 of the 15 <font size=-1>EU</font> countries would meet the Maastricht treaty's requirement for <b>budget deficits </b>of no more than 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> in 1997 if they are to join <font size=-1>EMU</font>. Britain, Italy and Greece were the exceptions. But the European Monetary Institute, precursor to a central bank, felt that progress towards deficit reduction has been too slow.</p>
<p>Voters in <b>Romania and Bulgaria</b> rebuffed ex-communists and supported reformists. Romanians made the Democratic Convention the largest party, and in his race for re-election President Ion Iliescu holds a slim lead over Emil Constantinescu, the Democratic Convention candidate, before a run-off on November 17th. In Bulgaria's presidential election, Petar Stoyanov, a pro-reform lawyer, defeated the Socialist candidate, Ivan Marazov.</p>
<p>Allies of Serbia's president, <b>Slobodan Milosevic</b>, easily won elections for the federal Yugoslav parliament and the parliament of Montenegro, the second republic in the Yugoslav federation.</p>
<p>The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development predicted that growth in<b> former communist economies</b> would accelerate next year from a projected 4% rate in 1996. But all of them, it said, must do more to reform their financial systems and improve infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Bhutto out</h2>
<p>Benazir Bhutto was dismissed as prime minister of <b>Pakistan </b>by the country's president. The president said her government was incompetent and corrupt; it, and parliament, were also dismissed. Miss Bhutto was put under house arrest, but later freed. A general election is to be held in February.</p>
<p>Japan's Liberal Democratic Party won over enough defectors to form a government. <b>Ryutaro Hashimoto </b>was formally reappointed prime minister.</p>
<p>A <b>Khmer Rouge commander </b>and 300 fighters became the latest rebel group to defect to the Cambodian government. But Pol Pot, the rebel leader, was reported to be preparing to renew his attacks on government forces.</p>
<p>A senior official in Washington said America had revised its view, and saw no prospect of <b>Afghanistan's civil war </b> coming to an early end.</p>

<h2>Engaged</h2>
<p>In the biggest-ever foreign takeover of an American company, <b>BT</b>, a British telecoms firm, agreed to pay around $21 billion for the 80% of America's <b>MCI Communications</b> that it does not already own to create a transatlantic giant called Concert. With annual revenues of almost $38 billion, Concert will be the world's fourth-largest telecoms company.</p>
<p>(See <a href="bw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>International <b>mergers and acquisitions</b> rose to $181.7 billion in the first nine months, and were on target for a record year even before <font size=-1>BT</font>'s monumental move. More money was spent on fewer targets and the greatest activity was across the Atlantic; America invested $11.7 billion in Britain, which reciprocated with $11.4 billion--a figure dwarfed by <font size=-1>BT</font>'s acquisition.</p>
<p>Invesco, a British fund manager, also did its bit by paying $1.6 billion for <b>AIMManagement Group</b>, the biggest foreign purchase yet of an American mutual-fund firm. The combined group, Amvesco, will combine Invesco's strength in retail funds with <font size=-1>AIM</font>'s big stockbroker network in America.</p>
<h2>Stormy Sky</h2>
<p><font size=-1>BS</font>ky<font size=-1>B</font> delayed the launch of a Time Warner channel in Britain as the spat between <b>Rupert Murdoch</b>, whose News Corp owns 40% of the <font size=-1>BS</font>ky<font size=-1>B</font> network, and <b>Ted Turner</b>, whose cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> outfit is now owned by Time Warner, worsened. Time Warner has refused to allow a 24-hour news channel from News Corp's Fox on to its New York city cable system. </p>
<p>Italy's Carlo De Benedetti sold his 27.4% stake in <b>Valeo</b>, a car-parts maker, for FFr6.5 billion ($1.3 billion). Because Valeo is that rarest of beasts-- a successful French company in a competitive industry-- many in France wanted it to remain in safe French hands. Their wish was granted: <font size=-1>CGIP</font>, a local holding company, bought 20.3% of the shares, with the rest going to a French financial firm and to J.P. Morgan, <font size=-1>CGIP</font>'s adviser.</p>
<p>In an effort to boost shareholder value, <b>Hoechst</b>, a giant German chemicals company, said it will seek a listing in New York next year. It will also divide itself into six subsidiaries, one of which may be separately quoted.</p>
<p>America's fourth-largest retailer, <b>J.C. Penney</b>, jumped into the fast-consolidating drugstore business by agreeing to buy <b>Eckerd </b>for $2.5 billion and assuming $760m of its debt. The deal will make J.C. Penney the second-largest drug retailer in America.</p>
<p>In Europe, the battle for control of <b>Lloyds Chemists</b>, a British drug retailer, intensified. Gehe of Germany reckons that it has pipped Britain's UniChem with a cash offer of &#163;650.6m ($1.1 billion) for Lloyds. But the contest could well continue.</p></td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>

<h2>Mopping up</h2>
<p>Determined to cleanse its Augean stables, Japan's new bad-loans agency began bankruptcy proceedings against <b>Sueno Kosan</b>, a property firm that borrowed heavily from the sick mortgage companies at the core of Japan's banking crisis. With over &#165;600 billion ($5.3 billion) in debt, it will be Japan's biggest-ever bankruptcy. More will follow.</p>
<p>The dollar fell sharply against <b>the yen</b> after Eisuke Sakakibara, a senior official at Japan's finance ministry, said in a newspaper interview that he thought the dollar's recovery from its sharp slide last year was about to finish. Japanese bond prices also fell after he described the market's view of the economy as too pessimistic.</p>
<p>The Hungarian government gave <b>ABN Amro</b>, a Dutch bank, the go-ahead to buy an 89% stake in <b>Magyar Hitel Bank</b>, the country's fifth biggest bank by assets. <font size=-1>ABN</font> Amro's bid was chosen ahead of another from Austria's Creditanstalt.</p>
<p>A grand jury in New York is examining whether criminal charges can be laid against some executives<b> </b>of <b>Texaco</b>, an American oil company. The move came after tape transcripts submitted in a discrimination suit brought by some black employees revealed executives using racist terms and discussing whether to destroy papers requested by the employees' lawyer.</p>
<p>Russia's "emergency commission" for <b>tax collection </b>is investigating state-owned Almazy Rossii-Sakha (<font size=-1>ARS</font>), which has a near-monopoly of Russian diamond production. The commission wants details of <font size=-1>ARS</font>'s dealings with De Beers of South Africa, which operates an international diamond cartel, and an explanation of the firm's $570m in debts and its failure to pay dividends even though it had $1.4 billion of sales last year.</p>
<h2>Flying high</h2>
<p>In what could be the biggest-ever order for Europe's <b>Airbus</b> consortium if all the options go through, <b>USAir</b> ordered 120 single-aisle aircraft valued at $5 billion, with options on a further 280. Airbus also announced a price of $198m for its proposed 550-seater plane-- matching Boeing's planned price for a similar aircraft.</p>
<p><font size=-1>(See <a href="bw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>IATA</font> members--250 <b>international airlines</b>--are still on route to make record profits of $5.5 billion this year, but earlier forecasts have been trimmed because of a jump in fuel costs. Morevover those profits are equivalent to a mere 4% return on revenues of $129 billion; combine that with higher costs from increasing regulation and many international airlines still look vulnerable.</p>
<p><b>British Airways</b> won permission from a French court to take over Air Libert&eacute; in partnership with Banque Rivaud. It will invest a FFr440m ($86m) in the defunct regional airline and merge it with <font size=-1>TAT</font>, another regional French carrier that it already owns. <font size=-1>BA</font> also reported a 9.3% rise in first-half profits, to &#163;470m ($718m).</p>

<h1 align=left>Dial M for merger</h1>


<p><b>BT and MCI are following airlines down the runway to a global free-for-all</b></p><br>
AS THEY jetted back and forward across the Atlantic last month, plighting their troth, did the bosses of Britain's <font size=-1>BT</font> and America's <font size=-1>MCI</font>, two telecoms giants, pause to ponder the parallels between the airlines that flew them and their own industry? If so, they may well have felt a little smug. Airlines, like telephone companies, were once fat monopolies, relying on national and international restrictions to shore up their profits. Now, at least in some markets, both types of firm face stiff competition. But while airlines find it hard to make fat profits, even during a boom, telephone companies are rolling in money. <font size=-1>BT</font> is using some of its enormous cash pile to finance its $21 billion merger with <font size=-1>MCI</font>. Why are telephone companies so flush and airlines so poor?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a few years' time, that question will seem anachronistic. For the deal, which is the largest takeover ever of an American company by a foreign one, is actually a bit of seatbelt-fastening in advance of a bumpy flight. While many airlines have been living with competition for years as deregulation has spread from America to Europe, most telephone companies are still protected in their local or national markets. Even in much of America, the monopolies of most of the regional Bells are, for now, intact. Where legal protection has gone, the grip of a former monopolist is hard to dislodge. In Britain, which has a regulator, Oftel, that is determined to help newcomers, <font size=-1>BT</font> still controls nine-tenths of the market.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In future, however, it will be harder for even the most profitable telecoms company to dodge greater competition. In the airline industry, technical novelties such as wide-bodied jets have helped to cut costs. Prices have broadly followed. In telecoms, the impact of innovation has been far more dramatic--the cost of delivering an ordinary telephone call is now about one-thousandth as much as it was in the late 1950s--while prices have fallen much more slowly. But not for much longer. Technological change is already creating choice: many customers are still stuck with only one local telephone company, but they already have the option of several sorts of wireless telephone, of cable telephony in a few countries, and of callback services and Internet telephony as ways around excessive international charges.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The world's big telephone companies can see where all this will lead. Falling prices will stimulate demand, as they have done in air travel, but they will also dent profits. Only the strongest, most efficient firms will survive. Just as airlines have formed international alliances to share codes on busy routes to fill their planes, so <font size=-1>BT</font> and <font size=-1>MCI</font> have recognised the need for a global alliance to offer multinational businesses an end-to-end telephone service. The merged group will turn Britain's telephone network into a sort of virtual Heathrow, scooping up calls from all over Europe and funnelling them across the Atlantic. Because the two companies will be able to carry a call all the way, they will not have to make costly settlement payments for using other networks.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Is this good news for customers? It is tempting to draw another parallel with the airline business. When, in June, British Airways and American Airlines announced what was, in some ways, tantamount to a merger, rivals argued that <font size=-1>BA</font>'s dominance of landing slots at Heathrow would reduce competition: together, the two firms would control more than 60% of flights between Britain and the United States. Without a free market in aviation, guaranteed by an open skies agreement between the two countries, customers could suffer.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Might the <font size=-1>BT</font>/<font size=-1>MCI</font> deal have a similar effect? America's <font size=-1>AT&T</font> is already complaining that the British telephone market is less open than it appears. But in telecoms, much more so than in aviation, Britain's rules favour newcomers. Oftel has done far more to rig the odds in the domestic market against <font size=-1>BT</font> than America's Federal Communications Commission has done in the case of <font size=-1>AT&T</font>. And the market for international calls from Britain is about to be thrown open when the government next month licenses 46 new competitors, including <font size=-1>AT&T</font> and 21 other American companies. Unlike international airlines, those firms will be able to operate without constraints on the prices that they charge, or the number of calls that they carry. <b><p>
Anticipating the death of distance</b><br>
In merging, <font size=-1>BT</font> and <font size=-1>MCI</font> are making a bid to be one of a handful of global telecoms carriers in the next few decades. Although their merger is basically a defensive one (see <a href="wb8436.html">page</a>), it will also create new opportunities. So long as the two firms can overcome the formidable problems that cross-border mergers inevitably throw up, they should prosper.  For governments, the deal holds two lessons. The first is that privatisation helps firms to become world-beaters. It is no coincidence that <font size=-1>BT</font>, which was floated in 1984, is in far better shape than bloated European rivals such as Deutsche Telekom, which is only now gearing up for privatisation, and France T&eacute;l&eacute;com, which is still run partly by civil servants. The second lesson is that privatisation is not enough. What has driven <font size=-1>BT</font> to this deal is tough regulation at home that ensures competition. That battling for business in domestic markets is a good preparation for battling for it elsewhere may seem obvious. But in many countries, it is a truth that is only now beginning to dawn. Time to dial <font size=-1>C</font> for competition.<br>

<h1>The last best campaign</h1>

<font size=1>LITTLE ROCK</font><p>
LONG before the voting finished on November 5th, street vendors in Little Rock were doing a brisk business in <font size=-1>T</font>-shirts with a spoof front-page story from the <i>Arkansas Democrat Gazette</i>. It declared a resounding victory for Bill Clinton. The <font size=-1>T</font>-shirt sellers, like everyone else, had been reading the polls. And the actual results brought no surprise. The only real tension was over the size of Mr Clinton's victory (big, but no landslide) and whether it would help the Democrats recapture at least one of the houses of Congress (it didn't). Shamefully, early estimates suggest that only 49% of eligible voters bothered to vote, the lowest turnout since 1924. (See <a href="am1.gif">chart</a>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, the final days of the presidential campaign managed a sense of sleepless drama worthy of this great exercise in democracy. Recalling that the first time he had fought round the clock for his country was on the battlefields of Italy in 1945, Mr Dole took off on a 96-hour dash across 20 states with barely a pause for rest, before arriving to vote in his native Russell, Kansas. "I couldn't think of anything else," he explained. "It's my last option." <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The "Marathon Man", as he called himself, travelled day and night from diner to parking lot, from airport tarmac to truck stop. To preserve his fading voice, he kept his speeches short and drank "Throat Coat" herbal tea. The valiant effort restored some of the respect that Mr Dole had been in danger of losing in his generally hapless campaign. It was a reminder of the story of his life: an endurance test, and one that he survived.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He might even have dared believe his own brave predictions of victory. For once, he was capturing the imagination, and his opponent was on the defensive over foreign campaign contributions. The race seemed to be narrowing as undecided voters made up their minds, and one tracking poll briefly suggested Mr Dole might just win. The wee hours of Tuesday morning found him in Independence, Missouri, paying homage to Harry Truman, the model for come-from-behind triumph.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But it was not to be. Valiant as Mr Dole's final effort was, it also smacked of desperation, and drew attention to one of his main vulnerabilities: his age. Mr Clinton, on a sleepless marathon of his own, looked relentlessly vigorous as he moved from the sunshine of California to the first snows of New England and on to the autumnal colours of the mid-west.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This, as Mr Clinton repeatedly pointed out, was the final campaign of a man who has been running for some office or other for the past 23 years. The last day of the last campaign began with a nostalgic visit to New Hampshire, birthplace of his 1992 comeback. The president moved on to Ohio, Kentucky and Iowa before holding his final rally in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. There, about to leave after his speech and the handshakes along the rope line, he suddenly turned and went back to the podium, waving and striding the stage, hanging on to the last minutes of the campaigning life. Then he was off to Arkansas for his triumphant homecoming.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His triumph is the sweeter because it had looked so improbable after the Republican surge in 1994. The Republicans looked forward to 1996 as the "confirming" election, the year that would give them control of the White House as well as of Congress. Instead, Mr Clinton not only won, but he won with nearly 50% of the popular vote to Mr Dole's 41%. Ross Perot, who took 19% of the vote four years ago, managed only 8% this time as the candidate of his new Reform Party. It could be argued that in 1992 Mr Clinton owed his victory to Mr Perot; not so in 1996. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet even as the voters rewarded the president, they also restrained him. If this election "confirmed" anything, it was the status quo. Republicans held on to the House of Representatives for the first time in 68 years, and increased their majority slightly in the Senate. So much for theories about presidential "coat-tails". Eleven governors' races left the split between the parties unchanged (32 Republican governors, 17 Democrats, one independent). Across the country, it was a good day for incumbents.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With a healthy economy and, of late, a government getting down to business, a reasonably contented electorate decided to keep things much as they were. Neither party can make extravagant claims for a "mandate". Both have to reckon with a political era that is neither of the right nor of the left, but one of extreme competitiveness, notably over what might be called the three "<font size=-1>G</font>s": geography, gender, and the role of government.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Take geography first. On the face of it, the electoral map looks straightforward. Mr Dole carried a swathe of loyally Republican states in the West and the South; Mr Clinton took most of the rest, including bellwether states such as Ohio. Look closer, and the picture is more complicated. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By winning Arizona, which last voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in 1948, and the huge prize of Florida, which voted for Jimmy Carter in 1976 but has been Republican ever since, Mr Clinton showed that the Republicans cannot take their traditional strongholds for granted. The president's defence of Medicare played well with retired folk in both those states. In the north-east, Mr Clinton swept 11 states that had all voted for Ronald Reagan in 1984. Much as conservative southern Democrats turned against liberal Democratic presidential candidates from the 1960s, so the social conservatism of the Republican Party's ascendant southerners now alienates the voters of the north-east. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Second, the "gender gap" was as wide as it has ever been. Among men, according to the Voter News Service exit polls, the contest was a tie, 44% for each of the main candidates. Among women, Mr Clinton romped home by 55% to 37%. He did so by talking engagingly about issues that women care most about, such as education and family leave. Henceforth, the competition for women's votes will intensify.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Women also tend to look more favourably than men on government activism, the third big area of competition between the parties. It is true that Mr Clinton won by running as a conservative, reforming welfare, promising to balance the budget and proclaiming the era of big government to be over. But it is also true that he won by insisting that government action can help people in their ordinary lives, in contrast to the harsh anti-government message of Republican revolutionaries. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How much action will actually happen? On a balmy election night in Little Rock, the president spoke of the need to put country ahead of party. The election, he emphasised, had shown the strength of the "vital centre" in America. Americans could achieve so much if only they could work together as one big happy family.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But any sense of togetherness will be hard to maintain. Mr Clinton's cabinet is already being shaken out, with four members--including the secretary of state, Warren Christopher, and the secretary of defence, William Perry--offering their resignations. The Democrats generally, remarkably united behind their president for this election, are likely to be a less orderly bunch from now on. For their part, the Republicans are already arguing over whether their failure to recapture the White House was due to an excess of ideology or of moderation. And the continuing Republican control of Congress guarantees yet more hearings into alleged Clintonian scandals.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the prospect of the subpoenas hitting the fan explained the less-than-ecstatic mood of the thousands gathered for the victory celebration at the Old State House. Perhaps, too, like the rest of the country, everyone was glad it was over. Or almost everyone. Mr Clinton would, if he could, go on campaigning for ever.<br>

<p><b>The Senate</b></p>
<h1>Consolation</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><p>
THE prize for the most entertaining Senate race goes to Louisiana, and particularly to a shocking fax entitled "Convicts for Landrieu". "Louisiana's felons, convicts and the like formally endorse Mary Landrieu," it proclaimed. Her candidacy represented a "once-in-a-life-sentence opportunity" for convicts to be let out of prison early. A retired archbishop of New Orleans thought voting for Ms Landrieu, a Democrat who believes women should judge the morality of abortion for themselves, was tantamount to sin. Asked in a television debate to say something nice about this lady, all her Republican opponent could manage was, "I love New Orleans. She's from New Orleans and that's good."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In its vitriol, its ideological charge and indeed its sheer closeness, the Louisiana race combined many of the themes that dominated the 34 Senate fights around the country. The resignation of 14 senators, more than in any year since popular elections to the Senate were first held in 1914, created many hot contests, Louisiana's among them. On the eve of the election, half of the 34 races looked very close. And, although Ms Landrieu won her race (by a margin of less than 1%), Republicans came off better overall. As <i>The Economist </i>went to press, the outcome in Oregon was still in doubt. But the Republicans had won 20 of the remaining 33 seats, having held 19 before. Of the Senate's 100 seats, they will hold 54, or 55 if they win Oregon. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Across the country, it had been assumed that Senate victories would be won in the political middle. This proved true only in the South. Ms Landrieu squeaked home because she posed as a centrist, and because her opponent, Woody Jenkins, was unabashedly right-wing. (He led Louisiana's anti-abortionists; he had promised to scrap the Internal Revenue Service; and he spoke warmly of law-breaking Oliver North.) In Georgia's tight race, Max Cleland fought as a Democratic centrist, too. Despite unattractive episodes from his past (he had asked for the early release of a murderer who killed again, and had fired an employee without due process), he won because his opponent was so far to the right.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leftish southern Democrats, in contrast, fared less well. Harvey Gantt in North Carolina and Victor Morales in Texas both failed to upset entrenched Republicans. In Alabama, Roger Bedford also lost, even though a Democrat had easily won the seat six years ago, and even though his opponent had once said he thought Ku Klux Klan members "were okay guys until I found out they smoked dope". Mr Bedford went down because he came from the party's left, having beaten a more centrist candidate in the primary.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Outside the South, Democratic centrists were in trouble. In Wyoming, Colorado and Nebraska--all open seats--the Democrats nominated moderates who sought to label their opponents as extreme. All were defeated. In Kansas, Democrats had hoped that their stockbroker-candidate, Jill Docking, could win the seat vacated by the retiring Bob Dole, especially since her views were arguably closer to Mr Dole's than those of her right-wing opponent, Sam Brownback. In New Hampshire, Democrats had big hopes for Dick Swett, a candidate more anxiously centrist even than Bill Clinton. But, though New Hampshire leaned Democrat this year (electing a Democratic governor), Mr Swett lost.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These setbacks are a disappointment for Bob Kerrey, organiser of the Democrats' Senate strategy. He went out of his way to recruit moderates, preferably wealthy ones with cash to spend on advertisements. Had the Democrats recaptured the Senate, Mr Kerrey's stock might have risen enough for him to contemplate the presidency again. As it was, Republicans fought off the Kerrey moderates by linking them to immoderate colleagues. Mr Brownback, for example, warned Kansans that a vote for his opponent was a vote for Edward Kennedy, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts. Meanwhile old-style Democrats, such as Paul Wellstone in Minnesota and Dick Durbin in Illinois, won with little difficulty.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was a good year for incumbents. Several had been at risk, but only South Dakota's Larry Pressler, a Republican, tumbled. In Massachusetts, John Kerry won with surprising ease (see <a href="am3109.html">page</a>). In North Carolina, Jesse Helms won despite his frailty. South Carolina's Strom Thurmond, who turns 94 next month, won with a campaign stressing his experience.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In all, the Republicans won three seats previously in Democratic hands: in Alabama, Nebraska and Arkansas. Of these, Arkansas was sweetest, partly because Tim Hutchinson will be the first Republican senator from the state in more than 100 years, but more because this is the president's home turf. Before the election, there was talk that Republican-instigated investigations into Whitewater, which have already led to the imprisonment of some of Mr Clinton's old friends, would produce a backlash against the Republicans. The Hutchinson victory killed that theory.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was fortunate for the Republicans, as they gathered at their election-night party in Washington to mourn Mr Dole's defeat, that they had Congress to smile about. Above the tables of tortilla chips and broccoli, huge screens displayed the results as they came in. There were boos when Mr Clinton took one state after another, and cheers when the Republicans notched up a Senate victory. But, from the flow of data on the screen, one number may soon assume particular significance. Of the voters in Arkansas, this poll said, 56% believed that Mr Clinton had not told the truth about Whitewater. Their House and Senate majority assured, the Republicans now have ample opportunity to demand the truth from the administration.<br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>Meanwhile, in Athens . . . </h1>

<font size=1>BOSTON</font><p>
GLOWING under the klieg lights in Boston's magnificent old Faneuil Hall, John Forbes Kerry, the junior Democratic senator from Massachusetts, stood in front of a white marble bust of John Quincy Adams. William Floyd Weld, the Republican governor who was unsuccessfully trying to snatch Mr Kerry's job, stood in front of a bust of Daniel Webster. No one watching the two men in debate on October 28th thought Messrs Kerry and Weld quite that grand. But there was no hooting at this implicit comparison either, as one might expect if, say, Alfonse D'Amato had been held up against Alexander Hamilton.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Massachusetts Senate race has not been perfect, but it was highbrow enough for the good folk of Massachusetts--always prone to compare themselves to Athenians--to be proud of the example they set for the rest of the country. Both candidates showed experience and brains. They argued fiercely, intelligently and even (more or less) fairly. They debated a staggering eight times, often in head-to-head Lincoln-Douglas format. The outcome changed exactly nothing: Mr Kerry will return to Capitol Hill with a bit more stature, and Mr Weld to Beacon Hill with a lot less. But now the election is finally over, the state is positively soggy with nostalgia.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The race was cracklingly fierce to the last minute. In the home stretch, the <i>Boston Globe </i>revealed that Mr Kerry had once lived for nothing in a fancy Washington apartment owned by a lobbyist, and that Mr Weld's state agency for workers' compensation was shot through with corruption. On October 30th Ross Perot whizzed into Boston to bless Mr Weld's candidacy in weird terms: "If John Kerry is a veterans' advocate, I'm a Chinese aviator." On November 1st, Vice-President Al Gore stumped on Mr Kerry's behalf, and on the 3rd Mr Clinton himself--up a mere 32 points over Bob Dole in Massachusetts--rode to Mr Kerry's rescue at a joint appearance in Springfield.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the real joy of the Massachusetts race was that the candidates were not cynical. There was no doubting Mr Weld's seriousness about cutting taxes and shrinking government, or Mr Kerry's on fighting Republican excesses and improving education. The Clinton and Dole campaigns treated the electorate with contempt, and the electorate reciprocated. The Weld and Kerry campaigns treated the electorate with some respect, and the electorate repaid them.<br>

<p><b>The House</b></p>
<h1>Not booted</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC, AND DECATUR, GEORGIA</font><p>
IN THE last weeks of the campaign, as his re-election appeared certain, Bill Clinton basked in predictions that he would be the first Democrat since Franklin Roosevelt to win a second term as president. But Mr Clinton has also made history in a different way, at once more impressive and less pleasing. Not since Woodrow Wilson was elected president in 1916 has a victorious Democrat failed to lead his party to victory in the House. But Mr Clinton has done just that. By Wednesday, with only a few of 435 House races still in doubt, it seemed Mr Clinton's coat-tails would boost Democratic representation in the House by nine seats. The Democrats had needed a 19-seat gain in order to control the chamber.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For Republicans, this represents a heartening change. Their House victory in 1994 had ended 40 years of continuous Democratic control, triggering a furious debate as to whether their ascendancy was a temporary fluke or a lasting realignment. Since the second world war, Republicans had captured the House twice before, in 1946 and 1952; but both triumphs had been erased two years later. Now, with a Republican House re-elected for the first time since 1928, Republicans have laid the fluke theory to rest. And, if history is any guide, they will increase their majority in 1998. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Republicans' biggest achievement was to hold on to all but a few of the 73 seats won for the first time in 1994. Freshmen are always vulnerable, and this year they seemed especially so. As a group, they had acquired a reputation for radical government-cutting. Their enthusiasm for scrapping environmental laws, and for curbing the cost of pensioners' health care, was thought to be especially unpopular. Moreover, the trade unions had spent $35m to try to unseat 32 of the most wobbly freshmen, an unprecedented effort. And yet only 14 freshmen were defeated.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This reflects three factors. Some voters, assuming Mr Clinton would win the presidency, may have shrunk from giving Democrats a "blank cheque". Others may have retained unhappy memories of the last time Democrats ran the House, when official cheques bounced with scandalous abandon. Still others may have been turned against the Democrats by the trade-union campaign. The union ads, accusing freshmen of wanting to "cut" education and health care, were pretty crude; and Republicans were able to hit back with ads saying that the unions, which are not popular in most parts of the land, were plotting to steal the election.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All in all, 77 Republican candidates were defending seats in districts that Mr Clinton carried for the Democrats in 1992. Yet all but 18 (11 freshmen plus seven others) triumphed. The Republicans offset this loss by toppling three Democrats. They also picked up ten formerly Democratic open seats. The large number of Democratic retirements this year (30 in all) worked against the party's hope of gaining the majority. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As in the presidential race, men, especially white men, voted Republican; and rich voters leaned to the Republicans also. As in the presidential race, more money was spent on campaigning than in the past. Yet, as of October 26th, the total raised by all House candidates came to $374m, representing less than $500,000 per candidate. The presidential and Senate campaigns have grown slick to the point of discarding volunteers, whose old tasks of envelope-stuffing and phone-banking have been usurped by computerised professionals. The House races still have home-made charm; they are still chaotic and surprising.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This contributed to one of the more cheering results of this election. Back in the summer, there were fears that black representation in the House would tumble. Judges had ruled unconstitutional nine districts that had been drawn so as to ensure black representation. Despite this, 37 blacks were elected to the House this time. That is one fewer than after the 1994 election, but still an improvement on the 25 returned in 1990.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Best of all, this election showed that blacks can win white votes, even in the South and even without having to compensate for race by espousing conservative opinions. Until now, the only blacks elected from majority-white districts were two Republicans (and one of these, Gary Franks, lost his seat this week). This time round, however, four black Democrats won in majority-white seats. Among them, Cynthia McKinney won with 58% of the vote in a two-thirds white district. And her victory took place a mere half-hour's drive from the district of Newt Gingrich, the conservative House speaker.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The McKinney triumph was unprofessional, unslick, and so all the more endearing. Ms McKinney declared, four days before the vote, that her main ally was "street heat". She had walked across more than a third of her district over the past month, delivering thousands of newsletters by hand. She had stood each morning at highway intersections for two hours, waving placards at commuters. And, with the help of a multiracial band of volunteers, she was set to win. Only one of her wishes failed to come true. Her baseball cap said "Boot Newt" on it.<br>

<p><b>Voter initiatives</b></p>
<h1>Progressives all</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><p>
FOR candidates, election day settles the argument. They win or lose. In the case of propositions--of which there were 93 on the ballot this year, in 20 of the 24 states that allow them--election day is often merely the prelude to years of contention in court. Popular approval of measures does not mean they are constitutional. Nor does it mean that their opponents will gracefully concede defeat.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In California, where 12 propositions were on the ballot this year, the two most controversial passed handsomely: and immediately ran into legal challenges, which may have to go as far as the Supreme Court. The most important of these, Proposition 209, seeks to end all race-or gender-based preferences in state and local-government hiring, contracts and education. Just over 54% of the voters approved this measure; 46% opposed it, including top officials of all the state's colleges and universities. On Wednesday, civil-rights groups filed suit to block the measure, claiming not only that it was unconstitutional but that it conflicted with existing federal law.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Also passed, but delayed by legal challenges, was Proposition 215, which would legalise the use of marijuana in California (under doctor's orders) as a palliative in severe illness. Although cannabis relieves a host of ailments--from seizures to glaucoma to the nausea induced by chemotherapy--the federal government restricts it more tightly than even cocaine or morphine, forbidding doctors' prescriptions and blocking most research.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Arizona voters went further, approving not only the medical use of marijuana but also the parole of drug criminals not deemed to pose a risk to public safety. The money saved from incarceration is to be ploughed back into education and treatment, to which first-and second-time offenders will be sentenced instead of jail. Bill Clinton's drug tsar, Barry McCaffrey, called the proposition "a cruel hoax wrapped up in some attractive ideas", but voters apparently disagreed. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Election day also saw continued machinations by lovers of term limits. Facing a Supreme Court decision that ruled such limits on Congress unconstitutional, a group in Arlington, Virginia, placed similarly-worded initiatives on 14 different state ballots. Nine passed. In those states, legislators are now required to press for a constitutional amendment imposing term limits and, if they do not, to face re-election with ballots saying that they disregarded voters' instructions. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The technique is creative, to say the least. A similar plan worked early this century, when senators were first made subject to a popular vote. It is hard to get excited about term limits, which force voters into a choice they are free to make anyway by booting incumbents out. On the other hand, this is a good place to use referendums to make the public's wishes clear to their representatives. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Campaign-finance reform offers a similar challenge, but voters were encouraged by a heated national debate in the closing weeks of the campaign. Broad reforms passed this year in California, Colorado, Arkansas, Nevada and Maine. And the morally-concerned majority also had its say in Alaska, Colorado, and Washington, rural states where gun groups and hunters wield power disproportionate to their numbers. Propositions were passed there to restrain the use of bait, traps and hunting from aircraft, although anti-hunting measures failed in Michigan and Idaho.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like the affirmative action fight in California, a number of state initiatives mirror national debates. Proposals to raise the minimum wage beyond the new federal level of $5.15 an hour were rejected in Denver, Missouri and Montana, but passed in California and Oregon. The larger significance of the huge number of initiatives-- more than double the number posted ten years ago--is a return to the enthusiasm for direct democracy that marked the first decades of the century, when many of the laws allowing initiatives were passed in the first place. It is also fitting for the time, now that a Republican Congress and a Democratic president both purport to embrace the states as laboratories of democracy. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;California saw the largest sum ever spent to defeat a proposition: $37m, poured out by corporations to deter Proposition 211, which would have made it exceptionally easy for shareholders to sue them for fraud. The measure was defeated by 74% to 26%. Money's usefulness apart, the moral of 1996 is clear: if you are a white male who wants to work for the minimum wage, bilk small investors and smoke joints when you're ill, California is the place to be.<br>

<p><b>Campaign money</b></p>
<h1>Loose change</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><p>
THE limp campaign of 1996 has one resonant claim to fame. It was the most expensive ever. Between them, the parties had raised more than $207m by October 16th, compared with $75m in the previous presidential-election year. When donations from individuals and political-action committees (<font size=-1>PAC</font>s), public financing and "independent" expenditures are included, Common Cause, an organisation that worries about such things, reckons the campaign cost a total of $2 billion. Most of it was spent on television advertising.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last June, the Supreme Court handed down a broad interpretation of "independent" expenditures which emboldened parties to throw even more soft money into important races. Fifteen House candidates had spent more than $1m each by September 30th, with the speaker, Newt Gingrich, on top with $4.1m. According to Common Cause, 68 Senate candidates had by then spent $155m between them: Jesse Helms of North Carolina accounted for $12.2m, John Kerry of Massachusetts for $9.3m and Phil Gramm of Texas for $7.9m. Mr Gramm's opponent, Victor Morales, spent only $323,279. Texas is a particularly lopsided example of a general trend. In 20 races where an incumbent was running, only one challenger had spent more than the incumbent by September 30th.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From his perch in Little Rock on Tuesday night, President Clinton said "we must act and act now" on campaign-finance reform. With enough pressure from Ross Perot, it might happen. Mr Perot's 8% of the vote on Tuesday was a shadow of his 1992 performance, but his voice is still heard. As usual, he offers few specific solutions; he just demands that the problem be "fixed". But how? The Supreme Court has called restrictions on campaign spending a violation of free speech. Short of amending the constitution, then, legislators can assemble only a patchwork of voluntary limits, restriction on donations and free access to the media. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The voters of Maine opted on election day for a more radical approach, in a referendum calling for strict limits on spending and on private donations but offering public money to help candidates with their campaigns. A group of businessmen has derided this as "welfare for politicians". But David Donnelly, a backer of the idea, argues that his state will "truly sever the link" between private money and public officials. The law was designed to meet the Supreme Court's conditions, so it does not stop millionaires spending their own fortunes on their campaigns. But the millionaires' opponents can exceed the ordinary limits, and get extra public money to do so.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some say the current state of affairs is a small price to pay for the quadrennial choice of the country's leader. After all, Americans spent an estimated $2.5 billion on Halloween this year. But most Americans regularly put on their Halloween masks. Only one in 400 gives more than $100 to a political campaign. Behind the mask of politics, cash gets turned into unfair influence. Americans who deplore this phenomenon will be watching Maine with interest.<br>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><p><b>
WAS the 1996 campaign really so boring? We think not. Dole-speak, provided liberally (as it were) by the Republican candidate, gave delight and bafflement in equal measure. Here, nostalgically, is a parting selection:</b><p><br>
We've had millions and millions of dollars spent in Florida saying Bob Dole is against Medicare, Bob Dole is against Social Security, Bob Dole is against veterans, Bob Dole is against children. There<i>'</i>s nobody left. I<i>'</i>m against everybody.<br>
<i>St Petersburg, Florida, September 9th</i><p>[Clinton] came out against truancy, which I thought was courageous, said he's opposed to it. And I said, <i>'</i>'That's . . .that's statesmanship." Didn<i>'</i>t even take a poll. He just did it on his own.<br>

The cause of crime can be explained with one simple word: criminals, criminals, criminals.<br>
<i>Philadelphia, September 16th</i><p>They [the Clinton administration] look you in the eye and say<i>, </i>we're going to give you targeted tax cuts if you keep your room clean and eat your vegetables and do all the other things the government wants you to do.

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>A new Newt</h1>

"I'M GOING to write several books . . . the founding of the New York Zoological Society was a key moment in our history . . . you know, we could save $14 billion a year by reforming what we do on diabetes . . . " With that, Newt Gingrich bounces up from his seat on top of his roofless double-decker bus, turns his back to the cold wind, and surveys the campaign cavalcade that is following him. Each vehicle is filled with clean-cut supporters decked out in Newt shirts, dedicated to boosting the Republican vote in Mr Gingrich's Georgia district. Mr Gingrich seems thrilled. "Isn't this great?" he exclaims. "Five buses!"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This was the Newt Gingrich on display in the last days of the campaign, in his home district outside Atlanta. It is also the Newt Gingrich whom Americans are soon going to meet, a very different figure from the grim ogre vilified by Democrats since the summer. Having defied predictions that his Republican troops would lose control of the House, Mr Gingrich has every reason to bubble with good cheer. He can now look forward to at least another two years as speaker of the House-- and probably to more than that, since the president's party tends to lose seats in mid-term elections. Bob Dole's retirement makes him the Republicans' pre-eminent leader, as well as their most dynamic one. "I think Newt is in the early-middle phase of his career as a national leader," says one of the speaker's henchmen.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The old Newt--the one attacked in 75,000 Democratic campaign ads--wanted to impose radical budget cuts on a country unprepared for such stern measures. This backfired, so the new Newt on the double-decker bus mixes big ideas with tactical humility. He acknowledges the danger of pushing legislation without building public support first. He even sees the advantage in not pushing anything at all, and leaving the risks of leadership to others. When Mr Clinton proposed an ambitious solution to the inadequacies of American health care, he was butchered for his pains; when Mr Gingrich promoted necessary budgetary reform, he was similarly demonised. If you lead you bleed, is the conclusion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Old Newt (gleefully caricatured by Democrats these past months) was prepared to shut down the government to get his way. New Newt is a magician of compromise and coalition-building. His aides now boast that, rather than resist Democratic calls for a higher minimum wage earlier this year, Mr Gingrich brilliantly caved in, persuading fellow Republicans that so popular a measure could not be buried. He even went so far as to allow Phil English, a Republican from a Democratic-leaning district in Pennsylvania, to sponsor the minimum-wage bill. Mr English duly stressed this feat in his re-election campaign. His victory this week was a triumph of New-Newt tactics. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Old Newt demanded nothing less than revolutionary cuts in government. New Newt is adept at settling for small reforms and making the most of them. On the stump this autumn, Mr Gingrich liked to wave an ice-bucket before his audiences and regale them with the news that, by eliminating free ice deliveries to congressmen, he saved taxpayers the princely sum of $500,000 a year. Never mind that the speaker's plans to control the vast cost of retired Americans' health benefits crashed and burned. Mr Gingrich has privatised a congressional shoeshine stand, a post office and a beauty parlour.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is a rich irony in this. In his celebration of micro-policies, as in his newly pragmatic pose, Mr Gingrich looks uncannily like Mr Clinton, his fellow-victor of the week. This has not been lost on anti-government purists, who hiss with contempt for the speaker these days, as David Brooks has pointed out in the <i>Weekly Standard</i>. "He's randomly conservative," says one Republican. "He has no conservative instincts," says another. Old Newt was the hero of such folk. New Newt is accused of parroting fuzzy lines fed to him by focus groups.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet this seeming Gingrich-Clinton equivalence masks a big difference. Over the past two years, Mr Clinton has essentially conceded ideological victory to the Republicans, promising that the era of big government is over, ending guaranteed welfare payments and embracing the Republican drive to balance the budget. Mr Gingrich, in contrast, has conceded that his style was too abrupt, but his ideas are winning. He can afford to become a pragmatic compromiser now, because his grand ideological battles have mostly been won. "In just two years, Newt Gingrich has accomplished more than most leaders do in a lifetime," proclaim the leaflets in the speaker's campaign headquarters. The hyperbole is hard to digest, yet there is something to be said for the thought.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At some point in the next two years, Mr Clinton will probably appoint a commission to curb the cost of retired people's health care, even though the Democrats lashed Mr Gingrich for saying that this was necessary. The commission will no doubt look at ways to cut costs without compromising the quality of service to old folk, and so Mr Gingrich's excited talk about diabetes on the campaign bus (you can save money and improve health by moving to preventive care) may well turn into solid policy. Equally, the next two years are likely to see a debate about encouraging volunteers to work as a complement to the bureaucratic welfare state. Mr Gingrich's recalling of the volunteer heroism of America's past (as in the founding of the Zoological Society in New York) will doubtless become fashionable. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All of which points to the difficulty in interpreting this week's elections. Mr Clinton won by running against Gingrichite cuts in government, or at least a cartoon version of them. On the other hand, Mr Clinton stole many of Mr Gingrich's ideas; and Mr Gingrich survived a congressional election that was, to a large extent, a referendum on his speakership. The lessons of this mixed verdict will be debated for years. Among the many books that will offer an infallible interpretation, count on at least one from Mr Gingrich.<br>

<p><b>Singapore</b></p>
<h1>Goh slow</h1>

JUST as races are not always to the swift, nor battles to the strong, so elections are not always to ruling parties. But in Singapore, that is certainly the way to bet. The People's Action Party is assured of a big victory in the general election that has to be held by next April. Even the <font size=-1>PAP</font>, however, is subject to the ravages of time and chance, which Goh Chok Tong, the prime minister, is doing his best to mitigate.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the approach to an election, incumbents like their voters to be basking in the glow of rosy economic statistics. Unfortunately for Mr Goh, his government had on November 5th to reveal figures which showed that in the third quarter of this year, <font size=-1>GDP</font> was only 3.2% higher than in the same period in 1995--the lowest quarterly increase for ten years (see <a href="as1.gif">chart</a>). The growth forecast for the year as a whole was cut for the third time, to 6%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is hardly the stuff of recession as commonly understood (although, compared with the immediately preceding period rather than with last year, the economy had contracted for the second successive quarter, meeting the technical definition of the term used in America). Singaporean officials also point out, rightly, that the problems facing the economy are cyclical rather than fundamental. It has been hit by a regional slowdown and, in particular, by a global slump in sales and prices of some electronics products (see <a href="wb8439.html">page</a>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the less than usually hectic growth rate may be one reason why Mr Goh has said that this parliament will serve out its full term, until January 5th. Like British prime ministers, he has the tactical advantage of being able to choose the election date and, unusually for Singapore, has opted to wait almost as long as he can.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if the electorate does react badly to a hint of harder times, recent changes to the election laws will make it more difficult for the small opposition to increase its representation in parliament from the four out of 81 seats it currently holds. Last month Parliament passed bills that would allow an increase in the number of candidates elected in each "group representation constituency" or <font size=-1>GRC</font>. At present, there are 15 <font size=-1>GRC</font>s, each of which elects four members of Parliament from a single party slate. The other 21 come from single-member constituencies. Now the size of a <font size=-1>GRC</font> slate can be up to six candidates.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>GRC</font>s were introduced in 1988, to ensure that Singapore's minority races were represented in parliament, despite a public-housing policy that prevents ethnic enclaves from forming. Each party must field a candidate from a minority group, such as ethnic Indians or Malays, on its slate. However, because it has difficulty in finding enough credible candidates, the opposition has always seen the <font size=-1>GRC</font> system as evidence of the <font size=-1>PAP</font>'s determination to entrench its power. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The opposition has other troubles, too. Chee Soon Juan, leader of the Singapore Democratic Party, and one of the government's most prominent critics, got some figures wrong in a debate in August over health care. Last month, as a consequence, he was grilled for seven hours by parliament's privileges committee, and faces the threat of criminal charges and jail. The local pro-government newspaper, the <i>Straits Times</i>, reported that Mr Chee's evidence had been "confused" and "careless". An editorial on the parlous state of the opposition lamented that "Singapore deserves better". But given the fate of Dr Chee, it is hardly surprising if there are few volunteers to stand against the <font size=-1>PAP</font>.<br>

<p><b>Public spending</b></p>
<h1>Out of control</h1>

TO READ November 6th's newspapers, you would think that the previous day's cabinet had decided to spend its way out of the government's political difficulties. Ministers had agreed, they reported, to spend more next year on health (&#163;600m on top of &#163;34.2 billion); more on education (a "generous settlement"); more on police and prisons (with Michael Howard, the home secretary, "delighted"); and more on defence. Even Scotland and Wales seem to have fought off Treasury efforts to scrap the formulas which give them an anomalously big share of public spending.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;William Waldegrave, the chief secretary to the Treasury, who supervised this process, maintained a dignified silence. But he was far from pleased by the reports. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Five of the six "wise men", the Treasury's outside advisers, recommended on October 31st that Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, should not cut taxes in his November 26th budget. He will cut them all the same. It would therefore have suited the Treasury to have appeared tough on spending. Otherwise, markets may interpret the tax cuts as inflation-provoking election bribes, adding to the pressure for higher interest rates. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, the collective interests of the cabinet as a whole took second place to the departmental interests of its individual members. Out of control in their eagerness to proclaim victory in the spending round, they have undermined the Chancellor's efforts to seem prudent.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact, the settlement represents an honourable draw between spenders and controllers. Inflation has turned out rather lower than was expected at the time of the 1995 budget. To hold state spending next year to the real level planned then, Mr Waldegrave would have had to cut cash spending plans by some &#163;3.5 billion. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But that could only have been achieved at the cost of disagreeable political consequences--for example, rising hospital waiting lists. In the event, Mr Clarke, whose political antennae are second to none, seems to have settled for around half that amount. Public spending next year will be higher in real terms than this year. But according to Chris Giles, of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, the increase will only be around 0.3%. Compared with the 1991 Budget, when Norman Lamont planned a real spending rise of 4%, Mr Clarke's pre-election bribery so far is small beer.<br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>Oil bonus</h1>

ONE bit of inflation has been good news for Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer: the rising oil price (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>). Since August, the price of Brent North Sea, the marker crude, has risen from less than $20 to more than $25 a barrel. In the last few days, it has fallen back a bit but it is still nearly 25% higher than three months ago. Since the $14 low-point in the first quarter of 1994, oil prices have risen by 75%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the last Treasury pronouncement on the effect of the oil price on government revenues, six years ago, officials estimated that a $10 rise in the price of a barrel of crude, if sustained for a year, would result in an increase in revenues of about &#163;2 billion. Since 1990, taxes on North Sea oil have been lowered, so, according to analysts, the benefit of a $10 increase is now reckoned to be about &#163;1.5 billion. Still, this windfall, equivalent to a reduction of more than 1p in the standard rate of income tax, is not to be sneezed at--especially by a hard-pressed Chancellor facing a pre-election budget in a month's time.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the longer term, however, the effects of higher oil prices are less beneficial. According to Opal, an oil-price research company, the price of unleaded petrol at the pumps has risen by an average of about 5p per litre since the low point of 54p per litre in July. Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, predicts that inflation in the world's five richest countries is likely to increase by 0.2-0.3% by the end of the year as a direct result of the movement in crude. British exporters are also anxiously monitoring the exchange rate. Over the past two months, the pound has risen strongly against both the dollar and the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark, to $1.64 and DM2.49 respectively.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Will the price stay high? Goldman Sachs predicts that the price of crude will average $25 a barrel in the last quarter of this year and in the first quarter of 1997. Other oil analysts disagree: there is still plenty of spare capacity, and production may start increasing. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The oil companies, meanwhile, are not complaining. <font size=-1>BP</font> announced on November 5th that its third-quarter profits had risen 33% to &#163;761m. Sir David Simon, its chairman, said the chancellor should not even think of a windfall tax. Now there's a thought.<br>

<p><b>Broadcasting</b></p>
<h1>Big bad Rupert</h1>

A KIND of hysteria has gripped some of the British press at the sight of <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>, that notorious but successful satellite-television broadcaster, preparing to order the first set-top boxes to receive and decode digital signals. <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> is 40% owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Within a few years the whole of British broadcasting will be under his control," yelped the <i>Independent</i>. Mr Murdoch is not quite that close to a monopoly--whatever happens to the airwaves, cable television will still provide competition--but this is a crucial time for other broadcasters.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Digital television requires special receiving equipment. Signals sent from a satellite, through cable or over the air all require different devices, and most of the channels will be encrypted, so that they can be watched only by subscribers. Because <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> seems certain to be ready to launch digital satellite television in Britain before anybody else, rival broadcasters worry that people will buy its set-top-box decoders. When their own channels are launched, people will not want to buy a second set-top box.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This prospect especially alarms the <font size=-1>BBC</font>, which cannot afford to underwrite its own set-top boxes. Even so, it still hopes to produce a package of digital subscription channels. The public broadcaster has been lobbying furiously for guaranteed access to the <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> decoder box.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>, for its part, grumbles that the <font size=-1>BBC</font> wants a free ride. It is afraid of the cable industry, which is increasing its share of the market in areas where the two compete head-on, and is also likely to go digital next year. For now, <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>'s main problem is to find partners to help it subsidise the set-top boxes, which will otherwise cost viewers an unattractive &#163;500 or so apiece. It has been talking to <font size=-1>BT</font> and Barclays Bank about the possibility of sharing the bill, in exchange for using the boxes for home shopping and banking. But a deal with <font size=-1>BT</font>, the richest potential partner, will have to get past Oftel, the telephone industry's regulator. Last month Oftel stopped a joint promotion between <font size=-1>BT</font> and <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>, offering cheap calls to <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> subscribers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government, harried on one side by the <font size=-1>BBC</font> and on the other by <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>, has failed to satisfy either. A new set of regulations, about to be published, will oblige anybody offering a set-top-box gateway to allow access to other broadcasters on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The <font size=-1>BBC</font> fears that <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> is so far ahead that these regulations will mean nothing.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is probably too bleak. Oftel will police the rules, which is appropriate, for the problem is much the same as the interconnection arguments that arise endlessly in the telephone network, when one telephone company wants to send calls across a rival company's network. There, the argument is usually not about access, but about price.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Meanwhile, the bones of a possible compromise are emerging. <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> has decided that its set-top boxes should have a plug to allow the attachment of an inexpensive receiver for digital terrestrial television. Because digital terrestrial television will be available in many more homes than satellite services, it is likely to have a much bigger market than satellite alone would provide. In exchange for a terrestrial slot on good terms, <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> might just consider a common interface, to allow its set-top boxes to be used by other broadcasters. This would encourage customers to buy the boxes and could help <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> defray the costs and win more viewers. Would that be a victory for the <font size=-1>BBC</font>? As the telephone business proves, having access to a rival's network is no guarantee of a bigger market.<br>

<p><b>Government</b></p>
<h1>Big brother</h1>

FREQUENT visitors to America can by-pass immigration queues at <font size=-1>JFK</font> airport in New York by using a smart card and a machine-read handprint. In Australia, job-seekers can call up vacancies on touch screens at 320 Job Centres. About 7m Spaniards in Andalucia can access their own state-benefit records, their privacy protected by an electronic check of their finger prints. And Britain?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Belatedly, it is catching up. On November 6th Roger Freeman, the public-services minister, published a consultative green paper--on <font size=-1>CD</font>-<font size=-1>ROM</font>, naturally--on the electronic delivery of state services. Three pilot schemes to pave the way to one-stop electronic access to government data were launched, including terminals at a branch of the NatWest bank in London. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Making it easier to extract information from government will be phase one. Phase two will allow proper two-way communication. People will be able to get into the system using home personal computers, digital television or terminals in public places such as libraries. The provision of access might even be contracted out to building societies and banks which already have a network to serve their own customers. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In time, people will be able to submit their income-tax returns electronically. Biometric identification (for example, a nifty device that recognises people by studying their iris) may take the place of a written signature on the return.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government claims that services will be available where you want them, when you want them. Responses will often be instant. But those who want to go on using paper and stamps will be able to do so.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The programme could cost an average of &#163;200m a year over ten years, but savings will be higher. Moreover, the cash to pay for it will come from the private sector. Before private firms get paid for what they have installed, they will have to make it work. Deals will be structured so that the more the public uses the system, the higher the return to providers, so they will have an incentive to make their systems user-friendly.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This being Britain, there are plenty of sceptics. Civil-service trade unions worry that the new technology will cost clerical jobs. Some civil servants are concerned that too much is being handed over to private firms, which may fail to respond quickly and sensitively to the demands of democratic politicians. Civil libertarians conjure up nightmare scenarios whereby police, tax and benefit data are linked up, giving bureaucrats total knowledge of every citizen. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Peter Lilley, the social-security secretary, is about to lend credibility to this charge. He wants to change the law so that he can get access to tax records to check claims for benefits. This will be tough on fraud but also tough on law-abiding people who don't want any old <i>apparatchik </i>crawling over their tax affairs.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The green paper tries to soothe these fears. It suggests that a single database of names and addresses held by government would be useful, so people who move house would have to send the state only one change-of-address card. But otherwise, it floats proposals for data-sharing only cautiously. Each department will be allowed to use information only for the intended purpose. Data-protection safeguards will not be changed. Big brother? A friendly one, maybe, but keep watching.<br>

<p><b>The Co-operative movement</b></p>
<h1>A lot at stake</h1>

<font size=1>MANCHESTER</font><p>
GRAHAM MELMOTH hopes to be the Tony Blair of retailing. On November 4th Mr Melmoth became chief executive of the largest part of Britain's Co-op movement: the Co-operative Wholesale Society (<font size=-1>CWS</font>), a mutually owned conglomerate with annual sales of &#163;3 billion ranging from fish fingers to funerals, pensions to package holidays. Like Labour before Mr Blair became its leader, the Co-ops have been losing business to their capitalist rivals, and finding it hard to recruit young people. Not only does Mr Melmoth want a New Labour-style revival, he sees a modernised Co-op as the very heart of the "stakeholder society" that Mr Blair dreams of.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour and the Co-ops share common roots. Poor conditions in Britain's industrial towns in the 19th century led to the Labour movement's rise and were the reason why the Rochdale Pioneers set up the first Co-op in 1844, so that the poor could club together to buy decent, affordable food. The idea spread across Britain and at one point there were 1,400 local Co-op societies. But in modern times, fierce competition from privately owned supermarkets has led to a string of mergers and closures. There are now just 52 Co-op societies, of which by far the largest are <font size=-1>CWS</font> (which started out as the movement's wholesaler) and Co-operative Retail Services (<font size=-1>CRS</font>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In spite of repeated attempts at modernisation, the Co-ops have continued to lose customers in recent years (see <a href="br2.gif">chart</a>). Their main problem is that whatever they do, capitalist firms do it better. Their original job of feeding the poor is now done by deep-discount supermarket chains like Aldi and Netto, whose prices are lower. Most Co-ops these days are aimed at the mass market. But, says Richard Hyman of Verdict, a retail consultancy, the stores and their product lines are often years behind their capitalist competitors.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Co-ops' mutual-ownership status means they cannot easily raise capital on the stockmarket, limiting their ability to invest in updating their stores. But, unlike those building societies which are heading for the stockmarket, Mr Melmoth does not accept that mutuality is past its sell-by date. Anyway, <font size=-1>CWS</font>'s complex ownership (it is owned both by individual shoppers and by other Co-op societies) would make a flotation highly impractical. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Melmoth says the Co-ops still have a strong position in catering to small towns and in running "convenience" stores. But even such unfashionable redoubts are now under attack. Giants like Tesco are building smaller shops in such secondary locations because new planning rules are limiting the number of sites for giant stores. Convenience stores are also being added at many petrol stations, and the deep-discounters are still expanding, grabbing more of the Co-op's cash-strapped shoppers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How can the Co-ops fight this fresh onslaught? Recently, they have decided that if they cannot compete on price or product range, then they will compete on morals. Updating the principles of the Rochdale Pioneers, <font size=-1>CWS</font> is promoting itself as the "Responsible Retailer", championing "fair trade" with poor countries and selling environmentally friendly products. Its Co-op Bank subsidiary has won new customers by promising not to lend to dictators or firms that test their products on animals. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This has two big flaws. First, such lofty principles appeal most to the young and affluent, not the old and poor, who shop at the Co-op (and which it would not want to desert). Second, if ethics sell groceries, you can bet that capitalist supermarkets will turn moral. As if to prove this, on October 28th Tesco began selling organically grown fruit and vegetables at the same price as their intensively farmed equivalents.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As well as joining Tony Blair on the moral bandwagon, Mr Melmoth hopes to emulate his successful recruitment drive, by turning more Co-op shoppers into "stakeholders", ie, members of a Co-op society. Members used to be rewarded through the "divi", a loyalty-card scheme which most Co-ops abandoned years ago because it was too costly. Ironically, just as Co-ops are talking of bringing the divi back, their rivals, led by Tesco, have got in first with loyalty cards of their own. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One way of making the 52 Co-op societies more competitive would be to merge them, thereby cutting costs and rationalising the muddle of different names and formats that they trade under. But repeated attempts to merge <font size=-1>CWS</font> and <font size=-1>CRS</font> have failed; last month, plans to merge their non-food stores collapsed. Mr Melmoth plans to have another go, but even if he succeeds, a united Co-op would still be too small. So his short-term job (again, like Tony Blair's) is to continue his predecessors' work of modernising <font size=-1>CWS</font>, replacing a bureaucratic regional structure with a strong, centralised management and a clear marketing strategy.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;New Labour might not like to be associated with the Co-op's dowdy image but it should take an interest nonetheless. The Co-op movement is the nearest Britain gets to Mr Blair's "stakeholder" vision. If its approach cannot survive in competition with shareholder capitalism, the movement will prove that Mrs Thatcher was right when she said "there is no alternative". And one day soon, there may be no such thing as the Co-operative Wholesale Society.<br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>Clinton's slippery coat-tails</h1>

AS THE barber-shop quartet at the American embassy's election-night bash swung into "Georgia on my Mind", Bagehot spotted two modernising members of Britain's rival political parties in animated conversation. Were they debating what President Clinton's victory meant for America's budget deficit? Whether he would remain involved in Bosnia? Where next for the Helms-Burton act and Europe's trade with Cuba? Bagehot sidled nearer.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's just as we've been telling you," he heard the one in the Armani suit with the blue carnation in the buttonhole say. "It's the economy, stupid. Wait until next May when voters here start focusing on the bottom line, and they'll be flocking back to John Major just like they've flocked back to Bill Clinton on the other side of the pond. I don't care whether it's Bill or John, whatever you throw at an incumbent, you're not going to persuade voters that everything is bad when they are feeling good."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Trust you to be superficial," replied the one in the Armani suit with the red rose in the buttonhole. "Yes, of course the economy is important in any election, but that plays for us, not you. American voters admire the way Bill Clinton has cut the deficit, just as British voters admire the way Tony Blair got Labour away from tax-and-spend. When Bill talks education and training, voters think he talks sense--just as they do when Tony does it for us. As for your government, the voters fingered you as a load of bunglers from the day Britain left the European exchange-rate mechanism in 1992."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though he was drinking only Perrier with his pecan pie, Mr Blair's colleague was becoming animated. "Here's the real message of tonight. Two years ago America fell into the hands of the crew who dominate your party here. There was Newt Gingrich and his 'Contract with America' and the religious right. Sure, it had its appeal; I don't deny that. But the American people tried it, and they didn't like it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's the same with your lot here. Voters have had it up to their necks with right-wing policies. They've had it with right-wing rhetoric. And don't forget they've had 17 years of it where America has only had two.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Of course, they don't want the left either, which is why we've modernised. We've done just what Bill Clinton did to the Democrats, moving away from big government. Tony is Bill without the sex and the sleaze, which is why in May your lot will be history."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Sleaze, you're on to that old story again are you?" his Tory friend interposed. "Like your blessed Tony with that holier-than-thou crap of his? Look what has happened in America. There's Bob Dole, the war hero; there's Bill Clinton, sleaze incarnate--and who wins? Mr Sleaze. John Major is 'Honest John'. Do you really think sleaze could actually destroy him, when it hasn't stopped Clinton being re-elected?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Alright, sleaze may not have worked in America but neither have tax cuts," said his Labour friend. "You keep on telling me that Kenneth Clarke has only to cut taxes now, and promise more to come, and our poll ratings will plummet.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well that didn't work in America, did it? Bob Dole promised tax cuts yet the voters were not interested. Some of them remembered that he used to be against bribery. It's the same with you. If you start cutting taxes now, British voters will remember the 22 times you've put them up since 1992."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That proves nothing," said the Tory. "Bob Dole's problem was not that he promised tax cuts. Bob Dole's problem was that he was a lousy candidate.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He never had a strategy. First he said that Clinton was a liberal, then he said he was stealing the Republicans' clothes. First he refused to play the sleaze card, then he was attacking Hillary. Bob Dole must be the worst candidate for high office since you ran Michael Foot in 1983. And despite all that, he started the campaign 20 points behind the president and finished up only eight points down.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We Tories are going to stick to our lines. At least, we're going to stick to them unless the goons from Central Office persuade the prime minister to get side-tracked on to <font size=-1>EMU</font>. 'The Enterprise Centre of Europe.' 'New Labour, New Danger.' 'Opportunity for all.' And even you have to admit that John Major is a great campaigner. Remember the soap box? Remember his passion over the constitution in 1992? Well, you ain't seen nothing yet." <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two paused to wave away a waiter bearing a tray of margaritas. Bagehot could bear to remain silent no longer. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Gentlemen, gentlemen. I have listened to you burbling on for the last half-hour and it has rarely been my misfortune to endure such a farrago of stuff and nonsense. The truth is that the American election and the British election are different sorts of events in different political systems played to different rules with different campaigning instruments. It is therefore not surprising that, as a cursory glance at the record will show, there is no correlation of any kind to be found between the results of 13 post-war presidential elections and those of Britain's 14 general elections. Incumbents win, incumbents lose; left and right advance and retreat; good candidates do well and bad candidates do badly on both sides of the Atlantic, in a way that is entirely <i>sui generis</i> to each particular election in each country in the circumstances of each election year; and therefore, despite your half-plausible theorising and your special pleading and your ingenious attempts to link what is not linked, nothing you have said has the least bearing on the question of which of your parties will win Britain's general election next year. Gentlemen, I bid you both good night."<br>

<h1>A marriage of convenience</h1>

<font size=1>LONDON AND NEW YORK</font><p>
<p><b>BT's takeover of MCI is the biggest transatlantic deal ever, but the merger is still surprisingly light on substance</b></p><br>
AS WEDDINGS go, it lacked romance. The bride and groom had been living together for years, and already had a child. They got along pretty well, but he had been worried that her head might be turned by another man. Better, he reckoned, to wed her now and avoid the prospect of fighting for her heart later. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That, with a little lacy licence, is the reality behind the biggest transatlantic merger in history, which was announced on November 3rd: the $21 billion takeover of <font size=-1>MCI</font>, an American telecoms firm, by Britain's <font size=-1>BT</font> (See <a href="wb1.gif">table</a>). The wedding invitations--full of breathless talk of global logic and synergy--were echoed by starstruck analysts, who hailed the deal as a harbinger of a coming revolution in the global telecoms industry. But a closer look reveals a largely defensive move that, at least internally, will mean few real changes at all.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is not to say that the deal is a mistake; indeed, it may have been unavoidable. <font size=-1>BT</font> and <font size=-1>MCI</font> have been linked since 1993, when the British ex-monopoly bought 20% of the nimble long-distance carrier. Together, the two set up Concert, a joint venture to provide global telecoms services for multinational firms. Arguably, because they had already cemented their link with cash, their partnership was more cohesive than a loose web of global alliances offered by <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, a big American rival.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>BT</font>'s worry was that <font size=-1>MCI</font> might be bought by another firm. The American company carries one-fifth of the country's long-distance calls and two-fifths of its overseas calls. But after its early success in grabbing market share from <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, it has been struggling. It would have been a tempting target for one of the regional "Baby Bells", spun off when the original <font size=-1>AT&T</font> was broken up in 1984. They expect to be allowed into the long-distance market soon, under the terms of the Telecommunications Act passed earlier this year. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>BT</font>'s 20% stake entitled it to match any offer for <font size=-1>MCI</font>. But, with several potential suitors, some even bigger than <font size=-1>BT</font>, it seemed safer to slip the ring on <font size=-1>MCI</font>'s finger now, even if doing so meant paying a 44% premium over its current share value. Sealing the deal should take another year or so, a delay due mainly to the need for the union to be blessed by America's regulators. With some tweaking, they are likely to clear it. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the past, <font size=-1>MCI</font> has been promiscuous in its search of a strategy, flitting from liaison to liaison. In 1994 it invested $1.3 billion in Nextel Communications, a wireless-telecoms company--a deal that was subsequently broken off. Then it took a stake in Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, an alliance that is now looking cool. It has also formed alliances with everyone from Microsoft down.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now both <font size=-1>BT</font> and <font size=-1>MCI</font> claim that, simply by combining their operations--the new company, like the existing global partnership, will be called Concert--they will increase their annual pre-tax profit by nearly $850m by the fifth year after the merger. Set against a combined pre-tax profit of nearly $6 billion today, that is hardly a reason to merge. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bigger gains might come from using <font size=-1>BT</font>'s financial muscle and expertise learnt in Britain's local market to launch an assault on America's $100-billion-a-year local telephone market. Gross profit margins on long-distance calls in the United States are well over 40%; profits on international calls are even higher. But at present each long-distance call starts and finishes in a Baby Bell's local territory--and for that privilege long-distance carriers such as <font size=-1>MCI</font> pay the Bells 45 cents out of every dollar of long-distance revenues.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One way <font size=-1>MCI</font> could have sidestepped this tariff would have been to hook up with a Baby Bell, which is why it had in recent months been holding exploratory talks with two previously merged pairs--Bell Atlantic and Nynex, and <font size=-1>SBC</font> Communications and Pacific Telesis--as well as <font size=-1>GTE</font>. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It has also been trying to crack the local market itself with a venture called <font size=-1>MCI</font> Metro, which is building networks to connect corporate clients in 34 American cities. This has had limited success. By the end of this year <font size=-1>MCI</font> will have spent $1 billion on such networks; yet in the third quarter of the year, <font size=-1>MCI</font> Metro generated a paltry $45m in revenues, out of <font size=-1>MCI</font>'s total quarterly revenues of $4.7 billion. And most of its sales were to <font size=-1>MCI</font>'s other businesses.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Making money in the local market will grow harder as competition cuts prices. Many analysts expect local-call revenues to grow only slowly during the next few years. Worse, the new rules for opening local telephone markets are delayed in the courts. Until <font size=-1>MCI</font> is sure what those rules will be-- and it may be another year before they are clear--it cannot decide whether it is wiser to buy or lease network capacity from the incumbent Bells, or to build more of its own network, as it has done so far. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That leaves the global strategy. The theory behind the original Concert joint venture was that multinational clients could avoid having to deal with lots of different carriers. <font size=-1>AT&T</font>'s WorldPartners and the GlobalOne trio of Deutsche Telekom, France T&eacute;l&eacute;com and America's Sprint offer something similar (see <a href="wb8442.html">page</a>). Of the three, Concert has been the most successful, winning more than $1.5 billion-worth of contracts and claiming more than 3,000 corporate customers. But its revenues are tiny--in its most recent quarter, <font size=-1>MCI</font> reported $160m in overall sales for the venture--and it is unprofitable. <br>
</p><p><b><b>Concertina</b></b><br>
It is hard to see what Concert gains from a merger. <font size=-1>BT</font> and <font size=-1>MCI</font> have already integrated their global networks more successfully than their competitors have. And <font size=-1>MCI</font>'s marketing skills have already been applied to the venture. <font size=-1>BT</font>'s chief executive, Sir Peter Bonfield, suggests that gains will mostly be made by doing more of the same: merging the sales and marketing forces a bit further, and sharing more technology. In fact, an even bigger benefit may come from winning the confidence of customers, who tend to view loose global alliances with suspicion because they are prone to acrimonious collapse.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The best thing that could now happen to the deal would be for a regional Bell to buy into it. Such an addition would, in a single move, bring more local customers than <font size=-1>MCI</font> could hope to assemble by itself in a decade. The Nynex and Bell Atlantic duo seems the best match--they have the most customers making calls across the Atlantic--but <font size=-1>GTE</font> would be available to do a deal earlier. It is the only regional giant already allowed into the long-distance market.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"<font size=-1>BT</font> has reinforced its western front," says Joseph Kraemer, a telecoms analyst with <font size=-1>A.T.</font> Kearney, a consultancy. From there, Asia and Europe beckon. Continental Europe's biggest telecoms markets will open in 1998, and Sir Peter says that <font size=-1>BT</font> will bid for licences where it can. It already has joint ventures in a number of other big European countries, notably France and Germany. Asia is trickier. Had <font size=-1>BT</font> been able to buy Cable & Wireless, as it had hoped earlier this year, it would have won Hong Kong Telecom to boot--and a chance to break into the Chinese market.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Instead, Concert is now hoping for some arrangement with Japan's <font size=-1>NTT</font>, with which <font size=-1>BT</font> already has long-standing links. <font size=-1>BT</font>'s bosses said this week that a deal would have to wait until next year at the earliest, when Japan's regulators are expected to rule on the company's own future. Transforming a transatlantic tryst into a global <i>m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois</i> will not be easy.<br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>Marriage guidance for would-be brides</h1>

THREE alliances offer global telecoms services. Concert, progeny of the liaison between <font size=-1>BT</font> and <font size=-1>MCI</font>, is one; the others are WorldPartners, led by <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, and GlobalOne, combining Deutsche Telekom, France T&eacute;l&eacute;com, and America's Sprint. Both the American carriers may sometimes wish that they had found a beau with such a liberal upbringing as <font size=-1>BT</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All three alliances are oddities. They offer the largest customers of the big telephone companies that own them a one-stop shop for telephone services and rates on international calls that sometimes undercut those charged by local monopolies. Often, local laws allow such discounting providing the ventures limit their reach to big companies.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is a relatively new business, but one that is growing quickly--together the three global alliances claim about $3.3 billion in contracts. Yet their ultimate ambitions lie far beyond catering for rich corporate clients. Eventually, they hope to use their global networks to destroy the telecoms rules and rate conventions that have kept standard international calls so expensive for so long.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most such calls are charged according to rates set by each country, in most cases by a monopoly national carrier, as part of a process called "settlement". These rates are usually much higher than the firms' true costs and vary wildly: a call from France to the United States costs twice as much as one in the opposite direction. Because the three main global networks send calls along their own wires, and do not have to hand them off to another carrier at either end, they are able to bypass the settlement system altogether. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Today, these networks carry only a small percentage of global telecoms traffic. But as national markets start to open over the next decade, they hope to carry ordinary calls from individuals the same way. In a report to be published later this month, Analysys, a British consultancy, predicts that this could lead to the erosion and eventual collapse of the cosy settlement system. As more traffic bypasses it through global networks, call-back services, and routing through telecoms hubs in low-cost countries, the settlement rates will be eroded.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This will mean not just cheaper calls for all. Most telephone companies will find international business suddenly becomes a lot less profitable. Concert's two rivals consist mainly of telephone companies from countries where markets are still closed--France T&eacute;l&eacute;com and Deutsche Telekom for GlobalOne; 16 companies covering 31 countries for WorldPartners. These companies may be reluctant to cut their prices too fiercely, lest they cannibalise their owners' profits. As a result, they may be least aggressive in the very markets where they have the greatest technical advantages--those of their parents. This weakness is something that Concert, made up of two firms from competitive markets, is sure to exploit.<br>

<p><b>Asian electronics</b></p>
<h1>The silicon tigers' electric shocker</h1>

<font size=1>SINGAPORE</font><p>
<p><b>The economic fortunes of Asian economies are bound up with the electronics industry. A self-inflicted glut is causing a scare</b></p><br>
WHETHER it is making cellular telephones, computers, televisions, pocket calculators or the chips that make them all work, nearly every country in Asia is involved in some aspect of the electronics industry. That is only natural. The electronics business can be entered in all sorts of ways, by making anything from simple components to elaborate consumer products. But too many tigers chasing even as buoyant a market as electronics is a recipe for glut. If the market turns down, Asian economies' fortunes will be dragged down with it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Asian countries' dominance of some consumer-electronics markets is phenomenal. Taiwanese companies, for instance, make eight out of ten circuit boards found in the world's personal computers and half of the keyboards plugged into them. Singapore makes some 40% of the world's disk drives, and a third of <font size=-1>PC</font> microprocessors are packaged and tested in Malaysia. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the market into which Asian companies have leapt furthest is the one for memory chips. When shortages drove up chip prices four years running in the early 1990s, even Taiwanese food companies and plastic makers began building $1 billion-a-pop chip-making plants. Such diversification no doubt seemed irresistible at a time when margins were sometimes above 80%. But the resulting glut caused prices to collapse earlier this year--by as much as 70% for memory chips, which are used in products ranging from <font size=-1>PC</font>s to photocopiers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now there appear to be signs of a return to what the semiconductor industry apparently considers "normal": output is set to rise and prices to resume their long-term decline at 30% a year. America's Semiconductor Industry Association forecasts that the value of chip sales will grow worldwide by 3.5% in the fourth quarter; but that is still modest compared with last year's 42% increase. For the time being, some of the new plants are likely to be mothballed.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The markets for the things that chips go into are still growing briskly (see <a href="wb2.gif">chart</a>). The number of personal computers worldwide is still forecast to rise by 16% between this year and 1997, according to International Data Corp, an American research firm. But prices are unlikely to stop falling--especially now that Hitachi and Sony, two of Japan's biggest consumer-electronics giants, are muscling into the computer business.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The danger in this is that the fortunes of Asia's economies are closely linked to those of the electronics industry, and especially to memory chips. The repercussions of plunging chip prices have been felt throughout the region. In the first half of this year, export growth throughout East Asia collapsed to just 7%, compared with 28% in the same period a year earlier, according to the Asian Development Bank (<font size=-1>ADB</font>). The bank suggests several reasons: the weaker yen has made Japan more competitive, and some countries in the region, such as China and Indonesia, are trying to cool their economies. But the <font size=-1>ADB</font>'s economists also lay a large part of the blame on a downturn in the electronics business.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Depressed demand for electronic products partly explains slower growth in Singapore. Its manufactured exports (two-thirds of which are electronics goods) shrank by 6% in September, while <font size=-1>GDP</font> growth in the third quarter had slowed to just 3.2% from a year earlier, when it was racing along at 8%. South Korea and Taiwan, two other countries that rely heavily on electronics, are also turning in lower growth figures.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To make matters worse for Asia's tigers, the region's poorer nations are also trying to muscle into the electronics business. The ensuing battle could keep capacity running well ahead of demand. The Philippines is one of the latest to push into electronics in a big way. From a low base, the value of its electronics exports surged by 45% in the first seven months of this year. With a relatively cheap, well-educated, workforce that speaks good English--the language of the computer industry--the country is pitching hard for more business. "I think we can assume overcapacity will be here for some time," says Liow Voon Kheong, director of the electronics division of Singapore's Economic Development Board. To help its electronics companies cope, Singapore recently launched a crash training programme to give more people the sort of skills the firms might want.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Faced with stiffer competition, firms will search out the fastest-growing niches. Many Taiwanese firms think that they have found a promising one: making lap-top computers, mostly for western firms such as Compaq, <font size=-1>IBM</font>, Hewlett-Packard, Apple and Dell. Lap-top computers tend to have higher profit margins than desktop <font size=-1>PC</font>s because they are more complex to make, and unit sales have been growing by 30% a year. This year Taiwan aims to make nearly 4m of them, overtaking Japan as the world's leading producer.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If other Asian firms follow suit, the Taiwanese could respond by shifting production to cheaper areas. Taiwan's Acer, which is the world's fourth-largest computer firm, has already opened a factory in the Philippines. Yet chasing cheap labour around the Pacific rim is no longer as helpful as it used to be. These days, wages account for less than 5% of the cost of producing many electronic goods. Far more value may therefore be added by nimble staff who can quickly redesign a product, rather than by opening an assembly plant in a country paying lower wages. The sooner Asia's tigers learn that lesson, the better.<br>

<html><head><title>What a choice</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" width="78" height="39" alt="The Economist" border=0></p>

<h1 align=center>What a choice</h1>


THE presidential election campaign has been a strange affair, and not just because it has afflicted voters and onlookers alike with many months of torture-by-tedium. It has been strange because the two candidates have spent so much of the time wearing each other's clothes. Bill Clinton, a man who normally cannot let a bandwagon pass without leaping on to it, has cast himself as the solid, reliable, unflinching incumbent, looking to the future rather than to the past, of course, but doing so sober of mien and straight of spine. Meanwhile, Bob Dole, who for 36 years in Congress stood for prudence and for the non-existence of fairies, has run as a tax-cutting radical, declaring (against all available evidence) that the economy is doing miserably and that he has a magic formula to make everyone richer. Since both these poses test credulity to the limit, it is no surprise that many voters snoozed off as the contest went on.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, on November 5th a choice must be made. Or must it? The fact that the opinion polls suggest that Bill Clinton will win easily, and perhaps even by a landslide, may be enough to persuade even more people not to bother to vote than is usual in America, or at least to focus their attention instead on the battle between Democrats and Republicans for control of Congress. That likelihood even makes it tempting for <i>The Economist</i> to suspend its four-yearly habit of endorsing a candidate for the presidency, for making a choice feels less poignant when the outcome seems so clear.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet such apathy would be wrong for us, and it would be wrong for the voter. Although the congressional vote is the more exciting one, because it is more finely balanced, many of the important issues concern both these races. Both races will help determine--in Congress by the outcome, for the presidency if only by the size of Bill Clinton's victory-- whether the broadly Republican ideas of trimmer government and fiscal austerity that have held sway during the past two years will continue to do so during the coming four. And choosing a president ought never to be a casual, shoulder-shrugging affair: getting the right man to lead the world's superpower may be a trying business, but it is also vital.<b><p>A flawed challenger</b><br>
That point holds true even when the men on offer are far from appealing. In the spring of this year Bob Dole looked the sounder of the two even if not the likeliest winner in November. The tragedy of his inept campaign is that he has looked less sound as each week has passed.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reputation that made him the Republicans' senior figure, and clear front-runner throughout 1995 for that party's nomination, was that he stood for what nostalgics see as old-fashioned values and what others see as merely high standards. In Congress, most recently as Senate majority leader, he had been a deal-maker; after all, that was his job. But he stood up for his beliefs, supporting free trade against many of his own party's protectionists and attacking Ronald Reagan's supply-side tax cuts in the early 1980s. His speeches rambled, his wit was sometimes mean, his campaigning dire. But what marked him out was character. Whereas most politicians look good on the surface but rather shabbier beneath, Bob Dole was an exception: apparently too honest to try hard to look good, but rather admirable once you got to know him.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such a character would be well suited for the presidency, if combined with a steely determination in foreign affairs and a willingness to appoint (and listen to) top-notch advisers. Mr Dole's terrible error this year has been to drop that character and try another one: at best, that of the tax-cutting radical; at worst, that of a man willing to discard his principles to get himself elected. His economic plan contains many good ideas, including tax reform and reductions in federal regulation. But its biggest supposed vote-winner, a 15% cut in personal income tax, would be a disaster. Like the Reagan cuts that Mr Dole opposed, it would widen the budget deficit; with unemployment low and the economy growing strongly, it would stoke up inflation. With that plan, and that character change, he made himself an unappealing choice.<b><p>
A flawed incumbent</b><br>
Until, that is, you compare him with the alternative. Mr Dole has thrown his principles away for four months. Bill Clinton has been doing that for four years. That may be a little unfair. But not much, for the difficulty with Mr Clinton is that he changes so often that it is hard to know what you are supporting, or opposing. In 1992, <i>The Economist</i> endorsed this relatively unknown but energetic governor, arguing that President Bush had run out of steam. Four years of hindsight later, that choice looks like a mistake.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under Second-Term Bush the economy would have been just as healthy as under Mr Clinton, and Alan Greenspan would have done exactly the job at the Federal Reserve that he has anyway been doing. There would have been no distracting fiasco over health-care reform, and the task of reforming welfare might (thanks more to Congress than Mr Bush) have begun sooner. Even more important, there would have been some constancy in foreign policy, built on the foundation of the Gulf war victory. Errors would doubtless have been made. But America and the world would have been spared Mr Clinton's first two years of foreign policy made on the hoof; generally getting it right in the end, but taking several wrong turns along the way.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton has not been a bad president; just a mediocre one. He may have been helped by the fact that he has not had to deal with any huge international crises (he nearly helped to cause one, over China and Taiwan), though he would argue that this has hindered him, by not allowing him to show his mettle. His great achievement was the North American Free-Trade Agreement, a deal begun by Mr Bush but in the end well marketed by President Clinton. His worst error came also on trade, however: taking Japan, supposedly one of America's closest allies, to the brink of a trade war over cars.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He has, to be sure, learned from his mistakes. His foreign-policy touch has grown sharper. Brought to his knees by the 1994 mid-term congressional elections, he recast himself as a moderate Republican, keen to balance the budget by 2002, to declare that the "era of big government was over" and, at last, to begin reforming welfare. It is on that ticket that he has run this year, making many small pledges but no new big ones. If he sticks to that position, his second term might not be at all bad. Such a president would be a good balance to a Republican Congress, if (as is to be hoped) that party retains its control of it. Many of the ideas that such a Congress would stand for, including tax reform and further reform of the government safety net, are good ones; President Clinton could usefully restrain the Republicans' social-policy extremists. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But will he stick to that position? That is the question that will always surround him. If he does, this newspaper will congratulate him in 2000 when he retires. But the risk is that he will not. He will face financial constraints imposed by the bond markets, but none of the constraints of re-election. He may be beset by ethical problems, whether over campaign finance or Whitewater indictments, even conceivably of his wife. These might lead him in all sorts of new directions, especially if he has been re-elected on a landslide, and if the Democrats were to regain control of one or both of the houses of Congress. No one can be sure what he would do in such circumstances. And that is why <i>The Economist</i> feels unable to endorse him. We would not know what we were backing.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Would we know with Bob Dole? It is hard to be sure. We choose him on the assumption that the real Bob Dole is the one who spent three decades on Capitol Hill, not this year's dubious character; that he would be more prudent than his economic plan implies. That is an awkward basis for an endorsement. But the choice is a lousy one.<br>

<h2>Zaire on the brink</h2>
<p>Zaire and Rwanda appeared close to war as the Zairean army was driven back by Tutsi militias in <b>eastern Zaire</b>. More than half a million people, mainly Hutu refugees, have been displaced yet again, and aid workers, forced out by the fighting, are unable to provide help.</p>
<p><b>Eugene de Kock</b>, a former South African policeman who assassinated opponents of apartheid, was jailed for more than 200 years for murder, fraud and other crimes.</p>
<p><b>Palestinians and Israelis </b>negotiated on, and on, over Hebron. Yasser Arafat went to Europe, hoping for cash and support. The <font size=-1>EU</font> appointed its own "envoy" to (but not in) the talks. West Bank tensions rose after the killing of a Palestinian child. </p>
<p>A <font size=-1>UN</font> report said many children are dying of malnutrition and disease in <b>Iraq</b> because of sanctions. Rival factions of Iraqi Kurds began peace talks, under American sponsorship, in Turkey.</p>
<h2>Germany gasps</h2>
<p>Germany will <b>fail to meet the criteria</b> for joining Europe's currency union because of its debt and budget deficit, according to Germany's six leading economic institutes. The finance minister, Theo Waigel, was mauled in parliament. Germany, Britain and the Netherlands objected to <b>France</b>'s accounting methods for meeting the criteria.</p>
<p><b>Helmut Kohl </b>became Germany's longest-serving chancellor this century, surpassing the record 14 years and one month set by Konrad Adenauer in 1963.</p>
<p><font size=-1>EU</font> farm ministers agreed in a majority vote (Germany dissented) to give an extra 500m ecus ($630m) to farmers financially hurt by the <b>mad-cow crisis</b>. France, Germany and Britain will get over half the extra aid, which is on top of 850m ecus already agreed.</p>
<p>A candidate for the right-wing opposition, Petar Stoyanov, won the first round of <b>Bulgaria</b>'s presidential election, beating the (ex-communist) Socialist, Ivan Marazov.</p>
<p>The centre-left Labour Party, led by Alfred Sant, beat <b>Malta</b>'s ruling conservatives in a general election. The new government says it will leave <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s Partnership for Peace programme immediately.</p>
<p><b>Britain and Albania</b> settled a 50-year dispute. Albania will pay $2m for damaging two British navy ships and causing the deaths of 44 sailors off the Albanian coast in 1946. Britain will give back gold worth $20m taken from Albania by Nazi Germany during the second world war and which has since been held in the Bank of England.</p>
<p>A sale in Vienna of <b>Jewish-owned art</b> looted by the Nazis raised more than 153m schillings ($14m), four times estimate. The money will go to victims of the Holocaust.</p>

<h2>Random variable</h2>
<p><b>North Korea </b>upset its neighbours by announcing that any missile it develops will be tested "whenever and in what manner" it sees fit. South Korea kept up the tension in the peninsula by refusing further dealings with the North until it apologises for sending a submarine into the South's waters in September.</p>
<p>Wang Dan, a campaigner for <b>democracy </b>in China, was sentenced to 11 years in jail for, it was claimed, plotting to overthrow the government. Mr Wang previously spent several years in prison after taking part in democracy demonstrations in 1989.</p>
<p>Around 30 candidates put their names forward for the post of chief executive of <b>Hong Kong </b>after the British colony is handed back to China in 1997.</p>
<p><b>Japan </b>now has a minority government. In the wake of the general election, a loose alliance was agreed between the Liberal Democratic Party, led by prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, and the smaller parties that have been part of the governing coalition.</p>
<p>The Pakistani capital, Islamabad, was sealed off by the government for three days to prevent a march on parliament by <b>Islamic fundamentalists </b>calling for the resignation of the prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. In another development, the International Monetary Fund said that it would renew financial support to Pakistan.</p>
<p><b>Narasimha Rao</b>,<b> </b>India's former prime minister, appeared in court accused in connection with a forgery case seven years ago.</p>
<h2>The third man</h2>
<p>In the last week of the <b>American presidential race</b>, Bill Clinton held on to his commanding lead over Bob Dole, the Republican, in the polls. Ross Perot, the Reform Party candidate, rejected a request by the Dole campaign that he should withdraw. In turn, Mr Clinton rejected Mr Perot's request for an hour-long debate on ethics. </p>
<p>The Justice Department formally acknowledged that <b>Richard Jewell</b>, a security guard named as a suspect in the bombing at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, was no longer a suspect in the case.</p>
<p>The judge in the <b>Oklahoma bombing trial </b>said that the two defendants would be tried separately. </p>
<p>Awaiting the official results of <b>Nicaragua's elections</b>, the Sandinists'<b> </b>presidential candidate, ex-president Daniel Ortega, still refused to concede.</p>
<p>A nearly new Fokker jet on an internal flight <b>crashed </b>soon after take-off in Sao Paulo, Brazil, killing all 95 people on board, and destroying homes.</p>
<p>The United States' ambassador to <b>Colombia</b> denounced a draft allowing extradition of drug-traffickers because it would not be retroactive. "He thinks he's a viceroy," said one minister.</p>

<h2>Currency capers</h2>
<p>(See <a href="bw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>The <b>dollar </b>reached a 3.5-year high against a flagging yen. But the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark rose strongly against the greenback after the country's leading economic institutes predicted that Germany might not fulfil the criteria for joining European economic and monetary union, and that German interest rates could soon rise. Meanwhile, an unexpected quarter-point rise in British interest rates caused an already strong pound to jump to a 20-month high of $1.63.</p>
<p>In South Africa, the <b>rand </b>fell to a record low of 4.74 to the dollar. Worries about the country's minuscule foreign reserves were among the things that were blamed for the currency's decline.</p>
<p>The <font size=-1>IMF</font> said payments of its $10 billion loan to Russia could resume soon. But first it wants to be sure that the government is tackling the country's <b>massive tax arrears</b>. Russian officials have launched bankruptcy proceedings against four big companies and threatened several others with similar action.</p>

<p>Independent auditors, under the aegis of a committee led by a former chairman of America's Fed, Paul Volcker, are to be granted unprecedented access to <b>Swiss bank accounts</b> as part of an investigation into whether Swiss banks have disguised the assets of Nazi victims from their rightful owners.</p>
<p>Two of the biggest <b>German regional banks</b>,<b> </b>state-owned Norddeutsche Landesbank and Bankgesellschaft Berlin, in which the state of Berlin has a 56% stake, said that they were discussing a closer alliance. A full merger between the two would create Germany's second-biggest bank, with DM500 billion ($330 billion) of assets.</p>
<p><b>Deutsche Bank</b>, Germany's biggest, said that Rolf Breuer, a management-board member, will succeed Hilmar Kopper as its chief executive next May. Mr Breuer has helped to mastermind the bank's aggressive push into investment banking.</p>
<p>Several current and former senior executives of <b>ITC</b>, an Indian tobacco company in which Britain's <font size=-1>B.A.T</font> Industries has a stake, were arrested in connection with alleged violations of the country's foreign-exchange rules. </p>

<p>France's prime minister, Alain Jupp&eacute;, promised to hold a parliamentary debate on the transfer of <b>Thomson Multimedia</b> to Daewoo, a South Korean company, as part of the government's plan to sell Thomson <font size=-1>SA</font>, a state conglomerate, to the Lagard&egrave;re group. Opposition to a sale of the consumer-electronics arm to the Korean firm is growing.</p>

<h1>Where's the outrage?</h1>

<p><b>In January, America's voters were thought to be furious. Now, on the eve of the election, they seem remarkably content. What happened?</b></p><br>
THIS was meant to be an election fuelled by anger. Back in February, when Pat Buchanan won the New Hampshire primary, pundits noted that Americans were miserable, furious, insecure in their jobs, frightened of technology and still incensed with politicians. Of the candidates available then, only Mr Buchanan, with his eloquent invocations of class warfare and immigrant hordes, seemed to tap that feeling. "The peasants are coming with pitchforks!" he cried, summoning up a vision of his supporters besieging Evil Baron Bill in White Castle. Naturally, he could not win. But it was no surprise to see first Bob Dole, the Republican, and then Bill Clinton himself, setting off in hot pursuit of the discontented voters Mr Buchanan had spoken for. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a time, "insecurity" was the issue of the day. The candidates remembered, all too acutely, the fate of George Bush in 1992. Mr Bush had been taken by surprise in New Hampshire, again by Mr Buchanan, because he had failed to note that three-quarters of the voters there were worried about the economy<i>.</i> In 1992, the worries had been genuine. The economy had been slow to recover from recession; and, although the underlying indicators were healthy, the electorate was not then feeling the benefit. Bill Clinton's campaign mantra, "The rich got richer, and the middle class got the shaft", hit home; in their droves, the blue-collar Democrats who had switched to Ronald Reagan in the 1980s turned back to the Democratic Party. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This year, to all appearances, the state of the middle class (which in America encompasses almost everyone between janitors and millionaires), seemed equally unhappy. Since 1993, the North American Free-Trade Agreement had potentially enabled more jobs to be lost to low-wage Mexico (the "giant sucking sound"). Immigration, both legal and illegal, was at record levels. Companies were plunging headlong into the new vogue of "downsizing", boosting share prices while eliminating jobs in their thousands--and these were in secure industries, such as aerospace or telecoms, on which the post-war American dream had been founded. Worst of all, stagnant wages, which had been a feature of the 1980s, began to affect larger numbers of people higher up the income scale. Two jobs, rather than one, were needed to keep a middle-class family in the style to which it had become accustomed; and with working women had come a host of new social strains and difficulties.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The candidates in 1996 played with these issues for weeks. Yet, try as they might, they could not suggest what to do about them. In 1992, the solution had been relatively easy: a middle-class tax cut. Both Mr Clinton and Mr Bush offered one, and it was eagerly received: so eagerly, that it took Ross Perot to remind both candidates of the virtues of a balanced budget. This year, however, taxes have seemed to have little to do with the underlying malaise.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The presence in the Republican primaries of Steve Forbes, a billionaire publisher with a one-plank platform of a flat tax, encouraged most of the Republican candidates to flirt with their versions of a flat tax in the early months of the year. Mr Forbes disappeared early and the flat tax went with him, at least as an election issue. Only a shade of it--Mr Dole's vague promise of a "fairer and flatter" system--survived in the Republicans' economic plan. To the degree they grasped the flat-tax argument, voters seemed genuinely worried that it would not be revenue-neutral, but would be an unacceptable crimp on government. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once the flat tax was set aside, both Mr Dole and Mr Clinton began to emphasise their original offer of tax cuts for the middle classes. But here was another surprise: the voters seemed wary, and not even particularly interested. Mr Dole's offer of a cut of 15%, the central theme of his campaign, never caught fire. Voters simply did not believe his arithmetic. Mr Clinton's smaller tax cut, not much more than a token nod to middle-class worries, was preferred because it was safer. Indeed, polls showed that most Americans, offered a choice between the Republican tax cut and a balanced budget, much preferred the latter.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps, then, the issue of job insecurity could be addressed directly. But this proved hard. Suggestions by Robert Reich, the labour secretary, that the government should try to oblige corporations to behave "more responsibly" towards their workers, got precisely nowhere. Mr Dole's brief attack on Wall Street greed was so ridiculous that it was abandoned the next day. Mr Clinton, who was not then actively campaigning, wisely kept his head down. Candidates were quickly reminded that it is unthinkable for an American government-- even one controlled by Democrats--to tell firms how to behave. The flurry died down.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But if corporations could not be blamed for middle-class anxiety, other things could. On the right, the Republicans had already taken up cudgels against both affirmative action and immigration, on no firm evidence that either was a stealer of middle-class jobs. The Clinton administration, too, had promised to review policies in both fields. Bills to overturn affirmative action and to crack down on immigration were already going through Congress. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a time, it seemed that these might be the hot issues of 1996. They were not. Outside California--where both issues have been the subject of contentious local propositions--voters failed to seize on either racial quotas or immigration as a focus for their anger. And once Mr Buchanan had retired from the scene, no candidate tried to encourage them. The votes of blacks and Latinos were not so lightly to be tossed away. Besides, as far as jobs and wages were concerned, most Americans were not at all as angry as they seemed. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This fact became increasingly clear as the campaign proceeded. In retrospect, the fury of January and February looks like the last gasp of wilful economic ignorance, before the figures became so relentlessly encouraging that Americans could no longer ignore them. Even at the end of last year, employment in the old manufacturing industries of the mid-west was rising so fast that workers had to be recruited from other states. <font size=-1>NAFTA</font> was found not to have exported jobs to Mexico; on the contrary, a new taste for American goods there added to job-creation north of the border. Downsizing had been balanced either by the creation of new jobs in the same companies, or by the opening of new opportunities elsewhere.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Increasingly, voters reported that they felt happier both about Mr Clinton's management of the economy, and about their own prospects. The president's bold claims to have created 10.5m new jobs, to have lowered unemployment to 5.1% and to have encouraged a long and solid expansion, were allowed to pass without much remark even by Republicans.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Dole's assertion that the economy was "in bad shape" found no hearers; the claims of Jack Kemp, his running mate, that the economy could grow at twice the rate of the Clinton years were received with the ridicule they deserved. The typical swing voter was no longer the anguished man with a pink slip; it was the "soccer mom" whose four-wheel-drive car, demanding job and attendance at well-groomed football pitches suggested a prosperity hampered only by a chronic lack of time. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Undoubtedly, not everyone was lifted by the economic boom. But those who were left behind were increasingly the young, black, ill-educated or unskilled, whose votes were insignificant because they often did not bother to vote. Once most Americans reported that they felt more cheerful about their prospects, the issue of insecurity vanished: at least for the moment, and at least as fuel for anyone's campaign. <br>
</p><p><b>The moral high ground</b><br>What then of the other angry issues? At one time, there were plenty of them. Abortion, for example, had not died down since 1973, when a decision of the Supreme Court made it legal. The Christian right (disappointed in its efforts to get anti-abortion measures included in the Republicans' "Contract with America" of 1994) had vowed to fill the Republican convention with delegates pledged to oppose abortion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Its efforts were largely successful. Yet the issue, while still mentioned locally, never surfaced for long in the national debate. This was largely because Mr Dole let it be known that the Republican Party could comfortably accommodate both supporters and opponents of abortion. Such an assurance stretched credulity, but it worked. For in truth, again, most of America is not angry about abortion; it dislikes the practice, believes it should be legal but rare, and is sick of the politicisation of the subject. Even Mr Clinton's veto of a bill banning partial-birth abortions, which provoked angry protests from America's Catholic bishops, caused barely a flicker in the mood of the electorate. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There might have been more mileage in that other pre-eminent issue of the right, moral decline. The topic was passionately debated in 1992, after Dan Quayle, Mr Bush's running mate, regretted the portrayal of single motherhood as an acceptable "lifestyle choice" in a television soap opera. At the Republican convention in Houston that year, Mr Buchanan's tirade about the liberal onslaught on Judeo-Christian values was rapturously received.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From a conservative moralist's point of view, nothing in American media or public life has improved since that speech was made. Indeed, the presidency itself is now occupied by a man of questionable moral character. But the fate of the issue lay with the personality of the conservative candidate. Mr Dole was intent on avoiding moral righteousness to preserve the unity of his party, and the embarrassed cough of a decent man was no substitute. He struck a chord for a time with a bold attack on Hollywood for filling America's screens with violence and promiscuity; but, after Hollywood huffed, he more or less dropped the subject. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the closing weeks of the campaign, and especially in the second presidential debate, Mr Dole homed in on the ethically-challenged White House itself; but the connection between impenetrable Arkansas scandals, Asian fund-raisers and any wider sense of moral drift proved difficult to make. "Where's the outrage?" asked Mr Dole, plaintively, in Dallas on October 25th. Good question. But time and again, polls showed that voters were not much bothered by Mr Clinton's personal shortcomings. If he was a good <font size=-1>CEO</font>, they were happy to overlook the rest. And by September, the president did indeed seem to be the successful manager of contented folk: which raises the question: if he had not been, would he have weathered so buoyantly the justified attacks on his character? <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is not quite the whole story. To some extent, Mr Clinton's embrace of welfare reform in mid-campaign also deflated the issue of moral decline. In 1992, it could be argued (and was by both sides) that the system of welfare payments was a prime cause of demoralisation, dependency and inner-city failure. By 1996, the key word "responsibility" was being proclaimed at full blast by both parties. The easy dichotomy of 1992 (or, even more, of 1994) between morally stern Republicans and sloppily compassionate Democrats had disappeared in at least one vital area of government policy; it therefore became harder to argue that it was true in general. <br></p><p><b>A pox on both parties<br></b>Americans, however, were meant to be angry with politicians as a species this year, regardless of label. Observers of politics just before the Republican cataclysm of 1994 had described an electorate seething with a fury that could scarcely be explained. Incumbents were self-satisfied; the power of special interests was unbudgeable; too much time was spent in Washington; there was no accountability or control. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since most of the 1994 incumbents were Democrats, this discontent seemed easily remedied by a switch of parties in Congress--especially when Republicans were promising an upheaval. But voters remained angry even after they had kicked the Democratic bums out. The Republican honeymoon (and, in particular, the honeymoon of Newt Gingrich, the abrasive speaker of the House and self-appointed revolutionary leader) ended within a year, even though the freshmen in Congress delivered, or tried to deliver, almost everything they had promised. Rumour had it that the American voter was unappeasable; he hated both Republicans and Democrats. And his anger this time might really induce him to go for a third party.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It did not happen. It hardly ever happens, of course; but Ross Perot's 19% in 1992 had been impressive, and voters did not seem so angry then. Why did Mr Perot's campaign fail so signally in 1996? Partly because he was neither as fresh nor as visible as before; partly because his suppression of dissent in his Reform Party left a sour taste. But Americans were also not half as angry with the status quo as they were said to be. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For all the tirades against Republicans and Democrats, the truth is that the two big parties still deliver the goods both nationally and, more to the point, locally. At election time, the big-party machinery (with its plentiful lubricant of special-interest money) swings impressively into gear, and voters are swept along by it. Americans this year might have had some cause to be angry about a rotten choice of candidates; instead, they were resigned and passionless.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Besides, a third party succeeds only when it can harness an issue that is stirring the country to some extraordinary degree, but which the big parties are ignoring. Mr Perot's anti-deficit jeremiads almost provided such an issue in 1992; but both Republicans and Democrats have now seized that theme for their own, and no other similarly galvanising issue can be found these days. Americans in early 1996, asked which issues worried them, gave about 11% equally to crime, schools, the economy and a number of other things (see <a href="sf1.gif">chart</a>). This was the clearest sign--and it should not, perhaps, have come as a surprise--that there was no single furious torrent in January, more a confluence of streams which have since trickled out along numerous different channels and are now on the point of sinking into the ground. <br></p><p><b>The good old status quo</b><br>In fact, the overwhelming impression of the 1996 campaign is that voters, far from being furious with government, want things to remain pretty much as they are. They want none of the big entitlement programmes--Medicare, Social Security and the rest--to be touched. They like Mr Clinton's little bits of government-intervention-at-the-margin, on such matters as school uniforms and parental leave. They succeeded two years ago in kicking out an entrenched form of government, which has refreshed the debate; but they have also had their brush with revolution, and a little went a long way.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Republicans after the 1994 election misread voters' anger as badly as the Democrats did before it. They thought they had been given a mandate to deregulate, shrink government, cut spending and cut taxes. In fact, the negative grumpiness of voters did not translate into a positive passion for something different. Americans did not really know what they wanted. As it happens, parts of the revolution they got--from the banning of unfunded federal mandates to the turning over of welfare payments to the states--have made voters feel they are slightly more in control of the machinery of government. And there is nothing like the delegation of a portion of responsibility to make people feel that they are happy for the government to go on doing the rest.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of the various shows of temper of the past few years, only two cases of genuine anger can be discerned: frustration with stagnant wages and with incumbent politicians. Incomes have still not moved much: although average household income rose in 1995 for the first time in six years, earnings for full-time workers, both men and women, declined. As for incumbents, plenty are still ensconced, while the brave new freshmen of 1994 have discovered the charms of special-interest money. But even a small sign of movement in the right direction has made for a generally placid electorate, who seem poised to return a mediocre incumbent by a massive margin. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For America's mainstream politicians, this is good news. It is probably good, too, for American politics, for no democracy can function successfully if the electorate is in a state of permanent disgruntlement. But for America as a whole, there is also a dark side. There is no shortage of issues in America worthy of public outrage--but these are being aired only partially in the political debate.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The inner cities are home to a growing number of people who have no regard for, or connection with, the moral, political or social mores of the country as a whole. Guns and drugs are a growing menace. The public-school system, once internationally admired, looks ramshackle, and too few Americans are leaving school with the skills needed to compete in the global marketplace. Relations between the races are rockier than they have been for some time. And America remains burdened by an unfair and over-complex tax system. Any one of these issues is worth a campaign in itself. But the lesson of 1996 is that none of them will count for anything if the average middle-class voter feels her wallet is well-filled and her prospects satisfactory. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Is this a sign of narcoleptic boredom induced by television? Is it exhaustion produced by over-excitement two years ago? Is it the proof of an attention span no longer than the president's? Yes, all these things; and one more. Most Americans know in their hearts that they are the world's most fortunate nation, the most secure from war, the most economically self-reliant, and the most free. Under such circumstances, of course, it is still possible to be unhappy. But to be politically furious for any length of time takes effort: effort which, in the mid-1990s, most voters simply do not have the time or the inclination to make.<br>

<h1>A Democratic Nixon?</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON DC</font><p>
THE presidential race is winding to a close, and in some ways it seems to have been extravagantly fruitless. More cash--clean, laundered, or otherwise-- was spent on campaign ads than ever before; but for nearly a year Bill Clinton's lead over Bob Dole has remained more or less static. And yet something remarkable has transpired. Mr Clinton's Democratic Party has shifted sharply right; and this change is forcing Republicans to change also. The result may be a long-term shift in the identity and electoral appeal of both big parties. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Democrats used to be the party of the welfare state, of misgovernment-as-usual, of a tendency to believe that the poor and the unconventional and even the criminal deserved more sympathy than average Americans. Starting with his 1992 campaign, and even more convincingly this time, Mr Clinton has abandoned those positions. He has ended guaranteed welfare, and proclaimed the era of big government over. He has trumpeted his tough policies on crime. He has talked little about helping gays or feminists or poor blacks, addressing himself instead to the concerns of the middle class--of people who "work hard and play by the rules", as his campaign rhetoric has it. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In so doing, Mr Clinton has put his party in America's middle ground, a territory once occupied by Republicans. In the late 1960s the Democrats chose to be the exciting party rather than the majority party. They embraced civil rights, feminism and the new campus counter-culture; and these fashionable crusades alienated ordinary voters. Because the Democrats had vacated the middle ground, Richard Nixon could pitch his campaign to the "silent majority" in 1968. He won, and Republicans held the White House for 20 of the next 24 years. The Democrats' single victory, in 1976, was a post-Watergate anomaly. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now America is experiencing the mirror image of this process. Under Newt Gingrich, the radical speaker of the House, the Republicans have become the exciting party. They have latched on to this decade's trendy themes: resentment of government, rising religious fervour, the belief that the era of the Internet will compel radical decentralisation of power. But the exciting party, in the 1960s as now, is not the majority party--at least not when it comes to presidential elections. The Gingrichite drive to curb public spending, to close down several departments of the federal government and to hand their functions to the states, has made Mr Dole seem extreme. As a result, the silent majority that backed Nixon now looks to Mr Clinton. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the moment, not many commentators are willing to see this as a lasting shift. After all, Mr Clinton has not been re-elected yet, and a last-minute catastrophe is always possible. More likely, Mr Clinton could be re-elected and then tack left, as he did after his 1992 victory. The labour unions, which have spent an unprecedented $35m on getting Democrats elected to the House, will demand a pay-off. Indeed, their opposition to spending cuts may be so strong as to undermine Mr Clinton's centrist pledge to balance the budget.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A post-election leftward shift cannot be ruled out, but the odds are against it. Mr Clinton's most obvious leftish policy in 1993 was his attempted revamp of health care; this time round, his campaign is devoid of equivalent promises. Moreover, although the unions will emerge from the election with some clout, other trends will balance this. Democratic candidates for the House and Senate this year have done their best to cast themselves as moderates. They are less likely to push Mr Clinton left than their peers were four years ago. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Besides, there is another reason to believe in the Clinton-Nixon analogy, and it is the most telling. Whatever a re-elected Clinton might do in office for the next four years, the next Democratic presidential nominee is almost bound to be a centrist. The lesson of the past two years is simply too powerful to ignore. At the start of 1995, when Mr Clinton was seen as being on the left, he lagged likely Republican rivals by huge margins in the polls. A year later, when the president was on the right, he was ahead by equally huge margins. For this reason, Dick Gephardt, the likeliest leftish contender for the Democratic nomination four years from now, has lately been tacking right. Al Gore, the probable nominee, is on the right already.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the Democrats continue to claim the middle ground, can Republicans stave off a string of losses like the one suffered by Democrats before them? This year's campaign shows how difficult this is. For much of this year, Mr Dole has tried to devise policies with mass appeal, but which Mr Clinton had not claimed before him. The Democrats had usurped the Republicans' traditional role as the pro-business party, so for a while Mr Dole echoed Pat Buchanan's attacks on corporate downsizing. The Democrats had become the party of fiscal discipline, so Mr Dole abandoned years of fiscal caution in favour of cutting taxes. Casting around for more ways to look different, Mr Dole put aside his old support for racial quotas and denounced them. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;None of this really worked, with the result that Mr Dole flitted from one theme to the next, sacrificing his claim to be the constant leader who could be trusted by the electorate. It is the crowning irony of this campaign that the garrulous president has promised only small things, leaving people to guess what he would do in his second term. Meanwhile the taciturn challenger has thrown out a promiscuous list of half-explained proposals.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Might things work out differently four years from now? Some of Mr Dole's ploys, such as his attacks on business, are never likely to get a Republican elected. Others, such as his attack on Mr Clinton's character, will not work against a different candidate. But the Republicans are not without hope. On two issues, the Democrats have yet to seize the middle ground, leaving an opening for skilled attack. These issues are school choice and racial quotas.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a speech in California on October 28th, Mr Dole gave a glimpse of the powerful case to be made against racial quotas. Opposition to discrimination of this kind is not a blow against blacks, but a blow in favour of individual rights, he said. He could have gone further. Quotas tend to help the black middle class; by replacing them with a drive to find work for the underclass, government compassion could better find its target. Strangely, neither party has yet made this case. The Democrats urge the need to find jobs for the welfare underclass; the Republicans attack racial quotas. Neither has grabbed the middle ground by putting the two together. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Dole tried, but failed, to make a winning argument on school choice. All Americans want better schools; most would like a choice of where to send their children. The Republicans say the answer is to give parents education vouchers. The Democrats are not willing to go so far, partly because of their strong ties to teachers' unions. A more skilled orator than Mr Dole could have feasted on this: his opponents stood in the way of parental freedom and children's opportunity to learn, because of their ties to a special interest. Four years from now, a Republican candidate may well return to this promising subject.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All of which is to say that the Democrats' shift to the centre, though remarkably well advanced, is not complete yet. Mr Clinton has stolen many Republican ideas, just as Nixon governed like a Democrat. But he has not stolen all of them. Over the next four years, this may change: the Democratic Leadership Council, home of the party's intellectual right, is urging a break with racial quotas and progress towards school choice. That would make the centrist Democrats even harder to defeat. Unless, that is, the Nixon-Clinton analogy holds in one final way, and second-term Clinton is disgraced by a Watergate of his own.<br>

More surprisingly, Mr Perot says he thinks "every American" would pick Mr Dole over Mr Clinton if that were the only choice (thanks to Mr Perot, it isn't).

<b>Bimbo eruption:</b> Many expected one, but few expected it to involve Mr Dole rather than Mr Clinton. From 1968, nearly four years before the end of his first marriage, Mr Dole had a long-term relationship with a Washington woman, according to the tabloid <i>National Enquirer</i>. The <i>Washington Post </i>had previously confirmed the story, but deemed it unfit to print.<br>

<b>Counter-omen: </b>"The presidential candidate with the greatest number of royal genes has always been the victor since George Washington," says Harold Brooks-Baker of Burke's Peerage. Both Messrs Clinton and Dole can trace their ancestry to King Henry III; Mr Clinton can also trace his directly to Simon de Montfort and Robert I of France. This makes his blood marginally bluer. However, says Mr Brooks-Baker, "President Clinton's descent from Henry III is illegitimate." <br>

<p><b>The campaign</b></p>
<h1>A long day's journey</h1>

<font size=1>UNIVERSITY CITY, MISSOURI, AND DENVER, COLORADO</font><p>
YOU do not need to have spent months on the campaign trail to get a pretty good sense of the way things have gone. Just a day will do. Take last Monday, October 28th, eight days before the election.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bill Clinton was in University City, Missouri, where his own polls tell him he is some 12 points ahead. Bob Dole was in Anaheim, California, where he trails by up to 20 points. In front of Mr Dole was a podium with the word "Trust"; behind him and in every camera shot, thanks to amazing stage-management, stood the eccentric congressman, Bob Dornan, who makes Newt Gingrich look like a moderate.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Having prolonged the visit to California, the Dole camp needed to decide where to travel next. The first plan--an overnight stop in Denver on Monday, then on to Ohio before returning to Washington--was abandoned. Maybe Mr Dole would go to Denver on Tuesday, then on to Louisiana. Or maybe not. Throughout Monday, planners waited for the candidate to "sign off" on a schedule; but on Monday evening, with time running out to organise the next day's events, staff were still unsure where their candidate would be going.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was a telling illustration of a campaign plagued by indecision. Mr Dole had lurched from one tactic to another, from economics to ethics, from optimism to anger. Towards the end, he had turned his anger against the "liberal" media (always a bad sign) and against the supposedly sleepy electorate (even worse). He had sent his campaign manager on a bizarre and ultimately humiliating mission to try to persuade Ross Perot to drop out of the race. Now, with barely a week to go, he had apparently lost all sense of direction.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Back in Missouri, Mr Clinton was, as usual, basking in bright sunlight and-- voice slightly hoarse, body reaching towards the crowd, hands resting intimately on the front of the podium--showing off to the "Show-Me" state the latest piece of good economic news. The budget deficit for 1996, the president revealed, was a smaller-than-forecast $107 billion, 63% lower than when he took office. In the distance, a few demonstrators were shouting and holding signs such as "Cattle Futures" and "Paula Jones". But Mr Clinton carried on constructing his metaphorical bridge to the 21st century, before departing to squeeze in stops in Minneapolis and Chicago.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even the mishaps at Clinton events play to his advantage. The president was supposed to be joined at the rally by the best-known local politician, Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader who hopes to replace Mr Gingrich as speaker if the Democrats recapture Congress. But Mr Gephardt missed his flight from Washington. Republicans were thus deprived of perfect images to illustrate their end-of-campaign warnings of a Clinton-Gephardt nightmare (that is, a return to unchecked Democratic power).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the end, Mr Dole opted for a quick stop in Denver on Tuesday before returning to Washington. His campaign cobbled together an event at the Colorado Convention Centre, inviting geologists in town for their annual meeting in an effort to boost turnout. A few geologists turned up, despite the fact that Mr Dole was competing with sessions such as "The Godzilla Syndrome: scientific inaccuracies of pre-historic animals in the movies." Uncharacteristically, it was an animated evening in a packed hall, but Mr Dole was clearly desperate to get back to Washington. Perhaps he should have headed for University City, too. There, in a restaurant called Blueberry Hill, he would have seen Chuck Berry's guitar on display. A famous Berry refrain would make an apt theme for the Dole campaign: "No Particular Place To Go."<br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>The Rules of the game</h1>

"DON'T accept a Saturday-night date after Wednesday." Thus <i>Rule#7 </i>of "The Rules: Time-tested Secrets for Capturing the Heart of Mr Right" (Warner Books). The slim volume by Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider is taking America by storm (or rather, by confetti). It is discussed on talk shows, chuckled over in newspaper features, debated at dinner parties. American girls--not women, in Rules-speak--are either religiously following the 35 Rules in order to find a husband, or else deriding the ideas but buying the book and handing it on to their friends. Either way, America is Rules crazy.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why limit this to winning your man? Might there not be equally potent Rules for winning elections? Indeed there are. They are tested, immutable, obvious. Play by them, you win. You may think the Rules crass, calculating and simplistic, a codification of the sort of manipulation that has given politics a bad name. Maybe. But would-be presidents ignore them at their peril. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The essence of the dating Rules for girls can be reduced to four old-fashioned words: play hard to get. With the political Rules, the guiding principle is just the opposite: play easy to get. Do not be mysterious, reticent, enigmatic, busy with other things. Be understandable, accessible, willing, solicitous, relentless. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Above all, don't break the Rules. "Now we're having Texas state troopers rush to some other state to stop the flow of whatever," Bob Dole said in Houston last week. Impenetrable Dole-speak is against the Rules. You can probably think of many candidates who thought they would do things their own way, follow their instincts, win it on their own terms--only to lose on polling day. They should have stuck to the Rules. Our space is limited, so here are just ten of the most important.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Rule#1</i>: Spend, spend, spend. This is the reverse of the dating Rules--a Rules girl never spends a penny. Raise as much money as you can, be it hard or soft, in big lumps or small (though beware of Asians bearing gifts). And never run out of it. Bob Dole was broke between the primaries and the convention--and was duly outclassed by a free-spending Bill Clinton. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Rule #2</i>: Always return phone calls. (Again, the opposite of girls' Rules, and the opposite of the often hard-to-get Dole campaign.) Indeed, be the first to phone or fax. The Clinton/Gore people pioneered "prebuttal" and handed their state press secretaries red buttons marking them as a "Rapid Response Team"--a Rules badge if ever there was one.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Rule #3</i>: Have a plan, stick to it. Mr Clinton can drive you nuts with his 21st-century bridge-building, and his "<font size=-1>MMEE</font>" mantra of Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. But consistency is part of the Rules. The Dole campaign changed course with disconcerting frequency. "There never was a strategy," Don Sipple, a former Dole strategist, told <i>Newsweek</i>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Rule #4</i>: Flattery will get you everywhere. Sweet-talk the voters, especially swing ones such as soccer moms. Talk about things that matter to them--such as <font size=-1>V</font>-chips for televisions, school uniforms, gun-free schools, getting kids through college-- even if you cannot really help that much. Promise to cut their taxes and spend some money on them (see <i>Rule#1</i>). <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Rule #5:</i> If you lie, lie well. Don't promise things that you probably don't believe in (such as a 15% tax cut with a balanced budget) or that are inconsistent with your record (ditto). Sound plausible even when you are exaggerating wildly: Mr Clinton's achievements on crime prevention and compassionate leave grow even as he recites them. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Rule #6</i>: Demonise your rival, while remaining saintly yourself. So, leave the trashing to surrogates and ads. Better to associate your opponent with discredited figures or ideas (Newt Gingrich, say, or liberalism) than to attack directly. Come across as the person voters would feel safer leaving their children with.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Rule #7</i>: Think image, not just words. The Clinton campaign has been the master of the photo-opportunity--whether on the edge of the Grand Canyon, or surrounded by police officers, or on the caboose of the <i>21st Century Express</i>. From the New Hampshire primary onwards, notes Jennifer Laszlo, a political consultant who has written her own manual of campaign do's and don'ts, the Dole campaign has contrived to make their candidate "look like a boring man in a suit".<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Rule #8</i>: Make yourself desirable. Look good and energetic. Practise a beatific smile. Dress well and comfortably to suit any occasion. Surround yourself with beautiful people. Have pop stars sing "The Star-Spangled Banner" at your rallies. Do this constantly, so that it seems natural. Otherwise, taking Bo Derek on a bus tour (as Mr Dole did in California this week) looks calculating rather than cool. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i> Rule #9</i>: Don't blink too much. Research shows that the less frequent blinker wins debates. In the San Diego debate, Mr Dole's blink rate was 105 per minute, Mr Clinton's 48.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Rule #10</i>: Know why you're running, and why it's good for the country. You need a convincing answer to the question: Why will voters be better off if they elect you? The answer is your message, which you must repeat <i>ad nauseam </i>(see <i>Rule #3</i>). It is not enough to be running because you think it is "your turn".<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Following the Rules requires a fantastic amount of self-control--discipline would be <i>Rule #11</i>, but the full set of Rules will have to wait for our forthcoming bestseller. From the selection of ten provided here, it should be obvious that one side in the 1996 presidential race has stuck strictly, almost obsessively to the Rules, while the other almost seems to have gone out of its way to break them. You may draw your own conclusions for the likely outcome next Tuesday.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The dating Rules promise happiness-ever-after: no divorces, infidelities or other heartbreaks. Alas, the political Rules offer no such guarantees. They are merely good for getting elected. Governing is another matter entirely.<br>

<h1>China's grassroots democracy</h1>

<font size=1>BEIJING</font><p>
<p><b>Is political change taking root in the Chinese countryside?</b></p><br>
THE crushing of the democracy movement in 1989 seemed to freeze China's political development. Seven years on, repression continues. This week Wang Dan, a leading dissident, was sentenced to 11 years in prison, for "plotting to overthrow the government". But, behind this depressing picture, some observers claim to see signs of incipient political liberalisation in China. One minor sign of this is said to be the occasional assertiveness of the National People's Congress, China's parliament (see <a href="as4425.html">page</a>). But the most important development is an experiment with democracy now under way in the Chinese countryside. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The advent of village democracy in China certainly sounds impressive. There are around 900,000 villages in China, housing perhaps three-quarters of the country's 1.3 billion people. Since 1988, over 80% of these villages have elected, through universal suffrage and secret ballots, their own chiefs and village committees, who serve for terms of three years. By next year, 95% of villages will have held elections-- some will be staging their third election in a row. Although many of the village heads who are elected are Communist Party members, the majority are not. For China as a whole, it marks the party's most sweeping abdication of power since the People's Republic was founded in 1949.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What is going on and why? The answer seems to be that village democratisation has flowed from the economic reforms set in train by Deng Xiaoping. Until these reforms were launched in 1978, the party ran a command economy in China's countryside and created a horrible mess. Farm production stagnated, and rural incomes fell. By the mid-1970s the average farmer in Sichuan, to take an extreme example, was no better off than during the war-torn ravages of the 1930s.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After 1978, incomes rose steeply when farmers were allowed to manage their own plots and sell produce on the open market. But although the economy was transformed in most of rural China, local political structures struggled to catch up. Chen Jinluo, from the China Council of Law, a government body, <ul><font size=1>Local leaders were all appointed by higher authorities. In theory, they were responsive to the peasants. In practice, they were not. After the 'family responsibility system' was adopted, which gave peasants their own land to farm, a political structure imposed from above became irrelevant.</font></ul>
The irrelevance of the old structures seems to have led to the spontaneous emergence of new village committees in southern China in the early 1980s. In 1987, a law was passed by the central government formally allowing villages to elect their own headmen and committees. The idea was that these new forms of government would be more responsive to local economic needs. The central authorities in Beijing remain quite blunt on this point. Zhan Chengfu, a civil servant who oversees village democratisation from Beijing, says: <ul><font size=1>Villagers have a much better notion of village talent than the higher authorities. If you allow the county government to choose a stupid idiot of a village chief, the whole economy will be ruined.</ul></font>The need for local talent to get the rural economy going has become still more urgent of late. The first flush of market-based reforms in rural China wore off in the late 1980s. Growth in farm incomes has been worryingly slow in recent years. Some official figures suggest that 95m Chinese still live below the poverty line; the World Bank recently put the figure at 350m, almost all of them in the countryside. "It is impossible for the central government to do much," says Mr Zhan, "and provincial and county governments are not going to be of much help either." Villages, in effect, are being asked to fend for themselves, and higher levels of government are being asked to keep out of the process. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So democratisation in the countryside, which began in piecemeal fashion, is now being pushed hard by the central authorities. Provinces which lag behind politically, such as Guangdong, Hainan and Guangxi in the south, are getting a tongue-lashing from Beijing. Local governments are being "educated" to surrender power. The central government insists that it does not vet candidates. And election procedures are said to be be increasingly safer and fairer. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But although new political structures have emerged, they often co-exist with the remnants of the old system. Although rural communes have died, their leaders live on. Every village still has a Communist Party secretary, often set in old ways. In Pingyuan, a dirt-poor village in the mountains outside Beijing that <i>The Economist</i> visited recently, the villagers were at a loss to say what the party secretary did, apart from attend endless conferences elsewhere. The village headman, however, was lauded as a natural leader, who would do something about Pingyuan's water shortage.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The central government, at least, is proud of the little victories scored by villagers over their overlords in nearby towns. In Hunan province this year, a township government thought that one village was too factionalised to deserve an elected chief. The villagers sued the local government in the provincial courts, the township leaders were sacked, and the villagers allowed to hold their election. Village committees from Hebei province regularly come to nearby Beijing to complain that their county government is taxing peasants too much. They are given a sympathetic ear: by law, the state may take no more than 5% of farmers' incomes. Village democracy, say officials in Beijing, will reinforce peasants' rights in future.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Officials are also upbeat about the economic consequences of democracy. The best-known example is an entrepreneur in Liaoning province, a yuan millionaire in a very poor village who ran his own transport company. While away on business three years ago, he was elected village chief. He has since brought several million dollars of business to the village, which now sports factories and processing plants.<br>
</p><p><b>From small seeds</b></b><br>
Many contenders for village chief campaign on the promise of bringing in investment. Du Xiaoshan, from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the government's main think-tank, says that "the differences between two villages on the same plain can be striking. Good village heads spot commodities that are in demand." <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The big question is whether this experiment with democracy will begin and end in China's villages. In urban areas, the Communist Party still guards power jealously, and promises to do so come what may. (Members of the Peoples' Congresses in small towns are elected--but the bodies they serve on are powerless and elections are closely controlled and often uncontested.) Some Communist Party cadres are prepared to suggest, quietly, that proper elections for real jobs, of the sort held in villages, may now be allowed to spread up to townships of around 10,000 people. Eventually, they suggest, democracy could spread onwards and upwards to counties, provinces and the central government. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet that would need a far greater willingness to risk Communist control than has been seen so far. Once proper elections spread beyond villages, it is hard to see how the crucial distinction between multi-candidate and multi-party elections could be preserved. And while some cadres are prepared to suggest that democracy in the villages may lead to bigger things, it is not at all clear that this is what the architects of village democratisation have in mind. On the contrary, the Communist Party leadership may feel that a limited, closely monitored local democracy may even win back some power for the party. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Their reasoning is that peasants who enjoy greater prosperity and autonomy may be less surly about central authority, and local leaders may be readier to carry out central policy. That is why the political thaw continued in the countryside after the Tiananmen Square killings of 1989 froze reform elsewhere. "Because peasants associate everything with the Communist Party," says Du Xiaoshan, "then if life is freer, the party gets the credit." The party, says one senior cadre, hopes that village democracy "can help safeguard central authority, particularly the one-child policy." In Pingyuan, villagers confirm that the new village chief and committee are even tougher on enforcing family planning than the Communist authorities.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some in the party insist, however, that senior party members are now actively considering allowing the democracy process to bubble up to the level of county government. Could it go further than that? "I can't give you a timetable," says a member on the party's liberal wing. "But one thing is clear: the democratic process in China largely hangs on the results of autonomous democracy in the countryside."<br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>China's parliament-in-waiting</h1>

<font size=1>BEIJING</font><p>
WHENEVER a foreign reporter writes of the National People's Congress (<font size=-1>NPC</font>), his fingers instinctively tap out "rubber-stamp" before it. China's parliament was established in 1954. It is, according to the constitution, the highest body in the land, to which all other organs of state power report; the <font size=-1>NPC</font>'s chairman is even supposed to rank alongside the president as dual head of state. But this is all a polite fiction. Power in China is held by the Communist Party, which is not even mentioned in the constitution; the <font size=-1>NPC</font> has a well-deserved reputation as the party's plaything.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The plaything, however, has been a bit more unruly of late. The first real sign of this came in 1992, when the <font size=-1>NPC</font>--which has 3,000 delegates, only 60-70% of them party members--registered a strong note of protest against plans to build the Three Gorges dam on the Yangzi river. Not all the objectors shared western concerns that the dam would carry huge environmental and human costs. Many were instead peeved that it would suck investment away from their own regions. Whatever, 841 delegates abstained or voted against the plan. This year, the <font size=-1>NPC</font>'s chairman, Qiao Shi, led a working group to the Three Gorges to assess the main criticisms. His spokesman acknowledges that forced resettlements have been badly handled. Such meddling was unheard of five years ago.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The congress has issued other mild rebukes to the central leadership. Last year some 550 delegates withheld approval of the routine work reports submitted by China's judiciary. They objected less to the content of the reports, more to the way they were being rammed through the congress, with little time to consider them. One-third of the delegates also objected to a new banking law, after arguing for greater supervisory powers for the <font size=-1>NPC</font>, including (God help citizens of any parliament that gets this) the right to oversee monetary policy. Most famously, last year, 37% of delegates voted against the appointment of a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Jiang Zemin, China's president, to an important government post.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is worth noting that none of these minor protests actually led to a serious reversal of party policy. And it will be many years, if ever, before the <font size=-1>NPC</font> votes down the annual ritual of the government work report, delivered by the prime minister. This year, Li Peng's report registered only a handful of nays or abstentions. But, arguably, headline votes at the <font size=-1>NPC</font>'s annual gathering are not as important as reforms to the way the congress conducts its day-to-day business. In particular, the 150-strong Standing Committee of the <font size=-1>NPC</font> was given law-drafting powers in 1979. It now works hard at turning into clean laws the nightmarish web of rules, regulations and party <i>diktats</i> by which China is governed. The Standing Committee's permanent staff, insists one western diplomat, are now "really committed".<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some observers see in the <font size=-1>NPC</font> a vehicle for China's future liberalisation. Few would claim, however, that the <font size=-1>NPC</font> is such a vehicle now. Last week, when the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Freedom of Thought prize to Wei Jingsheng, China's best-known dissident, China's foreign ministry lodged an angry protest with the European Commission at this impertinence. "Parliaments in Europe", said the <font size=-1>EU</font>'s ambassador in a pointed reply, "do not take instructions from executives." <br>

<h1>Delinquent behaviour</h1>

<p><b>There are plenty of reasons behind the moral panic currently engulfing Britain. Real evidence of a decline in children's behaviour is not one of them</b></p> <br>
A HEADMASTER is stabbed to death; a school is shut because its staff say an unruly ten-year-old is making it impossible to teach the rest; staff at another insist that 60 pupils are unteachable. It is as though the devil's own spawn have overrun Britain's classrooms, and are ripping apart the very fabric of society. Except that, while there is plenty of rhetoric about rising numbers of violent and disruptive pupils, there is not much evidence to back it up.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Teachers tend to say that they think there are more troublesome pupils than there used to be, but the older generation always thinks that of the younger. The number of pupils excluded from schools has quadrupled in the past five years, but this is probably because schools are under much more pressure to perform (from national tests, league tables and external inspections), and so are less likely to tolerate disruption.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The evidence suggests, if anything, that the young are behaving better than their forebears did. The proportion of all 10-17-year-olds cautioned for or convicted of criminal offences actually fell by almost 20% in the ten years to 1994.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But of course, once a moral panic gets started, evidence gets flattened by an avalanche of anecdotes. This happened five years ago, when there was a moral panic not about devil children but about devil dogs. In May 1991, newspapers published horrible pictures of a six-year-old Bradford girl who had been mauled by a pit bull terrier. Suddenly, the newspapers were full of other cases of dogs biting children, which happen all the time and normally go unreported. The resulting kerfuffle led to the passing of the Dangerous Dogs Act, hastily drafted and repented at leisure because it proved impossible to implement.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The stabbing of Philip Lawrence, a London headmaster, by a teenage gang member in December 1995, has had a similar effect. This one extreme case has triggered other stories of juvenile delinquency in schools, and a panic about the immorality of modern children.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But none of these stories can obviously be generalised. Take the crisis over a ten-year-old in a school in Worksop. The disturbed boy whom the teachers refuse to teach has seen his father and uncle die, while his mother has cancer. The chairman of the school governors, a Tory, was unwilling to bow to pressure from the teaching unions. The local authority, which has refused to pay for the boy to be taught separately, is based in Nottingham, which regards Worksop as northern and foreign. Memories of the miners' strike have made local politics unusually vicious. All this is interesting, but not informative about the moral condition of British children.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The general themes to be drawn from these stories are political rather than moral. Rivalry between the teaching unions is an important factor. In contrast to other workplaces, almost all teachers belong to a union, so unions can expand only at each other's expense. Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Union of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, has been using the issue of unruly pupils to help him achieve his union's ambition of overtaking in size the National Union of Teachers, currently the largest one.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr de Gruchy, a skilled publicist who pops up continually in front of cameras at school gates, has encouraged members to express their grievances by calling strikes, and has cleverly identified discipline as one area on which teachers are likely to win public support. His tactics are paying off. His membership grew by 7% last year to 157,000, closing the gap with the <font size=-1>NUT</font>, whose membership was hardly changed at 192,000.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Government policy to allow parents to choose between schools is also making things worse in unpopular schools. The Ridings, the school in Halifax where teachers want 60 pupils suspended, is the local dumping-ground in an area where parents have plenty of schools to choose from. The creation of such dumps was an inevitable consequence of the policy, which the government has failed to address.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And naturally, too, pre-election posturing is also doing its bit. Politicians have found a convenient scapegoat for modern malaise: children, who, unlike any other slice of society, can be attacked with impunity without the risk of losing votes.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since the two main parties have fewer differences than they used to on the substance of policy, mood and image have become ever more important. An issue as vapid and insubstantial as morality is therefore the stuff of current politics. Tony Blair, Labour's leader, has sensed an opportunity to win votes because he regards morality and family values as his strength and the government's weakness. The government, meanwhile, is seeking to show that it is still the true party of law and order. A sort of arms-race of authoritarianism has developed, with both sides reluctant to be the first to say that things have gone far enough.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So, hoping to pre-empt new disciplinary measures in the government's education bill, David Blunkett, Labour's education spokesman, told a radio interviewer that parents should be forced to sign contracts with schools covering their children's behaviour, ignoring the fact that unless such contracts are entered into willingly, they are unlikely to be worth the paper they are written on. Moments later, up popped Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, who said she favoured bringing back the cane, though she had no imminent plans to do so. John Major decided the silliness had gone too far, and rebuked Mrs Shephard, saying that the cane would stay banned.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On October 30th, the government hurried out a draft version of a moral code to be taught in schools, intended to persuade voters of its determination to strengthen the moral fibre of the nation's youth. This misses the point. Bigger and better sermons on morality will not make children better behaved. Lessons in good behaviour are learned by example, and the example being set this week by politicians and teachers is not a good one.<br>

<p><b>Betting</b></p>
<h1>Cart before horse</h1>

PLACE a winning wager in your local betting shop, and you will find a 9% deduction is made for tax. Place the same bet in a betting shop on a racecourse, and a deduction of only 6% is made. So what's the problem? The problem is that the exchequer does not charge tax on racecourse bets.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This scam was raised in the Commons on October 29th by Iain Duncan-Smith, Tory <font size=-1>MP</font> for Chingford. A cosy deal between the betting-shop owners and the racecourses is to blame. Punters want betting shop facilities on-course, but providing such facilities for just a few days' racing a year is expensive. So the punter is charged through the deduction, which is on top of the bookmakers' usual profits.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Punters rarely complain. Many think it is a government tax. In any case, they are better off than they were before such shops began to open in 1972. Until then, a punter wanting a bet on a race at another course had to resort to a so-called "away" bookmaker. As there were only a handful of them, they offered skimpy odds. Now, that racecourses have both "away" bookmakers and shops, the bookmakers are forced to be more generous. Any punter who does not want to pay the 6% can bet with them, and then retire to watch the race on television in the comfort of the betting shop.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Punters suffer more from another iniquitous scam. This concerns the bookmakers' arrangements for the allocation of the pitches from which they operate.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The best pitches are near the stands where punters congregate. The worst are far away. Pitches are allocated by the National Association of Bookmakers (<font size=-1>NAB</font>), which operates a "dead man's shoes" rule. When a bookmaker dies, his pitch is first offered to his son or a near relative. If they do not take it, everyone moves up one. Outsiders may wait 25 years before they get a pitch at all.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No competition means a bad deal for consumers. The oldest, rudest bookmakers get the convenient pitches. They refuse smaller bets, and bets "each way" (to win, and to finish first, second or third). Inefficiency rules, with bookies employing a clerk to record bets in a big book and handing customers a cardboard receipt, instead of using computer technology.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bookmaker conservatism upholds this absurd system. The <font size=-1>NAB</font> is meant to be negotiating with the Racecourse Association (<font size=-1>RCA</font>) for reform. However, Peter Watson, the chairman of <font size=-1>NAB</font>, has just been turfed out by his members for contemplating change.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Strangely, conservatism is reinforced by an equally absurd bit of law. Under the 1963 Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act, racecourses cannot charge a bookmaker more than five times the standard entrance fee to take bets at their racecourse.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The House of Commons Home Affairs Committee argued in 1991 that this law should be scrapped. Racecourses could then charge what they wanted for pitches. They could ask more for the best, forcing inefficient bookmakers out of business. They could use the proceeds to improve the facilities offered to racegoers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, Tim Kirkhope, the Home Office minister responsible, says he will consider changing the law only when the <font size=-1>RCA-NAB</font> negotiations are complete. Since they could come to a sensible conclusion only if and when the law has been changed to free up charges, Mr Kirkhope is putting the cart before the horse.<br>

<h1>Murdering the cathedral</h1>

FOR more than a decade, ministers have agonised over a by-pass for Salisbury which threatens one of the finest views in Britain, the view of the cathedral across the water meadows made famous by Constable. On October 29th they decided to dither some more. "Further detailed studies", the government decided, are required; which will, astonishingly, defer the decision until after the next election is due.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Salisbury by-pass saga is an example of the paralysis that now passes for transport policy. It was first mooted half a century ago. By 1984, the government included it in the roads programme. In April 1993, a year-long public inquiry began into the proposal for a dual carriageway by-pass. The inquiry's inspector, Sir Peter Buchanan, took another 18 months before he reported in its favour. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Similarly, last month the government decided to shelve a scheme to relieve traffic around Stonehenge. Britain's greatest prehistoric monument has a day-long traffic jam for a neighbour. Faced by opposition to expanding the road into a dual carriageway, ministers decided that the least unpopular option was to do nothing. The government acknowledges that a long tunnel by-passing the site is the only publicly acceptable solution but says that, at &#163;300m, it would be too expensive.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The stories of Salisbury and Stonehenge show that roads can no longer be built on the cheap. Too many people are willing to fight against the concreting of more of the countryside. But then the pressures on public expenditure, which have pushed roads way down the list of priorities, mean that the Treasury will no longer pay for expensive roads.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is, however, an alternative. If the taxpayer will not foot the bill for roads, the motorist can be made to. People are used to tolls on tunnels under estuaries: the Dartford Tunnel that forms part of the <font size=-1>M</font>25, for instance, and employs an automatic collection system, has proved so successful that it is expected to repay its &#163;215m construction costs well ahead of schedule.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is no reason why a long tunnel by-passing Stonehenge should not be financed in a similar way. Objectors worry that locals would suffer; but they could carry concessional residents' permits, as with parking. Another concern is that, in order to avoid the charge, drivers would instead use little roads through neighbouring villages; but traffic-management techniques (putting in lots of lights, for instance, or snail's-pace speed limits) can help solve that problem. The obstacle is not technology, but lack of political will. Privately, politicians say that tolling is the only solution. Sooner or later, they are going to have to admit it publicly.<br>

<h1>The new age of holistic policing</h1>

<font size=1>MILTON KEYNES</font><p>
LAURA, a 13-year-old who has stolen some pens from the John Lewis department store, sits facing a police officer in Milton Keynes police station. Her face is a painful blush, her eyes red and downcast. Her parents, on either side of her, are angry: her father in a needs-a-good-hiding spirit, her mother confused. The police officer is nice. All adults have stolen something in their lives, he says, and don't believe those who tell you otherwise. However, some kids who shoplift go on to do worse things, and he intends to see that Laura does not.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Laura will get a talking to from a manager at the shopping centre she stole from. He will explain to her that shoplifting is not a victimless crime; she may be persuaded to apologise. She will get a sensible chat from a police officer about what is called "protective behaviour"--how not to get yourself into the sort of situation where you may shoplift.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other agencies are on hand. Laura could (though the officer does not think it necessary in her case) be given a session with the Prison Service about how that is not a nice place to end up. If there were bad problems at home, the social services could be brought in. If she had no friends, the youth service could help. If there were no responsible adult in her life, "Befrienders", a local service which matches adult volunteers with needy children, might step in.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rather an elaborate reaction, perhaps, to a few pens. But "Caution Plus", a programme aimed at first-time shoplifters which was designed by Caroline Nicholl, chief superintendent of Milton Keynes, two-and-a-half years ago, aims to nip criminal behaviour in the bud. Its effect is impressive. According to a study by the Home Office, the reoffending rate for first-timers in nearby Peterborough, where they will receive a police caution and then be sent home, is 35%; for those who have been through the Milton Keynes programme, it is 3%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Behind what is going on in Milton Keynes is a set of ideas known in the management-speak that has taken over the police as "problem-oriented policing". The ideas, which come from North America, are seeping through British police forces as they grapple with the problems of fast-increasing demands and slowly-increasing resources. Leicestershire, for instance, has had an increase in emergency calls of 136% in the past eight years, and a real increase in resources of 3.5% over the same period.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Problem-oriented policing aims not just to react to calls from the public, but to find out why those demands are being made and to solve problems at their source. Charles Pollard, chief constable of Thames Valley Police, and one of its principal advocates, calls it "holistic" policing, as opposed to the "sticking-plaster" variety.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To some extent, implementing these ideas means teaching policemen to go about their work in a different way. But administrative changes are also making a difference. "Sector policing", for instance, means dividing up beats and putting policemen in charge of small slices. The smaller the area, the idea is, the better a policeman can get to know it. According to David Morgan in Milton Keynes--who, as a beat officer, is likely to be sceptical about management theory--it works. "Before, if you got a 'domestic', you'd get different shifts coming fresh to it. Now, if you see the same thing happening again and again, you can do something about it." And the more you know about a neighbourhood, the more likely you are to be able to identify the culprit in a burglary or a murder.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Working with other agencies, something the police have not been good at, is central to these new ideas. Social services can help with domestic violence, which is behind most murders. Rehousing could be the solution to a long battle between warring neighbours, one of the sources of endless work for the police. Alcoholics--much crime is alcohol-related--can be pushed towards getting treatment.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;David Coleman, assistant chief constable of Leicestershire, cites the case of an old man who, one policewoman discovered, had called the police 20 times in four months. She went to see him, and found that he was bored. She contacted the British Legion, who helped him to buy a television. In the following three months he made just one call.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Problem-oriented policing has been taken up enthusiastically by some forces-- Thames Valley, Leicestershire and Surrey in particular--and more patchily by others. Although top policemen seem convinced, this approach to policing runs against the government's determined push for better crime figures.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Problem-oriented policing does not pay much attention to immediate trends in crime figures. It sees success in the longer term. Crime figures, as Mr Pollard points out, are too easily manipulated--as they were, he says, when he first joined the force and senior officers would discourage junior officers from recording crimes in order to keep the figures down. Policing by numbers, of the sort required by the Home Office's emphasis on performance targets, may thus be untrustworthy.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Anyway, by its nature, problem-oriented policing is likely to push the crime figures up. Some British police officers point out the contrast between this approach and that of the world's most-trumpeted policing success story, New York city. New York's police have achieved their results by making life tough for likely suspects (black teenagers, mainly) and have thereby generated hostility in black neighbourhoods as well as relief at the falling crime figures. If, by contrast, a policeman gets to know locals, and they trust him, the crime rate is likely to go up because they will report more crimes to him. The officer may be solving the problems of locals more effectively, and actually reducing the real level of crime, but the reported crime figures will make it look as if the opposite is happening.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Accordingly, it does not make much sense to look at what these new ideas are doing to the reported crime figures. They are new, they have been patchily implemented, they may take some time to bear fruit. But their supporters claim that they can, in the long run, have considerable effect: they point to cities such as Edmonton, in Canada, which has been pursuing this approach for years: emergency calls fell by 36% in four years, and crime by 40% in ten years. Maybe policing had something to do with it; and maybe the same will, eventually, happen in Milton Keynes too.<br>

<font size=1>INVERNESS</font><p>
CUT-PRICE sales of state-owned assets are usually roundly condemned by opposition parties. Yet when Michael Forsyth, the Scottish secretary, introduced a bill in the House of Lords on October 25th for a bargain-basement sale of government-owned land in the Highlands, his opponents raised a pious cheer.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Forsyth wants to sell 259,000 acres of the Highlands to the 1,400 crofters who live on them. They are the last remnants and descendants of 4,500 soldiers and sailors demobilised after the first world war who were persuaded to settle in Scotland on land bought by the government with the grand aim of producing "a fit and healthy race", and a nation self-sufficient in food production.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the Highlands, this land came under 19th-century crofting law which was passed to protect poor tenants from being evicted by rich landlords. The law on crofts is so peculiar that Highland wits define them as small pieces of land entirely surrounded by legislation.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Forsyth could ask his tenants to stump up &#163;1.5m. But he says he will hand the land over for nothing if need be, and may even give the crofters some money to band together in community trusts. These have been set up by the few crofters who have managed to buy land from private estate-owners; and the government hopes its tenants will do the same. Labour and the Scottish Nationalists, who have long sided with crofters as the victims of oppression, can hardly complain.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although the government gets about &#163;150,000 a year in rent, it spends &#163;370,000 in administering and maintaining the crofts. Saving money, however, is not Mr Forsyth's main motive.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Politically, the Highlands divide between landlords and tenants. Landlords are rich, aristocratic and Tory-voting; tenants (including crofters) vote anything but Tory. The Tories lost their last seat in northern Scotland--Ross, Cromarty & Skye--in 1983.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the last election threw up a political oddity. Inverness, Nairn & Lochaber became Britain's only four-way marginal seat. Sir Russell Johnston, a Liberal Democrat, held on to his seat with just 26% of the vote, with Labour (25%), the Scottish Nationalists (25%) and the Tories (23%) hard on his heels. Since Sir Russell is retiring at the next election and boundary changes have moved a few thousand Labour voters into a different seat, the Tories think they have as good a chance as anybody else of winning it. <br>

<p><b>New computers</b></p>
<h1>Microsoft steals the Sunshine</h1>

BARELY a day goes by without some computer company claiming that it is releasing a "breakthrough" product related to the Internet. Sun Microsystems' new JavaStation, which was unveiled on October 29th, should have been closer to meeting that description than most. The JavaStation is the first of the Californian firm's vaunted network computers (<font size=-1>NC</font>). Such machines, argues Sun, will oust the personal computer (<font size=-1>PC</font>), just as the <font size=-1>PC</font> toppled the mainframe. Unfortunately--but perhaps predictably--Microsoft and Intel, the two firms that have gained the most from the <font size=-1>PC</font>, are trying to spoil the party.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The JavaStation is not the first <font size=-1>NC</font>. A handful of other firms have already shown off their own versions. However, it is the first product aimed clearly at business users. Similarly, although the network computer is often associated with Oracle, another Californian software company whose boss, Larry Ellison, has been the <font size=-1>NC</font>'s loudest advocate, Sun is the firm that could gain most from the device, partly because <font size=-1>NC</font>s all use Java, Sun's Internet programming language. This is one reason why Sun's shares have recently outperformed even Microsoft's (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sun's sales pitch for the <font size=-1>NC</font> is simple: <font size=-1>PC</font>s cost too much too run. What large companies want, it argues, are "zero-administration" computers that reduce the "total cost of ownership" of information technology. The essence of the <font size=-1>NC</font> is hidden in those buzzwords: by using centralised servers to store a <font size=-1>PC</font>'s programs, rather than a local hard disk, <font size=-1>NC</font>s get rid of running costs (such as systems staff having to update software on every <font size=-1>PC</font> each time a new version comes out). According to most independent experts, <font size=-1>NC</font>s might cost less than half as much as <font size=-1>PC</font>s to maintain (see <a href="wb1.gif">table</a>). That is not quite "zero-administration", but it is still enough to tempt companies to dump <font size=-1>PC</font>s in favour of <font size=-1>NC</font>s.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This explains why on October 28th, the day before the launch of the JavaStation, Microsoft and Intel, supported by most of the biggest <font size=-1>PC</font> makers, announced the Net<font size=-1>PC</font>--an alternative answer to the problem of reducing the cost of running computer systems. Even though the details of the Net<font size=-1>PC</font> are still a little fuzzy, it will basically look like a cheap, ordinary <font size=-1>PC</font>. Its brains will be a less expensive (and slower) version of Intel's Pentium processor. Unlike the <font size=-1>NC</font>, it will have its own hard disk. But it will also have some clever (yet to be written) software that will allow systems staff to control a number of computers from one place.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If nothing else, this shows that Sun and Oracle have won part of the argument. A year ago Nathan Myrvhold, Microsoft's head of technology, wrote <font size=-1>NC</font>s off as "dorky". On October 30th Bill Gates, Microsoft's boss, said that one of the firm's top priorities is now "zero-administration" computing.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One problem for Sun is that the JavaStation looks very expensive. Mr Ellison, amongst others, had been talking of <font size=-1>NC</font>s starting at $500. A basic JavaStation costs $1,200 (including the screen and keyboard). That is only $800 less than the price of a normal <font size=-1>PC</font> loaded with goodies, such as a <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> drive and sound system.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The new Net<font size=-1>PC</font> is likely to cost around $1,500. It will be able to run Microsoft's Windows operating system--and hence the thousands of other programs that use it. Sun's JavaStation, by contrast, will depend on Java. Clever though the language is, applications programs written in it are still thin on the ground. And in most markets, Microsoft is much better known than Sun.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>NC</font>'s best chance of success is with firms that need computers to do one thing, such as ticketing or invoicing. But, now that the Net<font size=-1>PC</font> has appeared, the <font size=-1>NC</font> may look less attractive to the probably-far-bigger market of firms that want a machine that can perform several different tasks without necessarily being as complicated and as expensive to run as the modern <font size=-1>PC</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the moment, the <font size=-1>NC</font>'s chief advantage against the Net<font size=-1>PC</font> is that it exists. Each new version of the <font size=-1>NC</font> that Sun and its peers produce will encourage customers to try using the machines and software firms to write programs for them. By contrast, the Microsoft/Intel camp has not even produced a model of a Net<font size=-1>PC</font>: talk of it being ready to sell by mid-1997 seems optimistic. That may well be Sun's window of opportunity.<br>

<h1>The competitive depreciation of the yen</h1>

<p><b>This week the yen has continued its slide against the dollar. In this article Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, DC, says this is deliberate Japanese policy. On the next page we give our view</b></p></b></p><br>
JAPAN is up to its bad old tricks. The Ministry of Finance is seeking a further competitive depreciation of the yen of 10-20%, on top of its 40% decline against the dollar (and about 25% overall) over the past 18 months. The result would be a huge surge in Japan's trade surplus in 1997 and especially 1998. This would take jobs away from other countries, including European ones, where unemployment is already very high, and Asian countries that compete intensively with Japan. It would also rekindle protectionist pressures around the world and set the stage for another round of financial instability when the inevitable currency reversals take place.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Japan's motives are easy to discern. Its economy may be dropping into renewed recession despite five years of virtual stagnation. It has barely begun to restore the stability of its financial sector. But it seems incapable of attacking its problems via the proper policy tools. Short-term interest rates hover near zero, so admittedly cannot be reduced much further by easier monetary policy. But plans are in place to reduce the fiscal deficit, even though doing so will intensify the economy's weakness. Structural reform is the real answer to Japan's problems, but is slow or non-existent.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The finance ministry, which is particularly zealous in seeking fiscal contraction and avoiding serious structural reform, has thus reverted to its traditional remedy: currency depreciation. It justifies the strategy internationally by arguing that a weaker yen will not even reverse the recent decline in Tokyo's trade surplus from the gargantuan levels of 1992-94 because of the outsourcing of Japanese production that was promoted by the subsequent sharp rise of the currency. But why then does the ministry pursue depreciation so avidly, persistently jawboning its currency down and promoting outflows of Japanese capital, and buying huge quantities of dollars in the markets whenever the yen strengthens even a bit?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Virtually all models show that every 1% fall in the value of the yen has traditionally increased Japan's global current-account surplus by about $3 billion. The decline in the Japanese surplus in 1995-96 will probably reach about $60 billion, following naturally from the 20% appreciation of the yen (from 125 to 100 to the dollar) in 1993-94. This occurred despite Japan's negligible economic growth. The results demonstrate once again that Japan's trade responds to currency changes in textbook fashion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rise of the yen beyond 80 to the dollar in early 1995, which was clearly excessive, was too brief to have much effect on trade. But the currency probably settled around &#165;90 long enough to affect pricing and investment decisions by Japanese firms and help cut the surplus to tolerable levels. A new yen decline to &#165;120-130, as the Japanese authorities openly advocate, would thus represent a competitive depreciation of one-third to about one-half. Even allowing for some irreversible effects of Japan's recent foreign investments, the renewed expansion of the surplus would be enormous. It would restore the crisis levels of 1992-93 even if the relevant base were "only" &#165;100, and the currency decline would thus add up to "only" 20-30%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Japan itself would be the major loser from this scenario. It might gain a little growth in the short run. But pressures for constructive structural reform and thus fundamental improvement of the economy would recede still further. As the trade surplus ballooned, Japan would again ignite the wrath of its major trading partners, in East Asia and Europe as well as the United States. A sharp yen appreciation would inevitably ensue at some fairly early point, cutting growth and deepening the country's economic troubles as in 1993 and again in 1995 (see <a href="fn1.gif">chart</a>). The Ministry of Finance would once again have undermined the very economy it is supposed to manage. The Keidanren, Japan's main business federation, has recognised all this and publicly called for holding the yen-dollar rate between &#165;100 and &#165;110.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is a mystery why other Group of Seven countries have accepted this renewed Japanese effort to export its domestic problems instead of dealing with them properly. The United States continues to run a record trade deficit, which will probably reach $200 billion for 1996, so should hardly welcome renewed yen undervaluation. Some Europeans complain that their currencies are already overvalued, with serious consequences for their slow growth and high unemployment, a charge that could hardly hold against the dollar in light of America's large deficit but could well apply to Japan. Countries outside the <font size=-1>G7</font> have also been strangely quiet--although, for example, Korea's record deficits are driven importantly by the yen's depreciation against the won.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>G7</font> let the yen weaken similarly in the late 1980s, bringing on the huge surpluses that triggered a global onslaught against Japan's trade policies in the early 1990s and then the sharp yen appreciation that deepened Japan's own economic malaise. We are now in fact experiencing the fifth cycle of yen swings since the early 1970s, all of which have produced serious problems for both Japan and the world economy. It is tragic that both Japan and the other major countries seem unable to learn from this dismal history. The episode is a further reminder of the dramatic decline in the effectiveness of the <font size=-1>G7</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With the yen hovering around 115 to the dollar, action is urgently needed to halt the depreciation and reverse it at least modestly. Lloyd Bentsen, the then Treasury secretary, let it be known in early 1994 that the United States would not tolerate a yen weaker than about 112 to the dollar, stating clearly that "Allowing the yen to slide is not an acceptable way out of recession for Japan." The Japanese now assert that this "Bentsen ceiling" has been lifted and recent market movements suggest they may be correct.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No one wants to see the yen strengthen again to 80 to the dollar. It is time, however, for the United States and the rest of the <font size=-1>G7</font> to reassert the Bentsen principle and to let Japan know that competitive depreciation is unacceptable and will be firmly resisted. Much more constructive steps, particularly regarding structural and financial reform, are available and indeed necessary for Japan to restart its economy. The intellectual bankruptcy of the Ministry of Finance must not be permitted to push that country's new government to pursue the bad old ways once again and to plunge the world into a renewed cycle of trade protection and currency instability.<br>

<h1>An alternative viewpoint</h1>

THE gist of Fred Bergsten's argument is that the yen has fallen too far against the dollar, as a result of intervention by the Bank of Japan and jawboning by the Ministry of Finance. The result, he argues, is that Japan's trade surplus and America's deficit will widen and so reignite protectionist tensions. He urges the <font size=-1>G7</font> to act swiftly to halt the yen's decline. Is he right?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is interesting to compare the current situation with that in early 1994, when America's then Treasury secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, was quick to call foul when the dollar rose above &#165;112. This time round, Washington appears to have given its approval. Robert Rubin, the current Treasury secretary, said on October 29th that he had no problem with the dollar's recent rise.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One big difference between now and then is that in 1993 the American economy had ample spare capacity. Now, however, after several years of robust growth, American industry is working flat out. With little slack in the economy, a cheap dollar would be more likely to boost inflation than exports. In these circumstances a stronger dollar helps to keep inflation in check and so reduces the need for higher interest rates.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, the strength of the American economy relative to the still-fragile state of Japan's helps to explain the yen's fall. Mr Bergsten may be right, however, in suggesting that there is something "different" about the yen: the dollar has risen by 40% against the yen since April 1995; against the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark it has gained only 12%. Another reason for the weak yen is that Japan's monetary policy is extremely lax relative to America's--just as it needs to be to boost demand. Japan's interest rates are only 0.5% compared with around 5.5% in America. Indeed, it is the current strength of American's economy relative to that of Japan's that is sucking in more imports and causing America's trade deficit to swell this year.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Bergsten, in common with many other American economists, believes that a weaker dollar and a stronger yen would go a long way to reduce America's and Japan's trade imbalances. But dollar depreciation has been ineffective as a cure for America's external deficit over the past decade. The dollar fell from &#165;270 in 1982 to &#165;80 in April 1995; even at its current rate of &#165;114 it is still cheap. Yet America's current-account deficit is expected to be $150 billion this year, not much below its peak in 1987. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reason why the cheap dollar has failed to reduce trade imbalances noticeably is that America's deficit and Japan's surplus basically reflect America's low level of savings and Japan's excess of savings over investment. And a change in the exchange rate cannot by itself correct national savings and investment imbalances. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, attempts to manipulate exchange rates with the aim of reducing trade imbalances are likely to be offset by changes in prices. For instance, during the past decade of a strong yen, wholesale prices in Japan have fallen by 20%, while America's have risen by 25%. This has offset much of the yen's appreciation. Moreover, to prop up the yen, the Bank of Japan had to run an overly tight monetary policy which imposed severe deflation on the economy--the exact opposite of what it requires.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Bergsten wants the <font size=-1>G7</font> to act to push the yen higher. In fact, the dollar may soon turn by itself. There is evidence that Japan's economy is starting to pick up at last--industrial production grew faster than expected in September, leaving it 3.4% up on a year ago--so at some stage over the next year its interest rates will rise.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another factor is that central banks rather than private investors have accounted for most of the increased demand for dollars this year. A study by Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, an investment bank, shows that the dollar's rise this year has been accompanied by a sharp increase in central banks' dollar reserves. The reserve figures, however, do not finger the Bank of Japan for pushing the dollar skyward of late. Japan's foreign-exchange reserves did increase sharply earlier this year, but in recent months they have barely budged. Instead, the increase in dollar reserves has been spread widely across central banks.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The significance of these figures, however, is that if the dollar's strength is partly based on central-bank purchases, then it may not be sustained. At some point, the dollar may well slip back of its own accord.<br>

<h1 align=center>Europe's heavyweight</h1>


IT IS not just height and girth that mark out Germany's chancellor, Helmut Kohl, in a crowd. Nor even his durability. He will soon make a bit of history by overtaking Konrad Adenauer to become Germany's longest-serving chancellor since Bismarck (see <a href="sf0777.html">page</a>). Yet recent comrades-in-power have included France's Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand, Britain's Margaret Thatcher and Spain's Felipe Gonzalez, all of whom survived many gravity-defying years in office. What secures Mr Kohl a place in history is that he managed peacefully the unification of his country. Germany has gone from economic prominence to European dominance. The indefatigable Mr Kohl may have yet another election victory in him, in two years' time. So how well are the Kohl years preparing Germany, and Europe, for the future?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The mood in Germany is far from jubilant. Spirits are dampened in the east by stubbornly high levels of unemployment, and in the west by stubbornly high "solidarity" taxes designed to underpin the east's fragile economy. Mr Kohl now admits that integrating the two Germanies is proving harder than he had supposed. This week he backed away from his goal of halving German unemployment by 2000. And now western Germans face even more wrenching changes. Budget cuts needed to meet the Maastricht criteria for monetary union are bringing overdue but unpopular swipes at sick pay, and changes to job security, with more far reaching reforms of taxes and pensions to come. Though many Europeans would happily swap their economic troubles for Germany's, the scale of the reforms Germany now needs owes much to the Kohl way of government.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even before unification, the greying of West Germany's population, combined with increasing competition from lower-wage economies, had put issues of labour-market flexibility, privatisation, welfare costs, taxation and pension reform on the political agenda. More economically attuned chancellors, such as Ludwig Erhard and Helmut Schmidt, might have used the opportunity of German unity to tackle all this and reform Germany from within. Mr Kohl, following his instincts, opted for speedy unity and reassurance.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Speed was understandable. When the chance for unity came, Mr Kohl wanted to seize it fast, before the Russians got cold feet. At home, he oozed confidence that integrating the two economies would be relatively swift and painless. Eastern Germans, offered hard <font size=-1>D</font>-marks for Monopoly-money Ostmarks at one-to-one, supported Mr Kohl in droves at the ballot box. But along with the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark came western Germany's unreformed labour laws and red tape, which all but snuffed out the east's industry and drove up the costs of unity.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The collapse of the Berlin Wall not only changed the face of Germany, it also remade the map of Europe. The old German question--how to deal with a country that was too strong for its neighbours' comfort--seemed to have been answered by partition. How would a new, free and unified Germany now use its weight in the world? Mr Kohl's basic instinct--that Germany belongs inseparably to the western, democratic community of nations--cannot be faulted. Again, however, some of his policies have caused resentment. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the early years after unity, as troubles brewed elsewhere in Europe, Mr Kohl insisted that Germany should stand aloof militarily--democratic Germany's army could not be allowed to go where Hitler's armies once marched in-- while mixing it politically. So Germany chose to push for the recognition of Croatia, despite clear signs that this would intensify the violence in former Yugoslavia. To Mr Kohl's credit, the lesson has since been learned that responsible international citizenship may require the legitimate use of force for democratic ends. Hence the once unthinkable: Germany's close involvement in the military force helping to implement the Dayton peace accords in former Yugoslavia. With Germany's troops now as likely to be in foreign firing lines, Mr Kohl's foreign policy may in future be better thought out.<br>
</p><p><b><b>A determined European</b></b><br>
Is the same true of policy towards European integration? Though Mr Kohl has dropped calls for a federal Europe, he believes that only deeper political union--expressed through a single currency--can anchor Germany firmly enough and strengthen European institutions sufficiently to ensure peace in the years ahead. He wants, he insists, a European Germany, not a German Europe. But some Europeans still worry that what they get may feel uncomfortably Germanic.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though Mr Kohl is determined to press on, a single currency is not yet popular among Europe's voters, who are bearing the brunt of the budget cuts needed to bring it about. Nor would a closer political union--Mr Kohl's real aim--solve the problem of a powerful Germany, which would be just as powerful inside it. Ironically, the first effect of Mr Kohl's vision for closer union will be a split between those that join a single currency and those that do not, or cannot. It will also be harder for East Europeans to join the <font size=-1>EU</font> as full members--a surer way to defend the peace than by a new currency.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How will Mr Kohl be judged when his term of office eventually ends? Undoubtedly, as a great politician who kept his footing during turbulent times. Will he also weigh in as one of Europe's great statesmen? The fate of the euro, as much as anything Mr Kohl has done before, will decide that.<br>

<h2>African exodus</h2>
<p>(See <a href="ww1.gif">map</a>)<br>Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled from homes and camps in <b>eastern Zaire </b>amid warnings that many would die of hunger and disease. The Zairean army and local militias are fighting ethnic Tutsis, but Zaire said it was being attacked by troops from Rwanda and Burundi. Both countries denied sending troops across the border or supplying local Tutsi militias.</p>
<p>A former South African police commissioner, Johan van der Merwe, told the <b>truth commission </b>that the order to blow up the South African Council of Churches offices in 1988 had come from P.W. Botha, then president, via the minister of law and order, Adriaan Vlok. The commission said it would subpoena the former president if he did not respond to the allegation.</p>
<p>France's <b>President Jacques Chirac </b>paid an effusive visit to Syria and a cross one to Israel, where he objected to security he considered over zealous. In Ramallah he addressed the Palestinian parliament, the first head of state to do so, urging Palestinians to shun violence as they sought a state of their own.</p>
<p>After mediation by an American envoy, the rival <b>Kurdish</b> factions in northern Iraq agreed in principle, though not yet in fact, to a ceasefire.<p> <b>Qatar's ruling family </b>ended its feud, after the government dropped legal action against the deposed emir. The ruler's third son was named heir apparent.</p><br>
<h2>After Lebed</h2>
<p>Boris Yeltsin, Russia's unwell president, appointed as security chief <b>Ivan Rybkin</b>, a former speaker of parliament, replacing Alexander Lebed. Mr Rybkin will also be in charge of peace negotiations with Chechen rebels. Mr Lebed strengthened his alliance with Alexander Korzhakov, the president's former bodyguard.</p>
<p><b>Alexander Rutskoi</b>, who tried to overthrow President Yeltsin in 1993, was elected governor of Kursk in western Russia.</p>
<p>Russia and Ukraine said they were ready to sign a bilateral treaty, despite a vote by the Duma, the lower house of Russia's parliament, to halt a share-out of the former Soviet <b>Black Sea Fleet </b>between the two countries. Ukraine has also been smarting over claims from some Russian politicians for a reassertion of Russian sovereignty over Sebastopol, the fleet's home port in the Crimea.</p>
<p>The conservative Homeland Union, a party led by <b>Lithuania</b>'s ex-president Vytautas Landsbergis, won parliamentary elections, avenging Mr Landsbergis's 1992 defeat by former communists.</p>
<p><b>Bosnia's local elections</b> were again postponed because of worries of fraud, mainly by Bosnian Serbs.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>President Clinton promised to open <b>NATO</b> to East European members in 1999. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are thought likeliest to be in the first wave.</p>
<p>The Vatican at last admitted that <b>evolution </b>is "more than just a hypothesis". But, the pope added, it still does not apply to the soul.</p>
<p>About 300,000 Belgians marched in Brussels to support the families of four girls murdered by members of a <b>paedophile ring</b> and to protest against the authorities' handling of the case.</p>
<p><b>Gro Harlem Brundtland</b>, Norway's prime minister for ten of the past 15 years, resigned to give her Labour Party time to prepare for a general election next year. Her successor is expected to be the party leader, Thorbjoern Jagland.</p>
<p><b>Finland</b>'s opposition Centre Party won the country's first elections to the European Parliament. The vote was interpreted as a rebuff to the government's policy of bringing the Finnish currency swiftly into Europe's planned economic and monetary union.</p>
<p><b>German workers </b>took to the streets after talks between <font size=-1>IG</font> Metall, the engineering union, and employers broke down. The protests, against cuts in sick pay, may presage a long hot autumn.</p>
<h2>Japanese mist</h2>
<p>The <b>Japanese election</b> produced no clear victory. The Liberal Democratic Party led by Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister, won 239 seats, 12 short of an overall majority. But its old coalition partners lost seats and the shape of a new government remained unclear.</p>
<p>The <b>Taliban </b>Islamic militia held on to Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, amid reports that its harsh rule was alienating the city's people. Anti Taliban forces gained ground in battles outside the capital.</p>
<p><b>Pakistan</b> devalued its currency by 8% against the dollar and announced a budgetary package, aimed at closing the government's fiscal deficit, in an attempt to win the support of the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<h2>Starr gazing</h2>
<p>Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater special prosecutor, delayed the release of a report on the apparent <b>suicide of Vince Foster</b>, a White House aide.

<h2>Dial S for sale</h2>
<p>(See <a href="bw1.gif">table</a>)<br>Demand for shares in Germany's state-owned telecoms giant, <b>Deutsche Telekom</b>, surged ahead of the firm's forthcoming public offering of 20% of its equity. The German government said that the shares would cost DM25 30 ($16-20) each, valuing the firm at up to DM78 billion. In a recently established grey market, Telekom shares were changing hands at up to DM39 each.</p>
<p>Energy firms are also on the auctioneer's block. The Italian government fixed a maximum price for shares in the second stage of its partial privatisation of <b>ENI</b>, a state oil giant. It wants to raise at least 5.2 trillion lire ($3.4 billion) by selling another 8.5% of the firm; last November it sold 15% of its equity. Meanwhile, foreign investors fell over one another in a rush to buy American depositary shares in <b>Gazprom</b>, Russia's gas monolith. The placement of 1% of the company's equity suggests that the firm is worth around $37 billion. </p>
<p>British Telecom is at last faced with a formidable rival. <b>Cable and Wireless</b> is set to become Britain's largest cable <font size=-1>TV</font> and communications group<b> </b>when it merges Mercury, its British telephone unit, with three British cable companies that have North American parents. <font size=-1>C&W</font> will have a 52.6% stake in the new group, which will have assets of roughly &#163;3 billion ($4.8 billion).</p>
<p>Britain's telecoms watchdog banned <b>British Telecom </b>and <b>BSkyB </b>from running a joint promotion. It is worried about the competitive implications of a possible future alliance between the two British giants. <font size=-1>BT</font>, which cannot yet get involved in broadcasting under the terms of its licence, may eventually co-operate with the satellite broadcaster in digital <font size=-1>TV</font>.</p>
<p>Spain's state-owned electricity generator, <b>Endesa</b>, is beautifying itself before privatisation with an agreed bid of Pta200 billion ($1.6 billion) for two electricity distributors in which it already holds large stakes. News of the deal and speculation about other likely takeover bids boosted Spanish share prices.</p>
<h2>Potholes</h2>
<p>A federal judge ruled that <b>Volkswagen</b> and its chairman, Ferdinand Piech, must stand trial in America in an industrial-espionage lawsuit brought by General Motors against the German car maker. But <font size=-1>VW</font> still had something to smile about: its net profit soared 56% in the first nine months of the year, to DM1.5 billion ($977m).</p>
<p><b>General Motors</b> reached an agreement with its Canadian unions, ending a damaging three-week strike involving 18,000 workers in North America.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p><b>Eurotunnel</b>, the Anglo French operator of the Channel tunnel, plans to cut 657 jobs from its 3,500-strong workforce in order to make FFr264m ($51m) of savings.</p>
<p>Norfolk Southern, an American railway company, offered to buy <b>Conrail</b> for $9 billion, topping an $8.4 billion offer from its rival, <font size=-1>CSX</font>. The three companies dominate the<b> </b>rail<b>-</b> transport business east of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>(See <a href="bw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>Shares in <b>Digital </b>plummeted after bigger-than-expected losses of $66m in the first quarter of its fiscal year raised questions about the success of the American computer maker's turnaround. <b>IBM</b>, on the other hand, is bouncing back. It reported a $1.3 billion net profit in the third quarter of the year, mainly because its <font size=-1>PC</font> unit had returned to health after losing $538m in the same period last year.</p>
<p>America's <b>AT&T</b> picked 49 year-old John Walter, head of R.R. Donnelley, a printing firm, to be its president and chief operating officer. In 1998 the job of chairman and chief executive will be split, and the plan is for Mr Walter to succeed Robert Allen as the firm's chairman.</p>
Tax officials in Israel raided the offices of News Datacom Research, a unit of <b>News Corp</b>. The officials suspect it of concealing income of $150m. Rupert Murdoch, the head of News Corp, denied any wrongdoing.
<h2>Shaky foundations</h2>
<p>In Japan's <b>largest corporate collapse </b>since the second world war, Nichiei Finance, a lender in Yokohama, filed for bankruptcy, with liabilities of &#165;991.4 billion ($8.8 billion). It is the fourth such institution to collapse this year because of financial problems linked to the slump in Japan's property market at the end of the 1980s.</p>
<p>Most of <b>Japan's securities firms </b>reported an improved first half, partly because of buoyant underwriting business. But the biggest company suffered a setback. Nomura reported a net loss of &#165;337.5 billion ($3 billion), after making a &#165;371 billion provision to bail out one of its subsidiaries. In the same period last year it made a &#165;16.4 billion profit.</p>
<p>Yasuo Hamanaka, <b>the world's leading copper trader </b>until Japan's Sumitomo Corporation sacked him earlier this year, was arrested and charged in Tokyo with falsifying company documents.</p>
<p><b>Correction. </b>In the issue of October 12th, we said that China's holdings of American Treasury securities soared to $12 billion in the first half of this year, putting it behind only Britain and Japan as a foreign creditor. The figures quoted were in fact net purchases, which puts China in seventh place, not third.</p>

<h1>Extra extra large</h1>

<p><b>Is the enduring Helmut Kohl a statesman or just a politician?</b></p>
THERE is something reassuring about a powerful German chancellor who, when he wakes up in the middle of the night, is thinking--by his own admission-- about raiding the refrigerator, not re-arranging the world. Helmut Kohl is a leader who at first looked cloddishly ordinary and has grown extraordinary, all the while retaining a quality of solid averageness that invites popular trust.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On October 31st Mr Kohl will overtake Konrad Adenauer to become post-1945 Germany's longest-serving chancellor. The 14 years-and-one-month he will then have notched up exceeds the entire life-span of the Weimar Republic (1919-33), Germany's ill-starred first exercise in democracy. At summits, the German chancellor is shaking the hands of his third American president, fourth Russian leader and eighth Japanese prime minister. Since Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand's death in January, Mr Kohl has found himself grandly alone, despite chirpy pledges of common purpose from Jacques Chirac, at the head of the march for European political union. Another five years as chancellor--not out of the question, since he is a robust-seeming 66 years old--and he will outstrip Bismarck, the Iron Chancellor who held office in the second Reich for 19 years (without the regrettable necessity of seeking re-election). <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a democracy, Mr Kohl's popular durability is the more remarkable. That it has been Germany's democracy that has thrown up such longevity may be a partial explanation: the so-called "German model", by encouraging consensus among big social groups (workers, managers, parties and so forth), puts a premium on stability. But that is also true of Japan, say. Conceivably, Germans may be unusual in the way they respond to good leadership. At any rate, it is striking that, in Mr Kohl, Adenauer, and Willy Brandt, Germany has produced more post-war leaders with a claim to exceptional stature than any other western nation. In America, Truman and Ronald Reagan stand out for their personal impact on the world (Kennedy, perhaps); in France, De Gaulle and (perhaps) Mitterrand; in Britain, Margaret Thatcher.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Which raises two questions: How has Mr Kohl achieved the respect in which he is held? And, more important, what judgment should be passed about his achievements in office?<br>
</p><p><b><b>Letting Kohl be Kohl</b></b><br>
The immediate explanation for the respect Mr Kohl commands is that he represents continuity and order after unification, an event that has brought Germans enough upheaval to last a lifetime. Yet that explanation is obviously partial. Mr Kohl had first to earn respect--and there was nothing predetermined about that.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After Mr Kohl lost the general election of 1976, Franz Josef Strauss, the bull-like premier of Bavaria, snorted: "Believe me, Helmut Kohl will never become chancellor. At the age of 90 he'll write his memoirs, 'Forty Years as Chancellor Candidate'." This was no doubt sour grapes from a man who himself lost the 1980 election but the comment also reflected a once-common tendency to dismiss Mr Kohl, a former premier of Rhineland-Palatinate, as a hick with little knowledge of the world who had over-reached himself when he secured the leadership of the Christian Democratic Union (<font size=-1>CDU</font>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His first years as chancellor were inauspicious. He fell into the job in 1982 when the Free Democrats deserted their coalition with Helmut Schmidt's Social Democrats and switched to his <font size=-1>CDU</font>. Critics accused him of insensitive bumbling. Notoriously, he took a flummoxed Ronald Reagan on a visit to a German cemetery where some <font size=-1>SS</font> troops were buried. He likened poor Mikhail Gorbachev to Goebbels. Fellow politicians began to talk of him as a one-term chancellor. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ordinary Germans, however, did not share the politicians' verdict. The fact that they have ensconced him in office suggests that he has made contact at some fundamental level: he has secured the average voter's confidence. He could not be ruffled. Soon he needed to go on slimming cures to combat an outsized appetite, a foible which rather appealed to his countrymen. It even helped that he came from (and has kept a home in) Ludwigshafen, an industrial port on the middle Rhine which strikes everyone as just about the most averagely-German place imaginable.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;German voters do not much go in for intellectual leaders and Mr Kohl makes no pretence to be one. He operates by instinct and like another non-intellectual, Ronald Reagan, exploits television with gusto. One of the great achievements of his cosy style is to make Germans feel content with themselves and their country--no small matter for a place with such a past. There is something apt about the choice of Mr Kohl's cardigan (size <font size=-1>XXL</font>) as an item on display in the Museum of History in Bonn.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This popular touch is the first of four features that have helped Mr Kohl consolidate his grip on German power and have forced his fellow politicians to reconsider their initial scepticism. The second is the transformation in his public skills on the world stage. No chancellor, it is often repeated, has learnt more in office. The tactlessness of the early years has all but gone. He has learned to speak the right language about Germany's past, which has helped foster warm relations not only with Poland and Russia but also with Israel and other nations which have most reason to fear Germany.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A third feature that has helped him is a lucky chance: a weak and fractious opposition. In the past four elections, the Social Democrats have run a series of almost sacrificially feeble candidates. In the 1994 election, the <font size=-1>SDP</font> candidate formed a troika with two of his party rivals at the last minute--hardly a sign of confidence. One of them has since staged a takeover as party boss. Mr Kohl has good taste in opponents.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The last feature that has given him such political dominance is his uninhibited approach to the exercise of power. Like Lyndon Johnson, Mr Kohl has the faculty that Germans call <i>Fingerspitzengef<dierisis>uhl</i>, a fingertip feel for politics that enables him to know just where to apply pressure and where to give personal encouragement. His range of personal contacts is immense. And, while he is sometimes accused of being disengaged from policy issues, no one doubts his skills in party management. Like Adenauer, who once claimed he was 75% of the cabinet, Mr Kohl likes to command, using his imposing bulk and indefatigable self-confidence to dominate both his circle of advisers and his party.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unlike Adenauer, he has few damaging critics. Karl Hugo Pruys, once his spokesman, recently his biographer, notes that he has no intimate friends. He is too consumed by politics for that. Politics, it seems, is his only passion (apart from food). Even opposition leaders confess admiration.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This may be good for him but not for his party. More than Adenauer, who founded the <font size=-1>CDU</font>, Mr Kohl embodies the party. He has led it for 23 years and has squashed first his rivals, then anyone who disagreed with him, such as Kurt Biedenkopf (now premier of Saxony). So absolute is his control of the <font size=-1>CDU</font>--at its annual conference in Hanover this week, 95.5% of delegates voted for him as party leader--that he is preventing it going through the process of renewal that could throw up the leader it will eventually need to replace him. He has made the <font size=-1>CDU</font> look like an assembly of yes-men.<br>
</p><p><b><b>The unification chancellor</b></b><br>
So much for the 'how' of Helmut Kohl<b>. </b>The bigger questions concern the 'what': What has he done? What should one make of it?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Germany has changed enormously during his rule, not least in becoming one country instead of two. It has begun the difficult process of reforming its bloated welfare state and adapting its high-cost and specifically German system of doing business to the increasingly American ways of international competition. In diplomatic affairs, Germany has come out of its post war shell. It has gone through the agony of allowing its soldiers to operate outside Germany and is now arming its peacekeepers in the Balkans to let them act as toughly, if need be, as other foreign forces. It feels sufficiently unburdened to press for a permanent seat on the United Nations security council. Of course, Germany has not overcome all its daunting post-war inhibitions: the self-questioning, the embarrassment about looking powerful, remains, often masked by the chancellor's personal self confidence. Yet Germany dominates Europe in a manner it did not when Mr Kohl came to power. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Kohl has guided Germany calmly through all these changes, especially unification: it is hard to imagine any country handling an upheaval of that magnitude as smoothly as he, and Germany, did. All the same, there is no Kohlism; there are not even many coherent policies attached to his name. So should he be judged merely as a durable tactician on whose watch unification happened to occur? Or is he a statesman, able to look ahead and guide, even create, events to serve his purpose?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To answer the question, begin by considering Mr Kohl's record in the light of the two chancellors with whom many, perhaps most, Germans would compare him, Adenauer and Brandt. Adenauer's great achievement was to anchor his country securely in the West. To this end, he set unification aside. Stalin is said to have offered him East Germany back in exchange for German neutrality; Adenauer refused. His policies guaranteed closeness to America, a fundamental goal, and brought the famous reconciliation with De Gaulle's France which spurred what has become the European Union.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Brandt's great achievement concerned the eventual goal of unification. Getting there, he reasoned, meant going in the seemingly opposite direction of recognising communist East Germany. To this end, he used his stint as chancellor (1969-74) to advance <i>Ostpolitik</i>, a bold and intricate scheme to restore traditional German links with Eastern Europe and Russia that Hitler and communism had shattered. This helped reassure Russia that the intentions of its historic enemy were not aggressive.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Kohl's great achievement has been to complete Brandt's aim of unification without compromising Adenauer's alliance with the West. At the outset of his chancellorship, Mr Kohl walked into a bitter east-west row over nuclear missiles. Controversially, he backed <font size=-1>NATO</font> plans to install cruise and Pershing missiles in West Germany. At great risk to his popularity (which was in any case shaky), Mr Kohl chose to emphasise Germany's commitment to the West and to the European Union (then Community) by ignoring the pacifist demands and neutralist temptations present in Germany. These amounted to a "Germany-first" belief that the country should go its own way; after all, supporters of this view asked, wouldn't neutrality relieve Germans of the pressures they bore?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That question returned with a vengeance when the prospect of unification drew near. In his newly-published account of that rousing time ("Helmut Kohl: I Wanted German Unity", Propyl<dierisis>an, DM48), the chancellor relates how he supported his insistence on a unified Germany's westernness with a disarming line in folk wisdom to win over Mr Gorbachev. Having sat the Soviet leader on a wall overlooking a moonlit Rhine in the chancellery gardens in Bonn, Mr Kohl softened him up thus: <br>
<ul><font size=1>Look at that river flowing by, it symbolises history. There is nothing static about it. You can dam this river . . . technically it can be done. But then it will overflow its banks and find another way to reach the sea. So it is with German unity.
</font></ul><br>Soon afterwards, Mr Kohl had that unity, without paying the price of some form of disengagement from the West which the Soviet Union, and some Germans, had in mind. There are many doubts about the economic terms on which unification was achieved but none of the historic nature of the achievement itself. Mr Kohl reconciled unification with westernisation--an act of statesmanship.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Inches short of greatness</b></b><br>
Teddy Roosevelt once said that even Lincoln would have been wasted had he lived during the relative calm of the early 20th century. To be a great president, it is not enough to have great skills and a compelling vision; you also need great occasions.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helmut Kohl has been able to measure himself by this yardstick. Unification was perhaps his greatest test but not the only one. Two others stand out: the challenges facing Germany's consensus system and Europe's unfinished business of economic and monetary union (<font size=-1>EMU</font>). All three tests suggest that while the chancellor is indeed capable of rising to the big occasion, he does so in a way that makes him fall short of the highest standards of statesmanship.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Kohl's manner of dealing with the great issues is to establish a point of no return, march past it, and let "details" fall into place later. Squabbling over smaller matters, he tells himself, only creates enemies and problems. This helps him make the great leap in the first place. But it also means that he cannot--or does not--think through all the ramifications of the change.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Take unification. Here, the "details" are starting to qualify his achievement. Mr Kohl has been criticised for overruling the Bundesbank and deciding to exchange solid <font size=-1>D</font>-marks for East Germany's meagre Ost-marks at a rate of one-to-one. The reason he did this was to meet popular expectations in the East. But it does not require hindsight to see that this would make East German businesses uncompetitive and increase the cost of modernising the ex-communist east--though few people expected the subsidy cost to rise to its current cumulative sum of over DM900 billion ($580 billion). Mr Kohl might also have freed up the east-German labour market and permitted more exemptions from the "social market" restrictions now hampering growth throughout Germany. Had he done so, the liberalisation now taking place painfully might have begun earlier. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This pattern--taking a bold decision then seeing some of the benefits eroded after the event--can be seen at work in the economic reforms launched this year (see <a href="wb8404.html">page</a>). Having looked brave this autumn when pushing a first batch of welfare cuts through parliament, Mr Kohl is now shrinking from applying them in full. To take a small example: where full pay for sick leave is part of a labour contract, says the chancellor, it must stay--at least until the contract is renegotiated. This is vintage Kohl. Employers and unions are in a fog, but both sides have something to thank him for. He stands, above all, for consensus between government, managers and workers. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That system has proved successful in the past, as have high productivity and German exporting skills. They may no longer be so now, as competitiveness slides, tempting German firms to manufacture outside Germany where wages and other costs are lower, pushing up unemployment. Some people believe the end of "the German model" is nigh, barring an improbably strong economic surge--and even that would merely delay deep reform.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Is Mr Kohl the man to push that reform through? The evidence so far is against it: he enjoys power not conflict; he seems deeply committed to the consensus system; his now-abandoned promise to halve unemployment by 2000 had the ring of fantasy. It may be unfair to accuse Mr Kohl of adding to the problem through his concern to avoid conflict and keep winning votes. But it is fair to say that the chancellor, a historian not an economist by training, looks ill at-ease in dealing with economic change. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the "unification chancellor" Mr Kohl's reputation is secure. As an economic reformer, he is likely to go down (unless his zeal is renewed) as a man who took half his chances. But he himself wants to be judged by a European yardstick: as the man who pushed through <font size=-1>EMU</font>--a point of no return--and hence made inevitable some form of closer European Union able to prevent nationalist aggression from returning to the continent.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Chancellor for Europe?</b></b><br>
With <font size=-1>EMU</font> still in the balance, it is obviously too early to make a judgment of Mr Kohl by this yardstick. But suppose <font size=-1>EMU</font> occurs. It would indeed be a triumph for the chancellor, upon whose unwavering support the whole plan has depended during the past uncertain year. But would Mr Kohl's broader, federating aim then be guaranteed? Not necessarily. For one thing, there is a short-run tension (which Mr Kohl has always denied) between the aims of <font size=-1>EMU</font> and <font size=-1>EU</font> expansion: the new members, when they join, will be members of a second class of Europeans who do not use the single currency. This is divisive, rather than inclusive.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For another thing, many Europeans, though few Germans, are less worried than Mr Kohl about the great threat of nationalism. That means Germany approaches Europe in a different way from most of its partners, France included. Mr Kohl's federating mission is, in a nutshell, to save Germany from itself. Other members of the European Union may dislike nationalism, but none (except perhaps for Italy) think it necessary to save themselves--or anything else--from the consequences of their own actions. Mr Kohl's project for <font size=-1>EMU</font>-driven integration is shaping up to be, like unification and welfare reform, a great leap forward--followed by years dealing with unforeseen consequences.<br>

BACK in 1994 Jan Allen threw a party, and the mood of that gathering held the key to the Democrats' defeat in the congressional elections of that year. It was just before polling day, and Ms Allen, a retired <font size=-1>IBM</font> executive and Democratic activist, was dismayed to find her fellow Democrats unmoved by the election. Nearly all of them-- professionals and university professors--assumed a Democratic victory in the local congressional district. Their candidate, David Price, was a clever politics professor with the advantage of incumbency; the Republican challenger, Fred Heineman, was a blunt policeman from New York. And yet, two days later, the unthinkable happened. Mr Heineman was elected, not because the Republican vote had grown much, but because complacent Democrats had not bothered to turn out. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This time the Democrats are determined not to be complacent. On October 21st Ms Allen attended another social gathering, in a genteel housing development called Fearrington Village. The village's barn was decked out with pot plants, and 100 or so well-to-do Democrats stood around eating from plates labelled "Pig Out!". Mr Price, who is trying to win back his seat, greeted everybody assiduously, impressing upon them the need to rally voters. Ms Allen has certainly got the message. She has installed eight new phone lines at her local party office, and rounded up volunteers to call people. Another team of activists stands ready to drive Democrats to voting stations on polling day.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is not just the local activists who have cast off their old complacency. In 1994 the party headquarters in Washington gave Mr Price little advice or money, figuring that, as a four-term incumbent, he could fend for himself. This time, however, party <font size=-1>HQ</font> has been more generous; and the trade unions have spent some $1.3m on local television advertisements to help Mr Price's cause. Two years ago it was hard to attack Mr Heineman; he was a political novice, with no record to pick at. Now that he has spent two years in Congress voting with Newt Gingrich, the Democrats pummel him for voting against the environment, against education, against just about everything that makes life worthwhile.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With more enthusiasm, more money, and a more clearly defined opponent, Mr Price seems virtually sure of taking back his district. The question is whether these same forces, operating in dozens of races around America, will be enough to break the Republicans' control of the House. If it is, a host of Gingrichite committee chairmen will be displaced by Democrats. Whereas a Republican House would keep a second term Clinton in the political centre, a Democratic House would pull him to the left. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To win the House, Democrats need a net gain of 19 seats. This sounds feasible: 12 of the 25 elections since the second world war have produced a swing this size or bigger. Many of the 73 Republicans elected for the first time two years ago share Mr Heineman's vulnerability. They won as fresh outsiders; now that they are incumbents, this appeal is gone.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Two years ago in Chicago, for example, voters elected Michael Flanagan, an unremarkable 30-year-old who campaigned on such profundities as "I want to see good things happen." This time round, however, Mr Flanagan can no longer pose as an outsider. He has accepted cash from fat-cat backers, including the tobacco lobby. Deprived of his main political asset, he appears merely boring. He lags in the polls.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where they are not dull, Republicans have been made to seem extreme. In part, this is the result of propaganda: the Democrats assail their opponents for "cutting Medicare", even though Republicans suggested only slowing its rate of growth. In other respects, however, the extremist label is warranted. Many Republicans benefited two years ago from the money and votes of groups such as the National Rifle Association; once in office, they have felt obliged to vote for the repeal of the assault-weapons ban. A few candidates go even further. In Texas, for example, Ron Paul denounces tax as theft, and regards government benefits as immoral. His political newsletter is commended by a Canadian neo-Nazi group.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In some cases, Republicans seem in danger of being labelled "extremist" without enjoying the compensating support that extreme politics can bring. The gun lobby and the Christian right are less fired up than they were two years ago, so seem likely to yield fewer votes. They are turned off by Bob Dole's candidacy, not least because he has waffled on their issues. The congressional races do not grab them either. They may adore Newt Gingrich, the radical House speaker; but they are depressed by how far his star has fallen. Other House Republicans have disappointed them in various ways. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This mix of trend and anecdote, raising the possibility of a Democratic House of Representatives, gets some support from pollsters. This week a <i>New York Times</i>/<font size=-1>CBS</font> News poll found that 47% of respondents want the Democrats in charge of Congress, compared with 39% who favour continued Republican control: a month ago, the Democrats' lead was smaller. Several seers reckon that, if Mr Clinton wins by more than a ten-point margin, his coat-tails will carry enough Democrats to victory to tip the House their way. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble is that the polls are actually ambiguous, and trends and anecdotes can be advanced by both sides. The coat-tail effect is unreliable. In 1988 the Democrats gained three seats despite George Bush's victory in the presidential race; in 1992 Republicans picked up ten seats, despite Mr Clinton's win that year. Moreover, some who say they want a Democratic House change their minds when asked how Mr Clinton's re-election would influence their preference: the <i>New York Times </i>poll found that 48% would prefer a Republican Congress to balance the president, while only 41% wanted a Democratic Congress as well.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Republicans hope that the fear of a Democratic monopoly will give them the advantage in the last days of the House races. They are also hoping that the barrage of trade-union attack ads will backfire for the Democrats. This week, a new Republican advertisement took to the airwaves, showing union bosses plotting to fix the election in a shadowy backroom; "Big labour bosses, big money, big lies, big liberals," the voice-over intones. In places inundated by union dollars, but without strong union membership, such tactics may work. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One such place is North Carolina; and, despite Mr Price's likely victory there, this state demonstrates the limits of Democratic hopes. Until 1994, the state's House delegation consisted of eight Democrats and four Republicans. Since then, it has been the other way around. This year, even Democrats concede that three out of the state's five Republican freshmen will be re elected. Mr Price's seat, and one other, is the most they hope to win back.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The other vulnerable seat is held by David Funderburk. The Democrats have pounded him with all their usual tactics, accusing him of wanting to gut Medicare, and linking his name to that of Mr Gingrich at every opportunity. But Mr Funderburk remains undaunted. Being linked to Mr Gingrich will hurt him less, he reckons, than being linked to Mr Clinton will hurt his opponent. Locals agree with what Mr Gingrich says, even if they find him arrogant. But they dislike both Mr Clinton and his views.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That, at least, is the basis for Mr Funderburk's campaigning. He comes from a tobacco district, and a bumper sticker outside one of his rallies proclaims, "More Americans smoke than voted for Bill Clinton." Far from running from the Republican record, Mr Funderburk stands on the back of a farm truck and enjoins his audience to "vote the values of the district". He denounces the Clinton administration for being soft on heroin and cocaine ("the preferred drugs of Hollywood") while plotting restrictions on tobacco farmers. He and his fellow Republicans had tried to limit government, Mr Funderburk continued, but Mr Clinton's veto had obstructed them. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite the president's likely victory, some Republicans still believe that their agenda is more popular. They also believe that deep shifts--the growth of suburbs, the fear of an underclass left behind by the technological revolution--are pushing America their way. If Mr Clinton wins, it will merely reflect his success in moving rightwards. But the House Democrats have been slower to shift towards the centre. Even if they do well this November, their long-term grip on the House may depend on following Mr Clinton--which would amount to a victory for Republicanism, if not for Republicans themselves.<br>

<b>Divide and vote: </b>A majority of Americans (55%) think it is good for the country to have a president of one party and Congress controlled by another, reports a Harris poll. Ticket-splitting has become the norm: 62% say they will vote for candidates from both parties.<center>***</center><br>
<b>Travels: </b>In the last stretch of the campaign, Mr Dole finds it necessary to visit Florida, Texas and Arizona, states that should have been safely Republican. Mr Clinton, trawling for ethnic votes in the mid-west, eats pirogies (stuffed pastries) and recommends <font size=-1>NATO</font> membership for Central European countries by 1999.<center>***</center><br>
<b>Travails:</b> Mr Dole's attacks on Mr Clinton's ethics backfire. Most polls show Mr Clinton's lead widening. Mr Dole takes to referring to the Truman-Dewey upset of 1948 to show that the unexpected can happen. <center>***</center><br>
<b>Defeatism:</b> Rife among top Republicans. Defeatists reportedly include Jack Kemp (says privately the race is over, according to <i>Newsweek</i>) and Republican governors such as Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin ("I thought George Bush's campaign was probably the poorest-run . . . and I think this is a close second.").<center></center><br>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<b>Ethics: </b>As part of his offensive over foreign contributions to the Democratic Party, Mr Dole proposes campaign-finance reform. The Clinton camp mocks this "political deathbed conversion"-- and releases an ad accusing Republicans of tapping foreign money too.<center>***</center><br>
<b>Objection: </b>Nancy Reagan writes to Mr Clinton asking him "as a matter of decency" to stop airing replays of the assassination attempt on her husband. The footage is included in a Clinton campaign ad in which Jim Brady, Mr Reagan's former press secretary who was crippled in the incident, endorses Mr Clinton's gun-control efforts. The Clinton campaign says it will consider Mrs Reagan's views, but does not apologise.<center>***</center><br>
<b>Motor-doper: </b>Under attack for the rise in teenage drug use during his presidency, Mr Clinton proposes drug-testing for teenagers applying for a driving licence. Civil libertarians in turn attack Mr Clinton for pandering for votes with policies that intrude on freedom. <center>***</center><br>

<p><b>The Queen's Speech</b></p>
<h1>Moving ma'am</h1>

JOHN MAJOR is a constitutional conservative. You would think, therefore, that when the prime minister did propose a change, it would be remembered. Not so: on October 23rd, the Queen's Speech, setting out the government's legislative programme, went by without mention of Mr Major's proposal earlier this year that it be shifted from the autumn to May.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The autumn Queen's Speech is an anachronism. The budget used to take place in the spring. In those days it made sense to spread parliamentary business through the year by starting on the non budget legislation in the autumn. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, since 1993, the unified budget, which brings together the government's spending and taxing plans, has taken place in November. The result: an autumn logjam with the budget and new laws competing for time in the Commons. Come spring, there is a hiatus for <font size=-1>MP</font>s while those laws are considered by the House of Lords. Hence Mr Major's sensible proposal.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Next year will offer a great opportunity to make the change. Most people now expect the general election to be on May 1st 1997. A new government could announce its legislative plans for a normal one-year session of Parliament in the Queen's Speech just after that election. Otherwise there will be a tiresomely long session of Parliament, running until autumn 1998. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Surprisingly, however, the prime minister's proposal has got nowhere. The usual process of consultation between the parties which precedes such changes has not even been started. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, is said to be concentrating on the general election--a suspicion borne out by the fact that this year's Queen's Speech mostly contained bills designed to emphasise the gap between the main parties rather than any common ground. Ann Taylor, his Labour shadow, has failed to push for change. A good idea could easily be lost.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another reform proposed by Mr Major is, however, taking root. He wants bills to be published in draft before debate to allow expert scrutiny. The queen told the Commons that two bills--on care of the elderly and on national identity cards--will now get that treatment. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour is urging one further reform. It wants to abolish the ludicrous rule by which government bills are deemed lost if they fail to be carried in a single parliamentary session. Instead, unfinished bills could be picked up again in a new session at the stage they had reached when the old session ended--as is already the case with private legislation on behalf of particular companies and interests. Taken together, these proposals, Mr Major's and Labour's, could transform the effectiveness of Parliament in scrutinising legislation, which makes it all the sadder that they are subject to so much foot-dragging.<br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>Dialling Tone</h1>

LABOUR'S telephone campaign to persuade its members to vote on Tony Blair's "New Labour, New Life for Britain" policy document is being ridiculed by the Conservatives. But all the main parties now realise how effective telephone marketing can be, either to get supporters into the polling booths or to solicit donations. Especially after the 1992 general election, in which some say the phone was the secret weapon behind the Tories' surprise win.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Simon Pell, a Labour official who was behind his party's adoption of telephone marketing, later left to form Pell & Bales, a firm which is now being paid &#163;1.10 a call to ring thousands of party members to urge them to vote on the policy document. Although the document was approved by the party's conference, Mr Blair wants a direct vote of support from at least half of the 370,000 members.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour claims that just under 40% have voted so far, not all of whom will have backed Mr Blair's vision of a new Britain. Pell & Bales, with Labour's in house telephone canvassers, aim to reach 40,000 households containing, in all, 100,000 party members by October 31st, the closing date for the vote.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;During the 1992 election, Labour and the Liberal Democrats were lulled into false optimism because the Tories did hardly any traditional doorstep canvassing. In fact, local Tory constituency parties had switched tactics, realising that as voters were increasingly reluctant to open their doors to strangers it made more sense to canvass support by phone. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since then, Labour has invested heavily in setting up telephone canvassing operations, both at party headquarters and locally. Michael Cunnington, Labour's head of fund-raising, reckons that donations gathered by phone are worth about &#163;1.7m a year. The Lib Dems are also doing more phone-politicking, but mostly at a local level.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Tories seem to have lost the lead they built at the last election. Harvey Thomas, a publicity chief for the Tories from 1985 to 1991, says that after seeing how much money America's Republicans were raising by telephone, he pleaded in vain with his party bosses to set up a similar operation at Conservative Central Office. But local constituency parties refused to let go of their membership lists. Even now, Tory headquarters has no comprehensive list of party members. If it wanted to launch a nationwide telephone campaign like Mr Blair's, it would not know whom to call.<br>

<p><b>The cost of Scotland</b></p>
<h1>Misty</h1>

<font size=1>EDINBURGH</font><p>
SCOTLAND is over-subsidised, think many right-wing Tories. A study published by the Scottish Office on October 21st seems to confirm this. It estimated that in the 1994-95 fiscal year the government spent &#163;30.3 billion in Scotland, whilst the Scots stumped up a mere &#163;22.1 billion in tax, leaving a whopping &#163;8.2 billion gap (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Michael Forsyth, the Scottish secretary, is oddly proud of this for a right-winger, boasting that he spends about 25% more per Scot on things such as education than is spent south of the border. He warns that this Tory generosity will come to an abrupt halt if Labour wins power and a devolved Scottish parliament takes over his budget. Scots would be even worse off were they ever to be governed by the Scottish National Party (<font size=-1>SNP</font>), he threatens.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the <font size=-1>SNP</font> complains that the Scottish Office figures are distorted. The party has a point. Britain as a whole had a huge public sector deficit in 1994-95. Part of the &#163;8.2 billion shortfall between Scotland's public spending and tax revenues--around &#163;4.2 billion of it--is its share of that overall British deficit, not a subsidy from the rest of Britain. Moreover, Scotland should be allocated a share of privatisation revenues-- around &#163;600m, assuming revenues are divided according to population. That would cut Scotland's subsidy from (fiscal deficit with) the rest of Britain to just &#163;3.4 billion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This might still embarrass Labour. Its devolution plans would make this cash transfer from the south crystal clear, leaving the party with some explaining to do. As for the independent Scotland favoured by the <font size=-1>SNP</font>, surely it would be a poorer country than now, as presumably such transfers would stop on independence? No, says the <font size=-1>SNP</font>, arguing that independence would give Scotland control of most tax revenue from Britain's North Sea oil. Maybe. But, as our chart shows, even with 90% of this revenue, Scotland would still be in hock to the rest of Britain to the tune of &#163;2 billion--not including its share of Britain's deficit, which it would have to find a way to pay for if independence arrived. Freedom would not come for free.<br>

<p><b>Same-sex marriages</b></p>
<h1>Jewish family values</h1>

BRITAIN'S politicians are currently gushing with professions of faith in religion and family values. Yet two of Britain's bigger religious groups are struggling to decide what sort of families to value. The Church of England has been in uproar since Anne Atkins, a conservative Anglican, used <font size=-1>BBC</font> radio's "Thought for the Day" slot earlier this month to accuse the church of taking too liberal a line on homosexuality. And similar stirrings are afoot within Britain's Jewish community.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Reform Judaism is a branch of the religion that prides itself on its openness, especially in matters sexual. Unlike the various Orthodox strands, it has female rabbis, seats men and women together in synagogues and sees homosexuality as a legitimate form of love. But when one rabbi, Elizabeth Sarah, used a sermon on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish year, to say that she was to officiate at a "commitment ceremony" between two lesbians, all hell broke loose. One rabbi threatened to quit the Reform umbrella organisation; some Orthodox Jews said that Reform had, in the words of one rabbi, shown its "farcical and ugly face". The couple cancelled the ceremony, Rabbi Sarah apologised for the fuss and Reform leaders were muzzled.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Reform's peculiar position in Britain makes the mix of sex and religion more than usually combustible. In America, where Reform is the most popular branch of Judaism, Reform rabbis have been blessing same-sex unions for years. But in Britain Reform plays second fiddle to the Orthodox establishment; 13% of the country's 300,000 Jews belong to Reform synagogues while 40% belong to the United Synagogue, the main Orthodox grouping. Partly for that reason, British Reform is more conservative than its American variant. Its rabbis do not marry Jews to non-Jews; they do not acknowledge as Jews children of non-Jewish mothers unless they convert.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This cautious liberalism has served Reform Judaism well. Although synagogue membership is declining overall, Reform is adding members. It dreams of someday supplanting the United Synagogue as British Jewry's dominant religious group.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The uproar over homosexuality has exposed rifts between rabbis who think heterosexual marriage is the only kind Judaism can openly endorse and those who think gay couples deserve some kind of consecration. The controversy has also pitted clergy against laity. In what liberal rabbis regard as unprecedented meddling by a lay body in religious matters, the Council of Reform Synagogues ordered rabbis not to do same-sex ceremonies until the Reform movement decides on the matter.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That will not be easy. Unlike the United Synagogue, Reform has no chief rabbi to lay down the law. A committee of the rabbinical assembly, set up before the controversy broke, had hoped to include same-sex unions in a broader ruling on other sorts of family relationship, including unmarried heterosexual couples. Now it has been bounced into dealing with homosexual unions alone.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Reform Jews may yet agree to disagree. Rabbi Rodney Mariner, a member of the committee, says most members oppose letting rabbis officiate at gay unions but may nonetheless free dissenting rabbis to go their own way. Without a solution, Reform rabbis may find themselves presiding over a same-sect schism.<br>

<h1>Launching Deutsche Telekom</h1>

<font size=1>BERLIN</font><p>
<p><b>The sale of Germany's telephone giant will reshape Europe's biggest telecoms market. But will it, as many hope, transform German capitalism too?</b></p><br>
DEUTSCHE TELEKOM attracts superlatives. It is the most ridiculed company in Germany, the biggest phone operator in Europe, and (after Tokyo Power) the world's most indebted commercial entity. It has one of the best high-speed telephone networks in the world, yet it is also renowned for treating many of its subscribers badly. Its partial privatisation, which starts on November 18th, is the largest flotation in Germany's history and the second-biggest anywhere (after that of Japan's <font size=-1>NTT</font>, another telecoms giant).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More than perhaps any other big sale since that of British Telecom in 1984, Deutsche Telekom's privatisation is an attempt to change a country's business culture. At present German capitalism is caught in something of a vicious circle. Germany is unique among big industrial countries in that only about 5% of its population hold shares (in Britain, for instance, the figure is nearer 25%). This is partly a function of history: having lost their savings twice this century in post-war currency reforms, Germans are notably risk-averse. But it also reflects the poor performance of shares in most of Germany's biggest companies, which have offered miserable returns compared with those of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet--and this is where the vicious circle comes in--the poor performance of those companies is also a consequence of the country's lack of an equity culture. Germany's savings are mainly channeled through banks into loans to industry, rather than though mutual funds into shares. As a result, company bosses in Germany are generally under less pressure to produce sparkling results: shareholders, whose own money is at risk if a company does badly, tend to be more demanding.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is changing. The number of foreign investors in German firms is growing quickly and a new breed of German managers such as J<dierisis>urgen Schrempp of Daimler-Benz, a huge conglomerate, have made it clear that shareholder value is now a priority. A recent report by Goldman Sachs, an American investment bank, argues that German firms could easily push up their current low return on equity (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>) by between two and three percentage points. A successful sale of 20% of Telekom would give share ownership a big fillip--not least by paving the way for other large sell-offs, such as that of the government's remaining 36% stake in Lufthansa. Rolf Breuer, a director of Deutsche Bank, describes Telekom's privatisation as "the last big chance" to establish an equity culture in Germany.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With so many things depending on a successful sale, Telekom's board this week announced an indicative price range for the 500m new shares the firm is selling of just DM25-30 ($16-20)--some way below the DM35-40 level forecast a year ago. This price should ensure that the launch is a success. But the shares' likely long-term performance is harder to predict.<br>
</p><p><b><b>The need to be wired</b></b><br>
Telekom's new boss, Ron Sommer (who joined the company from Sony last year), has done his best to reform a company that still thinks and behaves far too much like a civil service department. Customers are now treated better. Repairs now sometimes happen on public holidays and there are many more phone boxes, usually in working order. The company has also launched new services, such as T Online, Germany's most popular Internet service provider. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Telekom's new shareholders will inherit an impressive range of assets. It has Germany's second-biggest mobile telephone network and its biggest cable-television network. Thanks in part to the high prices that it charges in its core business, Telekom is also an impressive generator of cash: it earned DM34 billion last year before interest, tax and depreciation. And Mr Sommer has pushed it into Global One, an impressive-looking international alliance, with France T&eacute;l&eacute;com and Sprint, an American long distance carrier.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet Telekom also has impressive weaknesses. It has a burdensome debt of DM100 billion, partly because modernising former East Germany's telephone system--a political not a business decision--cost it a cool DM50 billion. Moreover, despite Mr Sommer's best efforts, the company is still overstaffed by world standards, with 184 lines per employee, compared to an average of 275 at America's regional Bell telephone companies (though to be fair, the German firm does more things). Getting rid of unwanted posts-- 30,000 of its 200,000 staff are supposed to leave the firm by 2000-- could cost as much as DM100,000 per employee.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Telekom's domestic fixed-link businesses supplied DM51 billion of its DM66 billion in revenues last year (see <a href="wb2.gif">table</a>). That will not last. On January 1st 1998, telecoms in the <font size=-1>EU</font> must be fully liberalised. Telekom will then have to deal with something new and potentially life-threatening: competition in its bread and-butter business of providing telephone services to households and firms. A local call in Germany is still almost as costly as a coast-to-coast call in America. For long-distance and international services in Germany (as in most other monopoly markets), prices are still extortionate.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Already four consortia are marching, in differing degrees of readiness, towards the starting line. One of the most threatening combines <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, America's long-distance champion, with Mannesmann, a German engineering group that has taken only a few years to knock Telekom from the top spot in mobile phones, the only market where it has been exposed to real competition.<br>
</p><p><b><b>The route to profit</b></b><br>
Under Mr Sommer, Telekom should defend its fixed-link business more fiercely. It has already offered price cuts of 40% to business users (provoking protests from its competitors and regulators). It also faces competition from "re-sellers"--companies which buy cheap international capacity and then sell it through call-back services and the like. At least two, Telepassport and <font size=-1>USA</font> Global Link, are planning to launch services for internal German long-distance calls early next year (the latter will invest $100m to install new switches in Germany). Even routed via a neighbouring country, their service will be cheaper than Telekom's peak-time rates. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thanks to the resellers, to new entrants and to the existing networks owned by various other utilities in Germany, there will soon be a surplus of long-distance capacity. But in the local market, any new competitor will still have to use Telekom's lines to connect with customers. In theory, Telekom will be required to let competitors pick and choose which parts of its network they want to lease (the lines, but not the switches which connect them, for example) at a price set by the regulators.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, the rules are vague. For instance, it is not clear what constitutes a reasonable ground for Telekom to refuse an interconnection. Worse, the regulator, who is supposed to impose an interconnection agreement if the parties cannot agree on one, has not yet been appointed. (In the meantime, the rules will be enforced by the Federal Ministry for Posts and Telecommunications, which has little experience of regulating a competitive marketplace.) In keeping with their desire to protect Telekom, Germany's politicians seem reluctant to change. "We have people behaving like dinosaurs", complains Stephan Schwarz of <font size=-1>VTM</font>, a lobby group for Telekom's competitors.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, the market is unlikely to stay rigged in Telekom's favour for long. One source of salvation for its rivals is likely to be the European Commission, which has already held up Telekom's planned price cuts to its corporate customers. Expect an even tougher response from regulators elsewhere, particularly America. The Federal Communications Commission is already preventing Global One from launching full operations in the United States until Germany treats outsiders fairly. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In other words, even the friendliest treatment by the German government will only delay, rather than cancel, the day of reckoning for Telekom. Indeed, the point must soon come where the political imperative of having cheap communications (which can be achieved only by opening up the telecoms market and encouraging competitors) will matter more in Bonn than protecting the old monopoly. Where will that leave Telekom's new shareholders--not to mention German capitalism?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p><b> <b>Got the DTs</b><br></b>A lot of attention (and cash) has been paid to ensure that the current launch is a success. In a DM85m advertising blitz, comedians and other celebrity investment advisers have been singing (literally in some cases) the shares' merits. A disproportionate chunk of the issue will be reserved for German private investors. As Deutsche Telekom will account for nearly 5% of the main Frankfurt share index, almost any fund manager who invests in Germany is going to be needing some shares. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So far, so good. Barring regulatory fireworks from Washington or Brussels, or a stockmarket down-turn, most of the 3m Germans who have registered for the shares should buy at least some. "The banks and the government can't let this fail" is a commonly-voiced sentiment. That powerful interests stand behind Deutsche Telekom's success is certainly true. But this does not make it the risk-free investment portrayed in the advertisements.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Its new shareholders will not automatically make Telekom more efficient. The DM15 billion raised by the share sale will help reduce its debt-mountain, but Telekom will still be vulnerable (one investment bank, <font size=-1>BZW</font>, says that the sale is more reminiscent of a leveraged buy-out than a privatisation). Much will depend on Mr Sommer's ability to cut costs. The success of <font size=-1>BT</font> shows the potential, however.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When shares in Volkswagen, a German car maker, were first floated in 1960, they too were attractively priced and packaged in the hope of creating a nation of shareholders. But soon afterwards their price fell, dipping below their flotation price. Small investors panicked and dumped the stock (had they hung on to it for a long time, they would eventually have done well). The Volkswagen experience helped turn an entire generation of German investors against equities.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The chances are that the Telekom sale will be more of a success and help to open up German capitalism. Even so, an unwieldy monopolist, whose future partly depends on the government restraining its competitors, makes an awkward advertisement for a better way of life.<br>

<p><b>Multimedia in Britain</b></p>
<h1>The front line</h1>

MIGHT British Telecom at last face a se rious competitor in its home market? For several years, a number of other firms have been buzzing around <font size=-1>BT</font>. Now they have decided to gang up on it. On October 22nd, Cable and Wireless announced a complicated &#163;5 billion ($8 billion) merger between Mercury Communications, <font size=-1>C&W</font>'s own subsidiary and the company first groomed to challenge <font size=-1>BT</font>, and three cable <font size=-1>TV</font> firms. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The deal is the brainchild of <font size=-1>C&W</font>'s new boss, Dick Brown, who lists its advantages with glee. By connecting Mercury with the three cable firms--Nynex CableComms, Bell Cablemedia and Videotron--<font size=-1>C&W</font> will have the right to lay wires to the door of 6m Britons. Britain's cable companies already offer a telephone service to go with their television; now the three merged companies will be able to carry their calls throughout the country on Mercury's long-distance lines, and deliver them to homes in its regions without paying steep access fees to <font size=-1>BT</font>. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then there are the usual cost savings of merging operations. Together the companies, which will be called something like <font size=-1>C&W</font> Communications, will have a bit more clout in negotiating a price for television programming. And if <font size=-1>C&W</font> can work out a way to bring in Mercury One<font size=-1>2</font>One, a mobile telephone network it half-owns, it could then offer a tempting all-in-one package of services to its customers: television; local, long-distance and mobile telephony; and whatever whizzy interactive services it can pump down its lines, such as high speed Internet access.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, the new merger is a product of weakness, not strength. After more than a decade of laying lines, the cable companies have failed to repeat their success in America (see <a href="wb3.gif">chart</a>). They now reach more than a third of British homes. But only a fifth of these actually subscribe to the service; worse, this figure has barely moved over the past six years, even declining a bit of late. By contrast in America, more than 60% of the homes that are hooked up subscribe. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britons, it seems, do not like television as much as couch-bound Americans--or, rather, they do not like the American-style fare that the cable stations offer. They also enjoy better quality broadcast reception than many Americans, which makes cable less necessary. Many of those who do want more <font size=-1>TV</font> are happy to get it from cheap satellite providers, such as <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>. And the marketing tactics of most British cable firms have been lacklustre (a discrete postcard under the door once a year is still considered a hard sell). The one bright spot has been cable's relative success in selling telephone services, which have drawn more customers than television itself. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A telecoms man for most of his career, Mr Brown came to <font size=-1>C&W</font> in July from Ameritech, one of America's seven main regional telephone companies (with a short stint at another firm in between). Ask him about negotiating clout for television programming and he will dismiss it as a detail, but mention local-calling margins and he waxes lyrical about their importance. Alas, he says he cannot reveal just how staggering the merger's savings will be, because a public offering of stock may be in the works. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if the savings are impressive for calls travelling entirely over the lines of the merged firms, few calls will take this route. Combined, the three cable companies have only 500,000 customers, out of more than 27m telephone homes in the country. Most calls will continue to go from a cable customer to a local non-customer; the merger is of little help there. Even the long-distance ones that travel over Mercury's line may save just 15%. Mr Brown admits that the current merger is just a start; expect more cable firms to join later, he hints. That will increase the buzzing; whether <font size=-1>BT</font> will end up being stung is another matter.<br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>Land of the free, home of the Braves</h1>

INVESTMENT bankers may not be able to hit a curve ball, but the average professional baseball player would feel at home on a trading floor: the foul language, the cut-throat competition, the outrageous salaries. Since 1977, when America's ball players gained the freedom to change teams without owners' permission, their salaries have soared: the average major-league player now makes more than $1m a year. Besides enriching the athletes at the owners' expense, however, "free agency" was also supposed to make professional players more mobile and thus make competition among clubs more even. Has it?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The return of the Atlanta Braves to this year's World Series--their fourth appearance in five seasons--suggests that the best teams can still find a way to stay on top. (As <i>The Economist</i> went to press, the series was in progress.) Yet many people contend that the game has become more competitive in recent years: new teams are making the post-season play-offs, divisional races are more exciting, and so forth. So to try to determine whether this is so, Craig Depken, an economist at the University of Texas in Arlington, has tried to marry baseball with economics.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Economists often gauge the competitiveness of an industry by measuring the extent to which its output is concentrated among a few companies. The most common such measure is a "Herfindahl Hirschman" (<font size=-1>HH</font>) index: to calculate it, take the market shares of all the firms, square them, and add them up. If there are 100 equal-sized firms, the index is 0.01; if there are four equal-sized firms, it will be 0.25. So the higher the number, the more market power is concentrated. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In applying this to baseball, one difficulty is defining what ball players produce. Mr Depken uses two rough measures: strike-outs and home runs. After calculating <font size=-1>HH</font> indices for 1920-93, he found that both home runs and strike outs have indeed been growing less concentrated over time: that is, there is less disparity between the number of home runs hit by good teams and those hit by bad ones.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If free agency has indeed spread the best players more evenly around the league, this trend should have become more marked after 1977. However, this does not appear to be the case. Instead, the fall in concentration can be explained by other factors, such as adding more teams to the league, breaking teams into more divisions and so on.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This makes sense. Most owners of small-city teams complain that their big city rivals have more money than they do, and can therefore afford to buy the best players. Free agency appears simply to have bid up the players' salaries at their employers' expense, without changing the balance of power in the league. A lesson for investment banks?<br>

<html><head><title> Why the Net should grow up</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" width="78" height="39" alt="The Economist" border=0></p><h1 align=center> Why the Net should grow up</h1>THE growth of the Internet has been the most astonishing technological phenomenon of the last decade of this century. In 1990 only a few academics had heard of it; now, anything up to 50m people use it. In a year's time, that figure could be 100m--so far, the network's only constant has been that the number of people tapping into it has doubled every 12 months. But up to now, only a handful of companies have made much money from the Internet. If it is to become a commercial success, rather than merely a <i>succ&egrave;s d'estime</i>, it has to change. Otherwise many of the qualities that brought it popularity will become liabilities.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Increasingly, the Internet is coming under attack, and from many quarters. The telephone companies, whose networks carry much of its traffic, grumble noisily that Internet users clog their wires and bypass their long-distance rates with cheap Internet telephone calls. Frustrated regulators wail that the Internet has become a way to dodge national laws. Users are driven to distraction by the delays, the muddle and the brainless rubbish. Breakdowns of bits of the Net are hardly new, but when they happen these days a lot more people notice--as when America Online crashed in August, leaving 6m subscribers to twiddle their thumbs. Last week a group of American universities, fed up with the Net's sluggish ways, decided to set up Internet II, a new network that will allow its members to swap data more smoothly.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Faced with pile-ups and pollution on the prototype information superhighway, governments will be increasingly tempted to intervene. The Net's early colonisers reply that regulation will slow its growth. But is there any alternative?<br></p><p><b>Did somebody say market?</b><br>The first and most pressing need is for a better way to price the use of the Internet (see <a href="sf0774.html">page</a>). At present, many users pay less than the true cost of carrying their messages over the network. Most pay a one-off monthly fee to the firm that offers them a Net connection; and then home users typically have the additional cost of the local telephone call every time that they log on. This system is an invitation to use the network as intensively as possible, even if it causes problems for others. Thanks to the wonders of the World Wide Web, the multimedia part of the Net, people are using the network to transmit telephone calls, film clips and other capacity-guzzling applications. The upshot is that the Net still resembles a congested city street: because users pay only for their car and its fuel, rather than for the inconvenience their presence on the road imposes on others, they have no incentive to limit the use of their car in order to avoid traffic jams.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Congestion is made worse by the absence of a satisfactory way for firms running the Net to charge for carrying each other's traffic. Sticking to the informal style that was characteristic of the Net's early days, they have tended to use a rough-and-ready barter system. That worked when there were just a handful of firms whose own networks formed the Net, but today there are thousands. Some admit that they now carry as much traffic from freeloaders as from their own customers. When they cannot afford to spend enough to keep up with this demand, they become bottlenecks.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To some extent, the market will develop answers for itself. Indeed, to the dismay of the most ardent Internet enthusiasts, companies are increasingly building private Internets either to connect their internal users, or to ensure fast communications with other firms. These private networks will solve other Internet problems: they offer quality-of-service guarantees, and better security against hackers. Geeks will grumble that they risk causing the balkanisation of the Net. Customers will be delighted by the absence of delays.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The subsidy from the telephone network is a different matter, and usually reflects political pressures: governments, keen to see competition when it benefits customers, do not much like measures that drive up the cost of a local call. One of the welcome effects of the Internet will be to make political meddling in telephone prices harder to sustain, because inexpensive telephone calls over the Internet will help to undermine excessive margins on long-distance telephone tariffs. Indeed, the interests of surfers and telephone callers are ultimately identical: where competition thrives and regulation does not suppress it, people will communicate through whichever channel is best for their particular needs.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Governments can leave the market to sort out the way transmission over the Net is priced. Their proper role is to decide how far to try to regulate the material that passes through it. Many people dislike the way the Net is used by law-breakers to bypass national laws on decency, libel, racism, intellectual property, and so on. Because the Internet whisks content around the world, it is harder to police than a national television channel or a newspaper.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Policing, mind you, is not impossible. The government of Myanmar has outlawed the unauthorised possession of networked computers on pain of 15 years in prison. For governments that care a jot for liberty (let alone for the health of their communications-based economies), matters are more complicated. None of the abuses complained of can be stamped out without gross invasion of privacy, any more than people can be prevented from sending racist letters to each other in the ordinary mail or making obscene telephone calls or from pirating home videos. But all can be discouraged more vigorously than most countries have yet done. Governments need to force Internet service providers, many of which will in future be big telephone companies, to take responsibility for what they knowingly carry on their sites. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Internet will always allow the really determined user access to unpleasant or illegal material. The telephone does the same. The important thing is that governments should not treat the Internet differently from other communications media, merely because it is new. The faster the Net grows up, the easier it will be to follow that rule.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?845683200,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="ld4398.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&copy; Copyright</a>1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<h2>Kremlin intrigue</h2>
<p>Boris Yeltsin sacked his troublesome national-security adviser, <b>Alexander Lebed</b>, after renewed feuding between Mr Lebed and the interior minister, Anatoly Kulikov. Mr Kulikov had accused Mr Lebed, implausibly, of planning a "creeping coup". Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, apparently sided with Mr Kulikov.</p>
<p>A Kremlin doctor insisted a <b>heart bypass operation</b> on President Boris Yeltsin would go ahead in mid-November.</p>
<p>The British government proposed banning all large-calibre <b>handguns</b> in response to the Dunblane massacre last March, in which a gunman shot dead 16 children and a teacher. If implemented, the rule would be among the toughest in the world.</p>
<p><b>Far-right parties</b> fared well. In Austria's first election to the European Parliament, the Freedom movement did almost as well as the Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party. In France, a Communist and a candidate for the far-right National Front trounced the mainstream candidate in the first round of a by-election for a National Assembly seat near Marseilles.</p>
<p><b>Finland</b>, a member of the European Union for 22 months, joined its exchange-rate mechanism. Italy is still striving to re-enter.</p>
<p>A <b>one-day strike </b>in France protesting the government's austerity measures brought flights and trains to a halt and closed schools and public services.</p>
<p>Belgium's highest court removed Jean-Marc Connerotte as the judge presiding over the investigation into a <b>paedophile gang</b>, which has been accused of murdering four girls, after he attended a dinner with the victims' families. Those who saw him as the most energetic investigator in the case were outraged.</p>
<p>Denmark strengthened border controls and suspended the right of <b>biker gangs</b> to assemble, in an effort to control a war between feuding Hell's Angels and Bandidos.</p>
<h2>Kiwi split</h2>
<p>Political parties in <b>New Zealand </b>manoeuvred for power after an inconclusive general election under a new proportional-representation system. Jim Bolger's right-of-centre National Party won 44 seats in the 120-seat parliament. Labour came second with 37 seats.</p>
<p>The Australian government was embarrassed by a <b>political scandal</b> over shares owned by ministers in companies affected by their decisions. Two junior ministers resigned but the new government appeared to weather the crisis.</p>
<p>Opponents of Indonesia's occupation of <b>East Timor </b> were given a boost when two Timorese, Bishop Carlos Belo and Jose Ramos-Horta, a spokesman for the opposition in exile, were awarded the Nobel peace prize.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>Representatives of Afghanistan's <b>Taliban </b>militia had peace talks with Abdul Rashid Dostam, controller of the only large area of the country not under Taliban control.</p>
<h2>A second round</h2>
<p>At the second <b>presidential debate </b>in San Diego, Bob Dole, the Republican, attacked Bill Clinton for his ethical lapses at every turn. Mr Clinton smiled through it. Instant polls showed that the audience thought Mr Clinton the winner. </p>
<p>The <font size=-1>FBI</font> said that <b>crime </b>in the United States had fallen to a ten-year low, with the rate of violent crime falling 4% in 1995 from the previous year, and with the murder rate falling by 8%.</p>
<p><b>Argentina</b>'s main opposition parties, the Radicals and Frepaso, held talks that could lead to an alliance in next year's congressional elections. In New York, the former economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, who plans to stand in those elections, publicly accused two past colleagues, the home minister and justice minister, of manipulating judges and state prosecutors. </p>
<p><b>Brazil</b>'s government announced a plan to slim the civil service and public-sector companies, improve tax-collection and increase privatisation sales. Total hoped-for gain next year: $6.4 billion. </p>
<p><b>Mexico</b>'s government, under pressure from the recent <font size=-1>PRI</font>-- ruling-party--congress, abandoned plans to privatise many petrochemical companies.</p>
<p>At least 79 people died in a crush at a <b>football stadium </b> in Guatemala city.</p>
<h2>Algeria refers</h2>
<p>President Zeroual of <b>Algeria</b> announced a referendum to amend the constitution, outlawing religious-based parties, for November 28th. The civil war went on: bomb attacks on markets, air strikes against the Islamist guerrillas. </p>
<p>With at least indirect Iranian assistance, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan swept back into <b>northern Iraq</b>, retaking Sulaymaniyah and other towns from the Kurdish Democratic Party. An American envoy is to try to arrange a truce.</p>
<p>A<b> </b>flurry of visits tried to put pressure on Israel's prime minister, <b>Binyamin Netanyahu</b>. King Hussein of Jordan piloted Yasser Arafat to Jericho, the king's first venture into Palestinian territory. Mr Arafat and Jordan's prime minister visited Egypt's President Mubarak. So did Israel's President Ezer Weizman. Israel's latest plan for Hebron got an angry rejection from Mr Arafat.</p>
<p>In <b>South Africa</b> General Magnus Malan and others accused of an apartheid-days massacre were acquitted.</p>
<p>A ministerial delegation from East African countries to discuss peace talks with <b>Burundi</b>'s Tutsi military leader, Pierre Buyoya, was cancelled after he reversed his decision to talk to Hutu rebels. </p>

<h2>Lift-off</h2>
<p>(See <a href="bw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>The French government recommended that <b>Thomson</b>, a state-owned electronics giant, should be transferred to the Lagard&egrave;re group, rather than Alcatel Alsthom, a rival French group. Lagard&egrave;re's Matra defence unit will fit neatly with Thomson's missile operations. As part of the deal, which should hasten consolidation in Europe's fragmented defence industry, the government will wipe out FFr11 billion ($2.1 billion) of Thomson's debts. And Lagard&egrave;re will sell the firm's <font size=-1>TV</font>-making arm to South Korea's Daewoo Electronics. </p>
<p>Those who thought demand for microchips was waning should think again. The third quarter net profit of <b>Intel</b>, the world's largest semiconductor company, rose 41%, to $1.3 billion. Its sales rose 23%, reaching a record $5.1 billion.</p>
<p>Two giant <b>Californian power companies </b>agreed to merge. Enova, the parent of San Diego Gas & Electric, and Pacific Enterprises, which owns Southern California Gas, a big producer of natural gas, will together have nearly 6m customers and a market capitalisation of $5.2 billion.</p>
<p>In a British deal that will create the world's largest trade exhibitions organiser, United News & Media won a battle for control of <b>Blenheim </b>by agreeing to pay &#163;593m ($939m) for the conference organiser. A week earlier a Dutch media group, <font size=-1>VNU</font>, had grabbed 15% of Blenheim, prompting United's bid.</p>
<p>Marjorie Scardino, the chief executive of The Economist Group, is to become the new boss of <b>Pearson</b>, a British media conglomerate that is under pressure to improve its performance. Pearson owns 50% of <i>The Economist</i>. </p>
<p><b>Philips</b>, Europe's biggest maker of electronic goods, said it will restructure its management following a profits warning that caused its share price to slide. Cor Boonstra, who took over as president of the Dutch group this month, is renowned for his cost-cutting skills.</p>
 
<p>What, no Big Mac? The first <b>McDonald's in India</b>--and the first beefless one anywhere in the world--opened in Delhi. In deference to India's Hindu population, mutton has replaced beef on the menu. By using all-Indian ingredients, the group hopes to avoid being criticised by opponents of foreign investment in the country.</p>
<h2>Costly crutches</h2>
<p>The thorny issue of <b>state aid </b> to former East Germany is likely to cause further controversy after the German government gave DM880m ($572m) of aid to two shipyards in the east. Another big East German firm, Sket, a heavy-engineering group, began bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>The World Trade Organisation is to set up a panel to look into an American complaint, which is supported by the European Union, that Japan deliberately keeps foreign products out of its <b>photofilm market</b>. But America blocked a request from the <font size=-1>EU</font> for a panel to discuss the United States' Helms-Burton law, which penalises firms doing business with Cuba. America claims that it is a political issue, not one for the <font size=-1>WTO</font>. </p>
<p>The price of <b>oil </b>is soaring. Brent blend rose above $25 a barrel for the first time since the Gulf war. </p>
<p><b>William Vickrey </b>of Columbia University, who only last week shared the Nobel prize for economics with James Mirrlees, died, apparently of a heart attack. He was 82.</p>
<h2>Running bulls</h2>
<p>(See <a href="bw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 6,000 for the first time, and other bourses around the world hit <b>record highs </b>too. Among them were London, Frankfurt, Hong Kong and Sydney.</p>
<p>All change at troubled Morgan Grenfell Asset Management, the fund-management bit of <b>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</b>, the investment banking arm of Germany's Deutsche Bank. Keith Percy, its chief executive, and three other directors are to leave the firm after an investigation into a unit-trust scandal unearthed serious management flaws. </p>
<p>Italy said that next month it will sell a 60% stake in <b>Banco di Napoli</b>, an ailing state bank that is being purged of its chronic debts.</p>
<h2>A mighty fine line</h2>
<p>Two of America's biggest <b>railways </b>are coming together to create a huge freight company and rail network. <font size=-1>CSX</font>, a transportation company, will pay $8.4 billion for Conrail, leaving only one other serious rival, Norfolk Southern, to the east of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>A federal court suspended a set of rules that determine how much America's <b>regional telephone companies</b> can charge any new competitors for access to their lines. Further legal battles over the issue could delay the start of local competition for as much as a year.</p>
<p>America's<b> big three car makers</b> nearly doubled their profits in the third quarter compared with the same period last year. General Motors beat expectations with a net profit of $1.3 billion; Chrysler declared a record profit of $680m; and Ford clocked up $686m. However, the latter's losses in Europe and South America grew.</p>
<p>Two British airlines, British Airways and Virgin Express, and a French consortium led by Nouvelles Fronti&egrave;res, a travel group and Corsair, a French regional airline, are wooing <b>Air Libert&eacute;</b>. They are all interested in the crippled regional airline's slots at Orly airport in Paris.</p>

<h1 align=center> A tale of two lobbies</h1>


<p><b>Why do two similar countries disagree so profoundly about guns?</b></p>
BRITAIN and America have a great deal in common, but in one way they are about to diverge sharply. America has the laxest gun-control regime in the developed world, and Britain is about to adopt what will be about the toughest. How has this happened?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The immediate cause, of course, was the massacre of 16 schoolchildren and a teacher at Dunblane in Scotland in March this year. The report of the inquiry into the massacre was published on October 16th. It recommended tighter controls on handguns, but the government has gone much further, announcing that it wants to ban most kinds outright. Small-calibre pistols would be allowed, but would have to be locked up at gun clubs, not kept at home. It is estimated that around 80% of the 250,000 handguns held legally in Britain would henceforth be outlawed. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But America has its massacres, too, and they have not had such consequences. Bill Clinton has made some slight headway on gun control by helping to enact one bill banning assault weapons and another imposing a waiting period on those wanting to buy handguns. But, to outsiders, America's gun regime remains astonishingly lax.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Britain, the government's instinct to do nothing much was trampled by public opinion. Even the <i>Sun</i>--the biggest circulation, furthest-right of the gutter tabloids, whose suspicion of government is as ample as the bosoms it puts on display--said "if the Tories fail today  the people will take their revenge." According to a recent opinion poll, Britons favour a ban on handguns by 81% to 15%; Americans oppose such a ban by around 60% to 40%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The difference in the gun-control argument in the two countries goes to the heart of the difference in their politics. Americans start from their constitution, and thus from questions about fundamental liberties. Britons, without a constitution to hang their principles on, argue pragmatically. There is much to be said for the American way; but the American passion for liberty means that unimportant freedoms sometimes blow up in their faces. Britons, in contrast, argue on the basis of outcomes, rather than principles. They do not like what the freedom to carry guns has done to America, where the murder rate is ten times higher than in Britain, and 70% of murders are carried out using firearms.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet most Americans, too, would like stricter gun laws. A Gallup poll last year found 62% wanting them tightened up, compared to 12% wanting them looser and 24% saying they should stay the same. The immovable object is the gun lobby. Britain has one too, but it is unlike America's. In Britain, shooting is associated with landowning; joining a good shoot is a big step up the social ladder in the shires. Such people (some of whom are in the cabinet) use shotguns, which have escaped the ban because farmers can reasonably argue that they need them to keep down vermin. Handguns are only good for killing people--which, for Americans who maintain that they need to protect themselves against each other and the government, is the point.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So Britain's gun-control lobby has won a victory that its American counterpart dares not dream of. Unfortunately, rather than celebrating, the victors are crying "no compromise" until a no-exceptions ban is announced. Pragmatism can be a virtue; blind emotion is no way to set policy.<br>

Now it may have to change. But how?</b></p>READ about the Internet, and thrill to the notion of a world wired at the speed of light, with all the information anyone could want just a mouse-click away. But actually use the cursed thing, and a more prosaic picture quickly emerges. Delay, break-downs and glacial transmissions are part of everyday Internet life. New users are amazed: surely this tepid data trickle is not the fabled "information superhighway"? Veterans shake their head wearily: the Internet has always been swamped, and as long at it doubles in size each year, it seems likely always to remain so.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;True? That question--whether the Internet can grow out of stumbling adolescence and become as delay-free and reliable as the telephone network--ultimately comes down to one of economics. Today's Internet works with a financial model that has hardly changed from the days, a decade ago, when the network was a non-commercial communications link for universities and research labs. Multi-million dollar networks still trade data on the barter principle, or the roughest approximations of real cost. Not surprisingly, these intersections between networks are usually where the traffic backs up (see <a href="sf1.gif">map</a>). <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bypassing these bottlenecks is not as easy as it might seem. The Internet is made up of many networks, operated by many different firms. Customers can pay a fortune for "industrial strength", rather than "student strength" service, but that service only lasts as far as the firm's network reaches. Sooner or later, Web surfers find themselves in some congested backwater, where no amount of money can make a swamped Web server serve: the Internet treats all transmissions alike, whatever their price.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No wonder, then, that more and more users are simply bypassing the public Internet. Companies are setting up private "intranets" within single locations and "extranets" with branches and partners. A group of American research universities plan to build "Internet II", dedicated to academic traffic and free of commercial users, much as the Internet itself was just a few years ago. This month, President Clinton promised to seek $500m over five years to help them.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Building a second Internet (and many smaller rivals) might seem an expensive alternative to simply eliminating the economic failings of the first. But the question of how--or whether--the Internet's economic model should be changed is difficult. One of the reasons the Internet has been able to grow so quickly is that its builder avoided the complex accounting and time-and-distance charging of the telephone networks. Yet now that the Internet is carrying as much traffic as the voice networks over some routes, some charging by use is already taking place (when traffic was not so heavy, the approximations of flat-fee charges and bartering were good enough; now they can be expensive mistakes). <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So which model is best? Or, more fundamentally, what should it cost to communicate? At present, the answer depends on how you do it. Pick up the telephone, and you pay by the mile and the minute. Send a message across the Internet to the same destination (or use special software to make an Internet telephone call) and--even though the message will travel across the same lines--you pay, at most, the price of a local telephone call.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In part the cheapness is because the Internet sends messages more efficiently than local telephone network<b>s</b>: it breaks them down into small digital "packets" that can then be slotted in with other packets travelling over the same network. By contrast, a telephone call requires a whole electronic circuit to itself for the duration of the call. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But in long distance and international transmissions, the technology is similar: both voice and data are sent as a digital stream along fibre-optic cable. Indeed, nearly all of the Internet runs along lines leased from the telephone companies.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both telephone companies and the myriad firms that run the Internet therefore have a similar pattern of costs: their big expense comes in installing switches (or "routers") and providing lines. The cost of carrying one extra item is as near to zero as makes no difference--"too cheap to meter", as some would have it.  <b><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</b> But if the costs of the telephone companies and the Internet are similar, why are their methods of pricing different? The answer is that telecoms charges bear little relation to costs. The telephone industry is regulated nearly everywhere and in most countries prices are set by bureaucrats and commissions; real costs are hidden by a layer of cross subsidies. The Internet, on the other hand, is essentially unregulated.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</b> At present, telephone companies typically make less than half their revenue from fixed charges rather than from the price of each call. Tim Kelly, of the International Telecommunication Union in Geneva, reckons that the share of revenue from connection charges and monthly rentals has risen in the past decade from about 33% to 40%; he expects an increase to around 60% over the next ten years.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The companies are not keen on such "rebalancing", since it usually involves reducing lucrative call charges rather than increasing fixed charges. But without it, they are vulnerable to competition, including competition from the Internet, which can offer rival services far less expensively.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The competition, however, may have its silver lining: the Internet encourages telephone use, and in most countries this is charged by the second for local calls--including the ones, sometimes lasting for hours, made by the net-surfers. Add to that the income from installing extra lines, ordered by a surfer's frustrated relations in their desire to make ordinary telephone calls. Add lastly the prospect that the telephone companies will start offering services in competition with the Internet-- once the Internet has tested the prices consumers are willing to pay.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What seems reasonably certain, however, is that the impact of the Internet and the spreading deregulation of the telecoms industry will bring prices closer to real costs. The telephone companies will have the biggest pricing adjustment to make<b>. </b>But the Internet too may have to change--perhaps by moving closer to the method of the telephone companies, namely a mix of fixed tariffs and ones based on usage. Economists such as Hal Varian, from the University of California at Berkeley, and Jeff Mackie-Mason, of Michigan University, fret that the present structure of Internet pricing does not reflect its "social costs". <br></p><p><b>World Wide Wait</b><br>Those are not, as you might think, the conversation-deadening impact of hours spent surfing, but the congestion that periodically occurs on the network. My Internet video call may hold up your electronic mail, imposing a cost on you that I do not notice. Use-based pricing, they argue, is essential to encourage the rational allocation of scarce transmission capacity.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The dangers of congestion have undoubtedly increased in the past year or two, as the Internet has moved from being a government-financed playground for academics to a cornucopia of entertainment, commerce and information. As a result the use of the Internet is growing faster than the number of subscribers: traffic through one of the main connection points has been doubling every six months, says Tony Rutkowski, once head of the Internet Society and now with General Magic, a software firm, while the number of subscribers is doubling only every year.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, the Internet is no longer being used almost exclusively to send text. Instead, thanks partly to the development of the World Wide Web, people can listen to music, make telephone calls and look at film clips. These uses, which are the ones growing most quickly, gobble up far more capacity than text: to send 15 seconds of high quality video munches as much bandwidth as the text of a 700-page book.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A second change means that the costs of congestion are becoming higher. It may not matter if some parts of an electronic letter take a second or two longer than the others to reach their destination. But more and more of the material sent over the Internet needs to arrive immediately to be effective. If some of the bits that make up a video call or a telephone conversation are held up en route, the results are jerky and garbled.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Do these congestion-driven arguments imply the need for new settlement mechanisms? In the case of telephone companies, a system exists so that the company with which a call starts--which bills the caller-- can hand some of the proceeds to the company through which the call ends. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such settlements are a source of endless argument: America's long-distance carriers complain that local telephone companies overcharge them. Moreover, they transfer huge sums of money between countries: in 1994, carriers based in the United States handed over a net $4.3 billion to foreign carriers. Because countries in which telephoning is cheap (such as America) tend to ring countries where calls are dearer, American carriers grumble that they are subsidising the inefficient and uncompetitive. Gradually, therefore, telephone companies are moving towards a "sender-keeps-all" system, where they will charge each other a flat fee for access to a certain amount of transmission capacity, rather than bill each other on the basis of use.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That would bring them increasingly into line with what happens on the Internet, where settlement is rudimentary. There are payments between each of the Internet's hierarchy of links: access providers pay their regional network and regional networks pay the companies that operate the high-capacity long-distance parts, the backbone of the system. But such payments are mostly based on the availability of capacity, not its use: service providers simply agree to carry each other's traffic without totting up precise bills.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This encourages a "hot-potato" approach: Internet access providers hand traffic on as quickly as possible to the carrier taking it to its ultimate destination. That benefits small service providers and irritates big ones, who say they get little reward for the effort of carrying the traffic for most of its journey. In turn, this lessens their incentive to invest in new capacity. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The problem of settlement is worse for access providers outside America. Led by Singapore Telecom and Australia's Telstra, they complain that they have to pay all the cost of leasing lines between their country and the United States. "The rest of the planet subsidises the United States," argues Barry Greene, who works for Cisco, a maker of routers, but was previously with Singnet, the Internet arm of Singapore Telecom. The high cost of leasing international lines means that upgrading them to ease congestion can cost a non-American company ten times more than in America.<br></p><p><b>Free lunches all round</b><br>Economists, famously sceptical about free lunches, have thought up various ingenious schemes to charge Internet users in ways that more accurately reflect costs. Several versions will appear in a forthcoming tome on Internet Economics, edited by Lee McKnight and Joseph Bailey of <font size=-1>MIT</font>. The main suggestion is to attach to messages some indication of their priority (high for a film clip, low for an e-mail message and so on). Users might pay in advance for high priority traffic; or their payments might vary with the level of congestion. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The means for such fancy solutions will increasingly become available. A new protocol, or standard, called <font size=-1>RSVP</font> will soon allow people to specify the quality of service they want and, in theory, to be billed for it. Asynchronous transfer mode, or <font size=-1>ATM</font>, a technology that breaks the Internet's many sorts of digital signals into packets of a standard size, will allow a reliable quality of service and make it easier to keep accounts, if it ever becomes widely used. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Undoubtedly, charges would have an effect on the way the Internet is used. A study of "Information Infrastructure Convergence and Pricing: The Internet" by the <font size=-1>OECD</font>, published in June, showed that Internet access was far greater in competitive telecommunications markets than in uncompetitive ones. The reason is almost certainly that the average price for leased lines in countries with monopolies was 44% higher than in competitive ones (see <a href="sf2.gif">chart</a>). There was also a close correlation between Internet use and the structure of local call charges: surfing for hours is free or almost free in the United States and Canada, but most <font size=-1>OECD</font> countries charge local callers for the time they spend on the line. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fearful that use-based pricing would be a dampener, many Internet aficionados cross their fingers that the Internet can muddle on with its present, mostly flat-fee structure. After all, the capacity of the Internet's backbone has increased more than 10,000 times in the past decade; and that has been financed by the enormous increase in the number of subscribers. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition, various technical solutions have emerged to slow the growth in traffic, such as the practice of "caching": storing material that one person has looked at close to the point of use, so that the next user need not go all the way to the original site to look at it.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Flat-raters point also to the low cost of a flat-rate sender-keeps-all system. After all, for some telecoms companies to bill a customer for a call costs more than to transmit it. Moreover, the present system suits the idiosyncracies of the Internet. Each message may hop across a dozen different carriers. Should each be paid something? And the person who initiates an Internet "conversation" may send out a tiny message and receive a huge one. How should the costs be divided? <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One way or another, as the Internet expands in both content and usage, a change is surely inevitable. Some of the larger telecoms carriers, such as <font size=-1>BT</font>/<font size=-1>MCI</font>, are building parallel global Internets of their own on which customers, for a premium payment, will be guaranteed a more reliable service than the public Internet can now offer. They will, says Barbara Dooley, managing editor of <i>CIXtra</i>, a newsletter, have an incentive to carry customers' traffic for as much of the way as possible, to keep control of the quality of service. Once they carry traffic around the world, they will have little incentive to make settlement payments; they will probably agree to accept a certain volume of traffic from each other free.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And what of the public Internet? Its users will face a choice. If they want to surf for free, they will have to put up with the occasional congestion. This will be partly self regulating: if too many people try to hold video conferences with their children, the quality will become so awful that the youngsters will give up in disgust and congestion will lessen. The wonderful thing about the Internet is that it still reflects what its users want, not what some large telecommunications company believes they ought to have.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?845683200,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="sf0775.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&copy; Copyright</a>1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>Hang on</h1>

BOB METCALFE, one of the inventors of computer networking, predicted this spring that the Internet would grind to a halt this year. And as if to prove the point, a few months later America Online and Netcom, two of America's biggest Internet providers, went down for a day each, cutting off more than 6m subscribers. Pundits saw it as an omen of greater blackouts to come. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The geeks who keep the Internet running disagree. After all, most data show that the Internet is actually getting faster. Local failures are inevitable, but the Internet has so far been surprisingly resilient.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Skeptics worry that this cannot last. Not only is the number of users--already an estimated 40m-50m--doubling every year, but because of the increased use of pictures and sound (which use a lot more capacity than simple text), traffic per user is growing even faster (see <a href="sf2.gif">chart</a>). <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where this causes congestion is not along the Internet's highways, but at their intersections, where "routers" direct data towards their destination. Here the Internet's health boils down to a conflict between two laws: one coined by Mr Metcalfe himself, and one by a microchip guru, Intel's Gordon Moore.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Metcalfe's law states that the value of a network increases by the square of its users. This means that each new user tends to add more traffic than the one before, because the more people who are on the Internet, the more popular it becomes as a channel of communications. Moore's law is that computer chips double in speed every 18 months--and routers are just specialised computers. Since Internet traffic is growing three times faster, the trends seem set to collide. How can the routers keep up?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Three ways. The first is to share the load: network operators can increase the number of routers and connections, like adding more lanes to a highway instead of simply raising its speed limit. The second is to simplify their job, by tagging each data packet with what amounts to a short postal code rather than an entire street address. Finally, tomorrow's routers will be able to distinguish between data types, sending video down fast lanes and e-mail down slow ones. Anyway, there are only so many people in the world: the rush to surf will eventually slow.<br>

<h1>The last living liberal</h1>

<font size=1>ST PAUL, MINNESOTA</font><p>
NOBODY campaigns quite like Paul Wellstone. One moment he waves his arms before a crowd of students, urging them to embrace direct action ("Turn the heat up. Nothing will happen unless you keep pushing."). The next moment he drops to the floor to autograph a Wellstone placard affixed to a cleaner's trolley. Then he bounds into a daycare centre, and shares five minutes of empassioned concern with one of the teachers. Standing amidst a gaggle of toddlers would be photo-opportunity enough for any ordinary man. But Mr Wellstone seizes two children by the hands and marches them out into the autumn sunshine to see his rickety campaign bus. The cameras are practically singing.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Wellstone may be about to achieve something quite remarkable. In elections all across America, being "liberal" is supposedly the kiss of death. In Minnesota, however, this firm believer in an activist state is ahead in his race for re-election to the Senate. In elections around the country, attack ads are thought to work. But Republican attacks on Mr Wellstone seem to be backfiring. All across America, too, politics has become a professional domain, ruled over by pollsters, admen and demographers. But Mr Wellstone rebels against this, urging his audiences to "get out there and hold people accountable."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1990, when Mr Wellstone won his first Senate race, many thought him merely lucky. That year, the Minnesota Republicans were divided; a sex scandal had felled their gubernatorial candidate. Rudy Boschwitz, the incumbent senator, was kept from campaigning by a budget row that pinned him down in Washington. When he came home, he made various gaffes. Mr Wellstone's statism did not win, the argument goes; rather, the Republicans imploded.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This year a Wellstone victory would not be so easily dismissed. The Republicans are united; and Mr Boschwitz, who is trying to recapture his old seat, has no distractions from campaigning. On October 14th he lavished a whole day on the sparsely-populated south-west. He hopped between tiny towns in an eight-seater aircraft, spoke from podiums fashioned from hay-bales, and walked down empty shopping streets in search of unsuspecting voters.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Boschwitz is a twinkly-eyed sort, a grandad who runs 100 miles each month, a job-creating entrepreneur who arrived in America 60 years ago with nothing. In short, he is the ideal Republican candidate. His stump speech exudes the optimism that serves his party well. At each stop he celebrates local heroes--a man in a wheelchair who runs a farm, a team of volunteer firemen--and declares that the spirit of ordinary folk can do more to solve America's woes than Mr Wellstone's state activism. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For his televised campaign, Mr Boschwitz has hired Arthur Finkelstein, the ace of Republican air wars. The result is a binge of attack ads, sugared with some humour. In one, a 1960s professor inducts Mr Wellstone into the "liberal hall of fame", to the applause of doped drop-outs holding placards calling for more taxes. In another, a Wellstone cartoon waves a flash-card marked "liberal" up and down with comically inhuman energy. Six years ago, Mr Wellstone had the better television campaign. This time the Boschwitz ads are the more memorable.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Faced with this sort of opposition, Mr Wellstone ought to be in trouble. His views are unfashionable, to say the least. He was the only senator facing re-election who voted against welfare reform; he opposed the Gulf war; he wants the rich to pay higher taxes; his campaign bus is plastered with stickers advertising his ties to the dwindling trade unions. Yet Mr Wellstone is doing fine. The latest poll gives him a nine-point lead over Mr Boschwitz.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What to make of this surprise? It may be that Mr Wellstone's views, though out of keeping with America's as a whole, match Minnesota nicely. The state was too far north, its winters too bitterly cold, to attract normal Yankees as they moved west in the 19th century. Instead, Scandinavians and Germans settled its flat land, and they seem to have brought with them social-democratic tendencies. Minnesota's taxes are high, its schools and social services better than average. The state practises an industrial policy of which Europeans would be proud, pouring $840m into Northwest Airlines in 1991 in order to keep its hub in Minneapolis. Minnesotans cheerfully call their state the Sweden of America.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Out on the stump, Mr Wellstone plays up this idea of Minnesotan exceptionalism. "I feel blessed to be a senator from Minnesota," he roars, explaining that the people of the state are too decent to fall for the Republicans' sink-or-swim individualism. The attack ads have backfired, he suggests, because Minnesotans are sensible and nice. Indeed, "Minnesota Nice" is a phenomenon much discussed in the state: people are honest, uncorrupt, and slow to insult anyone; if you dial the wrong number, the person on the end of the line may volunteer to find the right one for you.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In truth, this Nordic niceness--rooted in solid farm communities, celebrated by Garrison Keillor in his stories about Lake Wobegon--is fading. Minnesotans have left the land for suburban homes, and they have succumbed to the same suspicions of welfare cheats and inner-city crime that have spawned Republicans all across America. Apart from Lake Wobegon, Minnesota's best known contribution to culture may be the country's biggest shopping centre. Every year, 40m visitors flock to the Mall of America outside Minneapolis. For many of them, the last contact with the farm values of old is the autumn apple festival in the mall's rotunda.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The old Democratic dominance of Minnesota has faded too, making it hard to pin Mr Wellstone's strength on the state's supposed peculiarities. There is a Republican governor, and in 1994 the Senate race was won by Rod Grams, an unimpressive and exceedingly right-wing newscaster. Besides, many Minnesota Democrats are not "liberal" in the Wellstone sense. The party is strongest of all in the far-northern Mesabi Iron Range, where miners and farmers tend to oppose gun control, legalised abortion and environmental rules--all of which are proud Wellstone causes.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So, if Mr Wellstone does win, some conventional wisdom will have to be discarded. It will not do to argue that his opponent was weak, or that Minnesota is exceptional. Instead, it will have to be accepted that "liberals" can win, especially if they emphasise Americans' economic insecurities in places where these are strong. Over the past month, Bob Dole has tried to hurt Bill Clinton by branding him with the <font size=-1>L</font>-word. Four years from now, the next Republican presidential candidate may have to try a different strategy.<br>

He pounced on the very first question in Wednesday's presidential debate in San Diego to engage in his latest campaign tactic: attacking the ethics of the Clinton administration. He talked about "scandals almost on a daily basis", about the improper gathering of <font size=-1>FBI</font> files, about possible presidential pardons. Later, he must have baffled millions of Americans by talking about "contributions coming in from Indonesia", an oblique reference to the <i>scandale du jour. </i>Perhaps he would have attacked more had the questions from the audience given him more openings. But the audience was interested in policy matters. And at the end of the debate the instant polls, for what they are worth, declared Mr Clinton the clear winner.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The new Dole strategy amounts to an admission of failure, the failure of any other approach to make an impact on what has remained an extraordinarily static race. Mr Dole's inability to sell his 15% tax cut is merely the most conspicuous example. So many moments that were supposed to mark decisive turning-points--the decision to quit the Senate, the choice of Jack Kemp as running mate, the Republican convention, the arrival of federal funds to pay for advertising, the first presidential debate in Hartford--have all come and gone with scarcely a blip in the polls. After countless bumpy trips on the Citizen's Ship and umpteen rallies in front of polite crowds, the excitement level surrounding the Dole campaign still fails to register on the political Richter scale. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So Mr Clinton remains what he has been all year: the top dog, sitting pretty. Mr Dole is the hapless underdog, now reduced to growling menacingly and baring his teeth. What has Mr Dole done wrong?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Just about everything, it would seem. Certainly, he has not helped his cause by his constant ditherings and changes of tactics. The decision, after a week of public wavering, to attack on the "character issue" is the latest <font size=-1>U</font>-turn among many, stretching back to the primaries. Mr Dole allowed himself to be tugged this way and that over Pat Buchanan's challenge and over the issue of abortion. By coming out against affirmative action he belied his own record on racial policy, and by embracing supply-side economics he jeopardised his hard-earned reputation for fiscal conservatism. All this from a man who touts his "leadership" qualities.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He has seemed uncertain how hard to push his tax plan, how vigorously to compete in California, how to express what this election is "all about". If so much indecision was not bad enough, he has too often been painfully inarticulate. Oh yes, and he is also old, falls over and blinks too much. His bid for the White House is widely seen as a close competitor to the 1988 Dukakis effort for the title of the worst presidential campaign of modern times.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton's campaign, by contrast, is one of the best. The president set his course long ago, and has stuck to it. The plan was to avoid a primary challenge, raise lots of money early, use this financial fire-power over the spring and summer to help consolidate a commanding lead over an opponent bumping against his federal spending limits, and then, after the party conventions, run a "holding operation" to stay on top. That is exactly what has happened.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton has also used the office of the presidency to maximum effect, making news and staging made-for-television signing ceremonies. Seemingly prepared for everything, the Clinton campaign's rapid-response effort has even given a new word to the English language: "prebuttal". Remarkably, a White House once notorious for indiscipline has been operating with military efficiency. Reporters have waited in vain for gaffes, flip-flops and snafus. The big exception was the resignation of Dick Morris, the president's strategic guru, over his dalliance with a prostitute. But the bimbo eruption was Mr Morris's, not Mr Clinton's, and by then the Morris strategy had worked its magic. Mr Clinton had neutralised "Republican" issues, from welfare to crime and foreign policy, making him a maddeningly difficult target for Mr Dole to attack. It remained only for Mr Clinton to go out and delight the crowds with his proven brilliance on the campaign trail.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And yet when all is said and done (which, thank goodness, it very nearly is), the contrasting aptitudes of the two campaigns may be less important than they now seem. More fundamental forces are really deciding the contest. Two forces, to be precise, each working in opposite directions.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One, in Mr Dole's favour, is that the country is broadly in a conservative mood. Mr Clinton (with Mr Morris's help) drew the lesson from the 1994 election. He has positioned himself as a conservative on matters of budgets and values--so successfully that Mr Dole is reduced to accusing him of being a stealth liberal. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The other force, this time helping Mr Clinton, is the health of the economy. Incumbent presidents are hard to beat if the economy is growing strongly, as it has been, with low unemployment and little inflation. The national angst over jobs and living standards, much exaggerated by media hype, seems to have abated (even though a recent poll in the <i>Washington Post</i> showed that a large number of Americans believe the unemployment rate to be more than 20%). These are no longer receptive times for a bold new economic plan, such as Mr Dole's 15% tax cut.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Dole can still hope that the political winds will in the end work in his favour, just as they did (despite his dreadful campaigning) in the primaries. They should at least tighten the race in the final three weeks; Dole people say they are already seeing such movement in states across the country. But luck, in the shape of the economic cycle, strongly favours Mr Clinton. Beyond the excitements over presidential debates, campaigning prowess and strategic decisions, it is these fundamentals that will determine who has the last bark.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br></td></tr></table><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?845683200,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="br7538.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&copy; Copyright</a>1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<p><b>Broadcasting</b></p>
<h1>Cheap</h1>

THERE is a good case to be made for privatising Channel 4 television. It is, some say, absurd and illiberal that the state should own three out of four terrestrial television channels. Others maintain that the state should not own television channels at all. Against the privatisers, supporters of Channel 4's current status maintain that its rich diversity would not survive in the commercial world.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, there is also a bad case for privatising Channel 4, and that is the one that the government is currently considering: that the sale could raise money for electoral bribes. Behind that lies an even worse argument: that, by offsetting the proceeds of the proposed sale against its public-spending plans to be published next month, the Tories could plant a time-bomb for a Labour government, which would not sell the channel. John Major is considering the proposal, which is backed by Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, but opposed by Virginia Bottomley, the heritage secretary. Mr Major should have no truck with such specious economic reasoning.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Channel 4 is not subsidised, but estimates of how much it would fetch vary hugely. If, at one extreme, it was given a remit to produce the unpopular minority-interest programmes that constitute much of its present output, it might raise only &#163;200m. Remit-free it might be worth as much as &#163;2 billion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if the government decided now to sell it, this could not pay for tax cuts next year because of the legislative timetable. Some Tory backbenchers, including Nicholas Winterton and Sir Tim Renton, are passionately opposed to a sale on cultural grounds. Even if they were persuaded, the government would find it hard to push through an act of parliament before the general election, which cannot be delayed beyond May. Privatisation is thus unlikely to figure in the Queen's speech on October 23rd which will set out this Parliament's legislative programme. And even if it were legislated straight after the election, the bill would not become law in time to allow a sale in 1997-98.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, Mr Clarke could announce the government's intention to legislate next year as part of his spending plans in his budget on November 26th, with the actual sale scheduled for 1998-99. Under existing public spending rules he would then be entitled to score the proceeds in his plans for 1998-99, allowing him to project lower borrowing in that year--and perhaps lower taxes as a result.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That would pose a problem for Labour, whose heritage spokesman, Jack Cunningham, is passionately against a sale. If Labour won, and the sale was ditched, a Labour government would have to find more revenue or spend less elsewhere. With the outlook for public finances already tight, neither option is attractive.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, it is bad economics to use financial receipts from the sale of state assets to pay for current spending or tax cuts. Such receipts do reduce the public sector borrowing requirement but they do not reduce the state's long-term claim on national resources. As for the politics, Mr Clarke's device is transparently sleazy. The government's proper course, if it decides that privatisation is right, would be to leave the sale out of its budget spending plans; to put a proposal for selling Channel 4 in its manifesto; and only if it is re-elected to take account of the proceeds in drawing up its future budgetary plans.<br>

<p><b>Taxation</b></p>
<h1>VAT's the problem</h1>

THIS year's budget will be knocked into shape on October 18th, when Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, and Treasury officials gather at Dorneywood, the chancellor's country pad. This meeting would be a calmer affair were it not for a huge and mysterious hole in the government's tax revenues. This has resulted in a far bigger public-sector borrowing requirement (<font size=-1>PSBR</font>) than is desirable so far into the economic cycle. New data on October 16th put the <font size=-1>PSBR</font> at &#163;3.4 billion in September, and total borrowing for the first half of this financial year at &#163;16.1 billion--making it extremely difficult for Mr Clarke to cut much off the income-tax rate in the budget on November 26th. What has gone wrong?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Value-added tax (<font size=-1>VAT</font>) is mostly to blame. <font size=-1>VAT</font>, levied on goods and services, contributes almost one-third of total tax revenues, a larger slice than in other big economies (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>). Yet in 1995-96, the &#163;43 billion of <font size=-1>VAT</font> collected was a hefty &#163;5 billion less than forecast in the November 1994 budget. That money could have paid for a cut of almost two pence from the basic rate of income tax. Although <font size=-1>VAT</font> revenues are in line with forecasts so far this financial year, that is because these forecasts already assume disappointing <font size=-1>VAT</font> revenues.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not all of 1995-96's missing &#163;5 billion is inexplicable. The 1994 budget assumed much faster <font size=-1>GDP</font> growth than there turned out to be. Had the Treasury plugged into its forecasting model the amount of growth that actually took place, it would have expected to collect some &#163;2 billion less in <font size=-1>VAT</font>, calculates Chris Giles, an economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research group. But nobody has yet worked out what happened to the remaining &#163;3 billion shortfall, says Mr Giles. A working party set up earlier this year is examining the more plausible theories, and will report to the chancellor soon. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One possibility is that consumers have been spending more heavily on "zero rated" goods than the Treasury expected. Britain has a standard rate of <font size=-1>VAT</font> of 17.5%-- above average for developed countries-- but levies a reduced rate of 8% on domestic fuel, and exempts some goods and services, because they are, ostensibly, necessities. This is no small beer: making zero-rated purchases subject to the standard rate of <font size=-1>VAT</font> would have raised around &#163;15 billion in 1995-96. One reason why spending might have been skewed more towards zero-rated purchases is the launch of the National Lottery--but its impact could only have been tiny, and then only if the money spent on tickets would otherwise have gone on <font size=-1>VAT</font>-able buys.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tax avoidance (legal) and evasion (illegal) are likelier culprits. Britain's "<font size=-1>VAT</font> productivity"--the additional revenue raised by each extra percentage point of the tax rate--has fallen steadily since 1989, suggesting that the increase in the rate to 17.5% has encouraged greater effort to cut tax bills.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Kent Matthews, an economist at Cardiff Business School, reckons that increases in the threshold at which firms start to pay the tax have encouraged innovative ways to cut bills, such as hairdressing salons "renting" chairs to individual cutters, who become self-employed workers earning less than the <font size=-1>VAT</font> threshold. He recently analysed <font size=-1>VAT</font> payment in several industries and compared this with estimated potential <font size=-1>VAT</font> revenues, concluding that revenues in the various sectors were between 30% and 100% lower than they should have been. In restaurants and hairdressing, in particular, the gap between actual and potential <font size=-1>VAT</font> was big and, since 1992, growing.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The small firms that dominate these sectors may not be the only problem, however. The smallest 70% of traders pay only 10% of total <font size=-1>VAT</font> revenues; 75% of the tax-take is culled from fewer than 2,000 big firms. So for &#163;3 billion to go missing, the chances are that those big firms are up to something. That is less likely to be evasion than honest, above-board tax avoidance. According to a senior Treasury official, the number of <font size=-1>VAT</font> experts employed by accounting firms and big <font size=-1>VAT</font> payers has recently risen sharply.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What can be done? Customs and Excise, which collects <font size=-1>VAT</font>, might try harder, perhaps, although it already has a fearsome reputation. Another option is to extend the coverage of <font size=-1>VAT</font> to zero-rated goods and (<font size=-1>EU</font> rules permitting) lower the rate. Dave, a London builder who helps customers avoid <font size=-1>VAT</font> by working for cash, points out that demand for this service has grown as the <font size=-1>VAT</font> rate has risen, whereas "the lower the rate, the less people will try not to pay it." Take note, Mr Clarke.<br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>Sterling efforts</h1>

THE pound rose this week to its highest level since 1994. Its trade-weighted exchange-rate (its exchange rate with the currencies of its trading partners, weighted by Britain's trade in each currency) is 6.1% up so far this year. It fell by a similar amount during 1995 (see <a href="br2.gif">chart</a>). Arguably, sterling's strength is now the only excuse that Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, has left for not raising interest rates--but it is not a good excuse.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Recent economic data have confirmed that the economy is growing fast and inflationary pressures increasing. An interest-rate rise is needed. The underlying rate of inflation (which excludes mortgage-interest payments) edged up to an annual rate of 2.9% in September. The government's target is 2.5% or less. The jobless total fell by an unexpectedly large 35,600 in September, to 7.4% of the workforce. Vacancies soared by 16,600, the biggest monthly increase in 16 years. The labour market is as tight as in 1988, a fact reflected in rising wage inflation: underlying average earnings grew by 4% in the year to August.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But sterling's recent strength complicates matters. As the pound rises, the cost of imports falls. In the year to August 1995, when sterling's trade-weighted value was low, import prices rose by 11%. They fell by 0.8% in the 12 months to July of this year. Exchange-rate movements take time to work through. According to Martin Brookes, an economist at Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, sterling's fall during 1995 added one percentage point to the inflation rate in the middle of this year. This year's stronger pound should ease inflationary pressures over the coming months.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although it may not do so by enough to overcome the building inflationary pressure elsewhere in the economy, might Mr Clarke use the possibility of a sterling boost to delay an interest-rate rise? It would be a gamble. The likeliest reason for sterling's recent rise is that the financial markets think that British interest rates will soon rise. If they do not, sterling might tumble again, adding to inflation instead of curbing it.<br>

<p><b>Welfare</b></p>
<h1>Fertile Field</h1>

PROMISING not to raise taxes may be a prerequisite to getting elected in the 1990s, but it imposes tiresome constraints on politicians once in office: they can borrow, break promises, or, worst of all, have no extra money to spend on pet projects. Or so it seemed. Now a fourth option is at hand, thanks to Frank Field, a Labour <font size=-1>MP</font> who chairs the House of Commons Select Committee on Social Security: impose new taxes, but call them something else.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Field unveiled this idea--which may not be as daft as it seems--in "How to Pay for the Future: Building a Stakeholders' Welfare", published on October 16th. He aims, commendably, to set out a blueprint for reforming the welfare state in ways that reduce incentives to milk the system and care better for the truly needy.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His plans include funding only half of the National Health Service from general taxes. Thus, income tax could be cut--the lower rate from 20% to 5% and the basic rate from 24% to 19%. To pay for the other half of the <font size=-1>NHS</font>, Mr Field would raise the rate of national-insurance contributions by seven percentage points. People would stop paying into the state earnings-related pension scheme (<font size=-1>SERPS</font>), but would be compelled to pay 16% of their income into a non-state pension scheme. Existing <font size=-1>SERPS</font> pensions would still be paid, but the scheme would no longer be able to use fresh contributions to pay them. To raise the cash, Mr Field would issue bonds--ie, borrow it. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It would be easy to dismiss this as fiscal casuistry, designed to obscure the true costs of welfare reform. But Mr Field is a serious thinker, much respected, who makes no bones about better welfare costing. He believes that the main reason people dislike paying tax is that they have no sense of ownership over the money once it disappears into the public purse. But call it national insurance or a compulsory pension contribution, and perhaps even give people individual welfare accounts, and they will see where their money goes and how they benefit from it, and so be willing to pay more. If Labour forms the next government, there is a fair chance that Tony Blair, a big fan of Mr Field's ideas, would see how this one works in practice. New Labour, new compulsory contributions?<br>

Perhaps the chance of peace in Northern Ireland boosted passenger and car traffic; but the booming Irish economy is also responsible. Freight and passenger volumes have both doubled over the past ten years (see <a href="br3.gif">map</a>).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Shipping firms have prospered from this swelling trade, and so too have port companies. But part of the ports' rising income has come from <font size=-1>EU</font> subsidies. Since 1989 it has poured more than &#163;100m into developing Irish Sea ports.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The main effects of these subsidies, which are intended to improve trading links between countries at the edge of the <font size=-1>EU</font>, are to fatten the companies' profits and to distort competition. Some ports do not qualify for subsidies and have complained to the European Commission that they are facing unfair competition. And although subsidies are not supposed to be spent on ships, some of the subsidised ports also own ferry companies, and some ferry firms own ports.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On either side of the short crossing between Ulster and Scotland, about &#163;80m (including a &#163;53m <font size=-1>EU</font> subsidy) will have been spent at Belfast and Larne by 1999, and about &#163;20m (including a &#163;3m <font size=-1>EU</font> subsidy) at Stranraer and Cairnryan. Some of this is to help ferry firms build terminals for a new breed of high-speed freight and passenger-carrying ships.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Stena, a Swedish shipping firm which reckons it carries 64% of Irish Sea passengers, has spent &#163;130m on two huge catamaran ferries each capable of doing 40 knots (74km per hour), twice the speed of conventional ferries. While passengers have poured on to the ships since they began sailings this year, rivals are less happy that Stena owns two of the British ports they sail from--Stranraer and Holyhead--and is getting a subsidy of about 15% towards the &#163;63m cost of terminals for the new ferries at both ports.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The European Commission became aware of these concerns when Stena and two of the other companies sailing from Stranraer and nearby Cairnryan, Sea Containers and <font size=-1>P&O</font>, all sought cash for new terminals. The commission and the Scottish Office gave up trying to work out which bits of the projects were for public benefit and which were for private gain, and simply shared the subsidy out at a lower rate than the companies asked for.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This approach, however, does not deal with the complaint by Sea Containers that Heysham, a Lancashire port it owns, is in an area which does not qualify for <font size=-1>EU</font> regional aid, while rivals like Mersey Docks & Harbour Company (<font size=-1>MDHC</font>) can get <font size=-1>EU</font> money. Since 1988, Sea Containers has spent &#163;10m on Heysham, roughly the same amount that Mersey Docks has received in <font size=-1>EU</font> subsidies.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fortunately for Sea Containers, however, it looks as though its fears that <font size=-1>MDHC</font> could get an unfair advantage may not materialise because of a battle for control of docks on the Mersey. On the Birkenhead side of the river, Merseyside Development Corporation has put together a scheme for a freight terminal with Forth Ports of Edinburgh. Forth Ports says it cannot go ahead without a subsidy. But its bid for <font size=-1>EU</font> money was blocked this year when <font size=-1>MDHC</font> announced it was going to build a &#163;16.5m freight terminal on the Liverpool side without any aid. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, so much Irish Sea freight is now being handled at Liverpool, that it looks as though neither terminal needs a subsidy to be profitable. The Port of Mostyn in North Wales seems to agree: it says its ambitious plan to build a freight terminal can go ahead without an <font size=-1>EU</font> grant.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?845683200,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="br7543.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&copy; Copyright</a>1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<h1>The euro and the dollar: strut your stuff</h1>

<p><b>What will European economic and monetary union mean for the greenback? </b></p><br>
 <br>
THE indecent haste with which governments in the European Union  are pushing towards a single currency may be driven more by politics than by economics; but hordes of studies have at least tried to weigh the costs and benefits of European economic and monetary union (<font size=-1>EMU</font>) to member countries. However, economists have given little attention to what the euro will imply for the rest of the world. In particular, what will it mean for the dollar?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Economists split into two camps on this question. One group suggests that replacing the rock-solid <font size=-1>D</font>-mark with a soggy euro will prompt investors to switch into dollars, lifting the greenback against the new European currency. Not only will the European Central Bank lack the inflation-fighting credentials of Germany's Bundesbank, runs the argument, but <font size=-1>EMU</font> will include countries that have fudged the budgetary criteria in the Maastricht treaty on monetary union.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another camp, however, argues that the creation of the euro as a rival to the dollar may encourage central banks and investors to diversify out of dollars, pushing the greenback down. The dollar's share of foreign-exchange reserves has already fallen to 64%, down from 80% in the early 1970s. There is scope for this to fall further: the dollar's weight in world reserves still far exceeds America's in the world economy: the ratio of American <font size=-1>GDP</font> to global output is just over one-fifth.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The effect of <font size=-1>EMU</font> on the dollar largely depends on how both European and non European central banks adjust their reserve holdings. Consider European central banks first. The total foreign-exchange reserves of <font size=-1>EU</font> members currently amount to over $370 billion, far more than those of either America or Japan (see <a href="fn1.gif">chart</a>). Add in their holdings of gold (valued at market prices) and the <font size=-1>EU</font>'s reserves are more than double Japan's and nearly quadruple America's. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Central banks hold reserves for two main reasons. First, as a cushion to meet temporary shortages in the foreign currency needed to make payments for trade or to pay interest; and second, as a means of supporting the value of their currencies if the need arises.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After <font size=-1>EMU</font> goes ahead, the need for participating countries to hold reserves will decline on both counts. They will no longer need such big war chests to defend their currencies' positions in Europe's exchange rate mechanism against speculative attacks. And after monetary union, member countries will need to pay for much less of their imports with foreign currency because trade between them will take place in euros. Thus they will need smaller foreign exchange reserves.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If (a very big if) all 15 <font size=-1>EU</font> countries eventually join a single currency, then over 60% of their current foreign trade would be reclassified as "domestic". However, <font size=-1>EMU</font> will also automatically reduce participating countries' reserves, because those that are currently held in other <font size=-1>EU</font> currencies will no longer count as foreign exchange. The <font size=-1>D</font>-marks held by the Bank of France, for instance, will be converted into euros. France's reserves will immediately drop, but there will be no implications for exchange rates.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even so, European central banks will still be left with excess dollars, which over time they are likely to dump. How so? Using rough estimates of the current composition of the <font size=-1>EU</font>'s foreign reserves, the average ratio of foreign-exchange reserves to imports in the 15 countries will almost double after <font size=-1>EMU</font>; the ratio of total reserves (including gold) will jump from 29% at present to 59%. Not only would that leave Europe's reserves much higher relative to its imports than the equivalent ratio in America, but a hefty 90% of those reserves will be in dollars. It seems almost certain, therefore, that European central banks will dump dollars, both to trim their reserves and to diversify into other currencies, such as the yen and Swiss franc. This will tend to weaken the dollar against the euro.<br>
</p><p><b> <b>Competition for Mr Universe</b></b><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In practice, not all 15 countries will participate in <font size=-1>EMU</font> from day one, so the overhang of dollars will be smaller. Economists at J.P. Morgan, an American bank, assume more realistically that in January 1999 just eight countries join <font size=-1>EMU</font> (Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands). With this smaller membership, "foreign" imports do not drop by as much. Even so, reckons the bank, this will leave them with excess dollar reserves of perhaps $70 billion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What about central banks outside the <font size=-1>EU</font>? The creation of a single European currency should boost the euro's attractiveness as an international currency for invoicing trade, as a tool of intervention and as an investment. If the European central bank can establish its inflation-fighting credibility, then for the first time since the end of the second world war the dollar could face a competitor of equal muscle. The <font size=-1>EU</font>'s total <font size=-1>GDP</font> is bigger than America's, and monetary union will help make European capital markets broader and more liquid, and hence more of a match for America's.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On simple diversification grounds, there is a strong case for central banks to hold more euros. For example, Japan's foreign-exchange reserves are thought to be almost entirely composed of dollars, and thus in the long term switching some into euros might seem prudent. As the role of the euro increases, some countries, especially in Eastern Europe, may choose to peg their currencies to it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The euro is also likely to play a bigger role in the invoicing of trade than the current sum of its constituent parts. This is because the currencies of big exporters tend to be used disproportionately in invoicing. For example, almost 50% of world trade is invoiced in dollars, far above America's 13% share of world exports. J.P. Morgan calculates that after <font size=-1>EMU</font> 17% of world exports will originate from the eight European core countries. If, as the bank assumes, the ratio of exports to invoicing is the same for the euro as for the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark, then this implies that 25% of world exports might be invoiced in euros, up from 16% today. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Adding together the three sources of increased demand for euros--European central banks' excess reserves of dollars, diversification by non-European central banks and trade invoicing--J.P. Morgan estimates that the demand for the new European currency could increase (and hence that for dollars will fall) by $600 billion over the next decade.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So contrary to the current popular view of the euro as a "weak" currency, <font size=-1>EMU</font> may actually create a rather strong one. This could be awkward for Europe: it would exacerbate the existing problems of European competitiveness, and so depress output and jobs. Moreover, if the new European central bank initially pursues a super-tight monetary policy to establish its credibility, governments will be forced to offset this with laxer fiscal policy. The consequent policy mix--tight money and loose fiscal policy--will be an exact replay of America's policies in the first half of the 1980s, which caused the dollar to soar. It would be a bitter irony if greater currency stability within Europe resulted in a bigger shift against currencies outside it.<br>

<h1>TECHNOLOGY BRIEF</h1>

<h2>Roboflops</h2>
<p><b>In the final brief of our series asking why some technologies disappoint, we look at the general-purpose robot, which was supposed to be cooking us dinner by now</b></p><br>
THE 1970s have a lot to answer for, but often overlooked amid bell bottoms and disco music is the notion of the do-it-all robot. The decade was a heady time for robotics: a Russian robotic rover wheeled about on the moon, while <font size=-1>R2-D2</font> and <font size=-1>C-3PO</font> nattered charmingly to each other. Robots assembled cars in Detroit and motorcycles in Japan. Industrialists predicted a multi-billion dollar robotics industry within a decade. And the home of 2000, <i>Popular Mechanics</i> confidently predicted, would have a robot butler to go with its personal helicopter.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alas, most of us still sweep our own floors, serve ourselves drinks and cook our own meals. The only wheeled beasts that roam most of our offices are vacuum cleaners. Even in factories, most of the machines that stamp, bend, package and sort are specially built for the job, which means that they are little closer to the vision of an autonomous, programmable robot than, say, a wind-up clock. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where is Robby the Robot, not to speak of the rebellious 'droids of "Westworld"? Still far in the future. The past 20 years or so have been frustrating ones for the robotics business, which has been dogged by technical glitches and sluggish demand for what products it has delivered.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;True, the American robotics industry, which almost collapsed in the 1980s, is undergoing something of a renaissance-- some 70,000 robots are now at work in American factories, according to the Robotics Industry Association. But that is still a modest figure. The world leader, Japan, has nearly 400,000 in its factories, though they are still mainly in the automotive and electronics industries, where they started out 30 years ago. Even in Japan, factory workers still outnumber robots by 50 to 1; in America it is 300 to 1.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reason for this is that, contrary to the hype that surrounded their creation, robots are rarely a good replacement for humans. Making a machine that, say, moves a bit like a human arm is relatively easy. Teaching it what to do with its mobility is a lot tougher. The hard part of being human is not bending joints, but seeing, thinking and sensing--all things that machines still do poorly.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Consider a modestly skilled factory worker whose job is to slip rubber rings around a rod. First he must pick up a ring from a tray of them. Easy enough for the worker, but a nightmare for a robot. The problem is identifying the ring, which may be at any angle, amongst a mass of other rings all of the same colour.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Throw enough computing power at this image-recognition problem and a robot can crack it, but more slowly than a person. So the factory may be forced to present the rings in a more ordered way: carefully stacked, for instance, or neatly lined up on a tape. This is expensive.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once the robot identifies the ring and its orientation, picking it up is easy. But putting it on the rod is not. The worker might place the ring on the end of the rod, then squeeze it and rock it until it slips on. For him, this is simple. But from a robot's perspective, he is engaging in some state-of-the-art "force control" and sensing. Moreover, the worker benefits from a very responsive "feedback loop"--ie, he can feel how hard he is pushing and adjust his squeeze so as not to push too much.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The lack of a sense of touch is a notorious robotic failing. When experts go to a trade fair and see a robot proving its dexterity by washing windows without breaking them, they snicker, knowing that the flexibility of the sponge gives it a big margin of error; the same robot could not put a cream puff in a box without crushing it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are signs of improvement here. The faster a robot's motors and computer are, the faster it can respond to its artificial sense of touch, and the less likely it is to damage what it is touching. But this is still the stuff of doctoral theses, not of household products. Nappy changing will remain a human chore for a while longer.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even when a factory robot can perform a task more efficiently than a person, the job of programming it and setting up its workplace can be more trouble than it is worth. The advantage of a general-purpose robot arm is that it can be programmed to do many jobs. The disadvantage is that the programming tends to be a job for highly paid <font size=-1>P</font>h<font size=-1>D</font> engineers, not technicians more used to the simple automation found on most factory floors. Commotion Systems, a new Californian firm, is developing easier ways to program robots using pre-designed software modules. For now, however, the chore of "training" robots is still one of the main reasons that they are not used more.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Outside the factory, a robot's failings are even more glaring. Seen through a machine's eyes, the real world is a baffling jumble of obstacles and unrecognisable shapes. HelpMate Robotics, a Connecticut company founded by Joe Engelberger (who is widely considered to be the founder of modern industrial robotics), makes a robot that can carry drugs, <font size=-1>X</font>-ray films and the like from one part of a hospital to another. But to navigate around even this ordered environment, the machine needs infra-red and ultrasonic sensors, a video camera, gyroscopes and an electronic map. Even then it requires a hospital with automatic doors, and sometimes needs to call for help. Stairs are out of the question, although the robot can be taught to operate a modified lift. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Engelberger's firm thinks that a home robot--not a tin domestic for the average family, but an aide for the elderly and disabled--is now within reach. Food might have to be bar-coded with the refrigerator shelf that it belongs on and its microwaving instructions, but a robot-cooked meal, delivered to the bedside, is already possible. A little dusting--don't forget to clear the shelves first--is probably on the cards, too, along with some light vacuuming and other domestic chores, so long as they are confined to a single floor.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But consider other, less routine jobs and HelpMate's hurdles become clearer. "Fetch my glasses from the bedroom" is a simple request, but obeying it summons up three of the trickiest problems in computer science: voice recognition (which allows the robot to translate sounds into words), natural-language processing (which enables it to translate words into commands) and image recognition. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As with many troubled products, the problem with robotics is not so much with the technology itself, but with the expectations that it has raised. Seduced by the humanoid helpers of Hollywood, people tend to think of robots for typical human jobs, which are often the ones for which they are worst suited.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;John Tenney, one of the founders of Commotion Systems, recalls a visit to one spark plug factory, which was considering installing a few robots: "We walked past rows of people doing brain-numbing work, until we got to the part of the factory doing the most complex assembly. They wanted robots there because they had a hard time finding skilled workers. But if it's hard for people, it's even harder for robots. You've got to pick the low-hanging fruit."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This does not mean that robots will continue to disappoint, only that they are still a long way from becoming general-purpose helpers, much less anyone's plastic pal. Rosie, the Jetson's friendly house-cleaning robot, is likely to remain Rosie the plain old Riveter for a while yet.<br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>New adventures in hi-fi</h1>

OASIS, the world's newest rock mega group, may be paying homage to the Beatles by putting together an album in the fab four's Abbey Road studio, but the practical business of recording music in the 1990s bears little relation to what went on 30 years ago. The pop hits of the 1960s were mostly created using four track tape recorders. Now, 24-track equipment is the norm, tape has given way to the compact disc, and the combination of synthesisers, optical fibre and the Internet has made it possible to make, record and distribute music at a far higher quality and far lower cost than once seemed likely.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Good Vibrations"*, a book by Mark Cunningham, who is himself a "song writer, musician and producer", describes the effect of technological change on recorded music since the invention of multi-tracking in 1949. His account is sometimes fascinating, sometimes impenetrably technophile. It is interesting that London's top recording studio can accommodate a symphony orchestra and a heavy-rock band in adjacent rooms with no leakage of sound from one to the other; very much less so that one room contains a "72-channel <font size=-1>SSL</font> 8000 <font size=-1>G</font>-plus console incorporating Ultimation and Total Recall automated fader systems".<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Technology has transformed how established musicians ply their trade. Sting is one of a growing number who work from home, recording tunes in his dining room and mixing them in what was once a cowshed. Frank Sinatra, in America, recorded duets by telephone with, among others, Bono, who was in Ireland--a technological advance that Oasis's warring Gallagher brothers might find handy should they find Abbey Road's quarters too close for comfort. George Michael now samples his own voice for backing vocals, with himself on synthesiser for instrumentals, dispensing (mostly) with session musicians. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But not everyone is so keen. A Luddite tendency has emerged among mainstream musicians, a sort of "campaign for real rock music": The claim is that new technology kills the raw emotion necessary for <i>bona fide</i> rock'n'roll. Paul Weller, Britain's top male vocalist of the moment, boasts of "playing real instruments" and avoiding "all that digital bollocks". Seeking the "kind of space and environment" once enjoyed by the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin, an American rocker, Lenny Kravitz, recently recorded in a 17th-century chateau near Paris, while Les N&eacute;gresses Vertes used a deserted casino.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But technology's greatest boon will be for the thousands of aspiring rock-stars who "for a once-only investment of just a few thousand pounds  make better sounding records than could be produced in a top studio 15 years ago." With the Internet promising to become a viable means of distributing and popularising music, the writing may be on the wall for the big companies which dominate the music business by signing up hopefuls on long contracts and controlling the dissemination of their work.<br>

<html><head><title> After he's gone </title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" alt="The Economist" border=0></p><h1 align=center>After he's gone</h1>HE IS, in some ways, quite an ordinary man. He is neither great intellect, nor rousing orator. He can be impetuous and sometimes quick of temper. He has failed, twice, to make marriage work. Yet few can doubt that much of the credit for the negotiated collapse of apartheid, and for the building of a new, non-triumphalist nation through racial reconciliation, belongs to Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. In this sense he is far from ordinary, and it is understandable that he should be so revered. The trouble for South Africans now, as they peer anxiously around them at their gathering problems and further, into a post-Mandela future, is that the more both they and the outside world cling to the saint-like figure, the harder they will find it when he goes.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That day is not yet at hand. God willing, Mr Mandela will remain in office till 1999, when he will be 80 and deserving, surely, of a peaceful retirement. But the aura of sainthood is now deflecting attention from some of South Africa's problems (see <a href="sf0760.html">pages</a>). It has also placed Mr Mandela out of reach of criticism, though he is not infallible. He has stood by incompetent lieutenants out of stubborn loyalty, while dismissing another (not incompetent) merely for challenging his authority. He has taken cash for his party from a casino tycoon, who had previously admitted paying the head of an apartheid homeland to secure gambling rights. In any event, fallible or not, Mr Mandela increasingly leaves the day-to-day running of government to others. He must take responsibility for their mistakes.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fortunately, his detachment is not total. He is fit and, as long as he is in ultimate charge, South Africans can be pretty confident that things will not go badly wrong: he has the authority to enforce his will, and on the large issues his will is dependably rooted in honesty and reconciliation. The immediate worry is that a number of apparently minor problems will get worse, and that in time they will add up to something serious. The longer-term worry is that, when the saint departs, he will be followed by someone much less saintlike.<br><b> <br></p><p><b>No easy walk</b></b><br>For those inclined to take a dark view, there is plenty to be concerned about. South Africa is a poor country, with a history of division and violence. Millions of people live in abject poverty with little immediate prospect of a better life: one in three is without even an informal job. Ethnic strains persist. Robbery, murder and every other kind of crime are rife.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To make matters worse, political stability is uncertain. Two of the main parties represent racial groups. The National Party, anchored in Afrikanerdom, has won some mixed-race adherents but little black support. The Inkatha Freedom Party speaks mainly for rural Zulus. They, and the other opposition parties, are hugely outnumbered in Parliament by Mr Mandela's African National Congress, which took 63% of the vote in the 1994 general election. It is hard to envisage the <font size=-1>ANC</font> out of government. Electorally, it has no need to listen to its critics. And it may already be showing, albeit in small ways, the arrogance of unfettered power: an apparent readiness here to tolerate incompetence, an apparent reluctance there to pursue corruption.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Africa, this scene is familiar. It usually turns to intolerance and impoverishment, sometimes to tyranny and bloodshed. Is this to be South Africa's fate?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It need not be. But South Africa's ability to get beyond its first few years of post-apartheid transition, and thereby to secure its post-Mandela democracy, will be made infinitely harder if action is not taken now to strengthen both the spirit of reconciliation and the institutions that must underpin it.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One such is the constitution. The <font size=-1>ANC</font> takes this document seriously; the effort that has already gone into it--and in many ways it is a model of protected freedoms--suggests that this is not a piece of paper to be swept aside lightly, as so many others have been in Africa. That should be reassuring for all minorities, as should the tradition of an independent judiciary. But the new constitution, due to be adopted by Parliament on October 11th, is not accepted by all parties, as, ideally, it should be. In particular, Inkatha wants stronger powers for the provinces and the chiefs. Its readiness to live with the new constitution may have to be bought either by promising to redraft the provincial constitution of KwaZulu-Natal, where the party's power is concentrated, or even by offering a deputy presidency (one of the two is vacant) to Inkatha's leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Inkatha's Zulus are one group who need to be accommodated if democracy is to be consolidated. The whites are another. Not all blacks are as forgiving as Mr Mandela. Some still seek vengeance for the crimes of apartheid, others merely want to press harder for black advancement. And no wonder: much power, especially in business, the civil service, the press and the universities, remains in white hands. It needs to be spread. Mr Mandela knows that that cannot happen instantly if peace and prosperity are to be secured. Others in the <font size=-1>ANC</font> need to make it plain that they realise this too.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That applies in particular to Thabo Mbeki, deputy president and Mr Mandela's anointed heir. He is a shrewd politician, and has shown himself ready to compromise with the <font size=-1>ANC</font>'s Zulu critics. But he lacks Mr Mandela's charm and personality, as well as, inevitably, his self-assurance and moral authority. The temptation for him will be to pick a path that does less to calm white fears and more to meet black demands than the route his boss has taken. That would be full of dangers. Plenty of old ghosts still haunt South Africa, as has been shown by the trial of Magnus Malan, a former defence minister, whose trial on charges of murder in the name of apartheid was due to end this week. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whites should, however, be clear that their privileges cannot endure. The aim must be a fair society for all, created by sweeping away the legacies of apartheid as fast as is compatible with nurturing stability and economic growth. Mr Mandela has given the new South Africa a famous start. Honour him for that. Criticise him, if need be, for his errors. But remember, above all, that what he has put in place must be fortified and extended by others if it is not soon to fall apart.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?845078400,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="sf0760.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&copy; Copyright</a>1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

America's <b>Texaco</b>, its joint venture with Saudi Aramco,<b> Star Enterprise</b>, and <b>Shell Oil</b>, the American unit of Royal Dutch/Shell, want to merge their American refining and marketing operations to create America's biggest oil retailer. <font size=-1>BP</font> and Mobil reached a similar deal involving their European downstream operations earlier this year.<p>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br> Shares in <b>Eurotunnel </b>fell heavily when trading in them resumed after details emerged of a plan to restructure its &#163;9.1 billion ($14.2 billion) debt. The complex plan would almost halve the company's annual debt-servicing costs, to about &#163;430m, partly through a &#163;1 billion debt-for equity swap that would give its 225 creditor banks a 45.5% stake in the Chunnel operator. The company's bankers and its shareholders must approve the scheme.</p><p>The <b>Dow </b>reached 6,000 in intra-day trading before falling again, pulling other bourses down with it. But Frankfurt hit another high.</p><p><h2>Change of cast</p></h2><b>Sony</b> had another go at tackling the problems of its troubled Sony Pictures Entertainment unit. The Japanese electronics giant named a new team to run its Hollywood business, led by John Calley, currently president of United Artists. To ease transpacific communications, Sony is appointing a Japanese executive to the team for the first time.<p>South Korea's <b>Hyundai Electronics</b> is setting up a &#163;1 billion ($1.6 billion) semiconductor plant in Scotland and creating 1,000 jobs initially, with the prospect of a further &#163;1.4 billion investment in a second chip plant. The two-phase deal would be one of the largest-ever inward investments in Europe.</p><p>After a year-long slump, demand for <b>semiconductors</b> is recovering. A ratio that measures the value of orders booked by North American chip makers to the value of their shipments reached its highest level this year in September.</p><p><h2>Taking credit</p></h2>Britain scrapped tax credits linked to <b>share buybacks </b> and special dividends just in time to scupper a plan by <b>Reuters</b>, a British information and media giant, to repurchase &#163;613m ($959m) of its shares. The government believes closing this tax loophole will add &#163;80m to its coffers in this fiscal year, rising to &#163;400m a year by 1998-99.<p>The <b>Nobel prize for economics</b> was shared by James Mirrlees of Cambridge University, a Scot, and William Vickrey of Columbia University in New York, who becomes the first Canadian to win the prize. They were rewarded for their work on "asymmetric information"--a situation in which two parties to a decision do not have the same facts.</p></td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%><p>American and European credit-rating agencies gave <b>Russia's debt</b> its first rating since the Russian Revolution.

Italy set the second stage of its flotation of Eni, an energy and chemicals company: a maximum of 10% of its shares will be sold to raise over 5 trillion lire ($3.3 billion). Germany's offering was Deutsche Telekom, which plans to issue 500m new shares in a DM15 billion ($9.8 billion) initial offering. A fifth of France Telecom will be sold next year, for around FFr35 billion ($6.8 billion).

<html><head><title> How wrong is it going?</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><table width=100%><tr><td align=left valign=top><img src="sf.gif" alt="Special feature"><td align=right valign=top><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" alt="The Economist" border=0></td></tr></table><h1>How wrong is it going? </h1><p><b>South Africa's breezy post-apartheid self-confidence has crumbled</b></p>JUST over a year ago, the world was marvelling at South Africans' ability to bury the past, and reach across the racial divide to share the triumph of the rugby world cup. A jubilant President Nelson Mandela, dressed in the once-detested Springbok rugby jersey, seemed to embody the country's new, non-racial spirit. A year later the Springboks have now lost to New Zealand for the first time on South African soil--and the waving of the national flag of the apartheid era at the matches has revived the country's introspective fears over unhealed racial wounds. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Is sporting disenchantment the symbol of a wider malaise, and a worrying future? Perhaps so. Take one fortnight in August. Cape Town vigilantes burned a drug baron to death, in full view of television cameras and the police; the justice minister, Dullah Omar, had to move his family out of their Cape Town house in fear of their lives; the German company-secretary of <font size=-1>AEG </font>in South Africa was shot dead in his front drive in Johannesburg by car-hijackers; and the president of the Constitutional Court, Arthur Chaskalson, was held at gun point in his house.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lawlessness is not the only cause of the spreading gloom. Since mid-February, the currency, the  rand, has collapsed (see <a href="sf1.gif">chart</A>), losing 23% of its value against the dollar and falling below the level at which it might have been expected to settle after the overvaluation caused by the strong inflows of capital in 1994 and 1995. Had the rand stabilised, regardless of level, its depreciation might have been regarded as an opportunity to boost exports. Instead, the downward slide fosters the worry that the world's currency markets are giving a vote of no confidence in South African economic stability. The finance minister, Trevor Manuel, thanks to inexperience, and the central bank, thanks to low foreign reserves, were able to stem the fall only briefly.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To make matters worse, the African National Congress-led government seems to stumble from one blunder into another. In May, for example, a deputy minister, Bantu Holomisa, alleged that a cabinet member had received a bribe in apartheid days, and that the <font size=-1>ANC</font> had accepted 2m rand (at the time some $600,000) from a casino magnate in return for favours. "Blatant lies," declared the <font size=-1>ANC</font>, only to hear Mr Mandela later admit to having taken the money without telling anyone--though not in exchange for granting any favours. For his pains, the <font size=-1>ANC</font> expelled Mr Holomisa.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Do these dramas amount to a blip, the spasm of a country undergoing a wrenching transition from the tight controls of apartheid to a society of freedom and democracy? Or do they represent the first skid down the slippery African slope, one which has oiled the failure of so many other countries to build a prosperous democracy after winning political liberation? The questions are no longer the products of the old worries--the threat from the white far-right; the risk of Zulu-inspired secession; the danger of reckless public-spending. Certainly those worries remain, but no longer at the forefront of people's concerns. Today, three new anxieties stand out: lawlessness, unemployment and political accountability.<br></p><p><b>New--and uncomfortable</b><br>Behind smoked glass windows, an alien phenomenon has arrived in South Africa's cities: the sex shop. American accessories nestle alongside local ones "made in sizes for the African man". <i>Hustler</i> and <i>Penthouse </i>are on newsagents' shelves. There is even a soft-porn magazine, <i>Loslyf </i>(loose body), in Afrikaans. The end of apartheid ended a system of racial injustice--and lifted the repressive lid of Calvinist culture.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For many whites, the lifting of the old social controls is disconcerting. A decade ago, whites dressed up to go to the theatre or dine out in central Johannesburg; blacks stepped off the pavement for them, and conveniently disappeared home at night. Today, Johannesburg has become a heaving African city, its pavements crowded with hawkers of boiled sweets and witch medicine, from which white businessmen scurry home at the end of the day. Once, both Africa and decadent America could be kept at bay; now the fantasy is over.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As in Russia, the collapse of the authoritarian state in South Africa has unleashed social and political freedoms--and with them controversy and criminality. The reasons are the same: the end of the old order dramatically increased the number of new commercial opportunities but did so at a time when the criminal-justice system (designed for the old regime) had changed comparatively little. Organised crime has filled the resulting gap.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The police at present have records on 481 crime syndicates operating in the country. The opening of post-apartheid South Africa has turned the country into a trans-shipment point for drugs from Latin America and Asia, heading for the European market. Johannesburg's sophisticated banks have become a target for money-launderers. Much of the car-hijacking in Johannesburg is linked to syndicates that run luxury cars north to nearby countries such as Zambia.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is not crime <i>per se </i>that grips the imagination but its random and violent nature. The murdered are no longer mainly the victims of political revenge, nor are they mafia-linked. Instead, violent crime touches all. Fully 58% of whites and 41% of blacks named crime as the country's most serious problem in a recent study sponsored by Nedcor, a South African bank. South Africa's murder rate is perhaps six times that of America, maybe five times that of Russia. Last year 19,000 people were murdered--52 each day. This was 4% more than in 1994. Car-hijackings around Johannesburg jumped 12%, to 8,524.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The study also exposed the weakness of the criminal-justice system. For every 450 crimes reported, there are 100 prosecutions, 77 convictions and a mere 36 imprisonments. Such is popular dissatisfaction that when the vigilante gangs burned to death the Cape Town drug baron, they won widespread public support. "I and several friends watched with undisguised admiration," wrote Thami Mazwai, a black writer. Weeks later, an opinion poll suggested 71% of South Africans want to bring back hanging, which was abolished only last year.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By itself, crime probably does not deter foreign investors much: if there is money to be made or a market to conquer, businessmen will go there. But crime puts off tourists. The number of foreign tourists visiting South Africa between January and May grew by only 2% over the same period in 1995, compared with year-on-year growth of 38% over the same period the previous year. Meanwhile, lawlessness feeds the feeling that the government is not in control.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What feeds it still more is the impression that some members of the police are in league with the criminals. In August, the commander of the vehicle-theft branch in Rustenburg, 100 kilometres from Johannesburg, and three other policemen, were charged in court with--guess what?--running a vehicle-theft syndicate. The problem compounds itself: poorly paid policemen who accept bribes to drop charges; excessive bureaucracy; public mistrust; ineffective prosecutors; loose conditions for bail; and overcrowded prisons. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;None of these problems, however, would be insurmountable if the government were determined enough to grasp them. Part of the solution must be political will. It is a measure of some progress that, for the first time, President Mandela has admitted that crime is "out of control", sending 500 soldiers to help the police in Johannesburg. The government has finally worked out a crime-prevention plan. Some road-blocks are said to have been spotted around Johannesburg. One police station, in the suburb of Rosebank, has even recruited street beggars as informal, unpaid assistants and issued them with fluorescent vests and identity cards. Another has obtained four horses so that policemen can peer over residents' high-perimeter walls.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To improve efficiency, McKinsey & Co, a consulting firm, has helped nine police stations reorganise themselves. At one, it found that only 7% of policemen spent time on "pro-active" (ie, preventive) policing; at another, less than half the vehicles were in service at any time. Reorganisation has now freed twice as many policemen to go on the beat at one station; at another, it cut the backlog in clearing dockets by 10% in the first month. By next May, McKinsey will be working in 100 stations across the country. Perhaps, therefore, South Africa's greatest enemy in its war against crime is its belief that little can be done about it.<br></p><p><b><b>Finding work . . . </b><br></b>Dawn, outside a Johannesburg metal-casting factory in January this year. Two thousand black South Africans are queuing in the street outside, drawn by rumours that the factory has 200 job vacancies. In the scuffle for a place in line, gunshots are fired. Eight people are shot dead. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of all the menaces to South Africa's stability, the most troubling is jobless growth. After a long recession, which ended in 1993, the economy is now growing robustly. Last year, <font size=-1>GDP</font> grew by 3.5% (see <a href="sf2.gif">chart</A>); but the number of recorded jobs inched up by just 0.6%. In the formal (ie, taxpaying) sector, the unemployment rate is 20%; add those who scratch a living informally by, say, hawking brushes or weeding gardens, and perhaps a third of the labour force is without work. Unlike in West Africa, where land has not historically been parcelled into a few large commercial farms, the jobless city-dwellers cannot fall back into the safety net of the family's subsistence-farming.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;South Africa's unresponsive labour market is not the result only of strong unions and labour protection. True, there are government-imposed non-wage costs, and it is costly to hire and difficult to fire. So companies look for capital-intensive, not labour-intensive, ways to grow. But the market's stickiness is also a product of apartheid's inferior education for blacks: unskilled black labour is cheap but unproductive; skilled labour is scarce, but costly. In addition, high tariff walls have sheltered manufacturers from competition, allowing skilled wages to rise and isolating South Africa's hierarchical companies from modern management practices. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The result is a conundrum the government has yet to resolve. How can it maintain the rights that unions won for workers operating in miserable apartheid conditions, without jeopardising the economy's ability to create new jobs?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the short-run, joblessness will probably worsen. The government promises to bring its budget deficit down from 5.4% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>in 1995-1996, to 4% by 1998. This will mean less spending and the loss of jobs in state firms and organisations. Meanwhile, as import tariffs are loweredto meet international obligations, firms will have to lay off workers to compete.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even foreign investment will not help much. In the two years to May 1996, foreign direct investment amounted to 18 billion rand, according to BusinessMap, a research group. But most has been to buy stakes in existing South African companies, often by firms which divested because of international sanctions in the apartheid days; they are not in greenfield investments creating immediate jobs.</p><p><b> . . . will not be easy</b><br>South Africa is a country of 41m people, fringed by African poverty, with a rigid labour market, an oligopolistic economy and high real interest-rates. Even gold output is declining, as mining the reserves becomes more difficult. Fast growth will not be easy.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet jobless growth is growth nonetheless. Two huge capital projects, to make stainless steel and smelt aluminium, are up and running; exports of coal and high-tech defence products are booming; luxury hotels are rising across the skyline in Johannesburg and Cape Town. Real domestic fixed investment grew by a year-on-year 5.5% in the second quarter of 1996. Privatisation could attract foreign cash and expertise, if the government would only get a move on.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, South Africans are, on average, no longer getting poorer. With annual population growth of just 2.1% and <font size=-1>GDP</font> growing by around 3.5%, <font size=-1>GDP</font> per head is on the rise. Indeed, the economy is in its best shape for years. The government inherited an economy emerging from over three years of recession and 20 years of double digit inflation. Now it has published a fiscally prudent macro-economic policy. Inflation, thoughrising, was still only 7.1% in July. The widening current-account deficit, of 2.3 billion rand in the first quarter of 1996, amounted to just 2% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>; Mexico's, before its currency crisis, was 7%.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unlike the rest of Africa, South Africa also has a diversified and sophisticated private sector and several home grown multinationals--with enough assets at home to keep a watchful eye on economic housekeeping. The Brenthurst group, an elite from South Africa's old business families, regularly visits Mr Mandela's home.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For all the fears that resentful <font size=-1>ANC</font> socialists would confiscate wealth, the new breed shares the same capitalist aspirations as the old. Though black incomes are barely a sixth of white ones, a black elite is rising on the back of government jobs and the promotion of black business. It is moving into the leafy avenues of formerly white Johannesburg suburbs, such as Kelvin and Sandton, and adopting the outward symbols of prestige--the <font size=-1>BMW</font>, swimming pool, golf handicap and black maid--that so mesmerise status-conscious whites. Most intriguing of all, the unions are becoming capitalists: dozens of them have become part-owners of a stake in Johnnic, an industrial holding company, sold by Anglo American in August to a black consortium.<br></p><p><b>Future imperfect</b><br>When South Africans are at their most despondent, they mutter about Zimbabwe. "Look north," says one black investment banker when asked to imagine South Africa in five years' time, "and temper it a bit." Without the unifying figure and moral integrity of Mr Mandela, who retires in 1999, what is to stop South Africa slipping the way of Zimbabwe: a supposed multiparty democracy ruled as a de facto one-party state, with a government that rides in limousines, periodically clamps down on the press, and blames white ownership of the economy for the country's ills? <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>ANC</font>, which won a handsome 63% of the vote at the 1994 general election, looks unassailable. Though their leaders deny it, political opposition remains ethnically divided: the Inkatha Freedom Party represents chiefly Zulus, the Democratic Party chiefly whites, the Freedom Front chiefly Afrikaners. Even the National Party--once all-white, now vigorously courting the non-white vote--won only 20% of the 1994 vote. At national level, disgruntlement with the <font size=-1>ANC</font> is more likely to translate into apathy than electoral protest. The worry is that the political elite, unburdened by electoral worries, will grow increasingly distant from those who elected it, and arrogant in its use of power.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Problems are appearing. In June, the public protector investigated how the health department had spent 14m rand ($3.2m) on a single musical play designed to promote "<font size=-1>AIDS-</font>awareness". He found that the health minister, Nkosazana Zuma, had misled parliament over the matter. She did not resign. Dr Zuma then declared that a business donor would foot part of the bill--but would not name him. When pressure grew to do so, she announced that the mystery donor had withdrawn his offer. In an uncharacteristic racial swipe, President Mandela accused the "white-owned media" of victimising her.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>ANC</font> might claim in its own defence that it is victim to its own determination to prise open the once-murky workings of government. The National Party, in apartheid days, scarcely felt accountable to anybody; patronage and corruption went on behind impenetrable walls. But the <font size=-1>ANC</font> can hardly be judged by the miserable standards of those who went before when it has declared itself the champion of accountable and open government. Contempt for parliament, suspicion of the press, intolerance of criticism: there is enough to breed disquiet. What will check South Africa's rulers from heading Zimbabwe's way?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the shortrun, the answer probably lies not in opposition parties (though noisy minority parties--and a resentful black constituency, fed up with President Mandela's failure to punish whites--could one day be mobilised from the left). <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Instead, the safeguard may rest in the new constitution, which protects individuals from abuse by government. Or in the fact that two of the nine provinces--the Western Cape (run by the National Party) and KwaZulu-Natal (run by Inkatha)--are not controlled by the <font size=-1>ANC</font>. Or in the informal organisations--the women's groups, church groups, street committees, parents' associations-- that rail against the government on behalf of ordinary South Africans. Lastly, it rests in a vigilant press, learning fast how to act as a check on government, and in a political leadership which worries about what outsiders think.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"President Mandela's visit to London in July represented the end of a chapter," says Jack Spence, director of studies at Britain's Royal Institute of International Affairs. There was something of a rite of passage in the extraordinary welcome given to him by the British state, a big congratulatory hug for coming of age, and a farewell wave of good luck as South Africa begins a new era. Now, however, the country has to face reality--and start delivering. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;South Africa suffers from schizophrenic foreign perceptions and turbulent domestic mood-swings. The euphoria of the political transition in 1994 inflated expectations. South Africa was hailed as the continent's saviour, a tiger economy for Africa. As sentiment now swings the other way, South Africa is being smudged with the brush of African failure. "If South Africa, with all its problems and opportunities, were geographically located in Latin America or Asia, observers would be far more optimistic about its prospects," says Robert Schrire, of the University of Cape Town. "However unfair and inaccurate, South Africa is viewed through the prisms of the African experiences."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Asia-like economic success, or stagnant African disappointment? Mundane reality will surely lie in between.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?845078400,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="am3077.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&copy; Copyright</a>1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<h1>Raining on Dole's parade</h1>

<font size=1>HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT, AND LYNDHURST, NEW JERSEY</font><p>
"WEEEE'VE got the momentum," Bob Dole told New Jersey this week. He arrived there fresh from Sunday's televised debate with Bill Clinton, in buoyant mood for a two-day bus tour. His campaign manager predicted the gap in the polls would shrink to single digits by week's end. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But by Tuesday, the second day of the bus tour, this was what the Dole momentum looked like. The polls had declared Mr Clinton the winner of the debate in Hartford, Connecticut, and the president's lead had even edged up a tad. As Mr Dole's bus-- called Asphalt I, "American Dream Machine"--arrived at Riverside Park in Lyndhurst, north of Newark in New Jersey, the skies were darkening ominously. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The crowd for the morning rally was thin, perhaps 300 people (including a few holding "Keep Abortion Legal" signs), leaving embarrassingly large patches of green grass between the television cameras and the podium. The musical introduction for Mr Dole was bungled, the candidate's speech was lacklustre. Dick Zimmer, the Republican senatorial candidate, who might be expected to attach himself like glue to Mr Dole if he reckoned it would help his own chances, was notable by his absence. Worse, a <font size=-1>TV</font> appearance the next day on "Oprah", an ideal forum for appealing to women voters, had fallen through.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By the time the "American Dream Machine" arrived at its next stop, Morristown, rain was falling. Although the crowd was bigger and Mr Dole did a brave job of speaking in the wet (proposing a "tax credit for rain"), it was no fun. The two open-air rallies and a fundraising meeting scheduled for the rest of the day were cancelled, and Mr Dole retreated to the "Citizen's Ship" to fly back to Washington.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dole momentum is proving hard to achieve. It was supposed to happen when he left the Senate, then at the Republican convention, and now with the two presidential debates. With less than a month to polling day, time is running out. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fairness, Mr Dole seemed genuinely pleased with his performance in Sunday's debate. He had held his own with the man his campaign had dubbed the greatest debater since Demosthenes. In New Jersey, he was greeted on his first day by blissful sunshine and respectable if not overflowing crowds. He told them Mr Clinton was a "stealth liberal" and assured them they could trust Bob Dole to keep his word, including his promise of a 15% tax cut--indeed, as president he would come to New Jersey to sign the tax-cutting legislation. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;New Jersey is one of the "battleground" states Mr Dole must carry to win the election. He trails there by 7-14 points in the latest polls, but is heartened by the example of New Jersey's governor, Christine Whitman, who accompanied him on the bus tour. Three years ago Mrs Whitman, who also campaigned on a platform of tax cuts, was 22 points behind at this stage of the race for governor, and went on to win.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If Mr Dole is to pull off a similar feat, he needs to change the dynamics of the contest. He failed to do that in the 90-minute Hartford debate. True, he succeeded in being warm and witty, a far cry from the uncaring extremist portrayed in Democratic advertisements. Most people watching liked him more at the end of the debate than at the beginning.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But that is not enough. Mr Dole was not terribly good at conveying his ideas for the future. And in order to avoid appearing mean, he passed up the opportunity-- served up on a platter by the debate's moderator, Jim Lehrer--to attack Mr Clinton's character. Mr Dole reckoned this was "an invitation to nowhere", and stuck to policy issues. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble is, policy issues suit Mr Clinton fine. The president could reel off his achievements over the past four years, especially the impressive figures on jobs, growth and deficit-reduction. He could list umpteen policy ideas designed to relate to voters' everyday concerns, from more cops on the streets to <font size=-1>V</font>-chips in televisions and tax credits for education. And of course he could repeat his favourite campaign metaphor of bridge-building to the 21st century.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was not exactly a glittering performance, but it was sufficient to keep the race looking much as it did beforehand, which is to say handsomely favouring Mr Clinton. Hence the almost taunting confidence with which Mr Clinton set off from Hartford to pick up endorsements from corporate America and to travel into what used to be the staunch Republican territory of New Hampshire, where he has a 21-point lead in the polls. If there was any change in momentum, it was not evident by mid-week.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What does Mr Dole try next? Another bus tour would take him this week to another battleground state, Ohio. He was due to be joined there by Colin Powell, amid speculation that he might announce some of the names voters could expect to see in a Dole administration. Then he heads for California in preparation for the second (and last) presidential debate, in San Diego on October 16th.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tough decisions are crowding in. How should he allocate its resources in the final weeks of the campaign? Should he abandon expensive California in order to concentrate on states where he has a more plausible chance of winning? Above all, if everything else fails to produce the magical momentum, should he change tactics and get personal?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Dole campaign this week launched a new advertisement, airing on Christian radio stations, which talks of a "moral crisis" in the White House. In Lyndhurst on Tuesday Mr Dole was preceded on the podium by Michael Chertoff, the former Senate Whitewater counsel. "Get aggressive, Mr Dole, in the next debate," was the advice shouted by one supporter at the end of the rally. "Less foreign policy, more character." America's eyes will now turn to San Diego to see if he takes that advice. <br>

<h1>Kemp gored</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><p>
AMERICAN life is plagued by electronic voices on the telephone, which forward calls and recite timetables in a relentlessly efficient and tedious way. Al Gore is one of those voices with a pretty face. At the vice-presidential debate on October 9th, he methodically defeated Jack Kemp, his Republican opponent. He was better briefed, stuck more closely to the questions, and attacked deftly. He was also dull beyond belief.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Defeating Mr Kemp, mind you, was not especially difficult. Mr Kemp made a fool of himself on foreign policy, waffling on Haiti, and eccentrically blaming the Clinton administration for causing the devaluation of Mexico's peso in 1994-95. Mr Kemp was also embarrassing on his supposed speciality, the economy. At one point he blurted out that the current long-run growth rate of 2.5% could be doubled, an outrageous claim. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Kemp was better at pleading the cause of inner cities. But Mr Gore can also do that (with statistics). Mr Kemp called for enterprise zones for poor urban areas. Mr Gore boasted about the empowerment zones that the Clinton administration has set up. Your correspondent had begun watching the debate with three eager friends. At about this point, all three wandered off.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However boring, the debate did reveal something about the last weeks of this campaign. Mr Kemp was invited by the moderator to attack President Clinton's character. He refused to do so, suggesting that the Dole team remains unwilling to exploit its greatest potential advantage. Instead, Mr Kemp offered a mix of nutty criticisms (as on Mexico) and artificial disagreements (as on inner-city policy). It is hard to see how either can dent the Clinton-Gore lead. Ghetto dwellers are not about to vote Republican, no matter what Mr Kemp may say.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The debate also shed some light on the next presidential campaign, in 2000. Mr Gore was already the front-runner for the Democratic nomination; he is even more so now. Unless a man of equal competence but greater passion emerges, it will be hard to topple him. But Mr Kemp has seen his stock slip a bit.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ed Rollins, who chaired Mr Kemp's disastrous presidential bid in 1988, says of his friend: "He was impossible to discipline and simply wouldn't listen." The lack of discipline came out on Wednesday. Kemp 2000 is a poor bet.<br>

<p><b>Campaign issues: Opinion polls</b></p>
<h1>Some margin for error</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><p>
IMAGINE the impossible: an American presidential election without opinion polls. It would be much more fun. There would be real tension about the outcome. As it is, polls have been the driving force of this campaign, shaping the candidates' messages and determining the dynamics of the race. Thanks to the polls, Bill Clinton has been able to cultivate an aura of inevitability. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet polls can mislead. A salutory lesson comes from Britain's experience in 1992. The major eve-of-election polls showed Labour just ahead, but John Major's Conservatives confounded everyone, winning by eight points. This was the British pollsters' most spectacular error ever, and it sent them into a painful post-election analysis to work out what went wrong. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They concluded that it was a mixture of things. There was a last-minute swing. There were problems with the method used to obtain a representative sample of the electorate. And there was a so-called "spiral of silence": many people, too embarrassed to admit that they would vote Conservative, claimed to be undecided or refused to answer questions.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Could distortions similar to those in Britain be affecting American polls this time? Some of the polls certainly raise eyebrows. In the space of five days late last month, the <font size=-1>CNN</font>/<i>USA Today</i>/Gallup tracking poll (a rolling sample taken over three nights) showed Mr Clinton's lead over Bob Dole moving from ten points to 25. It is hard to believe that voter opinion is really that volatile.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The odd rogue result is not on its own terribly significant. More to the point, the American practice of using computerised telephone banks to select a random sample of voters avoids the British pollsters' problematic quest for sociologically representative "quotas". But it raises other worries. John Zogby, whose tracking polls, in contrast to others, now show Mr Clinton's lead in single digits, and who uses a slightly different sampling method, reckons other polls "are talking to too many Democrats". The list of potential pitfalls suggests that the polls' margin of error may be greater than is generally acknowledged.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;First, there is the question of the non response rate--"the dirty little secret of the profession", says Karlyn Bowman, a poll watcher at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think-tank. In face-to face interviews, some 20% of people may refuse to answer questions. But in telephone polls, when people are often either not at home or choose to hang up, the non response rate is much higher (typically at least 50%). Diligent pollsters will repeatedly try to call back; but the non-response problem may be getting worse, as Americans lead ever-busier lives and do not hesitate to slam the phone down on what they assume are just more telemarketing calls.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pollsters rarely reveal the non-response rate. Yet it could be that Dole supporters are hanging up in greater numbers than Clinton-backers. If it is uncool to admit to being a Dole voter, a "spiral of silence" could be depressing Mr Dole's score in the polls.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The treatment of "undecided" respondents--say, 7%--probably also exaggerates Mr Dole's troubles. Two-thirds of the undecideds typically break for the challenger. This is not reflected in most polls, nor do published polls usually reveal the intensity of a candidate's support. Many respondents say they are leaning towards one side or the other, but may still change their minds. Add together the undecideds and the leaners in the presidential contest, and as much as 40% of the vote may still be up for grabs.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then there is the matter of turnout, a bigger complication for American pollsters than for British ones. The poor and members of ethnic minorities are most likely to support Mr Clinton, but they are least likely to vote. That explains why Mr Clinton's lead is greater among registered voters (16 points in a recent Pew poll) than among "likely voters" (12 points). The better pollsters ask a series of careful questions in an effort to establish whether a respondent is likely to vote, but this is not an exact science, and this year interest in the election seems to be low. In any case, not all pollsters are as scrupulous as they should be about their methods.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So is there hope yet for Mr Dole, who tells every audience not to believe the polls? Any systematic bias in the polls so far might open the possibility of a bigger-than-usual late swing, even of an upset victory. More than the presidency is at stake. If the presidential race is in fact closer than the polls suggest, then the Republicans' chances of retaining control of Congress are that much greater.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The size and persistence of Mr Clinton's lead argues against a surprise on November 5th. Moreover, the surveys of the major polling organisations that are not corner cutters all show essentially the same thing: a solid Clinton lead, larger than anything that has been reversed at this late stage since polling began. "Our track record is pretty good," notes Frank Newport of Gallup. True, but so was that of the British pollsters before 1992. <br>

<p><b>Cash to MPs</b></p>
<h1>Cleaning house</h1>

UNDER the 1689 Bill of Rights, <font size=-1>MP</font>s cannot be questioned or prosecuted for any of their actions at Westminster. As long ago as 1975, a Royal Commission headed by Lord Justice Salmon recommended that the Bill of Rights be amended to make the bribery of an <font size=-1>MP</font> a criminal offence. If the commission's recommendation had been enacted instead of being ignored by successive governments, Neil Hamilton, a former junior trade minister, and Mohamed Al Fayed, the owner of Harrods, the two key figures at the centre of the cash-for-questions scandal, could well be facing a criminal prosecution rather than a parliamentary inquiry.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Al Fayed claims that he paid Mr Hamilton, Conservative <font size=-1>MP</font> for Tatton, &#163;28,000 to ask 17 parliamentary questions on his behalf after being advised by Ian Greer, a lobbyist, that <font size=-1>MP</font>s were hired in the same way as taxis. Mr Hamilton acknowledges receiving &#163;10,000 in "commission fees" from Mr Greer. He also admits running up a bill of more than &#163;4,000 at the Ritz hotel in Paris as a guest of Mr Al Fayed. But he denies that these payments, neither of which was declared to Parliament, were linked to his repeated parliamentary representations on behalf of Mr Al Fayed. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is this ugly brew of bitterly contested allegations which Sir Gordon Downey, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, has now been asked to investigate. John Major, who has called for a rapid inquiry, said the charges were "poisoning British politics". That undoubtedly is correct. But a hurried inquiry held in private by a part-time commissioner, who has no powers to require witnesses to attend or documents to be produced, and who can report only to a Tory-dominated parliamentary committee, is unlikely to restore public confidence. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Major has so far rejected demands for a wider inquiry, but he may have to reconsider this stance when Parliament reassembles later this month. Mr Blair, the Labour leader, and Mr Ashdown, the Liberal Democrats' leader, have joined forces in calling for an independent judicial inquiry. If this demand is ignored, both opposition parties are considering tabling a motion of no confidence. Such a motion could put Mr Major, with his majority of only one in the House of Commons, in an awkward spot, for it may be the one motion which could force all the opposition parties, including the Ulster Unionists, to vote against his government.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Quite apart from parliamentary pressures, there is a strong case for a judicial inquiry held under the 1921 Tribunals of Inquiry Act. The disclosure that David Willetts, at the time a government whip and now a junior minister, sought to delay an earlier parliamentary probe into Neil Hamilton's conduct by lobbying Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith, the committee's Tory chairman, has done nothing to bolster confidence in the Commons' impartiality. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover there is a need to investigate more than just Mr Hamilton. In the thousands of pages of documents connected to the case, there is evidence that Mr Greer paid undeclared commissions not just to Mr Hamilton but to other members of the Commons Trade and Industry Committee. Sir Michael Grylls, the committee's chairman, received such payments from 1985, although he declared this interest to Parliament only in 1990. Tim Smith, the committee's secretary, resigned as a junior minister in 1994 after charges that he had received thousands of pounds in cash directly from Mr Al Fayed in return for asking parliamentary questions.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The need for an independent inquiry is further reinforced by the political nature of many of Mr Al Fayed's charges. He claims that he handed &#163;250,000 to the Conservative Party before the 1987 election and that since then he has given, through Mr Greer, campaign donations to 24 <font size=-1>MP</font>s, including two Labour <font size=-1>MP</font>s and one Liberal Democrat. Mr Greer, for his part, claims to have raised more than &#163;750,000 for Tory candidates. The one thing the two men now appear to have in common is their resentment at receiving so little in return.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Those caught up in this affair will, no doubt, claim they are victims of a changing political culture. If the government had acted on the recommendations of the Salmon Commission to make bribery of an <font size=-1>MP</font> a criminal offence--and to define precisely what bribery is--that excuse would not be available. But it is, at best, a poor defence. As the Royal Commission noted: "Membership of Parliament is a great honour and carries with it a special duty to maintain the highest standards of probity." Few of those involved in this wretched affair seem to have lived up to the "highest standards of probity".<br>

<p><b>Employment</b></p>
<h1>Makework</h1>

SINCE you cannot hear a hyphen, it was unclear whether Peter Lilley, the social security minister, was appealing in his conference speech this week in Bournemouth to the "hard-working classes" or the "hard working-classes". Both, probably; for this is the latest term for Essex man, Sierra man, the <font size=-1>C2</font>s whom the Tories fear they are losing to Labour. The swathe of employment and social-security measures announced or implemented this week is intended to persuade these people that the Tories are against dole-scroungers while Labour is in favour of them. On closer inspection, however, they reveal more similarities than differences. The changes fall into three broad categories:<br>
<li> <b><font size=-1> Cuttingcosts. </font> </b>The new Jobseeker's Allowance, introduced by the government on October 7th, cuts the period of time for which the newly-unemployed get unconditional benefits from a year to six months. At the end of six months, those who have more than &#163;4,000 in savings, or whose partner is working, will get no more benefits.<br></li>
<li><b><font size=-1> Fighting fraud. </font></b> The government is planning a bill that will allow different bits of government to swap more information; so the Benefits Agency will be able to check whether a claimant is also paying income tax or <font size=-1>VAT</font>--ie, also gainfully employed. A fraud inspectorate will be set up to tighten the administration of housing benefit, which the government calculates is costing it &#163;1 billion in fraudulent claims a year out of an &#163;11 billion budget. And the Benefits Agency will be given powers to impose fines for false claims: at present, because of the costs of prosecution, the government prosecutes in less than 10% of cases of suspected fraud.<br></li>
<li><b><font size=-1> Getting people into jobs. </font></b> Mr Lilley also used his speech to announce that private companies will be invited to tender for contracts to get people back to work, and will be paid by results. This follows the model of America Works, a company that provides such a service in several American states. And earlier in the week, the prime mininster announced an extension of Project Work, a workfare scheme which has been tried out in Hull and in Kent. Launched in April, it has so far covered 7,000 people; it will now be extended to cover 50,000.<br>
</li>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Project Work neatly illustrates the degree of consensus between the two main parties on the direction that future welfare reform should take. Workfare--no work, no benefits--is designed to do three things: to eliminate from the unemployment register those who are working on the black; to prevent the lazy from sitting on their backsides at the taxpayer's expense; and to reconnect the long-term unemployed with the world of work.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Project Work caters to people who have been out of work for more than two years. During the first 13 weeks, which are voluntary, it offers them help with looking for a job: the unemployed person gets a fortnightly session with an adviser, who will help with applications and phone employers. The next 13 weeks are compulsory: 18 hours of work a week with a voluntary organisation. Those who refuse to do it lose their benefits. The scheme runs from April 1996 to July 1997.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The scheme is not perfect. Richard Layard, an economist at the London School of Economics who has written extensively on the subject, reckons that a workfare scheme has a better chance of succeeding if it gets people before they have been out of work for so long; and he doubts that the compulsory period is long enough. "It doesn't seem at all serious." In any case, although pilot schemes are an excellent idea, extending them before they are finished or evaluated because you need something to announce at a party conference is not.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Early figures suggest that Project Work may be doing its stuff. According to Sandy Tulloch, district manager in Hull for the Employment Service, only 40% of those on the scheme wanted the initial 13 weeks' help in looking for work. Of the 2,100 people who have been through the project, only 182 found jobs. However, 475 have come off the register altogether. Presumably they had pressing engagements elsewhere. At that rate, the scheme should easily repay the &#163;6m it will cost for the 4,500 people who will go through it in Hull.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This tough-minded approach to welfare may well prove effective. Yet the Tories cannot claim sole ownership. Labour, after all, is offering a more expensive version of the same thing: unemployed people under 25, Labour has promised, will be offered a job or more education, and if they refuse, they will lose their benefits. Hard for the non-working classes; but appealing to the hard-working classes.<br>

<h1>Nursery lessons</h1>

A SPATE of press reports has claimed that the government's pilot scheme for nursery vouchers is in deep trouble. But these partly reflect the wishful thinking of the opponents of vouchers. When Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, sang the praises of vouchers at the Tory conference on October 10th, she seemed to have overcome her earlier doubts about them. Evidence from three of the four councils piloting vouchers contradicts a leaked memo from Westminster council, the fourth, which says they are a bureaucratic nightmare and are unlikely to create new nursery places.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Admittedly there have been some hitches. Kensington and Chelsea council says the system for distributing the vouchers, worth &#163;1,100 a year for each four-year-old, needs to be simplified, and that more effort must be made to explain the scheme to parents. It is also worried about the variation in standards between some private nursery providers. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But these problems are far from insurmountable, and Kensington also says there is "little doubt that the private sector will be interested in developing nursery provision, in part at least as a result of the voucher scheme." The other two pilot schemes--in London's Wandsworth and in Norfolk--have experienced no serious administrative problems, and both seem to have encouraged private and voluntary groups to create new places.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However they fare, the voucher experiments will be terminated prematurely next spring. If the Tories win the next election, they have promised to introduce vouchers nationwide whether or not their faults have been ironed out. More likely, Labour will win and scrap the voucher experiments without bothering to find out whether or not vouchers can create extra nursery places, at little extra public expense.<br>

<p><b>Civil Service</b></p>
<h1>After Butler</h1>

WITHIN months of taking office, the incoming British government will appoint the country's most powerful non elected official. Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, retires at the end of 1997, giving him just time to initiate a new government into the mysteries of office--and to allow it to appoint his successor.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since discretion is essential to the job, none of the probable candidates is conducting anything so crude as a campaign. But insiders have noted that <b>Hayden Phillips</b>, the 53-year-old permanent secretary of the Department of National Heritage and a former Brussels <i>chef de cabinet</i> to Roy Jenkins, has been putting himself about a bit. Lord Jenkins's enthusiasm is not echoed widely in Whitehall.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A lively choice would be<b> Richard Mottram</b>, 50, permanent secretary at defence, who previously ran the Office of Public Service and Science under Sir Robin. Mr Mottram has a more speculative mind than most mandarins, with an engaging ability to skirt close to indiscretion without ever crossing the line and actually saying anything indiscreet. He has in the past denied that he wants the job. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lively too would be <b>Richard Wilson</b>, 54, the permanent secretary at the Home Office. Mr Wilson was highly regarded as a hands-on manager in his previous job as permanent secretary at the Department of the Environment, but some Whitehall insiders question whether he could not have done better in the admittedly difficult task of handling Michael Howard, a populist home secretary. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A less extrovert choice, but perhaps Whitehall's favourite, would be <b>Andrew Turnbull</b>, 51, a former private secretary to Margaret Thatcher. Mr Turnbull, who succeeded Mr Wilson at environment, is reckoned both to have a good brain and to be a good manager. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, there is a further possibility: that Sir Robin will not have a successor at all. Labour is considering splitting his job so that there is one cabinet secretary and a separate head of the civil service. Sir Robin is resisting this, believing that his role as the prime minister's adviser has given him the clout needed to manage the powerful and relatively autonomous permanent secretaries who run individual government departments. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However if Labour wins and Sir Robin fails to persuade it of his view, a new candidate might come into the picture for the cabinet secretaryship. <b>Sir John Kerr</b>, 54, is Britain's ambassador in Washington. Aside from a spell in the Treasury, part of it as private secretary to Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe, his career has mostly been in the Foreign Office, leaving him short of experience in the home civil service. This might spark something of a revolt if he were appointed to run it. But Sir John is a legendary operator with a quicksilver intelligence and the stamina of an ox--just the qualities which a new government might appreciate in a cabinet secretary.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This would open the door for <b>Michael Bichard</b>, 49,<b> </b>the permanent secretary at the Department for Education and Employment, a rare example of a senior civil servant who really is enthusiastic about management, to take on the other half of the job as head of the home civil service.<br>

<p><b>Local by-elections</b></p>
<h1>High Tories</h1>

CONSERVATIVE support in local by elections has risen to its highest level for four years. The latest in <i>The Economist</i>'s regular survey of such results shows the Tories won 34% of the vote in wards fought by all three main parties betwen July and September (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>), only four percentage points behind Labour. They have not performed this well since 1992--the year in which they won the last general election. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The main cause of the change is not Labour weakness. Labour's share of the vote, although down by three percentage points from the third quarter of 1995, is actually 2.5 points up on the first half of this year. Rather, the Tory recovery is due to a weaker performance by the Liberal Democrats. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Lib Dem share of the vote, at 24%, is six percentage points lower than in the third quarter of 1995. In the same quarter three years ago, they were polling more votes in local government elections than either of the other big parties. However, they still do much better in local elections than nationally. Their local vote is almost double their national opinion-poll ratings.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With the general election now no more than seven months away, how does the Tory showing compare with those in the run-up to their last three successful general election campaigns? The good news for the Tories is that they are doing as well or better in local contests than they did before previous general elections. In the third quarter of 1982, they also polled 34% of the vote, but won easily in 1983; in the third quarter of 1986, 31% of the vote, before winning in 1987; and in the third quarter of 1991, 34% of the vote before winning in 1992. However, there is bad news for them too: Labour is running an average of 6% higher in local contests than it was in the corresponding period before its three defeats.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour has claimed some strong local by-election performances in recent weeks, at the expense of the Lib Dems. Moreover, an <font size=-1>NOP</font> poll in the <i>Sunday Times </i>gave it a 23% lead over the Tories, up four percentage points, reflecting its successful conference and new allegations of Tory sleaze.<br>

<p><b>Home shopping</b></p>
<h1>Home alone?</h1>

<font size=1>LONDON AND NEW YORK</font><p>
<p><b>Persuading American consumers to shop from home may depend more on traditional retailing skills than thrilling technology</b></p><br>
THE idea of doing your shopping from home, rather than visiting a store, spans over a century of American commerce. In 1893 Sears, Roebuck mailed out the first edition of its catalogue, from which the country's farmers were able to kit themselves out with everything from guns to Sunday-best suits. Pioneers could even find themselves a wife in a catalogue. Yet the idea still has a futuristic feel to it: the 21st-century couple lounging on their shiny bubble chairs and dictating orders to a sonorously deferential computer.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite all the hype about multimedia, old-fashioned catalogues still dominate the home shopping industry. They clocked up sales of almost $70 billion in America in 1995, according to the Direct Marketing Association (<font size=-1>DMA</font>), an industry group. Of that, some $43 billion was spent by consumers, the rest by businesses. In contrast, sales through infomercials or direct-response ads on television totalled $4.5 billion, $2.6 billion of which came from dedicated home-shopping channels. Sales of goods over the Internet and other on-line services were worth a mere $518m, estimates Forrester Research, a consultancy in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Catalogue shopping has been on a roll for the past decade and a half. The number of catalogues mailed in America rose from 8.7 billion in 1983 to 13.2 billion last year. The <font size=-1>DMA</font> forecasts that the industry's revenue will continue to grow at almost 7% a year for the rest of the decade, as it has since 1990. This growth is mostly driven by a large group of people spending increasing amounts on mail-order goods, rather than more people starting to buy them--59% of adult Americans already order from catalogues, and three-quarters of them spend more than $100 a year. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Clothing remains the most popular item sold through catalogues, followed closely by home furnishings. Computers and the software for them are also a big chunk of the business. Five of the top ten catalogue groups ranked by revenues are computer sellers (see <a href="wb1.gif">table</a>). The biggest general catalogue retailer, J.C. Penney, which also has a chain of department stores, depends mostly on clothing and furnishings.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are hitches. Last year, for example, the two main expenses of the catalogue business--postal charges and the cost of paper--both increased at the same time. But catalogue shopping still seems to have a number of things in its favour:<br>
<font size=-1></font> Various social changes, such as more women in work and greater worries about violence on the streets, have boosted home shopping.<br>
<font size=-1></font> State tax regulations mean that goods bought from a company in another state do not incur sales tax.<br>
<font size=-1></font> New computer technology allows retailers to target their customers with more precision, sorting through databases of names and addresses to work out who is likely to want, say, golf clubs and who would prefer china figurines.<br>
<font size=-1></font> As more companies shed central purchasing teams in bouts of downsizing, leaving individual departments to buy their own supplies independently, time strapped managers are increasingly turning to catalogues. As a result, sales to businesses are growing rapidly; the <font size=-1>DMA</font> predicts that they will represent 39% of all catalogue sales in 2001.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In theory, all of these advantages should particularly benefit more modern forms of home shopping. But the <font size=-1>TV</font>-based version seems stuck in something of a rut. Sales of Home Shopping Network (<font size=-1>HSN</font>), one of America's two leading networks, have been stuck at a little over $1 billion a year for the past five years. Those of <font size=-1>QVC</font>, its big rival, have risen from $1.2 billion in 1993 to $1.5 billion in 1995.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most of the pressure is now on <font size=-1>HSN</font>, which reported an operating loss in 1995 of $80m. Its owner, Barry Diller, a Hollywood mogul who used to run <font size=-1>QVC</font>, has restructured the company: in the past year about 300 jobs have gone from <font size=-1>HSN</font>'s headquarters in St Petersburg, Florida, where 1,800 telephonists and a large computer system can answer up to 50,000 calls an hour. Mr Diller has also brought in a new chief executive, James Held, who has ditched many of <font size=-1>HSN</font>'s clothing lines and focused the network around jewellery and cosmetics.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This reflects <font size=-1>TV</font> shopping's narrow audience. Some 85% of the shoppers are women, and the most popular category of goods is jewellery, which accounts for nearly 40% of the business. Other items include clothes, cosmetics and complicated fitness machines that are demonstrated by lots of healthy-looking presenters.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One reason that <font size=-1>TV</font> shopping has not prospered more is that, in a sense, it is a step backward from catalogues. The format-- goods paraded past the camera one after another--favours impulse buying rather than a search for something particular; it also attracts people with enough time on their hands to sit watching until something appealing flickers by. The average length of time spent watching <font size=-1>QVC</font> before the first purchase is made is 36 hours. The network tried to move up market in 1994 with <font size=-1>Q</font>2, a second channel that sold more expensive goods, but its failure to catch on with yuppies led the firm to recast <font size=-1>Q</font>2 simply as a "best of <font size=-1>QVC</font>" channel, showing repeats of successes from the main channel.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The thought of avoiding <font size=-1>TV</font> shopping's defects is what makes on-line shopping so exciting to people such as Mr Diller. Computers let customers navigate their way to the goods that they want when they want them. And their users certainly do not resemble stereotypical <font size=-1>TV</font> shoppers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At present, the biggest part of the on line market (around 25-30% of it) is made up of computer goods--hardware, software and books about them. Travel (20-25%) is the next biggest category. Forrester predicts that this mixture will stay much the same over the next four years, although the value of goods and services sold will grow to $6.6 billion by 2000. Other forecasters think the figure could be ten times this amount.<br>
<b> </b><br>
</p><p><b>The search for net profits</b><br>
Both <font size=-1>QVC</font> and <font size=-1>HSN</font> have started on-line enterprises--i<font size=-1>QVC</font> and the Internet Shopping Network (<font size=-1>ISN</font>) respectively. <font size=-1>ISN</font> is selling about $1m-worth of goods a month, vying with Amazon.com, a bookshop based in Washington state, and others as the most popular on-line merchant. At the moment <font size=-1>ISN</font> sells only computer goods, but Mr Diller intends to change that. Interactive searching, he argues, is worthwhile only if there is a wide range of goods to forage through. Amazon lists over 1m titles, more than any of its rivals, on-line or off. For its part, i<font size=-1>QVC</font> outdoes its television parent in the breadth of its stock, offering everything from power tools to pyjamas.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If offering a broader range of goods than your rivals is one big competitive advantage in on-line shopping, another is excellence in what traditional retailers like to call "supply-chain management". Taking an order on-line will be easier--customers will do most of the data-entry work that firms' telephone operators currently have to do with catalogue or <font size=-1>TV</font>-sales. But the warehousing and delivery of these goods will be fiendishly complex to organise.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Diller argues that this favours firms with experience in <font size=-1>TV</font> home-shopping: fulfilling orders fast and accurately is what <font size=-1>HSN</font> and <font size=-1>QVC</font> are geared up to do. But there is an important difference. The <font size=-1>TV</font>-shopping channels can broadly control the time when products are sold (most sales happen either while or soon after the infomercial is shown): this means that they can buy job lots of goods. With interactivity, orders may flow in over a much longer period. Rather than stock their warehouses with small runs of countless products, <font size=-1>ISN</font> and i<font size=-1>QVC</font> may be wiser to relay some orders directly to the manufacturer.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Amazon is an excellent example of why, even on the Internet, the intermediary still has a role. It distributes books for some 20,000 publishers, and guarantees its customers that it can deliver any book in print in the United States: 18 of its 106 staff deal with rare books (nearly a third are in warehousing and distribution). It keeps minimal stocks, at most a two-day supply of its 500 bestsellers in its warehouse; the rest it orders from publishers on demand. Some publishers say privately that they prefer selling through Amazon than through their own direct-sales operations. Unlike its slightly stale televisual rivals, Amazon offers interviews with authors. In short, it tries to make buying books easier for both consumers and manufacturers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A century ago, Richard Sears, a station telegrapher, used his country's new railways to distribute goods and build up his business. But Sears, Roebuck's strength was its range of merchandise and a solid reputation for quality, bolstered by generous guarantees. Even in today's on-line world, that is still a winning formula.<br>

<h1>Of spandex and software </h1>

<p><b>WordPerfect was once the proudest name in software. Now it is owned by one of the most shameless. And a good thing too</b></p> 
IT IS hard to believe that Michael Cowpland, Ottawa's most notorious challenger to taste and decorum, could really be a rival to Microsoft's Bill Gates. Mr Cowpland and his wife, Marilyn, drive matching Porsches, his blue, hers pink. Mrs Cowpland recently adorned the cover of a local magazine in a red spandex Santa suit (and sells far more risqu&eacute; stuff in her clothing store). Their massive glass-and-steel mansion, a smaller replica of Mr Cowpland's corporate headquarters, boasts two racquet courts as well as a ten-car garage, and has outraged neighbours in their otherwise staid suburb. Far from living and breathing software, Mr Cowpland prefers martial arts and tennis: he even schedules meetings around tennis championships.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His business methods are unorthodox too. The name of his first company, Mitel, now a large Canadian telecoms-equipment maker, originally stood for "Mike and Terry's Lawnmowers". Mr Cowpland and his partner had intended to make remote-controlled lawnmowers, but switched to electronics in the early 1970s. After he sold his share in Mitel in 1984, he started his current firm, Corel. It now leads the design-and-graphics software business. Corel's trademarks are garish ads (invariably embellished with rainbow-striped balloons), lots of different versions of its software and cheap package deals.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Corel has not yet managed to turn its market share into substantial profits (see <a href="wb2.gif">chart</a>). The average, boring software mogul would spend the next year or so sorting this out, all the time praising the Lord for having discovered at least one part of the industry that is Microsoft-free. Mr Cowpland, however, is neither average nor boring.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In January, Corel bought WordPerfect, the firm that introduced word processing to the world but then let Microsoft Word grab the market. Mr Cowpland paid just $11m in cash and $100m in shares, along with some royalty fees, to Novell, which had paid $800m for WordPerfect in 1994. Considering that WordPerfect, even in its current distressed state, still sells about $300m worth of software a year, its new owner could probably turn a profit by simply letting the franchise tick over. Instead Mr Cowpland is rejigging WordPerfect to challenge Microsoft in its most profitable business, the market for office "suites"--typically, a word-processor, spreadsheet, database and graphics program that work together.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At present this market is dominated by Microsoft's Office package. Ray Noorda, Novell's Microsoft-hating boss, had hoped that WordPerfect would be the torpedo to sink Mr Gates; instead it very nearly sank Novell. Mr Cowpland reckons that he can do better, thanks to two innovations. The first involves launching a new version of WordPerfect using all of Corel's hard-sell marketing tactics. That means bundling more software with the core word-processor and spreadsheet and pricing the product absurdly low. Although the list price is $260, anyone who claims he is swapping to it from a competing program need pay only $99. For corporate customers, the deal is even better: $895 for a version that can serve dozens of individual users. Microsoft, by comparison, charges about $200 per user for its suite.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Mr Cowpland's most daring move is a technical one. Corel is feverishly working on a version of the WordPerfect suite in Java, the Internet's hot new programming language. The advantage of Java is that it can run on any sort of computer, not just those running Microsoft's operating systems. A Java WordPerfect could run on the new wave of cheap "network computers", as well as on personal digital assistants (one of which Corel will be releasing itself next year) and other non-<font size=-1>PC</font> devices.<br>
</p><p><b>Back to the future</b><br>There is a bit of historical neatness to this: WordPerfect first made its name in the early days of personal computing by releasing a version for practically every sort of computer available, no matter how obscure. Rewriting the code for the particulars of each machine made releasing updated versions a logistical nightmare (the firm's headquarters was practically a museum of strange computers and obscure printers, all of which had to be supported). Now Java offers an opportunity to gain the same advantage without rewriting: the same software should run on any machine.<br></b>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Corel releases the first test versions of the Java WordPerfect suite on November 1st. There are plenty of technical hurdles to leap. But it is hard not to admire Mr Cowpland's courage. When Mr Noorda first rode WordPerfect into battle with Microsoft, Novell was one of the richest firms in the industry and dominated the networking sector that would soon emerge as the core of the Internet. Just two years later, it was losing money as a result of its WordPerfect wounds.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The same could happen to Mr Cowpland, whose financial cushion is even thinner. But many in the industry are rooting for him all the same. Microsoft, like all firms, needs competition, but since it took over in office suites it has had far too little. Java could change that. Mr Cowpland, his tennis outfit doubtless adorned with Corel balloons, deserves to take at least a set off Mr Gates.<br>

<h1>TECHNOLOGY BRIEF</h1>

<h2>Still a virtual reality</h2>
<p><b>Our third brief on the pitfalls facing new technologies looks at virtual reality and asks why it has not yet made dreams come true</b></p><br>
LOTS of new technologies promise to transform lives. Virtual reality (<font size=-1>VR</font>) is one--if the hype is to be believed. With the goggles, the gloves and the necessary gigabytes on a computer, it will be possible to create new worlds and fill them with beautiful people (or ugly ones--the choice is yours). It will require no more than slightly faster computers and slightly better gadgets for plugging people into them. The rise of <font size=-1>VR</font> is as inevitable as technological progress itself. Or so it was said.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In recent years, <font size=-1>VR</font>, which first emerged in the 1960s, has become a catch-all term for any computerised, interactive, real time, 3-<font size=-1>D</font> simulacrum, whether viewed on a stereoscopic headset or a single screen. Originally, however, it simply referred to what is now known as "immersive" virtual reality (<font size=-1>IVR</font>), in which users wear special headgear attached to a computer that gives them the impression of being in another environment.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There was no shortage of potential uses for <font size=-1>IVR</font>. It would enable designers to build and test a prototype aircraft without touching a screwdriver. Surgeons would be able to operate from afar. Soldiers would be able to control robotic tanks and aircraft. And, of course, there would be mind-boggling new games.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It would be astonishing if <font size=-1>IVR</font> had lived up to such great expectations. But even by more modest standards, it has been a disappointment. The global market for <font size=-1>VR</font> equipment-- immersive and otherwise--was only about $200m in 1995. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Technologies that replace existing ones must convince customers that they are better. Those that have no precursor must convince people that they are any good at all. <font size=-1>IVR</font> has been unable to do this for two main reasons.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;First, for many of its proposed uses, wearing a headset has no particular advantage over simply looking at a screen. Engineers can now design an entire aeroplane on computer, and then use <font size=-1>IVR</font> to simulate its manufacture and test its performance. But for most of this process, an immersed view is no more informative than a 3-<font size=-1>D</font> picture on a screen. Only when they need a pilot's-eye view--for example, to check that all the instruments are accessible--might they slip on the headgear. Even then, they may often prefer to have the computer draw a stick figure on the screen and calculate what is within its reach.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The same holds true for all computerised design: <font size=-1>IVR</font> and the fancy headset that goes with it are generally unnecessary. In many laboratories the headsets mostly sit idle, reserved for impressing visitors. (Some retailers cash in on this novelty value by using <font size=-1>IVR</font> to show customers the inside of a new house or car.) <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the technology could still be useful for creating environments in which to learn skills-- such as surgery or flying--or to do things--such as playing games--that would be expensive, dangerous, or even impossible in real life. Yet even here <font size=-1>IVR</font> is unable to make good its promises. The reason? The technology is still terrible. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The assumptions were only half right. Computers have got faster, but the peripherals have not kept pace.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The basic piece of <font size=-1>IVR</font> kit, dating back to the 1960s, is a bulky headset with a tiny screen for each eye. Usually, each screen shows a slightly different image, giving the illusion of 3-<font size=-1>D</font>. Attached wires or sensors track the wearer's head movements. From this, a computer providing the images works out what the user is looking at in the virtual scene, and draws it. For a deeper sense of immersion users may bedeck themselves with electronic pointers, earphones, gloves that monitor the shape of their hands, "haptic" devices that give the sensation of touching things, and even smell-emitters.<br>
<p><b><b>A distinct lack of vision</b><br>
</b>The point of being thus festooned is not to fool the wearer into thinking that he is somewhere real. The degree of immersion required depends on the application. Almost all these gizmos are still punishingly expensive and are mainly found in research laboratories. But for many uses--especially games, potentially the biggest single market-- just a headset should do, at least to start with.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But even the headsets turn customers off. Computers are still not powerful enough to eliminate "transport lag", the delay between moving your head and the image catching up. The field of view is narrow, typically just 10-20&#176; wide in games headsets, as against almost 180&#176; in real life. The depth of field feels wrong: whereas in real life looking at an object nearby causes objects in the distance to be out of focus, in <font size=-1>IVR</font> objects at all distances stay sharply defined. Finally, what the eye perceives-- such as motion--is not in synch with what the rest of the body feels. All this can lead to dizziness and disorientation, both during and after the experience.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Better systems do appear when uses are found for them. For example, at the Stanford Research Institute, animal trials of a "telesurgery" system are in progress. Video cameras in the operating theatre send stereoscopic images to the surgeon; robot arms give tactile feedback while replicating his actions. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble is that such systems are developed mostly by those, including universities and the military, who need sophisticated equipment that the mass market neither requires nor can afford. This, says Myron Krueger, a <font size=-1>VR</font> pioneer and the boss of Artificial Reality, a research company in Connecticut, may be why commercial <font size=-1>IVR</font> applications, and games in particular, have disappointed. Companies have yet to produce systems that are good enough and cheap enough for a broad audience, partly because they have yet to be convinced that the demand is there.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Virtuality, a British company that is the leading maker of <font size=-1>IVR</font> games, thinks it is. It has developed a $350 headset for home use that is about to be launched in Japan. This one has a wider field of view than its rivals (although the set will be monoscopic and will not track head movements). Virtuality hopes to do better than either Sega or Nintendo, two Japanese games makers that have launched unsuccessful <font size=-1>IVR</font> games products, or America's Hasbro, which last year wrote off tens of millions of dollars on a similar venture. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, even good headgear may not suffice. Stephen Ellis, a <font size=-1>VR</font> researcher at <font size=-1>NASA</font>, argues that, aside from games, <font size=-1>IVR</font> still lacks a "killer application"-- something to make it invaluable to the masses, not just specialists. It has been tried out for many things, from letting supermarket managers fiddle with new shop layouts to training people to overcome their phobias with huge images of spiders, but there is still no general-purpose use.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some hope the Internet will create one. <font size=-1>VRML</font>, a programming language developed for the Net, allows 3-<font size=-1>D</font> scenes to be put on Web sites easily. This might create the demand for a home <font size=-1>IVR</font> system. Satisfying it will simply require slightly faster computers and slightly better gadgets for plugging people into them . . .<br>

<h1 align=center>Can Israel rekindle peace?</h1>


WITH Israel and the Palestinians sliding into war, a restraining hand was vital. Bill Clinton offered it, and for that the world should be glad. But the relief may be short lived. Though the summons to Washington got Binyamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat talking to each other, nothing was resolved. The two will meet again, to talk again (see <a href="ir5984.html">page</a>). But it will be no more than a brief truce unless Israel's new government can be persuaded to acknowledge the underlying deal done by its predecessor: the return of occupied land in exchange for peace.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both Israelis and Palestinians were responsible for the violence that cost 58 Palestinians and 15 Israelis their lives last week. Yet outsiders-- friendly countries in Europe and Asia straightaway, America probably not until the bonds of the presidential election are loosened--need to concentrate their persuasion on the Israelis because it is they, since their change of government in May, who have virtually blown out the flame of peace. And it is they alone who can now relight it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Netanyahu rejects this. He went into the Washington talks in a bluster of indignation, demanding an assurance that Palestinian security forces would never again fire at their Israeli counterparts. It was terrible, indeed, that the distrust should have come to that. Law and order in the territories depend on the Israeli and Palestinian forces co-operating, not shooting at each other. Tensions snapped as Israeli soldiers fired at stone-throwing protesters across the checkpoints that divide Israel from autonomous Palestinian zones. The Palestinian police joined in. It should not have happened. It should not happen again. But frustration often begets violence. After nearly four months of Mr Netanyahu's prime ministership, many Palestinians had come to believe that the prospects for peace were so poor that they had little to lose by breaking the rules. They probably still do.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With difficulty, the immediate crisis is being sorted out, including the wretched tunnel whose opening set off the Palestinian protests--a trivial issue that has developed into a symbol of Israeli arrogance toward Muslim and Palestinian rights in East Jerusalem. But Israel still has to make up its mind on a much more fundamental matter. What should it do about the Oslo peace process, signed to general acclaim three years ago, but virtually halted by Mr Netanyahu?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Israel has four broad choices, of which one is probably untenable. That is its current policy of paying lip service to the peace process, expecting peace on the ground but acting provocatively. Mr Netanyahu's belief, repeated before and after his election, that the Palestinians are realists who will adjust to new firmness and to new limits is simply not true. Or rather it is not true that they will adjust peaceably--especially when they see changes to the status quo that are designed to destroy for ever their grander aspirations.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A second choice would be to seek to impose peace through force. Mr Netanyahu has threatened as much: he has declared himself ready to disarm the Palestinian police, thus enabling his government to continue on its current path without armed resistance. But that could not be attempted without entering Palestinian cities with maximum force, or without putting all the territories, Gaza included, back under military occupation. The bloodshed would be horrific, and the future black, without a trace of the security that Mr Netanyahu has promised his people.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A third, less bloody, choice would be to try to redefine the peace process by agreement. Mr Netanyahu hates the course set at Oslo. His interpretation of a permanent settlement for the Palestinians--including their status, the future of Jerusalem, the position of Jewish settlers--has nothing in common with Mr Arafat's. Maybe it makes no sense to embark, merely for the sake of talking, on the final negotiations that were officially launched in May, when Israel was still ruled by the Labour government of Shimon Peres. They would get nowhere. Better perhaps for Israel to reach a tacit understanding with the Palestinians to implement the interim accords but put longer-term matters on hold. The Palestinians would consolidate what they have--and go back to waiting.<br>
<b><br>
</p><p><b>Best to be bold</b></b><br>
One difficulty is that the Palestinians' patience might not prove infinite. Another is that, for this option to work, Mr Netanyahu would have to honour his promise to carry out the commitments made by Mr Peres. That does not mean, as he suggests, renegotiating terms that have already been laboriously negotiated; it means implementing them with minor modifications. It also means, and this is even harder for Mr Netanyahu's men, that Israel should not pre-empt a final settlement by turning the West Bank into a network of roads and the outskirts of East Jerusalem into vast Jewish suburbs. To do that would merely turn this option into a variant of the untenable present course.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fourth and boldest choice for Mr Netanyahu would be to confound both his friends and his enemies. He could avoid the obstacles of an interim accord, all of them immensely difficult for a rightist-religious coalition, by leaping swiftly ahead to the big one: a final settlement. In doing this, he would be following a line of precedents. Hardline governments, from time to time, have pulled off coups that had eluded their more liberal predecessors: Menachem Begin made peace with Egypt, Richard Nixon opened the road to China. Now, if he is up to it, it could be Mr Netanyahu's turn.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the aim would not, with the taste of violence still on the tongue, be to seek some sort of cosy peace. The key word, these days, is "separation". This is an admission of defeat, perhaps. Yet, for the security of both, the Israeli and Palestinian peoples may need to hold themselves separate. This has been done, often enough, on a temporary basis by not allowing Palestinians into Israel. A permanent way of achieving much the same result would be to allow the Palestinians their own state, and draw a firm frontier between it and Israel.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Without ever publicly saying so, Israel's Labour government was coming to see a separate Palestinian state as the most feasible answer to the problem of co-existence. A map had been secretly drawn, clustering most of the Jewish settlements in the West Bank in a new, safely Israeli, bulge of the old green line--an adjustment that would cause endurable pain to both sides. It was a good compromise, but Yitzhak Rabin and Mr Peres were both too cautious to back it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A chance for Mr Netanyahu to show up his predecessors' lack of courage? Why not? If the candle of peace is not soon relit, the next spark will set off a conflagration, perhaps extending far into the Arab world. None of the ways forward is safe--and standing still could be the most dangerous of all. Given the choices, the boldest step could be the safest.<br>

<h2>By Kabul ford</h2>
<p><b>Taliban forces </b>occupied Kabul, the Afghan capital, executed a former communist president, Najibullah, and imposed strict Islamic law. They prepared to attack the Panjshir valley, stronghold of Ahmad Shah Masoud, the military chief of the country's ousted government.</p>
<p>In response, Russia called for a summit of leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States to discuss <b>Afghanistan</b>, amid fears that the taking of Kabul could strengthen the hand of Islamic rebels in neighbouring Tajikistan. Alexander Lebed, Russia's national security adviser, said Russia should help the Afghan government, driven out by the Taliban.</p>
<p><b>Kashmir</b>'s National Conference party, which wants the state to remain part of India, swept to victory in the first local elections since a separatist revolt broke out in 1990. </p>
<p>Myanmar's military government blockaded the home of <b>Aung San Suu Kyi </b>after she called a meeting of her National League for Democracy. Soldiers detained more than 500 of her supporters, later releasing 163.</p>
<p>New Zealand apologised to a <b>Maori tribe </b>for occupying its land 131 years ago and hanging its chief. The government agreed to pay NZ$40m ($27.6m) in compensation.</p>
<h2>Bleak talks</h2>
<p>After being summoned for two days of<b> crisis talks</b> on the Middle East as Bill Clinton's guests at the White House,<b> </b>Binyamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat could agree on nothing, except to continue negotiating when they returned home. Jordan's King Hussein was in attendance but Egypt's President Mubarak declined, reflecting the Arab belief that Mr Clinton was not prepared to exert real pressure on Israel to save the peace process.</p>
<p><b>Palestinians</b> in the West Bank and Gaza remained under strict "internal closure", unable to leave their neighbourhoods. Israeli tanks ringed their cities, and the army threatened to shoot anyone coming near checkpoints. A Palestinian demonstrator was killed near Hebron.</p>
<p>Commonwealth ministers abandoned talk of sanctions against <b>Nigeria</b>, agreeing to send a fact-finding mission-- and even that without guarantees, demanded earlier, that it would be able to meet opposition groups.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<h2>Petty cash</h2>
<p>Before Congress adjourned for <b>serious campaigning</b>, the Senate and the House of Representatives passed a $400 billion budget, ensuring that the American government could continue to operate while its representatives were on the road.</p>
<p>Congress also sent Bill Clinton a bill to strengthen <b>the border patrol </b>and to increase criminal penalties against smuggling aliens and document fraud. The Republicans wanted much tougher legislation that would have prevented illegal aliens receiving benefits. </p>
<p>Governor Pete Wilson of California signed a bill, the first of its kind, barring the state government from buying goods made in <b>labour camps</b>.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court agreed to decide the constitutionality of state laws that stop doctors assisting terminally ill people to commit <b>suicide</b>.</p>
<p><b>Colombia</b> saw more clashes between guerrillas and army. Six government men died in one day.</p>
<h2>Converging</h2>
<p>Several members of the European Union presented budgets designed to make them fit for <b>economic and monetary union</b>. Italy shocked financial markets by doubling its planned savings for next year, giving the country an outside chance of qualifying for <font size=-1>EMU</font> in 1999. Spain and Belgium unveiled tough fiscal programmes as well.</p>
<p>France's prime minister, Alain Jupp<e-acute>, won a <b>vote of confidence</b> in parliament, despite recent sniping from members of his own party. Mr Jupp<e-acute> defended his austere 1997 budget plan and promised action to reduce rising unemployment. Teachers staged a 24-hour strike against the budget.</p>
<p>Annual <b>inflation</b> in the European Union fell to a record low of 2.3% in August. Sweden's inflation rate of 0.3% was Europe's lowest; Greece's 8.5% rate was the highest. In all, nine of the 15 members had inflation rates below 2%.</p>
<p>The <font size=-1>UN</font> Security Council voted formally to end economic sanctions against <b>Serbia </b>after western observers approved the results of Bosnia's election. But Serbia is still excluded from the <font size=-1>UN</font> and international financial institutions like the World Bank.</p>

<h2>Bull run</h2>
<p>(See <a href="bw1.gif">chart</a>)<br><b>American shares </b>powered upwards, taking the Dow Jones through 5,900 for the first time. The dollar squeaked above &#165;112 to a 32 month high, helped by weak Japanese production figures and a boost from housing starts in America. Bullishness invaded European markets too, with record highs in London--the <font size=-1>FTSE100</font> rising above 4,000--and several other markets. America's Treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, speaking at the World Bank meeting in Washington, <font size=-1>DC</font>, said the world economic outlook was the best in a "long, long time".</p>
<p>The European Union--supported by Canada--is to seek a ruling from the World Trade Organisation over whether America's recent <b>anti-Cuba legislation</b> violates international trade law.</p>
<p>Gold shares were pummelled after <b>gold</b> dropped through $380 an ounce, to stand about 9% down on its February high for the year.</p>
<h2>Downhill</h2>
<p>Shares in <b>Olivetti</b> fell after the Italian technology group admitted its net debt nearly doubled in only two months to almost 2.4 trillion lire ($1.6 billion) at the end of August and after a critical internal auditors' report. The loss making group has been spiralling downwards since the departure of Carlo De Benedetti as chairman some weeks ago, followed by more top executives amid accusations of false corporate reporting.</p>
<p>Germany's engineering union, <font size=-1>IG</font> Metall, promised a showdown if companies such as <b>Daimler-Benz</b>, which last week quickly took advantage of new rules to cut sick pay, pressed ahead with plans to renegotiate fringe benefits. Workers have been holding lightning strikes and stoppages in protest.</p>
<p><b>Eurotunnel</b> and its creditor banks at last reached agreement in principle on restructuring the Channel tunnel operator's &#163;8.8 billion ($13.8 billion) debt, repayment of which was suspended a year ago. Eurotunnel shares were themselves suspended as these negotiations were going on. <font size=-1>P&O</font> and Stena Lines are merging their Dover Straits ferry operations to compete with the tunnel.</p>
<p>Sweden's Autoliv, Europe's biggest maker of <b>airbags </b>and seatbelts, is to merge with a rival unit owned by America's Morton International to form a new company, with sales of around $3 billion, in control of 40% of the airbag market across America, Japan and Europe. No price was given. Morton will be left with its specialty-chemicals and salt business.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>Koninklijke <font size=-1>PTT</font> Nederland, a Dutch post and telecoms group, launched a $1.6 billion bid for Australian-based <b>TNT</b>, a worldwide courier service that recommended the offer to its shareholders. Combined, the new outfit would have annual revenues of over A$6 billion ($4.7 billion) and operate in 200 countries. </p>
<p>(See <a href="bw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>Wayne Huizenga's ambitious plans to merge his fast-growing Republic Industries with <b>ADT</b>, America's biggest electronic-security business, with car-auction operations on the side, finally came unstuck. Investors took a dim view of the $4.4 billion all-share deal when it was announced on July 1st; Republic's shares took a battering then and began recovering only when investors felt the deal could founder.</p>
<p>A planned international offering of depositary receipts in <b>Gazprom</b>, Russia's biggest firm and the world's biggest gas producer, was overshadowed at home by a row over unpaid taxes. Faced with a government claim for an estimated $2.8 billion, Gazprom said that it was being unfairly targeted. The government announced it had drawn up a list of Russia's biggest tax debtors and was pursuing them all. </p>
<p><b>House of Fraser</b>, a British department-store chain, announced a deeper pre-tax loss of &#163;13.6m ($20.8m) in the first half, including a &#163;4.9m charge on the disposal of one of its stores, compared with a &#163;4.3m loss for the same period last year. The group said it will close up to ten of its 50 stores, centralise its distribution system and revive its women's wear sales, a restructuring that could cost as much as &#163;50m.</p>
<h2>Exchange changes</h2>
<p>After nine months of consultation with its members, the <b>London Stock Exchange </b> published a manifesto for change. The document maps out a move towards automated order-driven trading, which will replace a more costly quote-driven system, reliant on privileged market makers.</p>
<p>All change in <b>British insurance</b>. Norwich Union said it would convert from a mutually owned company to a publicly quoted one. And the Prudential Corporation, another life insurer, launched a branchless bank.</p>
<p>(See <a href="bw3.gif">chart</a>)<br><b>Global bond issues</b> have soared so far this year to a record $509 billion, already outstripping a full-year total of $465 billion for 1995, with the top ten bookrunners taking half the business. Two Japanese houses, Nomura and Daiwa, slid out of the top ten.</p>
<p>As much as a third of British bookmakers' &#163;100m ($156m) annual profits may have been wiped out, and one issued a profits warning, after one jockey, Frankie Dettori, swept the board to ride <b>all seven winners </b>at a race meeting at Ascot.</p>

<h1>Economists for Clinton</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC </font><p>
IT IS a sad reflection of the state of the presidential campaign that Bob Dole, a man not known for telegenic brilliance, is counting on a sparkling performance in Sunday's debate to revive his fortunes. Worse, judging by the results of a poll (see <a href="am1.gif">chart</a>) by <i>The Economist</i>, Mr Dole has already lost one of the groups whose approval he most craves: economists. We randomly selected 60 macroeconomists at America's top 15 universities (around half the total number). Almost 70% responded to our survey. By a margin of almost three to one, the academics reckon that a second Clinton term would be better for America's economy.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given how much Mr Dole touts the academic respectability of his economic plan, these results are surprising. In a new newspaper advertisement, the Dole plan is lauded by Nobel laureates and endorsed by over 100 economists. "This is an excellent economic programme," writes Milton Friedman. "The Dole Economic Growth Plan is much superior to the Clinton do nothing alternative," says James Buchanan, another Nobel laureate. Eminent supporters perhaps, but it seems that many of their colleagues disagree. The general verdict seems to be satisfaction at the first Clinton administration and scepticism about Mr Dole's economic promises. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;First, we asked our boffins to grade Mr Clinton's economic record, much as they would evaluate a student's performance. Just under 30% of the academics award Mr Clinton an <font size=-1>A</font>; 51% give him a <font size=-1>B</font>. Only one judges that Mr Clinton has flunked on the economy, and gives him an <font size=-1>E</font>. Pollsters often put Mr Clinton's double-digit lead in the opinion polls down to a well-performing economy. The experts' verdict seems to bear out what ordinary Americans feel.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately for Mr Dole, our economists are distinctly unimpressed with the centrepiece of his economic platform--big tax cuts. Only 22% support his ambitious tax plan, while 46% prefer Mr Clinton's modest tax-tinkering proposals (and a hefty 32% do not like either). "Both  are bad, but Clinton's is less irresponsible," is a typical view. Those who approve of the Dole plan are at least entertainingly honest about the reason for their support: "I helped prepare it," was one comment; "I will pay less taxes," was another. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Overall, however, few think that Mr Dole's numbers add up. Only one in five professors reckons Mr Dole will be able to recoup as much of the cost of tax cuts through higher revenue as he hopes, and even fewer accept his claims about cutting taxes and balancing the budget by 2002 without further restraint on Medicare and defence spending. Mr Dole's belief that this achievement is just a matter of "presidential will" cuts little ice with the experts.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A surprising slice of economists (49%) even takes issue with Mr Dole's basic assumption--that growth should be America's top economic-policy priority. For many, questions of income distribution and poverty are higher on the agenda. Others have more esoteric priorities: one professor thinks that legalising drugs should be one of America's top economic concerns. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The academics are equally wary of Republican claims that America's economic growth rate can, in fact, be dramatically boosted. In our poll, only 5% think that America's trend rate of non-inflationary growth could realistically be raised above 3% a year. Around one-third reckon it could be bumped up to between 2.6% and 3%. But most (almost 60%) say an economy growing at 2.5% or less is the most realistic target.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We asked our experts to grade various policies according to their growth-enhancing potential. Again, the idea of tax cuts fares poorly. Only a small minority of our economists (12%) believe that a cut in marginal tax rates--with corresponding spending cuts--would have a major impact on growth. A larger group (41%) think it might have a minor impact, but 34% reckon such cuts would have a negligible effect. Were the tax cuts not accompanied by spending cuts, almost half the professors think the impact on growth would be harmful. Only one policy option is even less popular: looser monetary policy. Six out of ten economists reckon that this would be harmful for long-term growth.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ironically, perhaps, some of Mr Dole's other proposals find strong support among the boffins. More than four out of five think that education reform would give a major (51%) or minor (34%) boost to growth rates. In fact, when asked to give their top three priorities for raising growth rates, over 70% of the academics mention education. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One in four believes a lighter regulatory burden would make a big difference to growth rates; almost 50% say it would provide a small boost. And more than eight out of ten reckon that tax reform towards consumption taxes could help growth (24% predict the effect would be big; 61% say it would be minor). All told, 63% of the economists support fundamental tax reform, with the flat tax emerging as the most popular option. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite this strong support for radical tax changes, America's top economists seem an unradical lot. When asked which party combination between the White House and Congress they would prefer for the next four years, over 50% want divided government: ie, a Democratic president and at least one chamber of Congress held by Republicans. Only one in four would like to see Democrats in charge on the Hill and in the White House; even fewer (17%) want Republicans running both places. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not only do few top economists want Mr Dole in the White House; even fewer seem prepared to help him if he ever gets there. Only 5% of our respondents admit they would take a job in a Dole administration. One-third would accept a job in a Clinton administration, and almost 60% say they would turn down any offer. Too high-minded for the hurly-burly of Washington? Or not to be taken too seriously?<br>

<h1>Israelis divided</h1>

<font size=1>JERUSALEM </font><p>
LAST week's bloodshed has hardened Israelis in their polarised beliefs. Peace Now, a grassroots movement, staged a large anti-government demonstration in Tel Aviv on October 1st. But pro-government demonstrators too were filling the streets. Their red and blue banners, "Be Strong and of Good Courage", greet motorists driving from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Early polls show a we-told-you-so reaction from both sides of the divide. The right, whose slogan two years ago was, "Don't give them  guns", feel vindicated. On the left, politicians and demonstrators are demanding an inquiry into Mr Netanyahu's decision to open the tunnel--a demand fuelled by the continuing efforts of the defence minister, the army senior command and the Shin Bet security service to distance themselves from the timing of that decision.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In Washington, Mr Netanyahu confounded the politicians plotting his downfall. At the height of last week's violence, he blustered in public, but seemed at a loss for what to do. Mutterings began to be heard even within his own camp about his fitness for the job. Some Likud old-timers have always regarded the 46-year-old, American educated Mr Netanyahu as an<i> arriviste</i> lightweight and (with hindsight) see his decision to open the tunnel as a product of inexperience and brashness.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In former times, a groundswell would have developed to replace Mr Netanyahu with another Likud figure. But under the reformed Israeli constitution, a prime minister is directly elected and hard to shift. And Mr Netanyahu's firmness in Washington has, at least for now, silenced his critics. The jubilant right, across its spectrum, has hailed him as a hero.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The left is close to despair, its one hope for peace being that a re-elected Mr Clinton will apply the pressure he dare not apply now. The crisis had ignited the Labour opposition's hope of being invited to join a government of national unity. With that in mind, diehard supporters of Shimon Peres gathered on October 2nd to demand that he stay on indefinitely as leader of the Labour Party. Under its rules, the party must vote for a new leader within 14 months of an electoral defeat. Mr Peres, 73, has said he will not stand again, and half-a-dozen candidates, headed by Ehud Barak, a former foreign minister and army chief of staff, would be happy to succeed him. But with the peace process on the verge of dying, said his supporters, Labour must not jettison the man who largely brought it into being and may yet be called on to revive it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One man could force Mr Netanyahu to broaden his government: Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, spiritual mentor of the Sephardic-religious party, Shas, which, with ten seats, is a pivotal coalition ally. On September 29th, both Mr Peres and Mr Netanyahu made (separate) Feast of Tabernacles calls on him. He merely requested the rivals to "consult", which they dutifully did.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In the occupied territories, the settlers are now rejoicing. And the army is poised to deal the Palestinians devastating punishment. Senior officers say they have been ordered to use all the firepower they need to crush any renewed assaults on military checkpoints or other targets by Palestinian civilians or policemen. The army is smarting, particularly, over an episode on September 26th, when six soldiers were killed in a fight at a Jewish holy site in Nablus. Next time, says the army, we go in with tanks, barrels blazing if necessary. The tanks are already in position.<br>

<h1>Under threat</h1>

<font size=1>RAMALLAH </font><p>
IT WAS the worst violence in the occupied territories since 1967: 73 people killed, 58 of them Palestinian, and 1,500 injured. Palestinians hope that last week's fighting will convince everybody that the Oslo peace process cannot endure under the terms dictated by Israel's hardline prime minister. But they fear the worst, and the news from Washington confirmed their gloom: the peace process is "on the verge of collapse", said the mayor of Hebron. In Jerusalem Faisal Husseini, the <font size=-1>PLO</font>'s top man there, said he "was never as pessimistic as today".<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Israelis, in their fashion, seem to agree. After last week's fighting, they slapped an "internal closure" on the West Bank and Gaza. Some 2m Palestinians are immobilised, within their local "autonomous areas", with Israeli tanks ringing the main cities and helicopter gunships at the ready. Even the sick are barred from moving from their homes in one area to hospitals in another. Under orders from Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian police are keeping people away from Israeli army checkpoints. Wisely: the army has said it will shoot on sight any Palestinian who comes near its soldiers. Already, on October 2nd, one demonstrator near Hebron was shot dead and others wounded.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ominously, the army has suspended all joint patrols with the Palestinian police, pending a "thorough investigation" into the breakdown of security co-ordination which led to gun battles between the two forces. Palestinians can guess what this means. The Oslo process is predicated on co-operation between the two forces. If this is abandoned, so too is Oslo. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Were the gun battles the result of a calculated gamble by Mr Arafat to force Mr Netanyahu's hand and get the process moving again? So the Israeli government says. Palestinians believe that once their demonstrations were met by Israeli army gunfire--and that was the sequence of events in Ramallah and Gaza last week--the Palestinian police were bound to fire back.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet Mr Arafat certainly decided to raise the stakes, after Mr Netanyahu authorised a new exit from the tunnel in Jerusalem's Old City. A month earlier he had a poor response when he called on Palestinians to converge on Jerusalem in protest at Israel's decision to demolish a centre for disabled Palestinians and build 900 new homes for Jewish settlers. His people muttered darkly that Mr Arafat was losing support.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The tunnel business gave him a chance to regain it. He called on Palestinians to resist Israel's "Judaisation of Jerusalem". He did not spell out how they should resist. But after nearly 30 years of occupation, and seven of <i>intifada</i>--the popular uprising that began in 1987--he did not need to.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The difference now is the presence of some 40,000 Palestinian policemen, with weapons, albeit only light ones. In East Jerusalem--from where they are excluded-- the protests were all-civilian, though even so three Palestinians were killed after demonstrations outside al-Aqsa mosque. But in the Palestinian areas of the West Bank and Gaza,<i> intifada</i> rules no longer apply. Last week the incendiary mix of the Israeli army, the Palestinian police and stone-throwing civilians exploded. The policemen's controllers in the Palestinian Authority (<font size=-1>PA</font>) admit that they lost control. So, therefore, did Mr Arafat.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He did, however, recover it. By the weekend, Gaza was quiet, and Bethlehem and Ramallah under control. In Nablus, where the Israeli army lost six soldiers after trying to protect the besieged, Israeli-controlled, religious site known as Joseph's Tomb, the Palestinian police imposed a curfew on their own people.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Israeli government is demanding that the <font size=-1>PA</font> dismiss and prosecute those policemen--some 200 of them, says the Israeli army--who shot at Israeli soldiers. This will not happen. In Washington, Mr Arafat committed himself to a general end to violence. But he is not going to condemn members of his security forces for defending their own people. To do so would further undermine his leadership. It would also risk fracturing his security forces, on which he depends.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And Oslo? "The peace process is already dead, and has been since Mr Netanyahu was elected," says Marwan Barghouti, Fatah's leader in the West Bank. "Our protests are aimed at restoring it to life." Should the resuscitation fail, Mr Barghouti is clear what comes next. "War," he says.<br>

<p><b>Conservative Party 2</b></p>
<h1>A right lot </h1>

WIN or lose, the Conservative Party seems sure to lurch to the right after the general election, a special <i>Economist </i> survey of prospective parliamentary candidates suggests. Moreover, supposing the party is defeated and John Major resigns, the survey also indicates that the intake of new <font size=-1>MP</font>s will boost John Redwood's chances of becoming the Tory leader.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The survey was conducted between July and September among prospective Tory candidates in 75 seats where the present Tory <font size=-1>MP</font> had indicated an intention to stand down--ie, seats where prospective Tory candidates have the best chance of entering Parliament. Of these candidates, 46, or 61% of the total, sent usable replies. We also surveyed all the retiring Tory <font size=-1>MP</font>s in the same constituencies, asking them the same set of questions. Of these, 40% replied.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We tested opinion in three spheres of policy. Naturally, one was Europe, where we sought to measure Euroscepticism and attitudes towards a single European currency. Another was social liberalism, where our chosen indicator was their attitude to the death penalty. Another was economic wetness or dryness, where we asked whether they would favour tax cuts even if they meant spending less on health, education and social benefits. We also asked how they would vote in a post-election leadership contest.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The prospective candidates turn out to be a formidably right-wing lot. On Europe first, we asked them to rank themselves on a scale of one to five, one being the most pro European and five the most anti-European. Their score averaged 4.1: strongly sceptical. By comparison, among the retiring <font size=-1>MP</font>s, the average answer was 3.2. Not a single prospective candidate gave a pro-European answer of one or two. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Again, among the 46 Conservative candidates who replied, not one favoured a single currency. Indeed most of them were very hostile to the idea. By contrast, although some retiring <font size=-1>MP</font>s who replied were for a single currency and others against it, they fall on average roughly in the middle of the five-point scale.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although there is no chance of Parliament restoring the death penalty, the prospective candidates favour it, by a three-to one majority. By contrast, retiring Tory <font size=-1>MP</font>s are evenly divided. Moreover, two-thirds of candidates want tax cuts even at the expense of spending cuts. Only a quarter of retiring <font size=-1>MP</font>s felt that way.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As for a future leadership contest, most of our respondents, among both retiring <font size=-1>MP</font>s and new candidates, kept their counsel. In both groups a dozen or so possible candidates have some support. But among the prospective candidates, the name of John Redwood is the most often cited (by eight), while several others back the alternative right-wing contenders, Michael Howard and Michael Portillo. Four retiring <font size=-1>MP</font>s cited Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, as their preferred candidate for leader. He was not mentioned by a single prospective candidate.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A few warnings should be attached to these findings. First, the sample among retiring <font size=-1>MP</font>s was small, and may have a left wing bias since <font size=-1>MP</font>s who are fed up with the rightward drift of the Conservative Party may have been the most likely to take the opportunity of our survey to register their protest. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Second, we do not know how many of these candidates will actually make it into Parliament. If there is a strong anti-Tory swing at the next general election, many may lose the seats they are fighting. Finally, Westminster has a famously cooling effect on firebrands. Once they get there, many candidates may moderate their views. Labour's ranks in the Commons are full of <font size=-1>MP</font>s who today follow Tony Blair but who once followed Tony Benn.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, on the eve of the Tory party conference, our survey will give valuable ammunition to the Labour Party. The Tories have campaigned on the slogan: "New Labour, New Danger." On this evidence, Labour could respond "New Tory, New Danger" with more justification.<br>

<p><b>Conservative Party 3</b></p>
<h1>A forgiving lot </h1>

SHOULD John Major lose the general election, the favourite choice of Tory voters for the next leader is . . . John Major. More than a quarter of Tory voters want him to stay (see <a href="br1.gif">table</a>). He leads Michael Heseltine, preferred by 16%, with Margaret Thatcher the surprising third choice.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ostensibly, the Tory party conference, which opens in Bournemouth on October 8th, is about winning the election. But the succession to Mr Major is top of the real agenda. <i>The Economist</i> commissioned <font size=-1>MORI</font> to conduct an opinion poll to see whom voters wanted for the job. The firm interviewed 1,800 voters between September 20th and September 23rd.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Arguably, although Mr Major came top of the poll among Tory voters, after a defeat the party should be looking for the candidate with most appeal to voters generally. Here Mr Heseltine came top, though with only 16% of the vote. Mr Major was the second choice, with Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and John Redwood, the leading Eurosceptic, next.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Conservatives are famously loyal to their leaders--at least until they decide to ditch them. This is borne out not only by Mr Major's strongish showing, but by that of Lady Thatcher, six years after she was deposed by her own <font size=-1>MP</font>s. But the poll also shows that candidates on the left of the party, such as Mr Heseltine and Mr Clarke, run strongest. This is partly because they have held senior government jobs for longer than their rivals, and are therefore better known.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, the two most right-wing and Eurosceptical of the candidates are also favoured by many voters. Mr Redwood, in particular, features remarkably well for a man whose highest office was Welsh secretary. In contrast, the most regularly cited compromise candidates do badly. Messrs Dorrell, Lang and Rifkind manage between them the support of only 3% of Tory voters and 4% of the general public. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, the next leader is not chosen by the public but by Tory <font size=-1>MP</font>s. The compromise candidates remain relatively unknown by the public, although clearly this would change rapidly for any one of them who got the job. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, voters in general and Tory voters in particular seem to want any new leader to come from candidates on the extremes of the Tory party rather than those at its centre. After a defeat, therefore, and on current showings, Conservative <font size=-1>MP</font>s might have to choose between a candidate with voter appeal and a candidate able to reunite their party. Perhaps the idea of keeping Mr Major on is not such a bad one after all.<br>

<h1>Learning to earn </h1>

THE squeeze in government funding is beginning to hurt even Britain's richest universities. On October 1st, when Alec Broers became Cambridge's new vice-chancellor, he said his university would be in deficit within four years unless it found new sources of income. Some old fogeys may grumble at having to "dirty their hands with commerce", but Cambridge and its arch-rival Oxford are realising that the only way to pay for world-class laboratories and researchers is to exploit the fruits of their work more energetically.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The appointment of Mr Broers is a sign of such changing attitudes. Unlike his predecessors, he has spent much of his career in industry: for 20 years, he worked for <font size=-1>IBM</font>, an American computer giant. He promises that in seeking to boost the university's private income, he will consider "any reasonable proposal", such as letting firms set up their own laboratories within the university, or creating joint ventures in which the university holds a stake.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although Cambridge has already had a fair amount of success in fostering a cluster of growing high-tech firms in its science parks, Mr Broers wants his researchers to think big, and to model themselves on Hewlett-Packard--once a small firm sheltering in the shadow of California's Stanford University, now a giant multinational with annual sales of $30 billion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Oxford has lagged behind Cambridge in creating spin-off companies. Now it is starting to catch up. Oxford Science Park is expanding rapidly, and Brian Richards, an entrepreneur who has founded a string of biotechnology firms, has been recruited to oversee a more ambitious strategy at Isis Innovation, a company set up to market the university's intellectual-property rights.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last month Sharp, a Japanese electronics firm, opened a &#163;5m extension to its laboratory in the science park. A second building was also opened, to provide larger premises for five of the park's other fast growing firms. Further building work is about to start. The park now has a waiting list of would-be technology entrepreneurs queueing to get in.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Paul Drayson, managing director of Oxford BioSciences, a firm spun out of the university's medical-engineering unit, is convinced that Oxford is about to witness an explosion of innovation in disciplines such as his. He is urging the science park's managers to accelerate the park's expansion so that the university's keen young researchers do not take their ideas elsewhere.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Encouraging such entrepreneurship, while making sure that the university gets its share of the proceeds, is Isis Innovation's primary task. Up to now, it has tried to sell most of the university's good ideas to big firms. Mr Richards is planning a more adventurous strategy: he wants researchers to set up more companies to exploit their own ideas commercially, with the university as a shareholder. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Isis Innovation has been hampered by hostility from a few academics who see it as a sort of Frankenstein's monster in their midst and who abhor the very idea of the university getting into bed with industry. Mr Richards admits that overcoming such opposition is one of his main challenges, and that this will limit the amount of money that the university will allow him to spend on fostering high-tech spin-offs. But fortunately, claims Mr Richards, such old fashioned attitudes are waning. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It will be years before Oxford and Cambridge earn anything like as much from their private-sector spin-offs as the &#163;180m a year of government research funding they now share. But the potential exists: Oxford Science Park's star performer is Oxford Molecular, which makes software for drug design and now has a stockmarket value of &#163;196m--which means that the university's 6% shareholding is worth almost &#163;12m.<br>

<p><b>Airline alliances</b></p>
<h1>Too cosy </h1>

FEW industrial battles are fought for higher stakes than competition for airline slots. Ian Lang, the secretary of state for trade and industry, is coming under increasing pressure from his cabinet colleagues to nod through the proposed alliance between British Airways (<font size=-1>BA</font>) and American Airlines, two of the world's biggest airlines, without insisting on strict conditions that would reduce their dominance of transatlantic routes.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to authoritative sources in Whitehall, Mr Lang was advised this week by John Bridgeman, the director-general of the Office of Fair Trading (<font size=-1>OFT</font>), that the alliance should be approved without a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The <font size=-1>OFT</font> originally took a hawkish stance, insisting that the two airlines should hand over to competitors up to a quarter of the landing and take-off slots they control at Heathrow. <font size=-1>BA</font> alone has 38% of the slots out of London. The combined share with American Airlines and other airlines with which both firms are allied would be nearly 50%. Only a significant divestment of slots, the <font size=-1>OFT</font> first concluded, could reduce the competitive advantage that <font size=-1>BA</font> and American Airlines would gain from their alliance.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, it appears that the <font size=-1>OFT</font> has considerably diluted these conditions after hearing the two airlines' arguments. The <font size=-1>OFT</font> is now maintaining that <font size=-1>BA</font>'s deal with American is not seriously anti-competitive when it is viewed in the wider European context, where the two airlines control less than a quarter of transatlantic traffic.<b></b><br>
 Mr Lang ought to view the <font size=-1>OFT</font>'s revised recommendations with scepticism. <font size=-1>BA</font> and American Airlines plan to co-ordinate their schedules, combine frequent-flier programmes and share revenues from transatlantic flights. They already control nearly 70% of the flights on the busy London-New York route. No wonder rival airlines such as United and Virgin cry foul. Robert Ayling, <font size=-1>BA</font>'s chief executive, replies that several European and American airlines already have similar code-sharing deals. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Lang's dilemma is complicated by the fact that British-American negotiations on an "open skies" agreement to relax restrictions on foreign airlines operating in the two countries will remain stalled unless the deal goes through. <font size=-1>BA</font> will drop its opposition to greater access for airlines from the United States only if the alliance is approved. American Airlines, for its part, has threatened to walk away from the deal unless it is quickly approved.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Lang should ignore both threat and promise and concentrate on the core of the problem: the need to free up capacity. The excess demand for landing rights at Heathrow is so great that it reinforces the dominance of the airlines that control the peak-hour slots. Unless more landing rights are made available to new entrants, the freer competition of any "open skies" agreement will remain illusory. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Landing charges at Heathrow, one of the most congested airports in the world, are already among the cheapest anywhere. Incredibly, they are about to fall still further while charges at the nearly empty Stansted on the other side of London are about to rise. The chief beneficiaries of this dotty pricing policy are foreign airlines. Low charges are not passed on to passengers as reduced fares because Heathrow's capacity constraints restrict competition.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Landing charges are not, however, the crux of the problem. Industry insiders reckon Heathrow is so popular that the charges could probably be trebled without affecting demand. The ideal solution would be to auction slots to the highest bidder. This would raise the cost of using Heathrow, making Stansted--where demand for slots would initially be far less-- much more attractive. But the rights of airlines to routes acquired over the years cannot just be brushed aside.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A more practical approach was outlined in a report published by the House of Commons' Transport Committee earlier this year. It proposed that landing charges at Heathrow should be increased and the additional revenues allocated to an environmental fund. A better balance between the interests of airlines, of people who live near busy airports and of taxpayers could be achieved if increased landing charges, reflecting Heathrow's environmental costs, were combined with the regular auction of any newly available slots created through expansion of the airport or through the withdrawal from Heathrow of any airline. These are the issues which Mr Lang and the government should be tackling, rather than paving the way for a further concentration of commercial power in the hands of <font size=-1>BA</font> and American Airlines.<br>

<p><b>Air pollution</b></p>
<h1>Electric Jersey </h1>

THINK of cars and the island of Jersey in the English Channel, and it conjures up an image of the <font size=-1>TV</font> detective Bergerac sleuthing around the bailiwick in his 1940s Triumph <font size=-1>TR1</font> roadster. Now Jersey is turning its back on such romantic but smoky old clunkers. If Jim Bergerac were to come back in a new series, he might be at the wheel of an electric car. From next April visitors to the island will be able to hire electric cars from their hotel for the same price as a petrol-driven Ford Escort. Jersey's experiment, the brainchild of Nigel Philpott, the island's director of tourism, will be the most extensive test of private electric vehicles in the British Isles (not counting golf carts and milk floats). If the trial works, Mr Philpott would like to persuade all hire cars to go electric. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Islanders are worried that more petrol cars crawling over their leafy lanes will destroy Jersey's charm with a combination of noise and air pollution. The island has 724 inhabitants per square kilometre, three times more than Britain and twice continental Europe's most densely-populated country, the Netherlands. Jersey also has a lot of cars: 77,000 (including lorries and buses), or 663 vehicles per square kilometre, almost as many vehicles as people. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many of these are hired cars used by tourists. So Mr Philpott has roped in the local electricity company, some hotels and a local car-hire company to set up a system whereby selected hotels will have reserved parking spots for electric cars which visitors can book in advance. Since the island is small, a range of around 70 miles is no problem. Jersey Electric, the local utility, has staged trials with electric Peugeots and Citro<e-dierisis>ns. But it looks as if Toyota will win the contract to supply vehicles for Mr Philpott's much bigger experiment.<br>

<p><b>Dell Computer</b></p>
<h1>Selling PCs like bananas </h1>

MAKING personal computers used to be a war of engineers, each seeking a cleverer way to solder circuit boards. Now often it is the accountants who rule the battlefield. With <font size=-1>PC</font> manufacturing largely reduced to snapping together pre-assembled parts, the distance between market winner and loser is measured more often in inventory turns and stock management than megahertz and kilobytes.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That helps explain why Dell Computer is now the darling of Wall Street. Since January, the <font size=-1>PC</font> maker's share price has risen by more than 250%. Its profits in the latest quarter were up nearly 60% over a year earlier. Although the company claims the usual advantages for its technology and management, Dell's success really boils down to one thing: while most <font size=-1>PC</font> makers sell through shops, resellers, and systems integrators, Dell sells directly to customers, mostly by telephone. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The advantage of direct sales is more than eliminating the middleman's mark up. It can also eliminate the two months or more of delay in which a <font size=-1>PC</font> typically languishes in warehouses and on store shelves waiting to be sold. This is more important than it might seem: when it comes to inventory, <font size=-1>PC</font>s are like ripe fruit not bent metal. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;About 80% of the cost of a <font size=-1>PC</font> is made up of components, such as the processor chip, that fall in price by an average of 30% a year. Each day those parts sit on the shelf, they become a worse deal. In the best of times, too much inventory leaves a <font size=-1>PC</font> maker with machines that are priced higher than speedier competitors. At the worst of times, when a manufacturer is caught on the cusp of a big change in technology--such as the transition from the <font size=-1>486</font> chip to the Pentium--it can be left with millions of dollars of out-of-date <font size=-1>PC</font>s. It then either has to compensate stores to unload the white elephants at a loss, or ship them to the developing world to sell on the cheap. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Direct sales also help Dell around one of the trickiest bits of the industry: forecasting. Because some 500,000 customers call Dell's operators each week, it can gauge trends in demand more quickly--and so plan more effectively--than firms that get their data indirectly from stores.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The combination of these two advantages allows Dell to run one of the tightest manufacturing operations in the industry. It turns over its inventory every 14 days on average, compared to about 50 days for Compaq, the best of the indirect <font size=-1>PC</font> makers. Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, says this alone gives Dell a 3% cost advantage over Compaq, and twice that over more typical indirect makers, whose inventory is often 100 days (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>). <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lower costs allow Dell to charge lower prices, which is largely why customers are willing to take a chance on buying a <font size=-1>PC</font> unseen. Throughout 1995 and 1996 Dell has been growing at nearly 50% a year in a market growing by just 20%. This has pushed its share of the market up to nearly 4%, making it the world's fifth-largest <font size=-1>PC</font> maker in a fragmented business, where even the leader, Compaq, has less than 10%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Dell's success this year also owes a lot to one event that is unlikely to recur. The price of memory chips, which make up about 20% of the cost of a <font size=-1>PC</font>, has plummeted by more than two-thirds since January. That has meant that by the time many of its indirect competitors' <font size=-1>PC</font>s arrived at their customer's door, the memory chips in them were worth half what they paid for them. Dell's, which had been received just two weeks before the customer got them, had lost only a few percent of their value. Goldman Sachs reckons that this pushed Dell's cost advantage up to more than 8%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dell is not the only direct <font size=-1>PC</font> vendor: its biggest competitor in this market, Gateway 2000, is also booming, although it has focused more on consumers while Dell sells mostly to businesses. Direct <font size=-1>PC</font> sales have gone in and out of fashion for more than a decade, rarely rising above a market niche. Big corporate customers generally want some local intermediary who is within reach when things go wrong, while individual consumers usually prefer to touch a <font size=-1>PC</font> before they buy it. The fastest-growing <font size=-1>PC</font> market, the home, has traditionally been a retail stronghold.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, this was nearly Dell's undoing. In the early 1990s, concerned that by sticking to direct sales it would miss out on the biggest market, it dived into retail sales. It soon discovered that the market punishes companies that try to have it both ways. The moment Dell offered a new computer model through its direct channel, the older computers still on shop shelves immediately lost a big chunk of their value, forcing Dell to compensate retailers. It pulled out of the retail market in 1994, and has been rewarded with record profits ever since. "Every time we steer away from the direct model, we get a cold shower," says Tom Meredith, Dell's chief financial officer. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The same "channel conflict", Mr Meredith reckons, will keep the biggest indirect <font size=-1>PC</font> makers out of Dell's niche. And the rise of Internet commerce--an even more efficient form of direct selling--should help the niche grow. The direct route may never be the biggest slice of the <font size=-1>PC</font> pie, but Dell's accountants are keen to keep it the most profitable.<br>

WITHIN 18 months of its launch in America, digital satellite <font size=-1>TV</font> had scooped up 3m subscribers. In Germany, by contrast, subscriptions to the Kirch group's new service appear to be well below expectations (see <a href="wb8375.html">page</a>). Now it is the turn of Japan. The country's first digital television service, Perfec<font size=-1>TV</font>! (<i>sic</i>, in more ways than one), started commercial broadcasting on October 1st. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The good news for the companies betting that the Japanese are willing to pay well for more television is that the Japanese are ardent televiewers, spending an average of 4.25 hours a day glued to the box. On the other hand, they appear to have little taste for foreign programmes, and already have more channels to choose between than most Europeans. They also have, in <font size=-1>NHK</font>, a politically powerful public broadcaster which has usually topped the ratings. And past experience with commercial satellite broadcasting has been bleak: the main analogue venture, <font size=-1>WOWOW</font>, racked up debts faster than subscribers at first. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nonetheless, a few moments' channel surfing suggests plenty of scope for improvement. Japanese broadcasters and cable companies have grown fat by serving up a mushy diet of chat shows, panel games and soap operas. Since Perfec<font size=-1>TV</font>! began its free trial period on June 30th, Japan's media bosses have begun to fear that they may not be calling the shots for much longer. Industry watchers believe the parents of Perfec<font size=-1>TV</font>!--four Japanese trading houses (Itochu, Nissho Iwai, Mitsui and Sumitomo) and Japan Satellite Systems (<font size=-1>JSAT</font>), a satellite operator--will easily sign up the 300,000 subscribers they want by next March, and may have 2m within five years.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even as it starts to charge, Perfec<font size=-1>TV</font>! may strike subscribers as a bargain. For around &#165;2,900 ($26) a month, viewers get 57 channels of pin-sharp television and 103 channels of radio with <font size=-1>CD</font>-like sound. The snag is that subscribers will also have to pay &#165;50,000 or more for yet another set-top box and satellite dish to receive Perfec<font size=-1>TV</font>!'s compressed signal. At present, the 9.4m subscribers to Japan's three competing analogue satellite services need a different brand of set-top box and costly antennae for each one. Will they invest in a fourth?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reason they may is that, to the dismay of Japanese television executives, the digital newcomers have begun to rally around a single standard. Come next summer, viewers who have bought receiving equipment for Perfec<font size=-1>TV</font>! will also be able to tune in to <font size=-1>J</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>, a 100-channel digital satellite-television service being developed jointly by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Softbank, a Japanese software and media conglomerate. Mr Murdoch has shrewdly chosen to use the big new <font size=-1>JCSAT-3</font> satellite owned by <font size=-1>JSAT</font>, one of Perfec<font size=-1>TV</font>!'s parents. As a result, subscribers to both satellite services will be able to use the same set-top box and miniature dish.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other digital broadcasters are expected to follow suit--or, at least, to make their services as compatible as possible. Direc<font size=-1>TV</font>, a digital satellite-<font size=-1>TV</font> operator owned by General Motors' Hughes Electronics in Los Angeles, is planning to launch a 100-channel service in Japan later next year. The American aerospace firm has teamed up with Culture Convenience Club, Japan's largest video-rental chain. Direc<font size=-1>TV</font>--like <font size=-1>J</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>--may decide to use the same family of Hughes-built satellites adopted by Perfec<font size=-1>TV</font>!. With one small dish on the roof, one decoder box on the television set and one remote control in the hand, the Japanese could be surfing hundreds of television channels within a year or two. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To flourish, the new satellite broadcasters need to see off competition from the cable industry. With typically no more than 150,000 subscribers apiece, most of Japan's cable systems operators are more threatened than threatening, and ripe for consolidation. A greater threat may be the handful of big operators. Jupiter Telecommunications, the biggest, is a joint venture between Sumitomo and Tele-Communications Inc, America's largest cable operator. Set up in March 1995, Jupiter already has the franchise for accessing some 2.5m homes in western Tokyo, Osaka and Fukuoka. Its state-of-the-art networks will carry telephone messages as well as data and television programmes. It is developing four new television channels--movies, golf, shopping and documentaries--for this year and six more for 1997. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Japan's commercial networks--<font size=-1>TBS</font>, <font size=-1>NTV</font>, Fuji and <font size=-1>TV</font> Asahi--are in a much stronger position. Their audiences remain vast; and they still have an arm-lock on national advertising revenues. But they now face the prospect of having to invest heavily in digital broadcasting. In 1994 some government officials wanted to bring forward the date at which all the country's <font size=-1>TV</font> would be broadcast digitally from 2010 to 1999-- only to have their plan shredded by <font size=-1>NHK</font>, which had sunk billions in developing an analogue form of high-definition <font size=-1>TV</font>. Now even <font size=-1>NHK</font> is expected to go digital soon.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The question is: what will viewers pay for? Although American soaps, baseball and golf shows will be plentiful, the Japanese will mainly want home-grown fare. That gives tremendous power to the companies that produce programmes, such as Japan Image Corporation, a consortium of 50 small production companies that has been signed up by Perfec<font size=-1>TV</font>! to provide shows for four of its forthcoming 70 channels. By 2000 <font size=-1>JIC</font> expects to supply a dozen channels-worth of content. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With up to 500 Japanese-language channels to feed, such production houses will bring Japan's most talented young producers streaming out of the television studios to seek their fortune. But only if the programmes they provide for the digital satellite services are at least as good as those from analogue broadcasters will digital television in Japan copy America's blast off, rather than Germany's sluggish start.<br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>Deep pockets, short sight</h1>

<font size=1>BERLIN </font><p>
BEHIND a pillar in Berlin's leading electronics store is an expensive black box, for decoding the signal from digital satellite television. The salesman does not recommend it: bad value for money, he says. That is glum news for Leo Kirch, a media magnate. His Kirch group launched a digital pay-<font size=-1>TV</font> venture, <font size=-1>DF1</font>, in late July. It will succeed only if people can be persuaded to stump up DM880 ($576) for the box, plus a further DM20 a month subscription charge.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The signs so far are discouraging. <font size=-1>DF1</font> needs 1m subscribers to break even, and hopes to sign up 200,000 customers by Christmas. Since its launch, barely 10,000 have signed. The programmes (15 channels, plus, for an extra charge, pay-per view films) are not wildly different in either quality or quantity from those already available to German viewers who, on a typical weekend, can choose from 145 feature films and several hours of live football, all for free. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But trying to beat Mr Kirch on content is unwise. He has deals with all the main American studios apart from Rupert Murdoch's Fox, where one is expected soon, and controls the two best sets of sports rights--to the main German soccer league and the World Cup. He also has the financial backing of <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>, Mr Murdoch's successful British pay-<font size=-1>TV</font> business, which has a 49% stake in <font size=-1>DF</font>1.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Kirch's main problem will be to get his content to the viewers. His decoders are expensive and have been poorly marketed--probably because they were brought to market hurriedly. Besides, <font size=-1>DF</font>1 is currently available only on satellite. To sell <font size=-1>DF</font>1 to Germany's 16m cabled households requires the co-operation of Deutsche Telekom, the world's biggest cable operator. Until recently, Deutsche Telekom was competing against Mr Kirch in alliance with Bertelsmann, Germany's largest publishing house. Now it plans its own move into pay-<font size=-1>TV</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As for Bertelsmann, it has pulled out of German digital pay-<font size=-1>TV</font>, complaining-- belatedly--that it is expensive and unprofitable. That may be sour grapes, although similar noises are coming from other parts of the Kirch empire. Pro7, a brash television channel run by Mr Kirch's son, recently said that it was pulling out of a planned pay-<font size=-1>TV</font> venture. "The biggest miscalculation we have seen," said one manager. It will concentrate on business programming instead. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the Berlin electronics shop the salesman sings the praises of the existing pay-<font size=-1>TV</font> channel, Premiere. This uses analogue technology. But after several years it is still not in operating profit. <font size=-1>DF</font>1 may have a similarly sluggish take-off. The clearest prospects for pay-<font size=-1>TV</font> are in servicing distinct markets: football, pornography, minority languages, films and--possibly--financial information. People will not pay much for something while they can watch it elsewhere for nothing.<br>

<h1>TECHNOLOGY BRIEF</h1>

<h2> </h2>
A word is worth 1,000 pictures<br>
 
<p><b>The second in our series of articles on why some new technologies fly and others flop looks at the wretched saga of the videophone, and asks whether the personal computer will come to its rescue</b></p><br>
HOW can you improve on the telephone? Since Alexander Graham Bell first ordered his assistant to "come here" 120 years ago, calls have become clearer, automatic switches have brought direct dialling, and digital ones have delivered nifty features such as conference calls and voice mail. Telephones have proliferated (the International Telecommunications Union estimates there are over 800m of them); and most recently they have become portable.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But time and again, one enhancement has been rejected: the addition of pictures, either still or moving. Videophones, as they are known, were such techno-turkeys that telephone companies have at last stopped selling them altogether. One sign of their failure is that few consumers ever realised that they were on offer.<br>
Adding pictures to voice calls seems an obvious step--adding images to radio signals created television, and with it a huge new industry. But telephones have so far remained stubbornly photo-free. "Picturephone", developed at <font size=-1>AT&T</font>'s Bell Labs, now part of Lucent Technologies, was first demonstrated in 1964. At the time, other telephone companies talked of public videophone booths in major cities. Three decades later, videophones are still a rarity.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first consumer devices to sell in any number appeared in Japan in 1988. They were a fiasco. Rather than adding an extra dimension to conversations, the gadgets detracted. Whenever callers wanted to send an image of themselves, they had to interrupt their telephone calls for six seconds for a blotchy, black-and white picture to be transmitted. Only 250,000 of the phones were sold, mostly in pairs to men who worked away from their families.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These gizmos were followed four years later by <font size=-1>AT&T</font>'s VideoPhone 2500. Instead of still, black-and-white images, VideoPhone 2500 could send colour images that were updated a few times a second, although the screen, at five square inches, was hardly lavish. Like the Japanese device, VideoPhone 2500 flopped. Sales did not even reach 100,000 before the prices were slashed (they started off at $1,500). In the end, <font size=-1>AT&T</font> started to give the phones away.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Unwanted</b></b><br>

Certainly, videophones have been too expensive and their pictures too poor; cheaper phones and better images would undoubtedly have helped. But ultimately, they may have failed for a more basic reason: people just do not seem to want them. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Experience suggests that consumers will put up with high prices and low quality if they want the service on offer. There was great demand for crackly international phone calls (featuring bellowed exchanges of "Can you hear me?") even when they were ferociously expensive. The earliest mobile phones won fans despite their bulk and poor voice quality because people wanted to make telephone calls on the move. Because the demand was there, the technology improved rapidly: the price and quality of long-distance calls and mobile phones have improved as the market has expanded. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Videophones have never benefited from this virtuous circle. According to Tim Midwinter of <font size=-1>BT</font>'s Martlesham Heath research laboratories, the trouble is that when people make calls, they mostly want to talk. Ordinary telephones have been allowing this adequately for more than a century. Adding video, particularly when it is a jerky picture on a small screen, matters much less. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Videophones seem also to have suffered from another drawback. People make phone calls in any state of dress, or undress; while dirty or clean; and, perhaps most importantly, argues David Farber, a telephone expert at the University of Pennsylvania, while they are doing other things at the same time. Anecdotal evidence suggests that for many conversations, videophones would be more curse than blessing. Even <font size=-1>AT&T</font> executives were not immune: testing videophones in the 1960s, some would claim their systems were broken to avoid having to smarten up for each call.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A final defect of the videophone, compared, say, to the mobile one, is that it requires two to tango. If you are the only person you know who has one, who will you call? The same logic applied to the fax in its infancy--but lots of people saw they could benefit from having one. This has not been so for videophones. The model user became the grandmother who missed her grandchildren and had enough money to buy a pair. This market turned out to be tiny: <font size=-1>BT</font> sold only 10,000 of its domestic videophones between 1993 and 1995. Worse, if you bought a videophone from <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, but your granny in Scotland had one from <font size=-1>BT</font>, you would not be able to swap images with her.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So will the videophone always flop? Maybe not. Prearranged video conferences are becoming increasingly popular within companies, especially if they are seen as a way to cut down on overseas travel. A one hour video call between London and New York costs less than $150, and Dataquest, a research firm, estimates that more than 1m videoconferencing units will have been shipped by 1999. But these are usually large bits of specialist equipment that sit in the boardroom--hardly the omnipresent, friendly telephone handset.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The technology for one-to one video calls is, however, starting to show other promising signs of life. International standards for video telephony have been developed, ensuring that devices bought from one maker will work with those from another. And the complex gadgetry needed to squeeze and transmit video images down a telephone line is becoming ubiquitous. In the early 1990s, videophone makers had to cram clever chips and tiny screens into handsets. Today, the modern personal computer can become a videophone of sorts merely by adding a $200 digital camera and software (now standard) to compress and transmit the images. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This may turn out to be a vital change. The <font size=-1>PC</font> is not yet as compact as a telephone but it has become as familiar and unexceptional as one. And sales of multimedia <font size=-1>PC</font>s, almost perfect for video calls, will reach around 35m this year. In addition, <font size=-1>PC</font>s become cheaper and more powerful every year, so the quality of picture calls goes up as the price of the equipment comes down.<br>
<b> </b> Better still, Intel, the world's leading supplier of <font size=-1>PC</font> chips, is showing new interest in video telephony. From this Christmas, adding a special camera to an Intel-based <font size=-1>PC</font> will be enough to turn it into a videophone that can work over telephone networks and the Internet alike. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There will still be limitations. Ordinary phone lines are not best suited to carrying video images and the high-capacity connections of the future are still, well, in the future for most telephone subscribers. The <font size=-1>PC</font> with camera attached is anyway a far cry from the compact, dedicated videophone the telephone companies once hoped to turn into a mass-market product.<br>

<html><head><title>The trouble with men</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<!-- Changed by: Chris Rijk, 26-Sep-1996 -->
<p align=center><img src="/econlogosmall.gif" width="78" height="39" alt="The Economist" border=0></p>

<h1>The trouble with men</h1>

IT MAY be a man's world now, but "Tomorrow belongs to women" (to borrow the title of a book by Jack Lang, a French politician and sex symbol). No wonder.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Apart from being more violent, more prone to disease, more likely to succumb to drugs, bad diet or suicide--more socially undesirable from almost every point of view, in fact--men, it seems, are also slightly more stupid than women. At any rate, boys are doing less well than girls at school. And since, with each passing year, more brainy word-processing consultants and nursery-school teachers get new jobs while more brawny coal miners and machine-tool operators lose theirs, it seems inevitable that women with their graduate certificates and mothering instincts will soon be doing ever more of the world's work, while men lag further behind. A woman's work is never done; a man is drunk from sun to sun.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Well, does that matter? Biologists might answer: not much. To them, men are useful largely for one thing: supplying genetic products to mothers. Providing half a baby's genes stirs up the gene pool and outwits the bacteria and viruses that prey on the species. Also from a biologist's point of view, a lot of aggressive male behaviour is so much genetic advertising. Having men lock antlers, brag about football and indulge in dangerous virility rituals enables women, in some mysterious way, to pick the best genes to hand on.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But nature's methods seem extremely crude. Why not be a tad more scientific? The next generation does not need the current crop of men to be carrying around their sperm all the time. A clean, well-run sperm bank, regularly topped up, would be just as good--and would dispense with men's unfortunate social side-effects. Sperm banks could provide a wide range of gene services, offering, say, high intelligence, predeliction to be a surgeon, blue eyes, long legs and so forth. In America, they already provide a splendid array of choices (and offer insurance in case sperm counts fall even further).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Meanwhile, in terms of cultural evolution, men may well have done their job: they have pretty much set up modern civilisations and technologies; they may not be needed to keep them going. Knowledge-based societies, with their stress on brain not brawn, may be safer in women's hands.<br>
</p><p><b>Testosterone and its antidotes</b><br>
Back to real life. Men have not been humanely phased out. They still have more jobs than women and, on average, earn higher salaries. In the middle and upper income brackets, men are adjusting--albeit slowly--to women's growing economic power. But down at the bottom of the ladder, where men are men and women change the nappies (but also have the jobs), there are troubles of an entirely different order.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Here whole communities are caught in a deadly vice. As the article on <a href="sf0752.html">page</a> argues, in areas which used to depend on heavy industry, changes in the nature of work have laid waste the traditional sources of unskilled male employment. Men who used to work in the collieries or shipyards have proved unable (or, which is almost the same thing, unwilling) to do the "women's work" springing up in the industrial ruins. As their jobs have declined, so have their prospects of marriage, for who wants to link their lot with a jobless deadbeat? And as work and marriage have declined together, so everyone has suffered, for these two, since time immemorial, have been the twin responsibilities that have persuaded men to stay with women and children, obey the law and behave as social animals. For women, work and family are often competing spheres; for men, they are linked. When the link is broken, some men, in some places, become loose molecules: uneducated, unskilled, unmarried and unemployed.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps this will change. Perhaps men will begin to compete more vigorously for "women's work". Perhaps they will find jobs, and, having got them, marry and look after children again. But the evidence so far is against it. At best, men will change their ways reluctantly and more slowly than the quickening pace of economic change. Meanwhile, the blue collar problem will grow.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Men learn social behaviour through work and marriage, rather than grasp it by instinct. Nothing can be done to change that. Nothing should be done to turn the clock back-- by, for example, discriminating against women at work or keeping open economically pointless factories (which would amount to the same thing, since that would penalise the new jobs women do). As the survey argues, the engines of economic change--information technology and globalisation--are, contrary to rumour, benefiting the vast majority of humanity: not just women in the West but millions of men and women everywhere.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So such remedies as are possible must concentrate on the places where the social problems are worst: the inner cities. One reason that boys are falling behind girls at urban primary and secondary schools is that too few male teachers are around for boys to look up to and model their behaviour upon. Attracting more male teachers would help close the gap in educational attainment and improve boys' job prospects. More can and should be done to improve the skills of young men: it is especially worth concentrating on their schooling and vocational education, even though men often pooh pooh such things. And a lot can be done to alleviate the social evils of areas where employment and marriage rates are lowest. While the source of the trouble may be unemployment, much of the damage that flows from this is connected to the easy availability of guns and drugs. Here, more efficient restrictions are needed, which means, for drugs, decriminalisation and control.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such a list may seem a piecemeal and partial response to "the trouble with men". Granted, it is only a start. But with all great social changes, there comes a stage, before comprehensive policies can be agreed upon, when what is needed is to recognise that a problem exists and accept that it cannot be left to fester. With men in the ghettos, that stage has arrived.<br>

<h2>No light</h2>
Israel's decision to open an<b> ancient tunnel</b> close to the Muslim holy places in Jerusalem led to the worst violence since the start of the Oslo peace process. Clashes broke out throughout the Palestinian territories. In Ramallah, after Israeli soldiers approached the autonomous zone, Palestinian policemen fired back. Several dozen Palestinians were reported killed and hundreds wounded; at least five Israelis were killed. Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, cut short his visit to Europe.<br><br>
The <font size=-1>UN</font>-created tribunal to try Rwandans<b> accused of genocide</b> met in Arusha, Tanzania. Of the 21 Rwandans so far indicted, only three are in custody in Arusha. The court decided to postpone the trial of one of them, who is ill, until next March. <br>
<h2>Kabul threatened</h2>
The <b>Afghan government </b>of President Rabbani was fighting for survival as the Taliban, a rebel militia believed to be supported by Pakistan, reached the outskirts of the capital, Kabul. During the past month the Taliban has taken control of much of eastern Afghanistan.<br><br>
<b>Japan </b>will probably have a general election on October 20th, in which the Liberal Democrats, who lost power in 1993 after ruling for nearly 40 years, are expected to regain their grip.<br><br>
Banharn Silpa-archa resigned as <b>Thailand's prime minister </b>after he had lost the support of his six-party coalition government.<br><br>
<b>Indonesia </b>ordered Megawati Sukarnoputri, a critic of the government, to close her political office in Jakarta, arousing fears that the authorities will tolerate no organised opposition.<br><br>
<b>Murtaza Bhutto</b>,<b> </b>brother of the Pakistani prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, was shot dead by police. Mr Bhutto had campaigned to oust his sister.<br>
<h2>Leaderless Russia</h2>
It was disclosed that <b>Boris Yeltsin</b>,<b> </b>Russia's increasingly invisible president, suffered a heart attack--his third in a year--between the first and second rounds of the election this summer. Doctors will operate in six to eight weeks.<br><br>
Critics challenged the validity of this month's <b>Bosnian election</b>, claiming the number of votes exceeded the number of eligible voters. The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which ran the election, delayed certifying the results but declared a Muslim, Alija Izetbegovic, president. All this could delay municipal elections due in November.<br>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
European finance ministers narrowed their differences over a <b>stability pact</b>, a German proposal to keep members of <font size=-1>EMU</font> from running excessive budget deficits. The ministers also agreed that countries outside <font size=-1>EMU</font> could join a new exchange-rate mechanism, called <font size=-1>ERM</font>-<font size=-1>2</font>, in which their currencies would be allowed to fluctuate by 15% against the euro, the future European currency.<br><br>
<b>Armenia</b>'s<b> </b>incumbent president, Levon Ter-Petrossian, was re-elected with more than 50% of the vote in a four-candidate contest. The main opposition group said it was a fraud and as thousands of Armenians protested, light tanks and troops were sent into the capital, Yerevan.<br><br>
British police seized ten tonnes of explosives, killed one suspected member of the <font size=-1>IRA</font> and arrested five others in a series of raids in and near London. Police said the <font size=-1>IRA</font> had been on the verge of launching a series of <b>terrorist attacks </b>in the city.<br><br>
<b>Malta</b>'s prime minister, Eddie Fenech Adami, called a general election on October 26th, ten months earlier than necessary.<br><br>
France's prime minister, Alain Jupp<e-acute>, called for a <b>vote of confidence </b>in parliament on October 2nd.<br><br>
<b>Greece</b>'s ruling Socialist party, Pasok, led by Costas Simitis, won the general election, beating the conservative New Democracy party. Mr Simitis is expected to continue policies favouring the <font size=-1>EU</font> and budgetary rigour. <br>
<h2>The wedded state</h2>
A report by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation claims that Hillary Clinton drafted a property document that was used by an Arkansas savings and loan to <b>deceive federal regulators </b>in 1986. In a television interview, Bill Clinton accused the Whitewater special prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, of being "obviously" out to get him. <br><br>
John F. Kennedy junior, America's <b>"most eligible bachelor"</b>,<b> </b>married Carolyn Bessette at a secret ceremony off the coast of Georgia. Reporters from the <i>National Inquirer</i> were repelled.<br><br>
The first <b>presidential debate </b> was set for October 6th in Hartford, Connecticut. Ross Perot, founder of the Reform Party, filed suit in federal court to be allowed to join in. <br><br>
At the congress of <b>Mexico</b>'s ruling party, the <font size=-1>PRI</font>, activists denounced the rule of free market "technocrats" and voted against their policies, notably petrochemicals privatisation. They also voted that future <font size=-1>PRI</font> presidential candidates must already have held elective office, as few have. The leadership, taken by surprise by this outbreak of free speech, tried to sweep it all under the carpet. <br><br>
<b>Argentina'strade unions </b> launched a 36-hour general strike against the government's tough economic policies and unemployment.<br>

<h2>Steady as you go</h2>

The Federal Reserve held <b>American interest rates</b> steady.<b> </b>With mixed signals from the economy--unemployment at a seven-year low and fattening wages, but signs of slowing growth in the second half of the year--the deciding factor may have been timing. The closing weeks of a presidential campaign are an awkward time for the Fed to act. Consumer confidence ticked up slightly in September, to a six-year high.<br><br>
(See <a href="bw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>The International Monetary Fund said <b>growth in Japan</b> would reach 3.5% this year after a long recession, the fastest among the Group of Seven rich countries and well above the Fund's forecast in May. Growth elsewhere in Asia is expected to slow to 8% this year and 7.5% next.<br>
<h2>Sinking fund</h2>
The European Commission approved FFr3.9 billion ($762m) of emergency aid for <b>Cr<e-acute>dit Lyonnais</b>, adding another chunk of French taxpayers' cash to a rescue plan for the state-owned bank that is already costing up to FFr45 billion. The commission gave warning that another bail-out will amount to a "considerable figure" and insisted that any plan would need to include "real and substantive" divestments. The bank delayed issuing its interim results for a week after the commission's ruling.<br><br>
<b>Bulgaria's central bank </b> nearly trebled its key interest rate to 300% and placed nine state and private banks under supervision in an attempt to shore up a crippled financial system and prevent another default on foreign debt. Lyubomir Filipov, governor of the central bank, said he would resign if the latest measures to stabilise the lev failed to work.<br><br>
A war of words intensified between the central banks of Britain and Germany. A Bundesbank official said <font size=-1>EU</font> members that did not join the <b>single currency</b> should not have unrestricted access to <font size=-1>TARGET</font>, the proposed new payments system. A week earlier, the governor of the Bank of England had said there should be no discrimination.<br><br>
Britain's <font size=-1>BT</font> has taken a 25% stake in <font size=-1>CEGETEL</font>, a <b>new telecoms group</b> set up by France's Compagnie G<e-acute>n<e-acute>rale des Eaux. The aim is to compete with France T<e-acute>l<e-acute>com.<br><br>
The Austrian government rejected a bid for <b>Creditanstalt </b> from a consortium of Austrian, Italian and German banks in yet another setback in its long-drawn-out saga to privatise the bank. First Austrian, a savings bank, then announced that it will form a group to make a bid.<br><br>
Japan's coalition government promised a half-hearted reform of its powerful <b>finance ministry</b>, with inspection and supervision to be hived off to an independent agency.<br>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
Taking the lead of Daimler Benz, German firms scrambled to <b>cut sick pay </b>for workers to 80% of normal salaries after a bill was passed that allows the change from October 1st. Unions protested that the change should apply to future contracts, not present ones.<br>
<h2>Bad line</h2>
<b>AT&T's share price</b> was battered after the American telecoms giant gave a warning that profits in the third quarter could fall short of market expectations by up to 10%, with a further slide to come in 1997 as its core long distance telephone business feels the effects of tougher competition.<br><br>
Coca-Cola is catapulting its <b>Minute Maid </b>orange juice out of its traditional North American base and into Europe and Latin America with the formation of a 50-50 joint venture with Groupe Danone. The French foods group will produce and distribute the chilled juice outside North America. The aim is to be selling the stuff in 50 countries by 2000.<br><br>
(See <a href="bw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>As multinationals multiply, <b>foreign direct investment</b> grows, with mergers and acquisitions accounting for the bulk of activity. Total outflows worldwide rose to $318 billion in 1995, some 40% up on 1994. Inflows to developed countries rose by 53% but to developing countries only by 15%. Five countries, America, Japan, Britain, Germany and France, accounted for two-thirds of outflows; ten countries received two-thirds of total inflows, with America top of both lists.<br><br>
Two regional American oil refiners are to merge as a defence against hostile takeovers. <b>Diamond Shamrock </b> and <b>Ultramar </b>together will form the fourth-largest independent refiner, with a large network of retail outlets and revenue of $8 billion.<br><br>
<b>Lachlan Murdoch</b>, 24-year old son of Rupert, continued his meteoric rise to take on the job of managing director of News Ltd, News Corp's Australian unit. He replaces Ken Cowley, who remains as executive chairman.<br><br>
<b>Hilton Hotels</b> agreed to buy out most of the remaining interests in four more big hotels held by Prudential Insurance Co of America, at a cost of $267m. Prudential has apparently been critical of Hilton's management; Hilton itself has been switching back from franchising its name to buying, as profits in the hotel business perk up.<br><br>
The Dow reflected the market's approval of a deal that would create the world's second-largest <b>satellite network</b> when<b> </b>Hughes Electronics, a General Motors unit, agreed to buy PanAmSat, valuing the four-satellite operator at $3 billion. Share prices rose.<br>

<h1>How Labour could lose</h1>

NOTHING is ever certain in politics. But few things in British politics now look more likely than that Tony Blair's "New Labour" will win the next election. Labour will begin its party conference on September 30th further ahead in the opinion polls than any British opposition party has ever been at this stage. Indeed, Labour's poll lead has remained so large for so long that pollsters are questioning their own methods, and trying to adjust for the fact that people seem ashamed to admit to supporting the Tories (see <a href="br7495.html">page</a>). But even after adjustments--and a dose of scepticism born of the polls' failure to predict the Tory victory in 1992--Labour seems far ahead. Local elections, by-elections and what voters tell canvassers of every party all point to the same conclusion as the polls: after 17 years of Conservative government, the mood favours a change. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, Labour could still lose--and it could do so without a scandal or Mr Blair falling under the proverbial bus. If you find this difficult to swallow, suspend your disbelief for a moment, and come along on an imaginary journey.<br>
</p><p><b>Tony Blair's worst nightmare</b><br>
Imagine first that the economy continues to grow, that inflation remains low and that rising house prices, more cash in consumers' pockets and declining unemployment produce the "feel-good" factor for which the Tories have been praying for so long. And then imagine that the Tories manage to stop squabbling and rally round Mr Major's "wait and see" policy on <font size=-1>EMU</font>--which is, by the way, also Labour's policy. Finally, imagine that, with its poll lead shrinking, its policies subjected to withering scrutiny month after month and with many in its ranks deeply unhappy about Mr Blair's junking of so much of "old" Labour, the party begins to stumble. Internal squabbles escalate. Labour's leaders, fearing that their victory is slipping away, begin to flounder. By next spring, the race is close. And, in a repeat of 1992, floating voters reluctantly decide that they would be safer with the sorry lot of devils they know than the sorry lot of devils they don't. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, some elements of this future are more likely than others. It is quite probable that economic growth and low inflation will finally produce the long-awaited "feel good" factor and that voters will at last begin to give the Tories some of the credit for this. It is less probable that the Tories will stop fighting over <font size=-1>EMU</font>, especially after their most recent outburst of hostilities over the past two weeks. But a truce on <font size=-1>EMU</font> cannot be ruled out. Facing an election, the Tories could yet come to their senses.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The final ingredient in this scenario--Labour blundering and squabbling its way to defeat--may at first appear the least likely. Mr Blair, after all, has shown himself to be the strongest leader in the party's history. Who can deny with what zeal, and skill, he has set about smashing left-wing shibboleths or squashing internal opposition Would his party opponents really rock the boat if they faced the political armageddon of a fifth straight defeat? <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Believe it or not, they might. Mr Blair's party opponents have already made it abundantly clear that they are unhappy with his leadership. More damaging are rumblings of discontent from Mr Blair's own front bench. John Prescott, the party's deputy leader, relishes every opportunity to describe himself as a "socialist", in implicit but oh-so-obvious contrast with you know-who. Robin Cook, the shadow foreign secretary, can barely disguise his impatience with the enthusiasm for <font size=-1>EMU</font>, low taxes and fiscal prudence of Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor and Mr Blair's closest ally. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If internal discontent not only grows, but is accompanied by signs of incompetence from Labour's leaders, the threat to the party's electoral prospects could become genuine. And incompetence is what, surprisingly, Labour's leaders have begun to display as the party's policies come under closer scrutiny. Over the past month they have made unforced bungles on two of the trickiest issues facing the party: Scottish devolution, and relations with the trade unions, putting forward and then abruptly withdrawing proposals on both topics.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the months of campaigning pass, such scrutiny will grow, and it could provoke more blunders. The reason is simple. Mr Blair has been sending two messages to the electorate which fit together awkwardly: that a change of government is urgently needed, but that electing New Labour will not involve so much change as to be risky. This is best summed up by that delicious oxymoron which Mr Blair uses to describe New Labour: "a party of the radical centre". <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour's policies betray this contradiction. With the important exception of constitutional reform--the details of which Labour still seems confused about--the party's policies sound bold, but on closer examination are either so vague as to mean little, or are basically the Tories' policies with the sharpest (and thus, arguably, the most effective) edges shaved off. Despite all Mr Blair's rhetoric of radicalism, such policy conservatism sums up rather well what he is offering the voters: continuity, but with a set of fresh, vigorous new faces at the helm, speaking in softer tones.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This may appeal to enough uncommitted voters to give Labour its expected victory, even if the economy is growing and the Tories unite. But this means that the competence of Labour's leaders and the unity of their party are likely to become the key issues in many voters' minds. Voters may not expect an opposition party's policies to be worked out in complete detail. They may accept that Labour, like the Tories, will always have dissidents. But if voters come to believe that Labour's untested leadership is not united or skilful enough to take tough decisions in government, or that Mr Blair is in fact an isolated figure leading a disgruntled party (see <a href="br7505.html">page</a>), then his pitch from the "radical centre" will fail. The next election looks like being the first in living memory which is the opposition's, not the government's, to lose. But lose it Labour still could.<br>

<h1>Tomorrow's second sex</h1>

<p><b>The signs are everywhere in America and Europe: more women at work; girls doing better in school; debate about "feminisation" in America's politics; its "million-man march" last year. This article summarises the evidence of a growing social problem: uneducated, unmarried, unemployed men</b></p><br>
THESE four pages nail the following arguments to the door of debate:<br>
<ul><li>that boys are doing worse than girls at every age in school, except university where girls are narrowing the gap;
<li>that women dominate the jobs that are growing, while men (especially those with the least education) are trapped in jobs that are declining;
<li>that, for some reason, men are not even trying to do "women's work";
<li>that there is a loose connection between work and marriage: joblessness reduces the attractiveness of men as marriage partners;
<li>that men do not necessarily adopt "social behaviour" (obeying the law; looking after women and children) if left to themselves; rather, they seem to learn it through some combination of work and marriage (this is a matter of anthropological observation rather than statistical proof); 
<li>and hence, putting these claims together, that men pose a growing problem. They are failing at school, at work and in families. Their failure shows up in crime and unemployment figures. The problem seems to be related in some way to male behaviour and instincts. It is more than merely a matter of economic adjustment. And (considering the growth in "knowledge-based" employment) it is likely to get worse (see <a href="sf1.gif">chart</a>).</ul>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The problem is already far worse in some areas than others. Over the past 30 years, professional men have been less badly affected by economic change than their unskilled brethren. And (to the limited extent they want to) some have added so-called "New Man" attitudes to their traditional breadwinning role. They have adjusted reasonably well to social and economic change. But unskilled men have lost on both counts. Traditional family values-- husband winning the bread, wife watching the bairns--tend to be strongest (at least in theory) at the poorer end of the labour market. But American working-class men are increasingly unable (or unwilling) to support families; in Europe, high unemployment has fallen on such men disproportionately. And because providing for a family has been central to men's social role, finding a substitute for steady work will be an immensely hard--conceivably an impossible--task.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Trouble in class</b></b><br>
The trouble with men appears early: at school. Though men take up half or more university places in most countries (America is an exception), at primary and secondary school girls are increasingly outperforming boys. In England and Wales, for example, girls score higher than boys in tests conducted at seven, nine, eleven and-- which is less often realised--at five. In America, boys are much more likely than girls to be held back a grade and twice as likely to drop out of high school.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both the reasons for this discrepancy and its true extent are hotly debated. In some subjects at some ages boys still do better than girls (for example, mathematics at 16). Traditionally, boys have done less well than girls before puberty but used to catch up afterwards. What is new now is that boys are no longer catching up. English and Welsh 16-year-olds take a series of tests known as <font size=-1>GCSE</font>s. A standard measurement is the percentage of children who achieve grades <font size=-1>A</font>, <font size=-1>B</font>, or <font size=-1>C</font> in five or more subjects; 48.1% of girls achieve this, compared with 39% of boys. In some of Britain's poorer areas, the disparity is greater. In Hackney, a poor part of east London, for example, a mere 14.9% of boys reached this standard, compared with 30.2% of girls.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The pattern is repeated all over Europe. In 1995, in the European Union, 124 girls got general leaving certificates to every 100 boys. The boys' narrow lead in vocational certificates--they took 5% more--does not close the gap. Girls also tend to stay in school longer: Austria and Switzerland apart, in every West-European country, more girls than boys stay on in education beyond school-leaving age (though the boys who do stay are slightly more likely to go to university, taking 51% of places).<br>
</p><p><b><b>Trouble at work</b></b><br>
Because jobs are increasingly "knowledge based", this disparity in educational attainment is bound to be reflected in employment once today's schoolchildren become adults. This does not necessarily mean that girls have better job prospects than boys; other factors, including sex discrimination at work, may intervene. But it does mean that girls are improving their job prospects relative to boys. Moreover, the job market is already moving the girls' way.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Between 1980 and 1992, women accounted for three-fifths of the increase in the American workforce and two-thirds of the increase in the European one. Between 1990 and 1993, in ten of the then 12 <font size=-1>EU </font> members, women's share of unemployment fell. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the problem for men is not just that women are taking more jobs; it is that a significant proportion of men are dropping out of the job market altogether as women enter it. In the 1960s, almost all men worked and less than half of women. Not so now. The percentage of working-age men in the <font size=-1>EU</font> outside the labour force rose from just 8% in 1968 to 22% in 1993. For women, the trend was reversed, falling from 58% to 44% over the same period. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In America, the pattern is slightly different: while women's labour-force participation has risen from 43% in 1970 to about 60% now, men's has dropped relatively little from 80% to 75% (though there is an important exception: male high-school drop outs--those completing fewer than 12 years of school; in 1970, 86% were either working or looking for work; by 1993, only 72% were). If its employment trends continue, America will be employing nearly as many women as men by 2005.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Overall, then, the picture in the West is as follows: the labour market is increasingly friendly to women (though men still make more money and are more likely to be in work); but there are growing numbers of men outside the labour market in a way that women have been accustomed to but men are not.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The future for men looks bleaker, even if you disregard what is going on in schools. Western occupational surveys show that for the foreseeable future new job-growth will be in work typically done by women. America's Bureau of Labour, for example, forecasts that the five fastest-growing kinds of work between now and 2002 will be residential care, computer and data processing, health services, child care, and business services. Women dominate all these activities: their share of employment in them is respectively: 79%, 68%, 70%, 70% and 51%. In contrast, the five sectors declining fastest will be footwear, ammunition making, shipbuilding, leather-working and photographic supplies. They are man's work. Men account for at least two-thirds of the workforce in all the categories.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are numerous explanations for female success in growing businesses: women tend to be better educated; they stay in jobs longer (especially women with children); low-paid jobs are growing quickly and women are readier to accept them than men, who still see themselves as a family's breadwinner; women tend to have the social skills needed for jobs in services (though whether because of nature or nurture is disputed).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For men, the obvious response to such economic shifts would be to move into the bits of the economy which are expanding. But they are not doing this. Social theorists may like to claim that concepts like "men's work" or "women's work" are outmoded. The choices people make in the labour force tell a different story. Even in Nordic countries, which have made sexual neutrality a principle of national policy, sex segregation is the norm. Local government, state-run day-care centres, schools and social services are run by women. Men weld cars and take out the rubbish. The pattern is unchanging. In America's "administrative services" (ie, office work) men accounted for only 19.8% of the workforce in 1985 and 20.5% in 1995. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why should this be? Part of the explanation no doubt lies in the advantages that women have in the workforce--especially their willingness to accept lower-paid jobs. But there seems to be more to it than that. Men continue to spurn even well-paid work that is dominated by women. Less than 5% of America's registered nurses, for example, are men, though the average starting salary of a registered nurse is a comfortable $30,000-35,000. Women account for 96% of America's licensed practical nurses, a responsible but not especially highly skilled job that pays a full-time worker about $23,000. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The picture is similar in Europe. In Britain, the proportion of men in nursing, 11.6%, has budged little since 1984, when it was 10.2%. As the <font size=-1>EU</font> noted in a report on "Occupational Segregation of Women and Men in the European Community", male manual workers are "willing to undertake low-paid and low-skilled jobs provided they are not feminised." In Spain, the share of male office clerks has dropped by a third since 1980--even though this has been a fast-growing field at a time of high unemployment; women, meanwhile, have withdrawn from the textile and footwear industries. In these areas, job separation seems to have increased.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Blue-collar blues</b></b><br>
So women are catching up with men for economic reasons ("women's jobs" are growing faster than men's) and social ones (men won't do "women's work"). Both reasons hit unskilled and ill-educated men disproportionately hard.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Jobs that require some tertiary education or training are growing faster than those that require no qualifications. In America's ten largest cities, the number of jobs requiring less than a high-school education has fallen by half since 1970; two thirds of new jobs created in America since 1989 have been professional and managerial. Germany's Ministry of Labour estimates that by 2010, only 10% of German jobs will be appropriate for unskilled workers. In 1976, the proportion was 35%. In 1970, there were more blue-collar workers than white-collar ones in more than half the <font size=-1>OECD</font> countries; by 1990, that was true only in Spain. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In principle, unskilled men could accept these changes and kiss their wives goodbye on the doorstep as the little woman goes off to work at the nursing home. In reality, that is not happening. Despite huge social change during the past 30 years, traditional sexual attitudes retain a stubborn hold. A survey for the <font size=-1>EU</font> found that more than two-thirds of Europeans (ranging from 85% in Germany to 60% in Denmark) thought it better for the mother of a young child to stay at home than the father. Mothers, said this survey, should take care of nappies, clothes and food; fathers are for money, sport and punishment.<br>
<b><br>
</p><p><b>Trouble at home</b></b><br>
Among the poor, this combination of traditional sexual attitudes and male unemployment has been deadly to two groups: men in general in high unemployment areas and, especially, young unemployed men there. The reason is that the combination has set off a spiral of harmful and sometimes uncontrollable consequences which is tearing the web that ties together work, family and law-abiding behaviour.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Consider for a moment a neighbourhood in which most working-age women are not in paid jobs. This may conjure up a picture of tidy homes, children at play and gossip. Now think of a neighbourhood in which most men are jobless. The picture is more sinister. Areas of male idleness are considered, and often are, places of deterioration, disorder and danger. Non-working women are mothers; non-working men, a blight.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Men tend to commit most crimes. In America, they commit 81% of all crime and 87% of violent crime. Adolescent boys are the most volatile and violent of all. Those under 24 are responsible for half of America's violent crime; those under 18 commit a quarter. The figures for most western countries are comparable.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now ask yourself what restrains such behaviour? The short answer is: a two-parent home. Without belabouring the complexity of family policies, two-parent families are demonstrably better at raising trouble-free children than one-parent ones. Fatherless boys commit more crimes than those with father at home; a study of repeat juvenile offenders by the Los Angeles Probation Department found that they were much more likely to come from one-parent backgrounds than either the average child or than juvenile criminals who offended once only (see <a href="sf2.gif">chart</a>). <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Having a man in the house (preferably the biological father) is, it seems, more important than any other single factor. William Galston and Elaine Kamarck, two social scientists who worked in the Clinton administration, argue that the connection between crime and having a father at home "is so strong that  erases the relationship between race and crime and between low income and crime." That is why it is a worry that, in America in 1991, just 50.8% of children lived in traditional nuclear families (families where both parents were present and the children were the biological offspring of both parents). Among Hispanics, the figure was 38%; among blacks, 27%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But family is not the end of the matter. Work also plays a part, both in its own right and as a means of keeping men tied to families. In 1949, Margaret Mead, an eminent anthropologist, argued that <ul>In every known human society, everywhere in the world, the young male learns that when hegrows up, one of the things which he must do in order to be a full member of society is to provide food for some female and her young . . . Everyknown human society rests firmly on the learned nurturing behaviour of men.</ul><br>
When men find it impossible to provide, they also seem to find it difficult to learn the nurturing bits. They may retreat into fundamentalist masculinity--the world of gangs which provide for their members a kind of rule-based behaviour that boys do not get elsewhere. For everyone else (and, in the long run, for boys too), the effects of failing to learn nurturing are universally bad.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For an extreme example of this dynamic, take the studies by William Julius Wilson of mass male joblessness in American inner cities(<a href="#foot">*</a>). Here, for the first time in the West, most men are not working and women are the breadwinners (partly because they are working more than ever and partly because welfare cheques go to them). Mr Wilson argues that joblessness, especially among young men, not poverty is a prime cause of the disintegration of inner cities: "high rates of neighbourhood poverty are less likely to trigger problems of social organisation if the residents are working." Mass unemployment, he claims, destroys the institutions that enforce social behaviour--small firms, clubs, informal networks and, above all, the family.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Wilson demonstrates that, for men, employment is strongly linked to marriage and fatherhood; for a woman, children and work are separate (often competing) worlds. Men who cannot support a family are much less likely to form one; their attractiveness as a marriage partner sags. Among the inner-city blacks in Chicago whom he studied, almost 60% of those aged 18-44 have never been married and marriage rates are even lower among jobless black fathers than among employed black fathers. And this is true in America as a whole. Black men born in the early 1940s, who came of age during an era of full employment, were more than twice as likely to marry as those born since the late 1950s, who joined the workforce at a time when blue-collar jobs were falling. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So, in the language of social science, "The uncertainties in the labour market are carrying over into uncertainties in the marriage market," as John Ermisch of Britain's Economic and Social Research Centre puts it. Work, it seems, helps determine other aspects of men's lives.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Obviously, the impact upon a neighbourhood of large numbers of jobless single men is influenced by other factors, especially the prevalence of sophisticated deadly weapons. Europe has nothing like Chicago's South Side, the so-called "black belt" that is Mr Wilson's particular area of study. Compared with the South Side, drug use is lower in European cities; gun ownership is much lower; crime is lower; fear of crime is lower. The living standards of the poorest are generally higher. Schools do not have metal detectors.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All the same, if male joblessness is the crucial factor in neighbourhood decline (as Mr Wilson claims), then Europe faces similar problems, though they may be bottled up. Not only is average unemployment more than twice as high as in America, but a jobless European stays that way longer. Of Europe's 19m unemployed, more than half have been out of work for a year or more, compared with about 10% of Americans. And young people make up a disproportionate share of Europe's unemployed (except in Germany) and take even longer to get a job. In France, unemployment among under 25-year-olds is 27%, compared with a national average of 12.5%. More than 60% of European youths who are long-term unemployed have never had work; 40% will take two years or more to find their first job. You do not need a sociology degree to worry about the effects of so many young men with nothing to do.<br>
</p><p><b><b>The Japanese solution? No, thanks</b></b><br>
There is one rich country that does not have these problems; where just 1% of children are born to single mothers; where crime is low; where marriage rates are relatively high--and where the labour market is rigged in favour of men. This is Japan. In any recession, the "office flowers" are made redundant first. Women are expected to give up jobs on marriage. In the professions, there is not so much a glass ceiling as a concrete one: hard to miss, painful to hit.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble is that the West is unlikely to copy such a system, which is showing cracks in Japan, too. Just because men--or some of them--are struggling in work and at home, women are not about to stride back to the past, accepting the kitchen and nursery as their allotted spheres.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is all to the good. But there has been a loser in women's march to something closer to equality and that is the man in the blue-collar uniform. Many of the gains that the West has made through enhancing the economic position of women will be tarnished if the male labourer is pushed to the margins. Once known as the salt of the earth, at the moment his troubles are making countries lose their savour.<br>

<h1>The jam-and-Perrier budget</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><p>
IN A strange and marvellous way, the hypocrisy of this election season is unlike any that has come before it. In the past, politicians swore to run the economy responsibly, while at the same time promising programmes that would explode the deficit and multiply red tape. This time the opposite is happening: both President Clinton and the Republicans in Congress trumpet government handouts, while at the same time pursuing policies that will protect the budget and curb regulation. The old kind of hypocrisy was like that of an upright, war era American, who denounced all vice and sinfulness while committing adultery on the quiet. The new kind of hypocrisy is like that of a casual, computer-era American, who pretends to love drugs and sexual licence while drinking mineral water and working round the clock.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Over the past week, congressional Republicans have been caving in to Bill Clinton's spending demands, apparently jeopardising their promise to balance the budget by 2002. They have bowed to the president's zeal for regulation, barely criticising his decree that a huge swathe of Utah be designated a national monument, and acceding to pressure for new health rules. Meanwhile, out on the campaign trail, both presidential candidates are promising tax cuts. Not surprisingly, many have concluded that runaway government has returned, and that fiscal responsibility lies in ruins. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With one big exception, however, there are scant grounds for these fears. The exception is Bob Dole, whose promise to balance the budget and still cut taxes falls into the old category of hypocrisy: he is claiming to be responsible, while offering policies that would wreak fiscal chaos. For the moment, however, Mr Dole appears likely to lose the election. Assuming that Bill Clinton beats him, America will remain roughly on track for a balanced budget six years from now. Mr Clinton's election promises--Longer hospital stays for new mothers! Extra education programmes!--sound profligate but are in truth mercifully modest. The same goes for the Republicans in Congress, who are making much of their new willingness to pay for "commonsense" programmes, but who still retain much of their old budget-balancing zeal.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Consider, first, the recent expansions in government regulation. Posing in front of the Grand Canyon (actually in Arizona) on September 18th, Mr Clinton declared 1.7m acres of Utah a national monument, so protecting it from mining. Critics called this the biggest land grab in recent memory. But the truth is that nearly all the land involved in the Utah "grab" was already owned by the federal government. Besides, it does not add vastly to the more than 100m acres of America already designated a national park or a national monument. Compared with Jimmy Carter, who turned 50m acres of Alaska into a national monument, Mr Clinton's grab looks pretty trifling. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The same goes for the new health regulations. The day after the president's trip to the Grand Canyon, Congress agreed that new mothers should be allowed to stay in hospital at least 48 hours after giving birth. It also laid down that the maximum allowable cost of treatment for mental illness, which under most insurance policies is meagre, should henceforth be raised to the same level as the spending cap for physical illnesses. In principle (though not in compassionate practice), both new regulations are misguided: they will push up the cost of health insurance, so reducing the number of Americans who can afford it. Fortunately, however, both changes are modest. The new childbirth rule will raise insurance premiums by a barely noticeable 0.06%, according to the Congressional Budget Office; the mental-health clause will raise them by 0.4%. A much more sweeping attempt to put mental and physical illness on the same footing, which died in congruous earlier this year, would have increased premiums by a far heftier 4%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In general, the president is insisting that non-defence discretionary spending be increased, which is a big symbolic defeat for the cause of budget balancing. Last year, for the first time in 25 years, this category of spending fell. To build on that success, Congress laid out a plan to balance the budget by 2002, which was based on tightening the discretionary-spending belt in each intervening year. Now the belt is to be loosened.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Meanwhile the House Republicans are also doing violence to the principle of fiscal responsibility. They are proposing to pay for next year's extra spending partly by auctioning radio frequencies. But their estimates for the potential receipts from this source are probably too high, and part of the expected auction revenue had already been pledged to cut the deficit. The Republicans also propose to raise the deposit-insurance premiums collected from banks and thrifts. But higher premiums next year will probably mean lower premiums later, so contributing nothing to the medium-term goal of balancing the budget. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In sum, both president and Congress sound as irresponsible as the average laid back baby-boomer. The good news, however, is that they sin only in small ways. At mid-week, the president was holding out for $237 billion in non-defence discretionary spending, a rise in real terms of only 3% on last year. Meanwhile the dodgy money raising wheezes proposed by Congress were unwise in principle but insignificant in size: they would raise a mere $5.5 billion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The same goes for Mr Clinton's proposed tax cuts. In principle, these are rakish. Half the deficit reduction of recent years has come about because of the tax increases of 1990 and 1993, according to Robert Reischauer of the Brookings Institution. A proposal to cut taxes threatens to expand the deficit again. But the saving grace of Mr Clinton's tax cuts is that they are so small. Whereas Mr Dole proposes $550 billion worth of cuts, Mr Clinton promises a mere $20 billion or so. On the stump, the president boasts of tax credits and tax deductions with the devil-may-care panache of a champion budget-wrecker. The truth is that these flourishes have been carefully costed by mineral-water types with spreadsheets. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even when it comes to entitlements, the vast chunk of the budget not affected by this week's appropriations bills, Mr Clinton's irresponsibility is an affectation. He has spent much of the year attacking Republicans for their proposed cuts in Medicare, the health programme for the elderly. But the truth is that the president has proposed cuts too: $124 billion over six years, compared with Mr Dole's $158 billion. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For an election season, all this is quite remarkable. It does not guarantee that America will return to the budget-balancing path next year--the tax-slashing Mr Dole may beat Mr Clinton after all, or second-term Clinton may prove profligate. But there is at least a chance that the goal of balancing the budget by 2002 can be achieved. It had better be: in the 20 or so years after that, the retirement of America's rakish-workaholic baby-boomers will heap pressure on the public finances far more severe than any faced at present.<br>

<h1>Trends of the week</h1>


<p><b>Word: </b>"Liberal"--the label Bob Dole tries to attach to Bill Clinton. Mr Clinton says it doesn't stick.<br>
<p><b>Inexactitude: </b>Mr Clinton, appearing on "NewsHour": "There still has not been a single solitary shred of evidence of anything dishonest that I have done in my public life."<br>
<p><b>Fall guy: </b>The best quips on Mr Dole's embarrassing tumble after a railing collapsed in California come from Mr Dole himself. Example: "The first person to call me was a trial lawyer."<br>
<p><b>Complaint: </b>By the Nike Corporation ("Just Do It"), after Mr Dole unveiled his "Just Don't Do It" anti-drugs slogan. <br>
<p><b>Stealth: </b>Mr Clinton signs anti-gay-marriage legislation at 12.50am.<br>
<p><b>Prediction: </b>The election forecasts of seven political scientists, all with their own forecasting models, are published in the October issue of <i>American Politics Quarterly</i>. All predict a Clinton win. So does a <font size=-1>WEFA</font> Group model based on a state-by-state analysis: it says Mr Clinton will win with 406 electoral-college votes to Mr Dole's 132.<br>
<p><b>Surprise: </b>Although 23 points behind just three weeks before, Woody Jenkins, a Republican, wins Louisiana's open primary and will face Mary Landrieu, a Democrat, in the run-off. Hope for Mr Dole yet?<br>
<p><b>Company: </b>Asked in a <i>Wall Street Journal</i>/<font size=-1>NBC</font> poll which couple they would rather sit next to on an aeroplane, 35% of respondents said the Clintons, 23% preferred the Doles, 13% chose the Gores, 11% the Kemps and 7% the Perots.<br>
<p><b>Button: </b>"Hungarians for Dole".<br>

<h1>Nico Colchester</h1>

ON SEPTEMBER 25th, on a visit to New York, Nico Colchester died of a heart attack while out on his early morning run. Nico was deputy editor of <i>The Economist</i> from 1989 to 1993, since when he had been editorial director of the Economist Intelligence Unit, our sister company. He was 49, and was one of Britain's finest writers on foreign affairs and business.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although Nico's writing ranged far and wide, he was probably best known for his work on the European Union, first as Bonn correspondent and then as foreign editor of the <i>Financial Times</i>, and from 1986 at <i>The Economist</i>. He wrote two surveys for this newspaper on the <font size=-1>EU</font>, and then in 1990 a book, jointly with his friend David Buchan of the <i>Financial Times</i>, called "Europe Relaunched: Truths and Illusions on the Way to 1992".<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The book's sub-title sums up Nico's journalism admirably. He was pro-European, but as a result of hard thought, not dreamy sentiment, and was always fast to criticise the <font size=-1>EU</font>'s methods and muddles when he thought it necessary. A cover-leader of his, "Half Maastricht" (September 26th 1992), was typical in its punchy criticism of Europe's Maastricht treaty, and its prescient advice that a two-speed Europe was both desirable and inevitable. He was awarded France's Order of Merit in 1990 and Britain's Order of the British Empire in 1993.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One of Nico's particular talents was in the use of humour to cast light upon serious matters. At the <i>Financial Times</i>, where he spent the first 18 years of his career, one of his trademarks was his use of the Mars bar as a commodity standard with which to analyse inflation. At <i>The Economist</i>, a splendid leader in mid-1988 brought bank collapses and the Falklands war together to caution readers of "the dangers of sogginess" and the merits of "crunchiness". And rare indeed, it sometimes seemed, was a piece from Nico without a quote from "The Wind in the Willows". "Poop, poop", went Mr Toad, whenever appropriate.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nico was as energetic in life as in his writing. A regular runner for more than a decade, next month he was due to run a marathon in Greece, along Pheidippides's original course, for charity. When writing on knotty subjects, he was fond of inviting readers "to engage their mental four-wheel drives". Nico's was never disengaged.<br>

<h1>Thinking the unthinkable</h1>

<p><b>The huge opinion-poll lead of the Labour Party looks unassailable. But might the message of the polls be misleading?</b></p>
IF YOU read only the opinion-poll headlines, Tony Blair can begin measuring up the curtains for 10 Downing Street. As delegates gather for the opening of Labour's conference in Blackpool on September 30th, the party remains miles ahead; its lead extends to a credibility-defying 33 points, according to the latest Gallup poll in the<i> Daily Telegraph</i>. Although Labour's average poll lead has narrowed somewhat--by a couple of points after John Major was re-elected Tory leader last summer and by the same again earlier this summer--the Tories' recovery is glacial. In 1981, as long before the coming election, the Tories were 11 points ahead; in 1986, two points behind; in 1991, two points ahead-- and now 23 points behind, according to the (more credible) <font size=-1>MORI</font> poll for the <i>Times</i> carried out on September 20th-23rd (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>). <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This latest poll will particularly disappoint the Tories. They reckoned to have got the better of the political exchanges in August and September, when Labour had several internal rows. Yet, on this latest poll, the Labour lead has recently grown a bit, by two percentage points. As this week's spat between Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and the Tory Eurosceptics over the European single currency sinks in, the Tories could fall even further behind.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor, contrary to some Tory claims, is there much sign that people who talk of voting Labour are about to change their minds. According to another <font size=-1>MORI</font> poll in May, 67% of them are "very" or "fairly" strong in their backing. This compares with only 57% of Tories who are "very" or "fairly" strong. "The Tories are in deep, deep trouble," says Bob Worcester of <font size=-1>MORI</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, Labour's lead is based on some firm-looking foundations. Mr Major is as unpopular as ever. According to <font size=-1>MORI</font>, voters dissatisfied with him as prime minister outnumber those satisfied by 34 percentage points, the same as last September. And Labour has leads in all <font size=-1>MORI</font>'s three summary measures of party standing. By a three-to-two majority it is reckoned to have the best team of leaders; by more than two to one to be the most united; and by nearly two to one to have the best policies. Labour leads on eight of the ten issues reckoned by voters the most important facing Britain. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Recent developments in the electoral system also make it very difficult for the Conservatives to win. The system--first past-the-post in single-member constituencies--is kind to parties which concentrate their votes in seats they might take, but hard on those whose vote is evenly spread across the country. Usually, this hurts the Liberal Democrats. But demographic changes and an increase in tactical voting in European and local elections since 1992 mean that it is the Tory vote which now looks the most evenly spread. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the next election, Labour may need only 1% more of the vote than the Tories to win an overall Commons majority. The Tories may need to poll at least 7% more than Labour to do the same. If the Tories do as well in 1997 as they did in 1992 in terms of the total vote, they are still likely to fall short of an overall Commons majority. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So is a Labour victory a foregone conclusion? Not necessarily. Although most poll analysts do believe that Labour will win, many are more uncertain of this than the polling evidence seems to warrant. Among their reservations:<br>
<font size=-1></font> <br><b>Doubts as to the accuracy of the polls</b>. Before the 1992 election, the polls gave Labour the edge. In the event, the Tories were ahead by 8% of the vote. Some think that the polls are still underestimating Tory strength. Tory supporters are more reluctant to tell interviewers how they vote because, today, many people think it barely respectable to admit to being a Tory. There is a problem of poll methods, too. It seems that the method of sampling used by most pollsters, designed to represent a cross-section of the whole population in a single group of voters polled, is flawed, and includes too few Tory voters in the sample. This is confirmed by a new study by John Curtice, a psephologist with the Centre for Research into Elections and Social Trends, using data from the academic British Election Panel Study. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All the main pollsters now make adjustments to their polls which attempt to allow for the reticence of Tory voters. On these calculations, Labour's vote comes out 4.6% lower on average and the Tories 3.6% higher, according to Professor David Sanders of Essex University. But, if Mr Curtice is right, the polls still overstate Labour's true lead even after this adjustment.<br>
<font size=-1></font> <br><b>The "feel-good" factor</b>. Economic optimism has picked up. According to the September <font size=-1>MORI</font> figures, those expecting the economy to improve in the next 12 months are now only slightly fewer in number than those expecting it to get worse--by a mere one percentage point. Although this is worse than it was in August, when optimists actually outnumbered pessimists by two points, it is still much better than a year ago, when the figure was minus 19 points. A rise in house prices and consumer spending tell the same story. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whether this will spill over into votes for the Tories is a much-posed question. Statistical models linking voting intention to economic optimism broke down when sterling was ignominiously ejected from the European Union's exchange-rate mechanism in September 1992. Since then, voters have been reluctant to give the government credit for an improving economy. But in time better economic performance must surely help the Tories, even though the polls are not yet indicating this.<br>
<font size=-1></font> <br><b>A decline in Tony Blair's ratings.</b> After last year's Labour conference, voters satisfied with his leadership exceeded those dissatisfied by 27 percentage points. In August, that was down to nine points.<br>
<font size=-1></font> <br><b>A "softness" in the Labour vote.</b> Many voters say they will back Labour next time without really identifying themselves with the party. Around 37% of electors now say that they "generally" think of themselves as Labour compared with 51% of electors who say they would vote Labour in a general election. Both parties report that the "focus" groups of voters which they use to test their image report that the commitment of many voters who say they will vote Labour remains uncertain. There is academic evidence to support this. Paul Whiteley of Sheffield University and Howard Clarke of the University of Texas have applied a statistical technique called "error correction" to measure softness. They confirm that the Labour vote is flaky.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But this does not mean that they think Labour will lose. They produce a variety of scenarios for the election. The best gives Labour a landslide-winning 46.5% of the vote. And no amount of "feel-good" alone wins the election for the Tories. But one scenario does: lots of "feel-good" and lots of Labour bickering. "It looks as if Labour is going to win, but they could blow it," says Mr Whiteley. The succinct advice to Labour is: "Shut up now!"<br>

<p><b>Crime</b></p>
<h1>Suspect figures</h1>

PUT not your trust in statistics is this week's lesson for Michael Howard. For the past two years, the home secretary has been boasting of the falling recorded crime figures and claiming that they prove his dictum that "prison works". Now the number of crimes recorded by the police, published on September 24th, is rising again. Violent crime, Mr Howard's principal target, is rising particularly fast. Presumably this proves that prison does not work.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact the numbers prove nothing except that it is risky to place much reliance on such famously unreliable statistics. The latest batch show that, so far as those recorded by the police go, violent crimes rose by 10% in the year to June; homicides were almost unchanged (at 730, compared with 729); property offences fell by 0.3%; motor vehicle break-ins and thefts fell by 1%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A more important set of numbers was also published on the same day--the British Crime Survey (<font size=-1>BCS</font>), which is carried out every two years by asking people whether they have been victims of crime. The <font size=-1>BCS</font> shows a 2% rise in crime in 1993-95, the period when Mr Howard was saying the largest fall in crime for 40 years had taken place. Police and academic crime-watchers consider the <font size=-1>BCS</font> to be more accurate than the recorded crime figures.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Robert Reiner, a criminologist at the London School of Economics, argues that "there never was a decline in crime. What has happened is a decrease in the proportion of crime that is getting recorded. The dark figure of unrecorded crime is growing." Mr Reiner thinks this is happening at the moment for three reasons.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;First, one of the main reasons that people report property crime is because their insurance companies require it. During the 1990s, there has been a marginal fall in insurance coverage in the rougher areas of cities, which may lead to less reporting. Second, the police, being overworked, are less inclined to visit people to take details of crimes; and if the victim cannot be bothered to go to the police station, then the crime does not get reported. Third, new management systems have been introduced into the police, requiring them to meet targets related to crime statistics. The police therefore have a greater incentive not to record crimes.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What, then, do the more reliable <font size=-1>BCS</font> figures suggest? There seems to have been a slight decrease in property crime, and an increase in violent crime; but, in all, a smaller increase than at any time since the survey started in 1981. That may well be because of demographics: the proportion of male teenagers, who make up the bulk of criminals, is shrinking.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Otherwise, economics seems to provide the best explanation. <i>Pace</i> the government (which has always insisted, for obvious reasons, that there is no connection between people being out of work and committing crimes), plenty of research points to a positive correlation between unemployment and property crime. That would suggest a fall in property crime at a time when unemployment is falling. The other clear correlation is between rising living standards and violent crime. Most violent crime is alcohol-related; and the richer people are the more they drink, and the more they drink the more they beat each other up.<br>

<p><b>Deregulation</b></p>
<h1>Something must be done</h1>

IT IS against the law to charge for dancing on Sunday, either in a disco or at a decorous tea-dance. It is legal to charge for drinking, horse-racing and other Sunday activities but not, according to the Sunday Observance Act of 1780, for dancing. Despite the efforts of the government's deregulation task force, and the passing of the 1994 Deregulation and Contracting Out Act, which made it easier to get rid of unnecessary regulations, charging for dancing on Sunday remains illegal.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Deregulation", said Michael Heseltine, the deputy prime minister, on September 23rd when presenting the second report of the task force that he set up on deregulation, "remains one of the government's top priorities." This does not leave much hope for things lower down the government's list. In 1995, according to the government's own figures, 1,404 new regulations were added, and 420 were thrown out. But this is not necessarily the fault of evil bureaucrats. At least some of the blame lies with the politicians and the public.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To be fair, those figures are crude. Some of them relate to such unobjectionable measures as road closures. But anti-red tape activists insist that they are a massive underestimate: <font size=-1>MP</font>s supporting a parliamentary motion earlier this year to promote deregulation maintain that the real figure from April 1995 to July 1996 is 3,000 new regulations. The task force, too, is clearly not content: its report focused not on achievements, but on the vast amount still to be done.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So why are regulations being created faster than they are being abolished? Europe must take some of the blame. Single market legislation means that products must be acceptable throughout the <font size=-1>EU</font>, which regulates to harmonise. Hence, apparently, the need for ten pages of Euro regulations related to the sale of cut flowers. If Europe's Council of Ministers passes new regulations in areas where national rules already exist, the result is too often two sets of regulation on the same subject.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet more of the blame, say the deregulators, lies at home. As Maurice Denyer, managing director of a small building company and a member of the task force, points out, efforts to make life easier for businesses sometimes fall foul of the regulators' passion for regulating.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government has, for instance, moved towards goals-based regulation: telling businesses what to aim for, but not how to do it. The idea is to give firms freedom in how to comply with the rules. Yet, says Mr Denyer, inspectors have responded by making "accepted codes of practice" appended to the regulations increasingly rigid, so the effect is much the same as the old, prescriptive, regulations.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then there is the problem of vested interests created by the existing set of regulations. The almighty row about the deregulation of Sunday shopping hours was created not just by the trade unions and the religious few, but also by small shopkeepers who feared that their profit margins would be eroded by supermarkets. The result was partial deregulation.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But a wider problem is attitudes to regulation among the public and in the press. Although people are against "red tape" in general, any particular health problem or accident inevitably leads to calls that "something must be done". The sharpest current example is a network of regulations and inspectors currently being set up for youth activity centres, as a result of an accident at such a centre in Lyme Regis in 1993, in which four teenagers were killed. The accident was a freak. The cost of setting up the system will be around &#163;5.5m if only the 3,000-odd profit-making centres are included, or &#163;100m if 80,000-odd voluntary sector ones are also included.<br>

<p><b>The economy</b></p>
<h1>Return of the North-South gap</h1>

DURING the boom of the late 1980s, it became fashionable to describe a Britain divided into two nations: the Loadsamoney South and the Bugger-all money North, in Harry Enfield's uncryptic words. The recession of 1990-92, which hit the South disproportionately hard, silenced such talk. Indeed, the thought spread that the 1980s were an aberration, and that future economic growth would be spread more evenly throughout the land. Now, with another consumer boom taking hold, it seems that the gulf between the rich South and the poor North is starting to widen again, and that it may go on widening for years to come.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The extent of the North-South divide, past or future, should not be overstated. In every region of Britain, average incomes per head have risen by at least 20% since 1979. There have long been pockets of wealth north of Birmingham to match anything in the Home Counties. The three local-authority districts in Britain with the lowest average incomes per head are in London. Some southern areas receive regional aid: Cornwall has had assisted-area status for more than 15 years. Even so, the North-South distinction matters.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<a href="br2.gif">Chart 1</a> shows the difference between unemployment in selected British regions and the national average rate (excluding Northern Ireland). The highest rate of joblessness over the past 20 years has been in the North of England, and the other above average regions are all from the northern half of the country. The South (comprising the regions of south-east and south-west England, East Anglia and the east Midlands) had below-average unemployment. In the 1980s, the gap between the highest and lowest jobless rates soared from 2-3% to 6-8%, then fell to 4% in the recent recession.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That four-percentage-point gap suggests that rumours of the death of the North-South divide in the 1990s were exaggerated. So do aggregate measures of prosperity: average <font size=-1>GDP</font> per head in the South is now &#163;10,069; it is &#163;8,448 in the North. The South's per capita consumer spending beats the North's by &#163;7,544 to &#163;6,412. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Does this matter? The answer depends largely on whether the gap is self-correcting, or permanent. After all, simple theories of supply and demand would suggest that firms will move to areas of low wages and high unemployment, to take advantage of cheaper labour and surplus workers, or that workers will move away from such areas to where more and better-paid jobs exist. Both movements should narrow the gap. At first glance, this seems to be what has helped to narrow the unemployment differentials since the late 1980s.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, this optimistic interpretation is challenged in "Planning for Local Change", a study of the British economy published on September 27th by the Henley Centre, a firm of economic forecasters. It concludes that the narrowing of the gap during the 1990-92 recession, far from being the start of a permanent structural shift in favour of the North, was a temporary correction resulting from the bursting of the late 1980s' housing and consumption bubble, which was biggest in the South.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With that correction now complete, the South is likely to grow faster once again, says the study. Indeed, the gap between the highest and lowest regional jobless rates has grown from four percentage points to five since 1992. And, as <a href="br3.gif">chart 2</a> shows, although manufacturing jobs have been lost equally in both North and South during the post-1992 recovery, the South has been leading the way in creating new service-sector jobs, as it did in the 1980s.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to one of the report's authors, Paul Williams, an economist at the Henley Centre, rather than moving to areas where wages are lowest, firms tend to cluster together in the more competitive bits of the country. The South is better represented in those service industries which are likely to create the most wealth over the next few years: telecoms, computers and financial services. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some leading economists, such as America's Paul Krugman, argue that, although regional disparities may grow in the short run, congestion costs will limit, and then reverse, the process of agglomeration in the long run. Mr Williams disputes this, arguing instead that the South's competitive edge comes from its superior ability--from a greater pool of educated workers and better access to finance, among other things--to move rapidly into whatever economic activity has the highest value added at any given moment.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The North produces the lion's share of manufacturing output, but the manufacturing that does takes place in the South has a far higher value per tonne. When service firms have shifted away from congested parts of the South, they have tended to move first to less congested parts of the same region. There have been a number of well-publicised moves to the North, but most of these were of back-office, low value added activities. High value-creating activity remains largely southern-based; 60% of venture-capital investment in Britain goes to south-east England alone.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In America, although some states have enjoyed consistently faster economic growth than others during the past half century, the average rate of unemployment in each state has tended to stay close to the national average. Any deviations from the national average have mostly vanished within a few years, as the jobless moved to where the work was.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Britain, however, regional differences have persisted. Incredibly, the regional ranking of unemployment rates has barely changed since 1918. Migration has been relatively modest, although a southwards drift has recently restarted (see <a href="br3.gif">chart</a>). Moreover, movement is mostly by skilled, non-manual workers. As a result, there is little regional disparity in non-manual unemployment rates, but there are huge differences in manual joblessness. There are several plausible reasons why the less skilled stay put: it is hard for council tenants to move around the country, and property costs more in the South. But the perverse result is that, by offering an escape route to poorer regions' most valuable people, labour mobility exacerbates rather than ameliorates the North-South divide.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the divide does grow ever wider, it is likely to increase demand for more active regional policies to correct the imbalance. In fact, the government already transfers huge amounts northwards through the tax and social-security systems. "Financing Regional Government in Britain," a recent study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research group, calculated how much tax each region would have to levy to pay for its own public spending. It found that, using 1993-94 data (the latest available), the basic rate of income tax would have to rise to 41% in Wales, 38% in Scotland and 32% in the North of England, compared with 24% now. (There would have to be similar increases in the top rate of tax.) People in the south-east and south west would enjoy a tax cut, to 18.5% and 22.6% respectively.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This complicates current demands for regional government in Scotland, Wales and northern England. Genuine autonomy in these areas would cost locals a fortune in higher taxes. But perhaps the oddest feature of British politics is the lack of interest in regional autonomy in southern England, which has much to gain by loosening ties with the rest of of the country. Many people in Italy's wealthy north voted for the independence-minded Northern League?. So where is Britain's Southern League<br>

<h1>Fair trade</h1>

BETWEEN now and the general election, Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, can expect frequent repeats of this week's run-ins with, on the one hand, Tory Eurosceptics and, on the other, Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England. But the crumb of comfort for Mr Clarke in this week's economic data is that at least he will not face a balance-of-payments crisis. In the second quarter of this year, Britain ran a surplus of &#163;500m on its current account (its overall financial balance with the rest of the world), the biggest, and only the second, quarterly surplus since 1987 (see <a href="br4.gif">chart</a>). A positive balance for the whole of 1996 is now possible, or at worst a deficit of say &#163;1 billion-&#163;2 billion--nothing compared with the record deficit of &#163;22 billion in 1989.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Economists in the City of London had forecast a deficit of over &#163;1 billion in the second quarter after news that there had been a &#163;3.6 billion deficit in traded goods during that period. But income from overseas investments was a surprisingly strong &#163;3.7 billion. And there was an equally buoyant trade surplus in services of &#163;1.9 billion, including a boost to tourism revenues of perhaps &#163;200m from overseas visitors to June's Euro 96 soccer tournament. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although unexpected, this current account rebound is no flash in the pan, reckons Jonathan Loynes, an economist at <font size=-1>HSBC</font>, an investment bank. Although the traded-goods deficit may get bigger as stronger investment and consumer spending sucks in imports, there is no reason why Britain's service exports or its foreign investments should falter, he says. For which good news Mr Clarke should be deeply grateful.<br>

<h1>Labour's awkward one-man band</h1>

IT WAS as wooer to shy virgin that Tony Blair gave his speech to a City of London audience this month. This was not the tough Mr Blair who will be paraded before voters at next week's Labour Party conference in Blackpool, but Tony Blair as Hugh Grant-- self-deprecating, charming and seductive. And so it took a certain nerve on the part of one member of the audience, George Cox of the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, to ask the $64,000 question.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Mr Blair, like many here, I greatly enjoyed your talk and I applaud much of the sentiment in it," began Mr Cox. "My question is this: that if, sadly, at the last minute you had been incapacitated . . . could we have expected the same speech to have been given with the same insights, the same passion, the same conviction from any other member of your shadow cabinet, or perhaps of more importance, from any Labour candidate whom you will be putting forward to us to elect next year?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Blair replied with practised fluency. After the largest democratic exercise any party has undertaken, he had been elected on a modernisation ticket. There was "no real intellectual argument against modernisation". New Labour candidates and young Labour members were enthusiastic Blairites. His party was much less extreme and more united than were the Tories. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet the one-man-band question is still the one the leader's intimates fear the most. It might cost them the election. Worse, if New Labour does prove a one-man band, it will fail in government. It is too easy to imagine circumstances in which a Labour government, elected with high hopes, dissolves into division and disarray. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The party's immediate priority is to try to stop the electorate imagining any such thing. At Blackpool the leadership will therefore seek to repeat last year's feat of winning every single tricky vote. They do not want a conference, but a rally.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And yet they may not get it. Imagine, if you will, the moment when the 85-year-old Barbara Castle, the personal embodiment of sentimental old Labour, totters to the rostrum to call for higher universal pensions. The argument against her is being conducted by Harriet Harman, who speaks for Labour on social security and who, for half the hall, is the traitor who sent her son to a selective grammar school. Ms Harman will win the argument. Lady Castle's proposal would clobber the taxpayer while doing nothing for poor pensioners who would lose in means tested benefits what they gain from higher universal pensions. But minds are not hearts, and Lady Castle may yet render her party one last disservice by winning the vote.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Defeat for Mr Blair would not matter much in substance. Labour leaders have frequently ignored unpalatable conference decisions in the past. But it would be an uncomfortable omen for a Blair-led government. Two-thirds of Labour <font size=-1>MP</font>s in the next Parliament will be retreads from this one. Many are not Blairites, but voted for him in a Faustian bargain: they give him silence, he gives them victory. But once he has won, they may not prove so tractable. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Evidence of the potential cussedness of Labour <font size=-1>MP</font>s in the next Parliament is contained in a fascinating paper, "Blair's Bastards", by Philip Cowley and Philip Norton of Hull University. Even now, their analysis shows, Labour rebels are both more numerous and more persistent than their Tory counterparts. Almost 70% of the party have rebelled against the party line since 1992; 35% have cast more than ten votes against the party line compared with 27% of Tories. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;True, a few of the serial dissenters are to leave the Commons at the next general election--notably Peter Shore, a distinguished Eurosceptic. But, of the top 38 rebels, just five will definitely be gone from the next Parliament.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, Mr Blair will have potent weapons to wield against rebels: the power of patronage and the threat of expulsion or deselection. And he will be immeasurably helped by the fact that not one of the rebels proposes any serious alternative to Blairism.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, you can have rebels without a cause; which means that Mr Blair would be wise to contemplate an insurance policy. Even if Labour has a clear overall majority, he would be sensible to seek a working arrangement with Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, it may be easier for Mr Blair to do the deal if he has a majority than if the next Parliament is hung. In a hung Parliament, the Lib Dems will be <i>demandeurs</i>, with the power to pull the rug. Their price might prove too high. If, however, Mr Blair courts them when he has no need to, they should come cheaper. A cabinet job for Mr Ashdown; lesser ministries for Mr Ashdown's lesser colleagues; a modest reform of the voting system--although Lib Dem purists will huff and puff, these in reality might seal a deal.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The advantages to Mr Blair would be substantial. The Lib Dems expect to win at least 30 seats. If they side with Labour, therefore, Mr Blair's majority will be 60 higher than if they are against him--a comfortable cushion against rebellion and the almost inevitable losses at by-elections. Such an alliance would also make it easier, if it endured, for him to win a second term. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Seen in this light, the conference that is of most significance for a future Labour government may not be the party's own in Blackpool, but the one the Lib Dems have just held in Brighton. Some Lib Dems were outspokenly in favour of dealing with Labour. Some were outspokenly against. But most, including the leader himself, spoke about it not at all. As a result, come the day after polling, Mr Ashdown has a pretty free hand. If Mr Blair has any sense, he will firmly grasp it.<br>

<h1>Campaigning for a cause</h1>

WHY did 550 British marketeers, a habitually well-fed bunch, receive a Red Cross food parcel on September 24th? The Red Cross, one of the world's largest humanitarian organisations, is less concerned with their eating the loaf of bread it contained than their digesting the message on its wrapper. For Hovis, the baker of the bread, is one of the first companies to sign up with HelpAd, a company owned by the charity.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;HelpAd persuades makers of consumer goods to leave room for an advertisement on the outside of their packaging, and then sells this advertising space to another manufacturer, who makes something which goes well with the first product. Thus the loaf in the parcel carried an ad for Anchor butter; in another example Tabasco pepper sauce has bought spaces on the side of bottles of Del Monte tomato juice. The advertisements all include a little HelpAd logo explaining that the money from selling the space goes to the Red Cross. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;HelpAd charges commercially competitive rates for the space it sells. The aim is to secure a sustainable source of money for the Red Cross by tapping into companies' advertising budgets, rather than the discretionary funds usually set aside for charitable donations. The Red Cross spends around $24 billion a year-- around a tenth of the sum companies spend on advertising. HelpAd's goal is to be selling &#163;10m ($16m) of advertisements a year in Britain within two years. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So far the makers of some 500 products have made inquiries. However, persuading protective brand managers to take the plunge has been laborious. A frequent obstacle to an apparently promising product marriage is that a parent company that makes a brand of cream cheese, say, which might potentially be advertised on another company's crackers in fact has its own rival brand of cracker under another label. So far HelpAds have appeared on seven products, and three more product pairings have been firmly promised to appear by February 1997. Many interested companies are holding off from commitment to see how these ten fare. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If they go well, HelpAd intends to expand overseas. Plans are already afoot in another seven European countries and in South Africa. Other kinds of advertising are on the cards, too. Robert Doyle, a Northern Irish construction surveyor who thought up the idea of HelpAd and who is now a consultant to the Red Cross, is encouraging sports stars to "give their right arms to the Red Cross", by using the right sleeve of their playing shirts as a location for a HelpAd. And HelpAd may function as a broker for charities other than the Red Cross, offering its service for a small percentage of the money paid for the advertisement.<br>

<p><b>Bulgaria</b></p>
<h1>Into the hole</h1>

FORTUNES are mixed among former communists. While frothy stockmarkets fuel recovery in Central Europe, Bulgaria is fighting to avert meltdown. On September 24th, the central bank raised its main interest rate almost threefold, to 300%, and placed nine banks under "special supervision". The move was a last-ditch attempt to restore public confidence in the banking system, to stave off default on the country's $11.9 billion foreign debt, and to halt the steep slide of the Bulgarian currency, the lev. The central bank's governor, Lyubomir Filipov, staked his job on the new reforms working: a brave bet indeed.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Earlier stabs at reform were far too timid. In the spring, the central bank closed five troubled banks and raised interest rates several times, while the government launched a plan to shut loss-making industrial behemoths and kick-start privatisation. But this has proved inadequate. Inflation, brought under control last year, is now an annualised 110% and may soon hit 150%. The lev has collapsed from 71 to the dollar at start of the year to 230 (see <a href="fn1.gif">chart</a>). In recent weeks, depositors have lost all faith in the insolvent banking system, withdrawing local currency and switching it into dollars.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the government wants to avert disaster, it must move quickly on three fronts. First, it will have to close more dodgy banks, while toughening supervision and raising capital requirements for the survivors. Most banks are shoddily managed and have far too many dud loans. It must also stop state-run industry's losses. Of the 64 state-owned companies that the government promised to close earlier this year, only five have been wound up so far.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The third aim should be quicker privatisation. Asset sales brought in a piffling 9 billion lev ($135m) last year. Only by speeding up the process can Bulgaria raise enough cash to see it through the coming months. On September 22nd, it announced plans to sell 15 of the largest state firms by the year's end. The sales should raise between $500m and $1 billion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But more than this is needed. Repairing a battered economy is expensive: raising the biggest Bulgarian banks' solvency ratios to international levels could cost $3 billion alone. On top of this, Bulgaria has its foreign debt to service. This month alone, it must find $130m to repay both principal and interest; next year it is expected to repay a total of $1.25 billion. If privatisation flags, the country may have to default for the second time since 1990.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whether it does or not may depend on the World Bank and the <font size=-1>IMF</font>. Next week their representatives are due to meet government officials to discuss progress. If the Bulgarians impress the <font size=-1>IMF</font>, the Fund will release a $115m loan that it delayed last month; the World Bank may then follow with $200m of its own. If, however, the Fund holds on to its money, the lev--and Bulgaria's economic prospects--are sure to take another dive.<br>

<h1>The weirdest computer of all</h1>

<p><b>A quantum computer would rely on the surreal behaviour of the very small to work miracles with information. There is new hope that it might someday be more than fantasy</b></p>
THE computer has become so widespread, its applications so boundless, that it is easy to forget that it is just a machine, constrained like everything else by the laws of physics. But a machine is all it is, and a pretty simple one at that. The underlying logic of the programs--the binary choices that control the way a computer counts and calculates--would work just as well (if a lot more slowly) in a device that shuttled ball-bearings instead of electrons.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What, though, if a computer could be built around a different kind of physics, the quantum physics that governs the weird and uncertain behaviour of atoms and sub-atomic particles? A group of physicists and mathematicians that is working on this question believes that quantum computing could change computing just as thoroughly as quantum physics changed the Newtonian certainties of classical physics earlier in the 20th century.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Naturally, building a useful quantum computer would be difficult. Only the very smallest objects behave in a detectably quantum way. This means that the components of such a computer would be very tiny and very delicate. But so great is the theoretical appeal of the machine that America's Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (<font size=-1>DARPA</font>) has just created an Institute for Quantum Information and Computing, and given it $5m to investigate the possibilities.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Bit players</b></b><br>
What makes quantum computing so attractive? For some jobs, a quantum computer would be able to put even the best of today's supercomputers in the shade. It would do this by employing a trick that ordinary computers cannot truly master--parallel processing. Although supercomputers are fast, they can, like all other digital computers, do only one thing at a time. Even the so called "parallel" computers now available are just collections of machines that each do only one thing at a time. But a quantum computer would be truly parallel. It would be able to do many different things simultaneously in the same piece of equipment.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To see why, remember that every digital computer, no matter how wondrous its applications, consists merely of a lot of switches that are linked together and are either on or off. These switches can be thought of as the digits of numbers, in which case their ons and offs are the ones and zeros of binary counting. This is why, by a fortunate contraction of the words "binary digit", the currency of data processing is known as the "bit".<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The switches inside a computer can also be interpreted as the trues and falses of a form of logic known as Boolean algebra. Indeed, they are organised into "logic gates" that do calculations using this algebra. A digital computer is mainly a machine for altering bits by running them through logic gates. The gate known as <font size=-1>AND</font>, for example, compares two bits. If both have a value of "one", it creates an output of one; otherwise it creates a zero. With the next tick of its internal clock, the computer then passes this output bit to another gate for further processing. Each tick, then, corresponds to one step of the calculation.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the quantum world, however, the rules are different. A quantum computer's switches would not have to be either on or off. Like any quantum object which can come in several distinct states, a quantum switch can carry on indefinitely as a combination of all those states. It is not merely stuck halfway between on and off; it is actually on and off simultaneously, as if it existed in two parallel worlds.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bits in a "quantum computer" would not, therefore, be ones or zeros. They would be quantum combinations of one and zero. Such vacillating pieces of information are known as "qubits"(pronounced as "cubits", though they are usually rather smaller than the ancient Hebrew unit of length).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is this simultaneous existence in many states that would give quantum computing its power. An ordinary computer having (say) ten bits could exist in only one of 1,024 states (all the ten-digit sequences that can be made from ones and zeros) available to it, at each instant. A quantum computer with ten qubits could exist in all 1,024 states at the same time. It could therefore work on 1,024 calculations at once.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But qubits are fiendishly hard to make. For a quantum switch to maintain its multiple existence depends on one big proviso. Nothing can happen that might disturb it. No light must shine on it, no stray air molecules may bump into it, no inquiring probe can intrude on it. If it is disturbed, it stops vacillating and chooses a definite state to be in. This choice depends on chance and on the way its multiple personalities have interacted until then. If it happens prematurely, the computation will be ruined.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This proviso has made technical progress agonisingly slow. Paul Benioff, at Argonne National Laboratory, in Illinois, first applied quantum theory to computers in 1981. David Deutsch, at Oxford University, proposed the possibility of quantum parallel computers in 1985. Yet both had to wait until last year for the first two qubits to come on-line.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One group of quantum mechanics who created them was led by Chris Monroe, who works at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, in Boulder, Colorado. Dr Monroe's group trapped a single ion (an atom with missing electrons) of beryllium, by walling it in with electric and magnetic fields and cooling it to within an ace of absolute zero (-273&#176;C). Such an ion has two energy levels--providing the first qubit. And it can vibrate in two ways within the trap--the second qubit. These qubits are linked together via a pulse of laser light, which can switch the ion from one energy level to the other. Whether it does so or not depends on which of the two vibrational patterns the ion is in.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The result is a logic gate called <font size=-1>XOR</font>. This has two input bits, and reverses the value of the second if the first is "one". That is an important step. Though using many types of gate makes designing ordinary computers easier, it is possible to make do with just three: <font size=-1>AND</font>, <font size=-1>NOT</font> and <font size=-1>COPY</font>. A quantum computer is even simpler. It requires only two sorts of gate, and <font size=-1>XOR</font> is one of them. (The other would be able to change a zero into an arbitrary combination of zero and one. This has no equivalent in conventional computing.) <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Qubits can also be made out of light, because light can be polarised in two perpendicular directions. Jeff Kimble, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), in Pasadena, and the head of the <font size=-1>DARPA</font> quantum-computing institute, is working towards a light-based device. He and his team have designed a piece of apparatus that allows photons (the particles of which light is composed) to interact while they fly through a stream of caesium atoms. This interaction could in principle form the basis of logic gates like <font size=-1>XOR</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Trapping ions, though, may ultimately prove to be the best way to make real quantum computers. Such devices would require thousands of ions, vibrating in synchrony, and are certainly still in the realms of science fiction. But ion traps housing up to six ions have already been built during other atomic-physics projects. Groups at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, in New Mexico, and the University of Innsbruck, in Austria, are trying to improve upon them to connect a handful of qubits together.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Qubits v true bits</b></b><br>
Why bother? Why should <font size=-1>DARPA</font>, better known for researching missile defences and commissioning the precursor of the Internet, dabble in quantum theory? Perhaps to make better calculators. There are already three mathematical challenges known in which quantum computers would beat the pants off the ordinary kind.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first is up <font size=-1>DARPA</font>'s alley: cracking secret codes. The security of most "public key" coding schemes, in which people can exchange secrets without advance planning, relies on inscrutable large numbers. It is hard to factorise--to find numbers that multiply together to produce--some 200 digit numbers. But it is these factors that unlock the code. Since the programs for finding them are excruciatingly tedious, even for a fleet of supercomputers, such codes are pretty safe.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A quantum computer, on the other hand, would make short work of this task. In 1994, Peter Shor, a mathematician at <font size=-1>AT&T</font> Labs, in Murray Hill, New Jersey, designed a quantum circuit that could achieve it in many fewer steps. His quantum software arranges the multiple personalities of the qubits in a way that enables them to attack the problem separately, and then conspire together so that when they are, in the end, forced to behave like normal bits, they will be likely to produce the correct answer.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like much of quantum theory, this can be properly explained only in mathematics, not words. But a sense of what it entails can be gained by recognising that the equations of quantum theory are not unlike those of wave motion, as Seth Lloyd, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has suggested. Each parallel path of a qubit is analogous to a sound wave of a particular pitch. When different tones play together, they interfere, reinforcing or cancelling one another depending on their strengths and timing. The parallel lives of qubits do the same. And the strongest tones are the ones likeliest to be chosen by the qubits when they are measured.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In this analogy, an ordinary computation can be thought of as a melody of single notes plinked out on a piano. A quantum computation, with its complex array of chords and rhythms, sounds more like the Berlin Philharmonic. Dr Shor's trick was to arrange the concert hall so that the music was completely dominated by the proper overtones and beats--the rich timbre of the French horns, say--that correspond to the correct solution.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lov Grover, a computer scientist at Bell Labs (which recently split from <font size=-1>AT&T</font> Labs), has written quantum symphonies to solve two other problems. One, published in May, is a way to search unsorted databases. If you were to sift through 10,000 pieces of paper scattered about your desk in search of one important memo, you would have to be prepared to scan 5,000 of them to have an even chance of finding it. By assigning each parallel computation to pursue a different choice, a quantum computer could do the same in only 40 runs.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr Grover's other discovery, announced this month, is that quantum computers would be talented statisticians. They would excel at finding single numbers which depend collectively on lots of data: the median age of a large population, for example. If a quantum computer and an ordinary computer with the same internal clock rate raced to do it, the quantum computer would win hands down.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>
</p><p><b><b>Back to the future</b></b><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is, however, a snag. Qubits, not being true bits, are not truly digital. One of the big advantages of recording and processing information digitally is that it is difficult to make a mistake (electronic "ones" are not that easily turned into "zeros"), and surprisingly easy to design ways to recognise and correct any mistake that is made.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This ease of correction was shown in the 1940s, at a time when the first digital computers were being constructed. Claude Shannon, who also worked at <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, set the ball rolling by investigating ways of encoding bits of information so that they would resist errors during transmission down telephone lines. In the 1950s, John von Neumann, one of the mathematicians who helped to develop the theory of these early computers, went on to show how a reliable computer could be built out of unreliable parts, by using Shannon's ideas and combining them with extra (so-called redundant) circuitry.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The simplest error-correcting code is triple-redundant. Each bit is copied into two more bits: 0 becomes 000, and 1 becomes 111. If one bit accidentally flips, the other two indicate this and can be used to fix it. But Rolf Landauer, a physicist at the <font size=-1>IBM</font> Watson Research Centre, in Yorktown Heights, New York, has insisted that this cannot work with qubits, which cannot be measured, let alone copied. Yet error-correction would be vastly more important in a quantum computer than an ordinary computer, since the disturbance of even one qubit could ruin the coherence of the whole computation. If quantum computing is to become more than a dream, it needs a new way to correct errors as well as new hardware. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was therefore a welcome surprise when Dr Shor announced a year ago that he had invented a quantum error-correcting code. Instead of three qubits, Dr Shor's encoding formula required nine. A few months later other researchers at <font size=-1>IBM</font>, Los Alamos and Oxford came up with codes that work with five of them.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The idea begins with the qubit that needs to be protected from errors, and four other qubits, set to zero. A sequence of logic gates changes and tangles all five bits into a larger quantum combination. Just as one qubit is a mix of two different states, two qubits are a mix of four, three are a mix of eight, and so on. Five entangled qubits span 32 possibilities--each of the five-digit sequences that can be made of ones and zeros.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Five qubits are enough, though, to preserve the quantum ambiguity of what is going on, even if one of them goes bad. One qubit being unmasked by, for example, a collision with a stray air molecule, does not reveal enough information for an observer to work anything out about the qubit originally used to make the mixture. In these circumstances, the calculation can be corrected, and proceed unhindered. The original mixing, in other words, creates quantum cannon fodder for such interactions as would otherwise spoil a combination. Some losses become tolerable without the game being given away.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are still problems to be overcome, of course. It is necessary to design logic gates that will work on entangled bundles of five qubits at a time. And errors can still creep in during the encoding process itself. Dr Shor's latest achievements, to be announced at the Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science, being held in Burlington, Vermont, in October, address both of these concerns. First, he has designed logic gates for protected qubits by combining lots of two-qubit logic gates. Second, he has shown, theoretically, that the improvements in components needed to make quantum computing reliable should not, once such components actually exist, be too onerous.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His second result is analogous to the ideas in one of von Neumann's achievements, the "Synthesis of Reliable Organisms from Unreliable Parts". Early sceptics of computing thought that allowing computers to work, say, ten times longer on a problem would require components that were ten times as reliable. Von Neumann showed that, with the shrewd use of error correcting codes and redundant logic gates, the components did not need to be any more reliable. All that was necessary was that the speed of the calculation be slowed down to allow for error-correction. Dr Shor's result is not quite as powerful as this. He has shown that to allow a quantum computation to proceed for ten times as long, the reliability of components does have to be improved a little. But the improvement required is a small fixed increment, not a factor of ten.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That quantum error-correction is possible at all has led to a new wave of optimism about quantum computing. The circuitry for error-correction is too complex to be built in a laboratory anytime soon. But the group from Innsbruck, which is led by Peter Zoller and Rainer Blatt, has just published another partial error-correcting code based on the principle of quantum cannon fodder. This one is still simpler than Dr Shor's and should be particularly effective in correcting the sort of errors that might be expected in an ion-trap quantum computer.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Three times five, silly</b></b><br>
The Innsbruck group hopes to try out its scheme with a three-bit computer by 1998. Meanwhile, in Los Alamos, Richard Hughes and his team are planning to implement Dr Shor's algorithm for factorisation. With luck they will be able to factorise the number 15 within five years.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That this is considered ambitious hints at the difficulty of this latest merger of physics and computing. Indeed, many physicists doubt whether quantum computing will ever amount to anything useful. Dr Landauer is one of them. His work on the ordinary (not quantum) physics of information led to a new appreciation of information's inextricable relationship with physics. But he does not expect <font size=-1>IBM</font> to be mass-producing quantum computers anytime soon.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In this, he is assuredly correct. And even among the quantum computer's enthusiasts, most researchers are motivated less by a desire to produce a practical quantum computer than by a wish to learn how to wield more control over quantum effects themselves. Until now, nobody has been able to direct quantum states with the flexibility or precision required for quantum computers. Doing so should help to illuminate some of quantum theory's more curious features.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition, if quantum computing really could be made to work, physicists would have a powerful new analytical tool. One use for it would be to explore the many ramifications of quantum theory (such as the "Hubbard model" of how electrons hop around in a crystal, or theories of fundamental particles) that are thought to be correct but cannot be tested precisely. The sort of equations needed to check these ideas are too much for even the most nimble non-quantum supercomputer to handle.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1982, the late Richard Feynman, who was also at Caltech, suggested that a quantum computer would help to solve these sorts of problems. To simulate an ordinary object, only a few numbers are needed. For a quantum object every possible state must be tracked--an enormous set of numbers. How better to keep up with the calculation than by using something that is itself in a multitude of states?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whether such uses will come to fruition remains to be seen. But, as Dr Landauer points out, in one sense quantum computing has already been useful. It has provided a salutary reminder that computing does not take place in an abstract mathematical world. It uses earth, air, fire and water--or single atoms of those things. It is subject to all the limitations, and all the possibilities, written in the laws of physics. Some mathematicians and computer scientists spend their days searching for the quickest possible algorithm to solve particular problems. To their surprise they must now learn quantum theory, in order to cover all the possibilities allowed by nature. After a long absence, they are being forced to return from the virtual reality of information science and deal with the real world, in all its indeterminate queerness.<br>

<h1>TECHNOLOGY BRIEF</h1>

<h2>Being digital is not enough</h2>

<p><b>The dustbin of history is full of technological ideas that looked good at the time, but which nobody wanted to buy. What does it take for a new gizmo to catch on? The first in a series of articles seeks lessons from attempts to replace the compact disc and the tape cassette</b></p><br>
EVERYONE who is anyone in the consumer-electronics business has a dream: to do to the compact disc what the <font size=-1>CD</font> did to the vinyl record. Many have tried. All, so far, have failed.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Technologies may miss their mark for several reasons. They may not fill a market need. They may not deliver what they promised. And they may be too expensive to manufacture. But none of these reasons for failure applies to the various gadgets that have been put forward as successors to the <font size=-1>CD</font>. The market for recorded music is clearly huge. The new technologies worked. And they were not ludicrously costly to make. But they failed because they were not sufficiently better than the established alternatives.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since the success of <font size=-1>CD</font>s, venture capitalists have introduced a rule of thumb, known as the <font size=-1>10X</font> rule, to help them decide which ventures to back. They ask themselves the question, "Is this thing ten times better than what it is replacing?" Or, perhaps more accurately, "Will consumers perceive it to be sufficiently better to think it worth the upheaval of changing?" So far, since the <font size=-1>CD</font>, it seems that no consumer audio technology has passed this test.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1982, when Philips and Sony introduced the <font size=-1>CD</font>, the perception of a massive leap was certainly created. <font size=-1>CD</font>s were, indeed, better than <font size=-1>LP</font>s. Encased in protective lacquer, and read by lasers instead of having sapphires dragged across their surfaces, they did not wear out. They needed to be neither flipped nor rewound. They took up less storage space. And some people even thought that the recording quality was superior. But what really helped the <font size=-1>CD</font> was timing.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sales of recorded music went flat in the late 1970s. In 1980 they actually began to fall. The moment for a new technology was psychologically right. And <font size=-1>CD</font> was the better mousetrap people were looking for. In 1982, being digital was an excitingly modern concept. The perceived benefits were enormous. So sales grew by leaps and bounds (see <a href="st1.gif">chart</a>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Flushed with success, the same two companies introduced digital audio tape (<font size=-1>DAT</font>) in 1987. <font size=-1>DAT</font> has advantages over both <font size=-1>CD</font>s and tape cassettes (which survived the <font size=-1>CD</font> onslaught at least in part because another Sony technology, the Walkman, allowed them to do things that <font size=-1>CD</font>s could not). Digital tape beats <font size=-1>CD</font>s because it can record music instead of just playing it. And it beats cassettes because its sound quality is better. Unlike <font size=-1>CD</font>s, though, <font size=-1>DAT</font> bombed.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The received wisdom is that it was killed by the record companies, who were afraid it might be used to make pirate copies, and thus wreck their sales. But other technologies (including <font size=-1>CD</font>s themselves) have been resisted by record companies and still succeeded. The real reason, therefore, seems to be that it simply did not pass the <font size=-1>10X</font> rule.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Today, <font size=-1>DAT</font> lingers on in a few minor applications. It is the professional musician's favourite way to exchange demo tapes. And followers of bands such as the Grateful Dead and Phish (who permit audiences to record shows) use <font size=-1>DAT</font> in droves. But these are niche markets for specialists. They are not the places where billions are made.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Undaunted, the two companies tried once again in 1992, this time independently. Once again, they ran up against the <font size=-1>10X</font> rule. Philips introduced the digital compact cassette (<font size=-1>DCC</font>). This, at least, had the advantage that the machines designed to play it could (unlike <font size=-1>DAT</font> machines) also play ordinary cassettes. Sony replied with the mini disc which, unlike the <font size=-1>CD</font>, allows a user to make his own recordings. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This time the record companies could not be blamed for any failure. Unlike <font size=-1>DAT</font>, the <font size=-1>DCC</font> had the support of most of them. And the mini disc naturally had Sony Music (previously <font size=-1>CBS</font> Records) behind it. It was billed as the biggest, bloodiest fight-of-the-formats since the video-cassette recorder duel between Betamax and <font size=-1>VHS</font>. But it wasn't. The two did not lay a glove on each other. Instead, both were floored by existing technologies.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>DCC</font> was a total failure. Though superior to ordinary cassettes, it was not even as high-fidelity as <font size=-1>DAT</font>. This was because Philips made the tape heads of <font size=-1>DCC</font> players simple and cheap. That, in turn, meant that the music had to be simplified and compressed. Philips did this mainly by "throwing away" inaudible sounds. But even so, aficionados claimed to be able to hear imperfections in pieces with a wide range of treble and bass. And when aficionados fail to rave, consumers are unlikely to buy.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The mini disc did not fail completely--it still has a following in Japan. But it did not storm the rest of the world. A mini disc looks like a small <font size=-1>CD</font>, but it works rather differently. A <font size=-1>CD</font>'s surface is covered with pits, which encode the information it carries. A mini disc is a magnetic recording (though, like a <font size=-1>CD</font>, it is read by a laser). This means that, like a cassette, it can be sold blank and used as a recording medium. And the mini disc not only trumps the cassette on sound quality, it is also able to leap from song to song instantly. Even so, these advantages do not seem to add up to the jump prescribed by the <font size=-1>10X</font> test--at least, not in the West.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The latest attempt, though, does pass the test, at least formally. The <font size=-1>DVD</font> (variously claimed to stand for "digital video disc" and "digital versatile disc") has narrower tracks and tinier pits than a <font size=-1>CD</font>. Each of its recording layers can hold about seven times as much information as a <font size=-1>CD</font>. This is enough to store a boxed set of music albums (or a feature film, or 4.7 gigabytes of computer memory; the <font size=-1>DVD</font> truly is versatile). Since the discs will feature at least two, and possibly four such recording layers (the laser can be refocused to read below the surface), they will beat the <font size=-1>10X</font> rule hands down in the area of storage capacity.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This, then, will truly test the rule. By the time <font size=-1>DVD</font>s are released (which was due to happen this autumn, but looks as though it will slip to next year), <font size=-1>CD</font>s will be a technology that is a decade and a half old. Their sales are still on the up, but they no longer carry the aura of modernity. The time may be ripe for a change, and the technological leap may be big enough for this to be the change that works.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But perhaps not. Though <font size=-1>DVD</font>s will surely do well in computer and video applications, where the extra capacity will be welcome, having more than 25 times as much music on a disc may not turn out to be what people want after all. And if it isn't, there is still plenty of room in the dustbin.<br>

<h1><center>Leadership by Stealth</center></h1>

VICTORIANS enforced their diplomacy by gunboat. At the end of the 20th century, the preferred instrument is the Stealth bomber. The Stealth is technically amazing, powerfully effective--and also bizarrely-shaped and difficult to trace. Is it not, in fact, rather like America's foreign policy?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As America goes nose-to-nose with Iraq's Saddam Hussein in the closing weeks of an election campaign, the familiar chorus can be heard. The United States is unpredictable; unreliable; too easily excited; too easily distracted; too fond of throwing its weight around. While Americans wonder which candidate will be better for their living standards over the next four years, America's friends have a wish-list of their own for foreign-policy improvements, irrespective of who wins or loses in November. And it is not short.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But is it fair? The main indictment, of inconsistency abroad, was current even before Mr Clinton began his unnerving odyssey through the perils of international affairs. Yet the verdict is not cut and dried. In many spheres, America has stood firm. It has persisted in trying to bring peace to the Middle East. It has remained committed to security in Europe, through <font size=-1>NATO</font>, and in Asia, through <font size=-1>APEC</font> and the security treaty with Japan. Most bases abroad have been retained. America continues to understand--indeed, to take pride in--its role as sole superpower, military colossus and chief knocker-together-of-heads on the world stage. It preened itself over the Rabin-Arafat handshake and, more justifiably, over Bosnia's Dayton accords--although they followed four damaging years of shall-we-shan't-we muddle towards the war.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America is also, however, consistent in less palatable ways. Since the end of the cold war, it has been in search of an enemy: and has found him in despots hither and yon, from Saddam Hussein to Cuba's Fidel Castro to Muhammad Farrah Aideed in Somalia. The personal vendetta, sometimes pursued by aged congressmen rather than the president, has become a regular event. So too has a manifest public reluctance to involve America in the sort of activities abroad that may be required of a superpower, especially the spending of money and the sending of troops.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Here lies the nub of the matter. The real complaint about American foreign policy is not waywardness, but reluctance to engage. To begin with, it is often hard to get America's attention. The problem is not isolationism, which, some firebrands apart, has no constituency these days. It is the natural self-centredness of a vast continent that faces no immediate external threats. No president since Nixon has seen his main job as devising foreign policy. Mr Clinton's attention-deficit on the subject (recently reduced) is not, alas, an aberration. But a president can be helped by good advisers in both the State Department and the Pentagon; and, however the election turns out, a more authoritative secretary of state in a happier department would be useful.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For nowadays the main point of foreign policy ought not to be the elimination of immediate external threats, but the avoidance of future ones. On that score, recent policy looks misdirected. During his tenure so far, Warren Christopher has been 27 times to Damascus and only once to China. Indeed, from sheer energy and verbiage alone, it may well appear that little Cuba is as much a threat as an expansionary China. America has not hesitated to offend most of its allies in Europe and in its own hemisphere in the cause of bashing a neighbouring island which represents no threat to it at all. Meanwhile, the signals sent to China, which may be a huge threat in future, have been distinctly mixed: now tough on human rights, now fawning on trade; now oblivious to China's menacing noises in the South China Sea, now gunships in the Taiwan Strait.
</p><p><b>More clarity, less crusading</b>
<br>This choice of priorities has been unfortunate. Even more so, however, has been America's confusion between economics and politics, and its treatment of its biggest allies. Starting under George Bush, and continuing enthusiastically under Mr Clinton, America embarked on the idea that economics, not politics, should now take the lead in foreign affairs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is a mistake in principle, for governments are no better at selling exports or levering open foreign markets than they are at domestic industrial policy. But it is a disaster in practice, because it leads inevitably to confrontation with America's rich-world allies, which are its main exporting rivals and offer the juiciest markets. Squabbles with Europe over trade, and divisive competition with it over exports to China, have been regular bugbears. Even worse was America's eagerness to take Japan to the brink of a trade war over cars in June 1995. America is not the only guilty party in this regard. But it is the world's leader, and it needs to keep in mind the temptation that a divided alliance offers to rogue dictators such as Saddam as well as to budding powers such as China.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These strains have been worsened by America's distrust of multilateralism. True, it can have its drawbacks, notably the confusion of lines of command; unilateral action must remain an option. But America needs to get over its awkwardness in tactical alliances, its hit-or-miss communication with allies, and, in particular, its niggling attitude towards the United Nations. For all its failings, the <font size=-1>UN</font> is a useful resource, not least in long-term peacekeeping. America's rudeness towards it, and refusal to help pay for it, are foolish.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The business of prioritising has also been confused by the conviction that America should have a set of moral rules for foreign policy. Several presidents this century have tried to formulate a doctrine that laid down when America would intervene, in defence of which principles. To uphold human rights or democracy is an admirable aim, but desperately uneven in application. Lack of democracy does not inspire America to put pressure on Saudi Arabia, for example. As a guiding rule for foreign policy, it is more honest for America to admit (as James Baker, then secretary of state, did during the Gulf war, and as Mr Clinton did over Rwanda), that it intervenes when an essential resource such as oil is at risk, or when the threat to world stability cannot be ignored.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America's friends may feel that this is not good enough. But they should examine their own consciences. They frequently go crying to America over problems, such as Bosnia, in which it has no obvious interest. They are the first to complain if America does nothing. Yet if it intervenes, or adopts a policy of constant covert meddling, they may well complain even more. A little consistency in the world's attitude is overdue; a little more gratitude, when earned, might even encourage the American public.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All these improvements are devoutly to be wished as the next four years unfold. Would one candidate in the election ensure them more than the other? That is uncertain. Mr Clinton's grasp of foreign policy has improved markedly in the past two years; but his attention is still less focused than it might be, and his team is tired. Bob Dole has hinted that he might act more from principle, and his foreign-policy advisers have much to say about consistency and clarity. But he seems barely interested, and they are untried. Between the Clinton muddle and the Dole vacuum, the world may well go on asking whether America's foreign policy is a bird or a plane. And if that is an unfair question, the remedy is still largely--though not entirely--in America's hands.

<p><h2>Tribal splits</h2></p>
<p><p>The first <b>Bosnian elections</b>, intended to create national institutions in the aftermath of a 43-month civil war, passed off peacefully, with most voters favouring tribal parties. Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Muslim president, who favours a unified country, narrowly defeated Momcilo Krajisnik, a Serb separatist, for the chairmanship of a three-man presidency. Few Muslims dared to exercise their right to vote in their former homes, now ethnically cleansed by Bosnian Serbs.
<p>Umberto Bossi, leader of the separatist Northern League, proclaimed northern Italy an "independent and sovereign" republic called <b>Padania</b>. But fewer people than the League expected turned up to hear the announcement in Venice, after three days of secession rallies along the River Po.
<p>Russia's president, <b>Boris Yeltsin</b>, entered hospital in preparation for a heart operation. His stay is to be extended by several days, raising fears that he is sicker than the Kremlin admits.
<p>The European Union rejected a British proposal to scale back or eliminate a cull of up to 147,000 cattle thought to carry <font size=-1>BSE</font>, or <b>mad-cow disease</b>. Britain threatened to go ahead anyway, risking the collapse of an agreement designed to lead to the lifting of the <font size=-1>EU</font> ban on exports of British beef. Switzerland said it would kill one in eight of its herd to eradicate the disease.
<p>European governments tightened their belts to prepare for <b>economic and monetary union</b> in 1999. France announced a budget that it claims will cut its public-sector deficit to the Maastricht treaty target of 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> next year and its debt to 58%. Germany's parliament passed a series of cuts to social-welfare programmes.
<p>Eurostat, the <font size=-1>EU</font>'s statistical arm, said traditional <b>families</b> are in decline. Although 72% of men and women are married, the share is shrinking and 8% of children in 12 countries live with only one parent. Danes are the loneliest Europeans: 22% of them live alone; only 4% of Spaniards do so. Ireland has the biggest families, with half the population living in families of five or more.</p>
<p><h2>Korean conundrum</h2></p>
<p><p>A <b>North Korean submarine </b>ran aground in South Korean waters; 11 North Korean soldiers were later found shot dead on a mountain, in what the South Korean authorities said was a mass suicide. Another seven were found and killed by the South Koreans; others were thought still to be at large.
<p>The Japanese prime minister convened a special session of parliament for September 27th. This is widely expected to set the stage for a <b>snap election</b> in October.
<p>Indian police <b>arrested Sukh Ram</b>, a former communications minister, a month after police found over $1m in cash hidden in his house. Mr Ram was arrested on his return from abroad.
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>The Afghan rebel militia, the <b>Taliban</b>, captured the strategic city of Jalalabad. They now control two-thirds of the country.</p>
<p><h2>Iraqi lull</h2></p>
<p><p>To general relief, <b>Iraq and America</b> both drew back from full battle, though America's military build-up in the Gulf continued. Massoud Barzani who, with Iraqi help, had defeated his Kurdish rival in northern Iraq, hedged his bets by renewing his previously warm contacts with America.
<p>Syria gave Israel, on the eve of Yom Kippur, a<b> bad case of nerves</b> by redeploying some 12,000 of its troops in Lebanon. The completion of Lebanon's general election showed Syrian-backed politicians firmly in control.
<p>Israel's Likud government approved plans to build 1,800 <b>new housing units</b> in Matityahu, a West Bank settlement where about 2,400 ultra-orthodox Jews live. Talks with the Palestinians on Israeli troop redeployment in occupied Hebron got nowhere.
<p>At the end of a "national understanding conference", <b>Algeria's</b> President Liamine Zeroual said a general election would be held early next year. Several secular opposition parties boycotted the conference. The Islamic party, the <font size=-1>FIS</font>, was barred. The <font size=-1>FIS</font>'s armed wing further distanced itself from what it called "suspicious terrorist operations" by its rival, the <font size=-1>GIA</font>.
<p>Eugene de Kock, a former policeman in <b>South Africa</b> convicted of murder and pleading for leniency, said that two former presidents, F.W. de Klerk and P.W. Botha, knew of covert attacks on anti-apartheid activists.</p>
<p><h2>America in camera</h2></p>
<p><p>A civil action against <b>O.J. Simpson</b>, the football star acquitted last year of killing his ex-wife and her lover, opened in Santa Monica without television cameras. It also lacked a jury, as lawyers scrambled to find 12 people uninfluenced by the criminal trial.
<p><b>Guatemala's</b> government and rebel guerrillas reached an agreement on the future role of the armed forces that should open the way to a full peace deal soon. The 45,000-strong army, notoriously as brutal as the rebels in the 1970s and 1980s, will be cut by a third.
<p>In Colombia, a <b>kidnapped </b>Briton and a Dane were released after months--against payment of a ransom, complained Colombian officials. The kidnapping of a new-born baby aroused public outrage. A Dutch couple kidnapped in Costa Rica by former Contra guerrillas from Nicaragua were freed, also for ransom. In Mexico, Marxist guerrillas threatened to hit big business, method unspecified.
<p>The five-country Andean Pact said it expected to sign a preliminary deal on free trade with the <b>Mercosur</b> customs union by year-end. Venezuela and Peru hope for full deals with Mercosur by then.

<p><h2>Ciao, Caio</h2>
<p><p>Barely three months into the job and two weeks after Carlo De Benedetti resigned as chairman, <b>Olivetti</b>'s chief executive, Francesco Caio, quit in the wake of an investigation into alleged false corporate reporting at the high-technology group. Mr Caio's replacement is Roberto Colaninno, boss of Sogefi, a car-parts firm.
<p><b>Italian prosecutors </b>ordered a new round of arrests, beginning with one of the country's most prominent businessmen, Lorenzo Necci, who is head of Italy's state railway. Among others detained as part of the same investigation into corruption were the head of a state-owned arms company, two magistrates and a former politician.
<p>In a serious blow for Britain's Serious Fraud Office, a judge ruled out any further legal action against four former executives of the <b>Maxwell group</b> of companies, including Kevin Maxwell, son of its founder, the late Robert Maxwell. Mr Maxwell, who had been cleared of conspiring to defraud the group's pension funds in an earlier trial, had argued that the <font size=-1>SFO</font>'s decision to seek another one was "oppressive". The judge agreed.
<p>Grappling with a <b>Czech banking crisis</b>, authorities took control of Agrobanka, the country's fifth-largest bank and its largest privately owned one. Agrobanka's links with Kreditni, a bust bank, were beginning to cause liquidity problems.
<p>The European Commission was expected to open a formal inquiry into the price paid by <b>Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais</b> for a former subsidiary. The state-owned French bank, undergoing a massive restructuring and about to ask the government to assume yet more costs, pushed Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de Banque Occidentale into a state-owned holding company last year before buying it back in June.</p>
<p><h2>Beat that</h2></p>
<p><p><b>Ford</b> struck a three-year pay deal with its unions, setting a pace that General Motors, its bigger rival, might be forced to keep. America's number-two car maker promised to guarantee the survival of 95% of union jobs (now that it has slimmed down).
<p><b>Alcatel Alsthom</b> submitted a bid to buy <b>Thomson</b>, a defence group, from the French government, and said it would seek an Asian partner for the group's loss-making consumer-electronics business. The French government has received a rival bid from the <b>Lagard&egrave;re/Matra </b>group, another French conglomerate.
<p><b>Sony's Hollywood problems </b>returned with the ejection of Mark Canton from his job as chairman of Columbia TriStar Pictures and the refusal by Arnold Rifkin of the William Morris talent agency to take the job. Lucy Fisher, vice-chairman, didn't want the job either, but she is temporarily running the studios.
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>Scott Sassa quit as head of <b>Turner Broadcasting System's</b> entertainment division as the acquisition of <font size=-1>TBS</font> by <b>Time Warner</b>, newly equipped with federal approval, neared completion. Ted Turner, founder of <font size=-1>TBS</font>, takes on responsibility for the new group's cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> networks and will also become vice-chairman of Time Warner.
<p><b>Deutsche Telekom</b>, with a view to its partial privatisation in November, forecast a DM1.5 billion ($1 billion) dividend for 1996 despite a 96% plunge in first-half net profits from last year's DM3.5 billion to DM129m, caused mainly by the cost of redundancies. Telekom also said it was pulling out of a digital pay-<font size=-1>TV</font> consortium, intending to cash in on its cable-network monopoly. A prospective competitor, Vebacom, announced a deal with Ruhrgas to build a fibre-optic network alongside the country's gas pipelines.
<p>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>) <br> Forecasts for international <b>air travel </b>are being revised upwards by the airlines. The International Air Transport Association (<font size=-1>IATA</font>) now expects average annual growth of 7.1% in 1996-2000, up from earlier forecasts of 6.6%. Domestic traffic will grow by 6%. By 2000 the total number of airline passengers is expected to have risen to almost 1.7 billion from 1.3 billion last year.</p>
<p><h2>Peaks and troughs</h2></p>
<p><p>American, British and German <b>stockmarkets </b>reached record highs and in Japan two days of trading on the Nikkei brought gains of more than 4%. But America said that July had seen a trade deficit of $11.7 billion, the biggest for five years.
<p>(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>) <br> Mexico's remarkable return to health continued with the launch of a $1 billion global bond issue aimed at redeeming another chunk of existing high-interest <b>Brady bonds</b>. Mexico has raised more than $14 billion this year to pay off more expensive debt.
<p>As Switzerland's recession deepened--its <font size=-1>GDP</font> growth declined for the sixth quarter in a row--the country's third-largest bank, <b>Swiss Bank Corp</b> said that it would make a loss in 1996. It also plans a restructuring that will result in more central control, a loss of about a quarter of its branches and 1,700 jobs over the next three years.
<p>In the wake of "irregularities" discovered at some of its investments funds, <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Morgan Grenfell</b> sacked the funds' manager, Peter Young, for "gross misconduct" .
<p><p><b>Sumitomo Corporation</b> announced that its losses from apparently unauthorised copper trading by Yasuo Hamanaka were $2.6 billion, not the $1.8 billion it estimated in June. It has also decided to prosecute Mr Hamanaka.

<h1><center>Olivetti self-destructs</center></h1>
<p><b>The mayhem and the moral</b></p>


IT IS hard to believe, somehow, that Italy is the country that invented double-entry book-keeping, the basis of company accounts. For there is simply no good accounting word to capture the current state of affairs at Olivetti. On the face of it, Italy's biggest information-technology company--a firm as well-known in Europe as Apple is in America--seems simply to be imploding. At the start of this month it turfed out Carlo De Benedetti, its chairman for 18 years and the man who was once seen as the great white hope of Italian business. This week Francesco Caio, Olivetti's chief executive, resigned too. On September 17th alone the firm's share price fell by 10%, though it made a speculative rebound later in the week as Mr De Benedetti regained some influence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On one view, the turmoil at Olivetti represents a triumph for American-style shareholder activism in Europe. This, after all, is a company that has lost money every year since 1990. Unlike many Italian companies, however, it had increasingly turned to foreign investors in order to raise capital. This enabled its shareholders to insist on its Augean stables being cleansed. It was a meeting in London of foreign fund managers controlling a quarter of the company's equity that triggered the resignation of Mr De Benedetti. No such move would have been likely had Olivetti remained more typically Italian--that is, shielded from hostile scrutiny by a tangle of cross-shareholdings, family stakes and loans from friendly banks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, some will say that if this is a triumph of shareholder activism, who needs it? Certainly not the defenestrated managers. And arguably not the shareholders themselves. At first glance, the immediate result of their ousting of Mr De Benedetti has been self-impoverishment. Investors in the foreign funds that paid 1,000 lire (64 cents) a share for Olivetti's stock in a rights issue last December are unlikely to proclaim victory until the shares, which closed on September 18th at 511.5 lire, are showing a healthy profit.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whatever happens next at Olivetti, the moral that is drawn from the affair matters well beyond the Italian border. A growing number of continental European companies from Italy and elsewhere are queuing up to raise capital in both the London and New York stockmarkets. Some, such as Germany's Daimler Benz cars-to-aerospace giant, have already taken the plunge. But those who have yet to jump may well be deterred by the mayhem in Milan, lest they suffer the same fate as Olivetti.
</p><p><b>The two missing ingredients</b></b>
<br>It would be a pity if they were deterred. Many European firms do indeed have much to gain by making greater use of international equity markets. These can provide cheaper sources of capital than bank lending, together with the extra scrutiny that keeps managers on their toes. But for stockmarkets to work their magic, two conditions are essential. First, investors must be confident that firms are providing them with accurate and timely information. Second, a stockmarket needs to be properly regulated. Neither condition seems to have been met in this particular case.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On September 16th Italian magistrates announced that they were questioning Mr Caio about whether Olivetti had issued misleading financial statements about its affairs. Mr De Benedetti has also been questioned. This does not prove that there is anything the least bit wrong with the company's accounts, and Olivetti has vehemently defended them. But it is this uncertainty--not the departure of Mr De Benedetti--that sparked the wild selling of Olivetti's shares this week. In these circumstances, Consob, Italy's stockmarket regulator, should have formally suspended trading in the company's shares until it became clear that the accounts were correct and consistent. It should not have allowed trading in the firm's shares to continue as panic spread. That is no way to run a stock exchange.

<h1>On the road</h1>


<font size=1>CINCINNATI, HARTFORD AND WILMINGTON</font><p>

IT WAS drizzling in Cincinnati last Monday, so Bill Clinton's campaign event could not take place outdoors, but had to move across the street to the old Music Hall building. This, it so happens, was the site of the 1880 Democratic convention, which nominated Winfield Hancock, a Civil War hero but a lousy campaigner. Hancock went on to lose to the handsome if scandal-tainted James Garfield, who just loved meeting voters. "The World Almanac of Presidential Campaigns" refers to the 1880 election as "one of the most boring and inconsequential of all time." In 1996, a day with each of the major candidates suggests strong similarities, albeit with parties reversed, with 1880.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Clinton campaign oozes energy and seems to do everything right. The stop in Cincinnati was part of a tireless week of campaigning covering places as far afield as North Carolina, Iowa and Arizona. Ohio, with its 21 electoral-college votes, is a key state--no Republican has ever won without carrying Ohio--and was the one most often visited by both sides in 1992. This year is no exception. In Cincinnati, presidential politics is as finely balanced as views on whether the city's famous chili is best "three ways" (without onions) or "five ways" (with beans and onions): Cincinnati's vote went both ways in 1992, with 43% for Mr Clinton and 43% for George Bush.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So Mr Clinton was in the right place, and at the right time. On the day his opponent was setting out his policies on crime, the president was standing before rows of police officers to accept the cherished endorsement of the 270,000-member Fraternal Order of Police. It was the first time the <font size=-1>FOP</font> had endorsed a Democrat for national office.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Partly by dint of being president, wherever Mr Clinton goes it is a Big Event. In Cincinnati, the crowds were large, the surrounding security operation was imposing, the vendors of badges and other campaign memorabilia were out in force. There was "Hail to the Chief" to greet Mr Clinton's arrival at the Music Hall, plus an enthusiastic chant orchestrated by the local state representative. "Where's the president?" he asked three times. "Whoop, there he is!", the crowd roared thrice in response.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's the most unusual welcome I've ever had," Mr Clinton told his audience, "but I like it." Indeed, he likes everything about campaigning. He relishes the stump speeches, despite the hoarseness of voice they are causing. More than anything, he loves the adulation he gets when he plunges into a crowd. In the Music Hall, with a glowing, ruddy-faced smile, he lingered among his supporters, reluctant to leave, pausing for photographs, stretching out his hands to people desperate for a touch of the visiting superstar.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The contrast with the Dole campaign could hardly be greater. Bob Dole has been concentrating on Small Events, informal "Listening to America" sessions with sympathetic hand-picked audiences. Quizzical faces stare at the motorcade from the airports to the venues, where there often seem to be more Clinton/Gore demonstrators than Dole/Kemp supporters. Whereas with Mr Clinton you notice the prowess of the campaigning, with Mr Dole you puzzle over the point of it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why, for example, did Mr Dole spend precious time on September 18th "Listening to America" in Hartford, Connecticut, where a poll published that day showed him 26 points behind Mr Clinton? (Mr Dole was "listening" to a few women entrepreneurs, invited by the state Republican Party and outnumbered by the media squeezed into a meeting room on the 22nd floor of the Hartford Group insurance company.) And why did he then proceed to "Listen to America" in Wilmington, Delaware, a bellwether state but one with a grand total of three electoral-college votes? "Dole and Delaware. The Road to Victory Begins Here", proclaimed the banner in the hall of the Catholic girls' school.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The moderator of the Wilmington session was Steve Forbes, winner of the Delaware primary. Judging by the way he took charge of the question-and-answer session, he still rather fancies himself as the Republican candidate. He himself answered the questions from the invited panelists. As the proceedings dragged on, with Mr Dole shuffling in his seat, Mr Forbes began yet another reply by saying, "Bob will be responding later." Mr Dole looked at his watch and mumbled, "Not much later." When, at long last, Mr Forbes introduced Mr Dole, he praised him as "a man of few words".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Dole gave a 35-minute monologue, without notes. He brandished a nickel--the amount he says would have to be saved out of every dollar of cuttable spending under his economic plan--to illustrate how easy it would be to cut taxes and balance the budget as he proposes. He presented the election as a choice between "trust" (in him) and "fear" (being spread by the Clinton campaign). It was a competent performance, but not one destined to resonate far beyond the Delaware media market.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The journalists who follow Mr Dole aboard his "Citizen's Ship" despair of the scarcity of real news generated by his campaign. Just a tiny nugget a day would keep them happy. The candidate, fearful of the off-the-cuff gaffes which caused him problems earlier in the year, now rarely wanders back to the press section of the aircraft. At least one daily newspaper is thinking of taking a break because it is "so dull". The greatest excitement during a Dole day comes from the bumps that invariably seem to happen in mid-air: if there is a bad-weather front lurking somewhere in the country, that is where the "Citizen's Ship" is likely to be.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And yet a day with the two candidates also leaves a nagging feeling that, despite all the outward appearances, Mr Clinton is not quite as strong as he seems, and Mr Dole not quite as weak. Mr Dole plays a good underdog, emphasising the point that he has been prematurely given up for dead before by showing a letter to his father from the hospital where he lay wounded in December 1945: "At the present time it would appear that his recovery is somewhat questionable," the letter said.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There may be no wild excitement at Dole events, but there is a palpable sense of respect. Boring as it is for reporters, Mr Dole is sticking relentlessly to his message, and the conversation of the campaign is turning to issues--crime, the economy, foreign policy--that work well for him. A few other things have also started to go right. Ross Perot will not be in the televised presidential debates. Some national polls show the race tightening.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ohio, where he is about nine points behind, is still very much in play. In Cincinnati, not all the police officers assembled behind the president were in fact Clinton supporters. Outside the Music Hall, which sits in a run-down part of town, protesters from the local homeless centre predicted that the welfare bill Mr Clinton signed would result in more people living in cardboard boxes in the neighbourhood. Peter Ritchy from the Homeless Hotline of Greater Cincinnati handed out leaflets complaining that Mr Clinton listened to his rich Hollywood backers while ignoring the poor. "The Democrats have gotten complacent that all the poor people are going to vote for them," said Mr Ritchy, who would like to vote for Ralph Nader himself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is still possible that this election could resemble that of 1880 in another respect besides tedium and the character of the candidates. It was one of the closest ever.

<h1>Trends of the week</h1>


<p><b>Faith: </b>Pat Robertson tells his flock at a Christian Coalition conference that, given the gap between Bob Dole and Bill Clinton in the polls: "There has to be a miracle from Almighty God to pull it out. And that could happen."
<p><b>Miracle: </b>The gap halves, to only eight points, says an <font size=-1>ABC</font> poll of likely voters.
<p><b>Lone star: </b>A new poll gives Mr Dole an 11-point lead in Texas. In August, polls showing the candidates neck-and-neck there brought talk of a Democratic landslide.
<p><b>Song: </b>Anything but "Dole Man", an adaptation of the 1967 song "Soul Man", which was the Dole campaign's anthem until a lawsuit by one of the song's owners silenced the fun. Time to turn now to rock 'n' Dole, or beBob?
<p><b>Omen: </b>Miss Kansas wins the Miss America beauty pageant.
<p><b>Book: </b>"Trusting the People", by Bob Dole and Jack Kemp (HarperCollins, $15). Mr Dole's plug for the 164-page <i>chef d'oeuvre</i>: "Doesn't take long to read."
<p><b>Good news: </b>The White House reveals that Mr Clinton tested negative for <font size=-1>HIV</font> in 1990 (in a routine test for an insurance policy). The bad news: Republicans, suspecting the president is hiding something, still press for release of his full medical records.
<p><b>Lollywood:</b> Even before last week's glitzy presidential fund-raiser starring Barbra Streisand, federal election reports show that residents of the 90210 zip code, covering Beverly Hills, had given five times as much money to Mr Clinton as to Mr Dole.
<p><b>Ladbroke's odds:</b> Clinton 1-7 (as last week); Dole 9-2 (last week, 4-1).
<p><b>Word-association: </b>The word voters most commonly associate with Vice-President Al Gore is "intelligent", according to a Pew survey. For Jack Kemp, Republican would-be vice-president, it is "football".
<p><b>Bumper-sticker:</b> Spotted in Louisville, Kentucky: "Cut Waste and Taxes. Re-Elect No One!"
<p><b>Free</b> <b>air: </b>Rupert Murdoch's Fox television network begins broadcasting ten free, one-minute spots by each candidate. The Dole campaign objected, however, that Mr Clinton would have an unfair advantage answering the set questions from the pomp of the Oval Office. Compromise: he sits at his Oval Office desk, but with curtains behind him and not a presidential seal in sight.
<p><b>Hot air: </b>According to a study by the Centre for Media and Public Affairs, candidate soundbites at the party conventions averaged 10.4 seconds in length, led by 15 seconds for loquacious Mr Kemp, 11 for Mr Gore, 10 for Mr Clinton and eight for plain-spoken Bob Dole.
<p><b>Fresh air: </b>A non-partisan commission recommended that the televised presidential debates should feature only Messrs Clinton and Dole. Ross Perot is excluded on the ground that he has no serious chance of winning the election.

<h1>The world in his armpit</h1>


<p>AMERICA adores telegenic leaders, so it is tempting to dismiss a bald guy with glasses. America reveres the treadmill and the weights room, so it is tempting to dismiss someone who looks physically frail. America has made a fetish of the sound-bite, so it is tempting to dismiss a speaker who, in praising a colleague at the recent Christian Coalition conference, could think of nothing better to say than, "What a great future he has, because he is right here and he is right here."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tempting, but disastrous: Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate's foreign relations committee, is not a man to be dismissed. For he brings one quality to international affairs that has proved invaluable. "Jesse hates foreigners," says someone who has spent years working with him; then, feeling the need to be fair, he adds, "except for Israelis, maybe." To this one could add that Mr Helms mistrusts most treaties, and the whole apparatus of international relations. He has likened development aid to throwing money "down foreign ratholes". In the latest issue of <i>Foreign Affairs</i>, he says that the United Nations threatens American interests, and that it should be cut by half or dismantled.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Just recently, Mr Helms scored an arresting victory. A 25-year-old Helms staffer who reads <i>Jane's Defence Weekly </i>at bedtime fought a campaign to block America's ratification of the chemical-weapons ban. This was an ambitious venture, for no senator has ever mustered the 34 votes needed to vote down ratification of an arms-control deal before. First Trent Lott, the Republican leader in the Senate, lined up behind the Helms argument. Then Bob Dole put his weight behind it, and the pro-ratification forces had to withdraw the treaty from the Senate lest it be voted down.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It does not take brilliance to win support for an idea that clearly protects American interests. Mr Helms triumphs even without such an advantage: blocking the chemical-weapons treaty may on balance hurt America's interests, rather than the other way round. The treaty probably has enough support in other countries to go ahead anyway; and, if America stays out of it, its chemical companies will remain barred from lucrative export markets. Besides, the treaty will subject some would-be chemical-weapons-makers to inspections, however imperfect. For this reason it deserves America's support.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Helms has won several other anti-victories recently. In the first years of the Clinton administration, there were signs that America's embargo on Cuba might at last be lifted. This was encouraging: exposed to foreign trade and influence, Cuba's nasty dictatorship might well be undermined. Mr Helms, meanwhile, drafted a law entrenching the embargo, and threatening sanctions on third countries that break it. By a fluke, he got Mr Clinton to accept it: in February the Cubans shot down two American civilian aircraft, and the easiest way for the president to respond toughly was to sign the bill. Six months on, Cuba's regime shows no signs of falling. But the third-country clause has scummed up America's relations with its allies, which fail to see why their Cuba policy should be run by Mr Helms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Colombia is another place that Mr Helms has put his stamp on. Last year he backed a law to "decertify" Colombia as punishment for its puny zeal in fighting the drugs war, a move that would deprive it of aid. Up to a point, this was understandable: Colombia's President Samper had been accused of taking drug money for his election campaign. But these accusations were not proven; and, true or not, once in office Mr Samper fought the drug barons mightily. In 1995 his government lost nearly 600 police and security-force men in its drugs war. It also smashed the Cali cocaine mob. America cannot claim to have done as much within its own borders. Never mind: in March Colombia was decertified. Left unaided, the country has since descended even further into mayhem.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What to make of Mr Helms's influence? It reflects poorly on Mr Dole, who as Senate leader could have blocked Mr Helms's ascent to the chair of the foreign relations committee at the start of 1995. Mr Helms's intemperate views were no secret then; indeed, the senator had recently furnished fresh proof of them, by suggesting that the president's life might be endangered if he and his liberal views ventured into North Carolina, Mr Helms's state. Mr Dole might have encouraged Richard Lugar to seek the chairmanship, especially since Mr Lugar had spent as many years on the foreign relations committee as Mr Helms had, and even chaired it in 1985-86. But Mr Dole bowed to the underwhelming fact that Mr Helms had been in the Senate two years longer, explaining: "If you're going to start knocking down seniority, then it's a whole, you know..." . Such is the leadership and courage of the man nominated by Republicans for the highest office in the land.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Mr Helms's successes also say something about America, and about foreign policy in many democracies these days. He has been elected, after all, to four terms in the Senate, and polls suggest that this November he will secure another six years. His criticism of the United Nations, though shot through with half-truths, is no more rabid than the <font size=-1>UN</font>-bashing to be heard last month at the Republican convention. His attack on foreign treaties and entanglements appeals to American voters--just as it would do, for that matter, to German or British voters fearful of European Union. When Mr Helms denounces the transfer of power to international bodies remote from sovereign individuals, he voices a concern heard all over the rich world. He becomes an internationalist, despite himself.

<h1>The flourishing business of slavery</h1>

<p>THE trade in child sex has topped the indignation charts in the West this year. But much of it is only the nastiest aspect of a wider evil: slavery. Every country in the world has outlawed this practice, in theory. In fact, millions of people, women and children especially, are still used as slaves.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Child slavery has increased since the 1970s--in part, ironically, because that was when the shah of Iran banned the use of child labour in carpet factories. Many manufacturers promptly moved to Pakistan, Nepal and India, which had fewer qualms. Not only could they hire child labour dirt cheap, they found they could do even better by tapping into traditional systems of "debt bondage".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bonded workers agree to sell their labour in exchange for a lump sum, perhaps to pay a big medical bill. Such deals are common in countries where the poor's only equity is their sweat. But the line is easily crossed into slavery, when low wages, high interest rates and cheating make the debt impossible to repay. South Asia, where many people are illiterate, ignorant of their rights, and thus easily diddled, is the home of this system. The India-based Bonded Labour Liberation Front reckons that, from a small start in the late 1970s, there are now half a million South Asian children thus bonded (sometimes literally, by chains) to their carpet-weaving looms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Nepal and Pakistan, millions of bonded labourers work in farming. Here the relationship to slavery is clearest. Bonded debts can be passed on to the next generation. Those who are deemed not to have paid their debt can be sold to another landlord. If a man escapes his place of employment, his family can be held until he comes back, or sold if he does not. Bonded peasants can be sold into marriage.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bondage-cum-slavery is also common in the brick kilns and mines of South Asia, in some remote areas of Peru and Brazil (with forced prostitution to match), in the servants' quarters and camel racegrounds of the Gulf (Bangladeshi child riders are a speciality), and in the brothels of South-East Asia. In the worst cases, workers are kidnapped, forced to work, assigned a debt, and prevented from escaping by armed guards with shoot-to-kill orders. A Brazilian researcher has estimated there are 60,000 slaves in his country, mostly in the vast Amazon region.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The emergence of <font size=-1>AIDS</font> has played a large role in entrapping more and more women and children in sexual slavery. Brothel customers, aware of the risks of infection, want young girls from the countryside, who are presumed less likely to have <font size=-1>HIV</font>. And they want brisk turnover. Both desires have led to an increase in the trafficking of Burmese girls and women into Thailand, and of Nepali girls into India; the Nepalis are also highly prized for their fair skin and delicate features.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thai human-rights organisations reckon there are 20,000 Burmese prostitutes in Thailand at any one time. Some have been kidnapped and literally sold into sexual slavery; a few have left home knowing they will be working as prostitutes. Most are brought under false pretences. The women are routinely forbidden to communicate with their families or even leave the premises.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nepali prostitutes in India--there are roughly 20,000 in Mumbai (Bombay) alone--have it even worse. The typical pattern is to kidnap or coax a girl away from home with the promise of well-paid work or marriage--some traffickers even go through a marriage ceremony--acculturate her to her work through rape and the lowest kind of prostitution, then sell her on to another brothel or abandon her when she is too old or becomes <font size=-1>HIV</font>-infected. Border police put the average age of trafficked girls at 13, but do little to stop the trade.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Slavery in Sudan is also a young and female phenomenon: when armed raiders from the Arab north swoop down on blacks in the south, they take mostly women and children back with them. Girls become concubines, older women become house-servants and younger children tend animals. Some are sold, perhaps even exported: the American embassy in Khartoum has acknowledged as "credible" reports that Dinka and Nuba children from southern Sudan are being sold on into Libya. The men are either killed or left behind to get together a ransom to reclaim their women and children--if they can find them. According to the London-based Christian Solidarity International, which has ransomed 20 Sudanese slaves, the going rate for a woman is five cows.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Sudanese government flatly denies that slavery exists there. It is lying: the evidence from human-rights organisations, exiles, traders and former slaves is overwhelming. Louis Farrakhan, the black leader of America's Nation of Islam, and occasional guest of the Libyan and Sudanese governments, has rebuffed assertions of slavery in Sudan as Zionist claptrap. Last March, he challenged journalists to go to Sudan and find it. Two reporters from the <i>Baltimore Sun</i> did just that and published their findings in June, sparking off a lively debate among black Americans about how they--and black Muslims in particular--should respond to the plight of enslaved black Africans.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Slavery is as rooted as ever in Mauritania, whose government also denies that it exists. As the government notes, the country has officially abolished slavery three times, most recently in 1980. Yet perhaps 90,000 blacks live as full-time slaves to their Arab masters. Several times that number are only semi-free. Most live in remote rural areas in the east. They have no right to property or marriage; parents have no rights over their children.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although these are the chief redoubts of modern slavery, the rest of the world is not immune. "Released" prisoners who are forced to continue working in Chinese labour camps could plausibly be called slaves. So could the several dozen Thai workers who were found locked into their clothing factory in Los Angeles last year. There are reports of women from South Korea, Taiwan and the United States being tricked into forced prostitution in Japan.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where slavery is systemic and involves the actual buying and selling of human beings, it exists in part because governments are not trying very hard to stop it. Brazil has spoken out strongly against the use of forced labour, but the Amazon region is huge and few policemen and labour inspectors have been assigned to root out abuses. Thailand, Myanmar, India, Pakistan and Nepal all have impressive-sounding laws against slavery, kidnapping and child prostitution, but do little to enforce them. Too often, the police are buddies with the local oligarchs, or esteemed clients at the brothels that they ought to be busting.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rich world has little leverage to exert against slavery, though there are sporadic efforts. One such comes from Rugmark, an organisation that gives a seal of approval to carpets made without child labour. Another is an agreement by two western sporting-goods makers in Pakistan to send their child workers to school. But such responses can go only so far: most bonded labourers and outright slaves work for industries serving the home market that are immune to outside pressure. And the bosses, who live well off their cheap labour, are much closer to the powers that be than are their wretched workers. Until the penalties for slavery begin to outweigh its rewards, it will not disappear.

<h1>Master and slave in Mauritania</h1>

<font size=1>NOUAKCHOTT</font>
<p>SHE said she was a slave. Mohamed Ould Moissa said Aichana Mint Abeid Boilil was his wife.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Aichana took Mohamed to court to recover her five children. He claimed to be their father and wanted custody. She said she had never had sex with him, let alone been married to him; she called his claim a pretext to keep her children as slaves. The court sided with her, and the family was reunited, except for one daughter, "given" by Mohamed to one of his relations.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Slavery was outlawed in Mauritania (see <a href="ir1.gif">map</a>) in 1980, but that did not eradicate the centuries-old practice. In the past, Moorish camel caravans used to sweep down on villages in the south, carrying off everyone the men could lay hands on. The enslaved had to tend their masters' herds, perform domestic chores and work the family's land. Disobedience or any attempt to escape was brutally punished. The women were the sex slaves of their owner, and their offspring generally grew up to be his slaves.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Freed slaves or the descendants of slaves are known as <i>haratin</i>; they make up about 40% of Mauritania's 2m people. Some argue that many are still in bondage. "Nothing has been done to alter the situation that forced the government to ban slavery 16 years ago," says Boubacar Ould Messoud, president of <font size=-1>SOS</font> Esclave, an organisation set up to help slaves. "There are still slaves sweating to feed their masters." Certainly there are many thousands of people who work without being paid in cash.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Slavery is reinforced by race. Traditionally the lighter-skinned Bidan from the north enslaved the "black African" farmers from the south. But skin colour is no exact guide to status. Some Bidan are dark-skinned, and some black groups, especially the Sonink&eacute; and Hal-Pulaar (Fulani), also practise slavery, though less conspicuously.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Eight years after slavery was supposedly abolished, Fatma Mint Souleymane ran away from her master's constant beatings. Only when she reached Nouakchott did she learn that she did not belong to somebody else. "I was always working. I had no way of hearing the radio or time to chat with other slaves. How could I hear about the new law?" she asks. Others have heard about abolition, but know no other life than slavery. They accept their condition as "God's will" or simply do not believe they could be free.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pointing out that most political and economic power is in the hands of the "masters", the Bidan, Boubacar Ould Messoud accuses the government of not really trying to eliminate slavery, but merely making noises, to appease western aid donors. He calls for a nationwide awareness campaign to inform everyone that they are free and to change attitudes among both "slaves" and "masters". It must be couched in religious terms, he says, breaking the centuries-old indoctrination of slaves, who were told they would go to heaven if they were obedient, and to hell if not.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government prefers to look the other way. "Slavery has been banned, so I can say that, legally, it no longer exists," avows Mohamed Lamine Ould Ahmed, minister for energy and one of few <i>haratin</i> to have got that high. "There are people who've stayed with their former masters. Having been freed, they've chosen to stay in the environment where they grew up, with people of the same tribe--their friends and relations."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This may be partly true. What ex-slaves have gained in freedom, they may have lost in security. Traditionally, they were considered part of the family. Although abuses occurred, owners were responsible for their welfare and provided food, clothes, protection and medical care. Can freedom deliver these? Former slaves are more likely to end up, homeless and jobless, in the slums among the sand dunes around Nouakchott.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the Bidan too are suffering these days. The severe droughts of the 1970s and 1980s ravaged their herds, and many fled with their slaves to Nouakchott. Once in town the slaves, released because their masters could not afford to keep them, and used to manual labour, often did better than their ex-masters, who knew little more than how to ride camels. Often one hears of an impoverished "master" claiming the legacy of his deceased slave--a wooden shack or tent, and maybe a few scrawny animals. Some still accept the argument that if a man owned the slave, he owned the slave's property too.

<p><b>Iraq and America</b></p>
<h1>Saner voices</h1>

<p>AFTER two weeks of belligerence, peace of a sort descended on the Gulf. On September 13th Iraq dropped its earlier defiance, announcing that it was "suspending" missile attacks on American, British and French aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones, from which Iraqi aircraft are barred. Nor, it said later, would it rebuild its missile-smashed air defences in the south. Reports from Washington suggested this would not be enough: the United States also wanted Iraq to dismantle all its air defences. But by this time William Perry, President Clinton's defence secretary, touring the Gulf states, had had a full blast of the coolness with which his country's allies regarded the prospect of further strikes. The American build-up went swiftly on, but fire-eating evaporated into an unthreatening rumble. America, insisted Mr Clinton, was not seeking a confrontation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A week ago Mr Perry was promising a "disproportionate" response to Iraq's unsuccessful missile attacks. Then Saudi Arabia, the weightiest American ally in the region but under threat from internal dissent, made it politely plain that it did not agree. The claim that the American attacks on southern Iraq were for the protection of the Gulf's oil producers did not sway Prince Sultan, the Saudi defence minister: "I've not heard a threat from Iraq to Kuwait," he was reported as replying.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Understandably, Kuwait itself has been the United States' most enthusiastic supporter, allowing its territory to be used as a potential launch-pad for Stealth bombers. But, even there, the Americans took too much for granted, announcing that up to 5,000 ground troops were on their way to the sheikhdom, without getting Kuwaiti agreement. It came in the end, but the Kuwaitis gave Mr Perry a hard time before accepting that the troops--probably 3,500, from Texas--could indeed come.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Off flew Mr Perry to London, to meet his British and French counterparts. The British were publicly supportive, but privately relieved that the threat of battle had receded. Charles Millon, France's defence minister, chose to distance his country from American tactics: as soon as he got back to Paris, he issued a public warning against any escalation. To rub it in, on September 18th, after talks with President Jacques Chirac, the Saudi foreign minister declared that the two countries wanted to see "reason prevail, calm restored and the integrity of Iraq respected."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Calm, indeed, seemed to be restored--for the time being. But the Kurdish manoeuvres, which started the whole affair, are not necessarily evolving in a way to please Saddam Hussein. Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, having with Iraq's physical (and psychological) help defeated his rival, Jalal Talabani, is now intent on showing that he is not Mr Hussein's poodle. The time is not ripe, he says, for a new arrangement with Baghdad over some form of federation. And though Iraqi trade is welcomed over the now open border, Iraqis themselves are not.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Wisely hedging his bets, Mr Barzani wants to resume the good relations he once had with the Americans. They are no less anxious to detach him from Mr Hussein. Hence the meeting at midweek in Turkey between Mr Barzani and Robert Pelletreau, the State Department's Middle East man.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Americans, ostensibly, are continuing their efforts to mediate between the two Kurdish rivals. In practice, the whole status of northern Iraq has to be decided. Is it still to be deemed a "protected" zone? Are the American-led allies to go on providing their aerial umbrella? Can the aid effort be resumed, now that 2,000 Kurds, working in one capacity or another for the Americans, have been whisked off to Guam, in the Pacific, for safety and debriefing? In searching for answers, the Americans have first to explore Mr Barzani's intentions.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a>

<p><b>Rail privatisation</b></p>
<h1>Trainspotting</h1>


<p>DESPITE opposition predictions that it would be "a poll tax on wheels", Britain's newly privatised rail network seems about to deliver significant improvements for its passengers. Roger Salmon, the rail franchising director, will invite bids next month for a new high-speed route to be operated by 160mph Italian-designed tilting trains on the west-coast main line. The journey time from London to Manchester will be cut by 25%, to less than two hours. A bullish message of increased investment and improving performance will also be given by Bob Horton, the chairman of Railtrack, at the newly privatised company's first annual meeting on September 25th.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;True, little on the railways has changed just yet. Decades of under-investment have bequeathed a legacy of too much bumpy track and antiquated rolling stock. Punctuality and reliability remain as patchy as ever. Finding out when trains run and reserving seats is still often absurdly difficult. Media comment is invariably bilious. Passenger complaints are at record levels, rising by 14.5% in the year to the end of March, the 13th consecutive year in which complaints have increased (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>). The sour public mood is unlikely to be sweetened by a series of one-day strikes called by the <font size=-1>RMT</font> transport union beginning on September 20th and 23rd, which threatens to cause widespread disruption across the country.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, those who said that splitting the nationalised British Rail (<font size=-1>BR</font>) into 60 separate private companies would prove a political disaster have fallen silent. Labour is busy backtracking on its commitment to restore "a publicly owned, publicly accountable railway". It is easy to see why. The announcement on September 17th that two more passenger services in the west of England have been successfully franchised means that more than half the network is now operated by private firms. Contrary to many forecasts (including by <i>The Economist</i>), competition for the passenger franchises has been so intense that subsidies required to maintain the privatised services are significantly less than they were under <font size=-1>BR</font>. Sir George Young, the transport secretary, claims that annual government grants to support the first seven franchises will, by 2003, be a third of the amount needed by <font size=-1>BR</font> to run them in its last year of operation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although the private train operators have been in business for only a few months, their determination to improve service and attract more passengers is already beginning to show results. Later this month, Great Western, which operates services throughout the West Country, will unveil the first of its newly liveried and refurbished trains. The company has already reduced journey times on its long-distance routes by up to 20 minutes and is planning to introduce new motorail services. Great Western's passenger traffic is up by nearly 7% since privatisation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other operators are also trying to lure passengers back to the railways with better service. Chiltern Railways, a firm run by former <font size=-1>BR</font> managers, announced earlier this month that it had ordered 12 diesel-powered 100mph express trains to reduce its journey times between London and Birmingham by a third, in order to compete with InterCity services. Sea Containers, a freight company which took over the east-coast main line six months ago, is also planning to order two Italian or Swedish high-speed tilting trains to reduce the journey time between Edinburgh and London from 4.75 to 3.75 hours.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Train companies operating less glamorous routes are also keen to boast of their improvements. Prism Rail, which operates the so-called "misery commuter line" from Fenchurch Street in London to Tilbury and Southend, is spending &#163;14m on modernising stations. The company, run by former bus executives, has promised to replace two-thirds of its existing 40-year-old rolling stock with new trains by 1999.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until the new investment in track, stations and rolling stock comes onstream, passengers will understandably be sceptical about privatisation. So far improvements have been largely cosmetic. Midland Main Line, which operates services between London and Sheffield, offers all passengers free tea and coffee, for example. Great Western has introduced a business carriage where complimentary newspapers can supposedly be read in peace: mobile phones and tape players are discouraged. South West Trains, operated by Stagecoach, an aggressive bus company, maintains a spare train at Waterloo for peak-time emergencies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A lively price war is a more potent sign of the benefits of the new regime. Chiltern is promoting a &#163;20 day-return fare between London and Birmingham. This undercuts the peak fare on InterCity West Coast's line (which is 40 minutes faster) by &#163;35. Ferocious competition marked by knocking copy is also taking place over the London to Gatwick services operated by Gatwick Express and Network South Central. Both the west-coast and east-coast InterCity companies are fighting a price war with EasyJet, a budget airline, which offers a &#163;29 single fare on the London-Glasgow and London-Edinburgh routes. The rail companies responded with an identical fare and complained to the Advertising Standards Authority that EasyJet failed to tell passengers about the &#163;5 in airport tax.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The train operating companies have been slower to respond to long-standing complaints about the inadequacy of train-inquiry bureaus. A national system with a single phone number is under development, but industry sources acknowledge that the speed, quality and accuracy of information provided is still "a very thorny problem". The performance regime under which Railtrack and the train operators are penalised for late-running also causes problems for delayed passengers catching connecting trains. Companies are less and less willing to hold trains, for fear of financial penalties.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such transitional problems should soon be resolved. Better management aside, the fact that the new privatised railway has been given guaranteed levels of subsidy, a stable fare structure and the freedom to invest long term unhindered by the vagaries of the government's annual expenditure round should deliver better services eventually. Unfortunately for the Tories, they may not be in power to get the credit. Politics is so unfair.

<p><b>Universities</b></p>
<h1>Pay as you earn</h1>

<p>THE era in which the taxpayer footed most of the bill for sending a large proportion of Britain's 18-year-olds away to university, which began in the mid-1960s following the Robbins Report, may be drawing to a close. On September 19th the vice-chancellors of Britain's 115 universities proposed a scheme in which graduates would have to repay about a third of the cost of degree courses.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Opponents of such a scheme say that it would deter students from poorer families--undermining the Robbins principle that university education should be open to anyone who would benefit from it. And none of the main political parties is keen to alarm middle-income voters with the prospect of hefty tuition bills for their children. Nevertheless, the imposition of university fees over the next few years now seems likelier than ever.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The universities have become exasperated with the government's relentless cuts in the funding it provides for each student. They have reached the conclusion that there is no chance of getting more money from whichever party forms the next government, so the students will have to pay. The universities will submit their proposals to Sir Ron Dearing's inquiry into the future of higher education, which will report after the next election.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour and the Liberal Democrats accept the need to make students borrow to cover their living expenses, but say they should not pay tuition fees. Gillian Shephard, the education and employment secretary, appeared to adopt a similar line on September 18th, saying she expected the government to continue paying all tuition costs. However, whatever the parties' education spokesmen say now, if the Dearing inquiry calls for students to contribute to tuition costs the proposal is likely to get strong backing from the Treasury. The choice will then probably be between fees and no further expansion--or even a contraction--in university education.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The scheme the vice-chancellors propose is based on one that has been in operation in Australia since 1989. In the British version, for each year of study, students would borrow &#163;2,400 (at today's prices) to pay a fixed fee, plus &#163;4,475 for their living expenses. Once they have graduated, they would pay a surcharge of 3% of gross salary on their national insurance contributions until the debt is cleared. Now, full-time students aged under 21 make no contribution to tuition costs, and typically get a grant of &#163;1,586 a year and a loan of about &#163;1,600.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The prospect of accumulating up to &#163;20,000 in debt (plus interest at around the prevailing bank base rate) during a three-year course may indeed sound daunting to many potential students. But it would be fairer to taxpayers--and not as daunting for students as many critics assume. Once they graduate, students would pay only in proportion to what they earn, and over a term as long as would be required to clear the debt. Those on low incomes would be exempted from repayments. There would be no prospect of bailiffs knocking at the door. And, of course, getting a degree greatly increases the chances of landing a well-paid job, so even after paying the 3% levy most graduates should still be better off.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While the vice-chancellors' scheme is sensible, many academics fear that the government will use graduates' contributions as an excuse to make further cuts in its grants to universities. They point to Australia's new conservative government, which is both cutting universities' grants and increasing graduates' repayments. That is a possibility here. But surely the alternative--universities bursting at the seams, aspiring students turned away, and the quality of higher education declining because taxpayers simply do not want to pay any more--is worse.

<h1>Profit taking</h1>

<p>WITH only two months to go until the budget, anyone lucky enough to benefit from a tax break is starting to get nervous. Easily the most worried this year should be anyone who receives government-approved profit-related pay (<font size=-1>PRP</font>). The Treasury has spotted that the tax perk granted to <font size=-1>PRP</font> schemes is costing it a fortune (see <a href="br2.gif">chart</a>), and that an increasing number of such schemes are nothing more than tax-avoidance ploys. Thus, <font size=-1>PRP</font> is ripe for deperking.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Profit-related pay was given favourable tax treatment in the 1987 budget as a temporary measure intended to encourage firms to tie their employees' salaries more closely to company profits. This was supposed to help wages to fall during bad times and to encourage more entrepreneurialism among ordinary workers. High hopes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At first, the number of <font size=-1>PRP</font> schemes grew at a snail's pace: by 1991-92, they cost the exchequer only &#163;40m. But then firms, egged on by their accountants, found clever ways of using <font size=-1>PRP</font> without linking employees' pay any more closely to changes in their employer's profits. (Employees rarely want pay that is genuinely linked to their firm's profits--which is less certain than basic pay--unless it is on top of what they already get.) The cost of tax-rebates soared, to an estimated &#163;1.5 billion this financial year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>PRP</font> ploy appealed to firms because it enabled them either to increase their workers' after-tax pay without actually paying them any extra or to cut their own wage bill without cutting the after-tax pay of their employees. Thanks to such wheezes, says Chris Giles, an economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research group, people as unfamiliar with profits as charity workers and university lecturers are now able to receive <font size=-1>PRP</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The case for scrapping the tax-break on <font size=-1>PRP</font> is overwhelming: even when it is not a scam, why should other workers subsidise it? But it may yet survive. Some 3m people get <font size=-1>PRP</font>; to a top-rate taxpayer on maximum <font size=-1>PRP</font>, the tax-break is worth &#163;1,600 a year. How many votes are there for the Tories in grabbing that?

<p><b>Voting reform</b></p>
<h1>Grim for Tories</h1>

<p>TONY BLAIR is against introducing full proportional representation in Britain. But the Labour leader is privately more sympathetic to a half-way sort of electoral reform, the alternative vote (<font size=-1>AV</font>), which takes account of voters' second preferences. The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, although traditionally in favour of full <font size=-1>PR</font>, are now deliberately vague about other options for change. A resolution to be debated on September 24th at their annual conference in Brighton calls only for a "fair system of voting". Only the Tories adamantly resist even <font size=-1>AV</font>--unsurprisingly, since a new study of <font size=-1>AV</font> for <i>The Economist</i> suggests that it would probably mean many more Labour and Liberal Democrat <font size=-1>MP</font>s and far fewer Tories (see <a href="br3.gif">table</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The study, carried out by John Curtice, a psephologist, for the Centre for Research into Elections and Social Trends (<font size=-1>CREST</font>), makes use of newly available data from the 1996 edition of <font size=-1>CREST</font>'s British Election Panel Study, which regularly interviews the same group of voters. The study shows that 51% of Liberal Democrat voters now prefer Labour as their second choice compared with only 29% who prefer the Tories. Similarly, Labour voters prefer the Lib Dems to the Tories by about eight to one, up from four to one at the time of the last election.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under the alternative vote, the candidate who comes bottom of the poll is eliminated and his vote redistributed among the other candidates according to the second preferences of his supporters until one candidate obtains 51% of the vote. As far more Lib Dems currently say they prefer Labour to the Tories, in the many seats where the Lib Dems are in third place their votes would switch to Labour under <font size=-1>AV</font>, knocking out the Tory candidate.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The results are dramatic. Look at the second section of the table, which shows the results of a hypothetical election in which Labour and the Tories are level pegging with 39% of the vote each. Under the present system, Labour would still win more seats than the Tories, partly because of tactical voting. But under <font size=-1>AV</font>, Labour would win 105 more seats than the Tories, giving it a comfortable overall majority. If Labour wins the election by as much as recent polls suggest, it would get 451 seats, compared with 426 under the present electoral system (third section of table).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour is not the only gainer. True, the Lib Dems would still get less seats under <font size=-1>AV</font> than they would under proportional representation. However, they would get nearly twice as many seats as under the current system of "first past the post" in an election where the two big parties were neck and neck, and nearly three times as many in a Labour landslide.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Conservatives could argue that this shows that <font size=-1>AV</font> is unfair to them. Those who complain about the existing voting system say that it unjustly gave the Tories an overall Commons majority at four successive general elections, even though they fell well short of half the vote in each of them. <font size=-1>AV</font>, our study suggests, could have the same effect, although this time benefiting Labour, not the Tories.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In practice, however, <font size=-1>AV</font> would probably not be as hard on the Tories as our crude numbers suggest. Most Lib Dems in the study have Labour as their second choice because of the Tories' current unpopularity. But this will not always be so. Indeed, at the time of the 1992 general election, the same <font size=-1>CREST</font> panel showed that Lib Dems were more likely to say that the Tories were their second choice than Labour. As the gap between Labour and the Tories narrows nearer the election, as it surely will, the gap in Lib Dem second preferences is also likely to narrow. If Lib Dem second preferences returned to what they were in 1992, then Labour would still be the biggest party in a level-pegging election, but would fall short of an overall majority. <font size=-1>AV</font> may seem an attractive half-way house for Labour, but it could still give the Lib Dems the balance of power in a hung Parliament.

<h1>Asia's costly labour problems</h1>

<font size=1>HONG KONG</font>
<p>"THE situation in the country has changed," Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, said last month. With the country short of manpower, he argued, firms should stop relying on cheap labour and shift to capital-intensive and high-tech industries. Dr Mahathir's prescription could apply to much of Asia, where labour difficulties are rapidly eroding the region's cost advantage over western countries.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A study published on September 18th by Political &amp; Economic Risk Consultancy (<font size=-1>PERC</font>), a Hong Kong-based firm of consultants, weighs up the various factors that make a country's workforce attractive to foreign investors--including not just the cost of labour, but its quality, availability and stability. <font size=-1>PERC</font> asked 223 expatriate managers based in Asia to rank labour attributes on a scale from zero to ten (with ten representing the worst score). The managers also scored workers in a selection of western countries. When the grades for both skilled and unskilled workers were averaged out, only India and the Philippines got good marks (see <a href="wb1.gif">table</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The problems raised by the managers vary from country to country. Staff in Hong Kong and Singapore, for instance, were highly rated for quality, but were expensive and likely to hop from job to job almost as quickly as the low-cost, but poorly skilled, Vietnamese. Although India may provide the cheapest and most available labour, only the Philippines scored reasonably well in all categories.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet even in the Philippines, which is attracting plenty of interest from foreign investors now that its economy finally seems back on track, problems crop up. For example, small foreign firms encounter particular difficulties, since Filipinos appear to respond best when employed by big multinationals with a strong corporate culture.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>PERC</font> study is another jot of evidence in what seems to be a disturbing trend. Despite Asia's potentially enormous workforce, most companies in the region complain about the difficulties of finding, training and keeping employees. With economic development racing ahead of local skills, workers often have to be imported to fill the gaps--even for unskilled jobs. Hence labourers from Myanmar work on Thai building sites; Filipinos assemble computers in Taiwan, and East European technicians beaver away in Singapore.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Malaysians were shocked earlier this year when 3,600 workers were laid off in Penang, the country's leading enterprise zone and home to 130 electronics firms. Those who cut back included Quantum of Japan, which transferred the manufacture of hard-disk drives to Japan, and America's Hewlett-Packard. Grundig, a subsidiary of Philips, a Dutch consumer-electronics giant, shut its factory completely. Although a slump in electronics was partly to blame for the retrenchment, companies in Penang face a severe shortage of skilled workers, as well as wage increases that have outstripped productivity gains.

<h1>Of MiGs and microchips</h1><p><b>Is Larry Ellison's vision of the future of the computer industry really that different from Bill Gates's?</b><p>MICROSOFT'S job is to get Windows everywhere," said Larry Ellison on September 16th. "It's our job to stop them." The founder of Oracle, the world's second-largest software company, is taking pot-shots at the largest one, and loving every minute of it (see <a href="wb2.gif">chart</a>). To a thumping rock soundtrack, he has just mounted the stage of a computer conference in Paris, to take part in a much-hyped "battle of titans" between himself (worth a mere $5 billion) and Bill Gates ($18 billion) over whether the future of their industry will belong to the <font size=-1>PC</font> or to Mr Ellison's cheap and cheerful network computer, or <font size=-1>NC</font>, which should soon reach the shops.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is a striking contrast of styles. Mr Gates is coyly self-effacing in his Paris speech ("We're just plumbers," he claims). Mr Ellison is bitingly sarcastic ("More like the only plumber"). Mr Gates stays behind the podium and talks about directories and file formats. Mr Ellison stalks around the stage in his trademark tailored double-breasted suit and shows a picture of the MiG-<font size=-1>29</font> he is buying himself as a new toy. Mr Gates gives warning against industry "bologna" and hype. Mr Ellison talks grandly about the converging of television and information.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A network computer gets its information from the Internet and stores it there, instead of using its own memory and disk drives. This, says Mr Ellison, will change the world, not just the computer industry. Since they are easier to use (turn them on and they are connected) and will cost a few hundred dollars at most, the <font size=-1>NC</font>, unlike the <font size=-1>PC</font>, will spread beyond the rich and the corporate user.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This argument has struck a chord with many, making this a heady time for Mr Ellison. Two years ago, practically nobody outside the computer industry had heard of him or could say what Oracle did (it makes fairly arcane database software). Now Mr Ellison is stopped on the street by people who have seen him on <font size=-1>TV</font>, and is invited into the presidential limo to explain the <font size=-1>NC</font> to Bill Clinton. Better still, the unruly children of the computing world, always looking for a new prophet, now think that Mr Ellison and the <font size=-1>NC</font> might lead them out of the valley that has for the past 15 years been ruled by Mr Gates, the pharaoh of the <font size=-1>PC</font>. (The previous would-be Moses, Marc Andreessen of Netscape, was last seen being chased by Mr Gates's chariots.)
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But how real is the difference between Mr Gates and Mr Ellison? In terms of personality it could not be much larger. Despite recently becoming both a husband and a father, Mr Gates remains intently focused on technology and his business. He never talks of his private life in public, and starting a family has made no apparent difference to his famously long work hours. Even his $30m house is portrayed more as a showroom for Microsoft technology than a home.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Ellison, by contrast, works out, sails his boats, flies his planes, dates a lot, and meditates in the replica of a Japanese monastery he built near his company's California headquarters. "I don't dedicate my life to Oracle," he says. Ask him why, and something very unGateslike happens. He talks for nearly an hour about his feelings. He describes the need of a lower-middle-class kid growing up in Chicago to prove himself (his sister now complains that their early family life gets poorer with each telling) and muses about his reasons for pushing <font size=-1>NC</font>s ("Am I doing this for the greed of self-esteem or for the benefit of mankind? I don't know"). As for the MiG-<font size=-1>29</font>, it could fill several psychoanalysts' notebooks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Put in these terms, all the waffle about clashing titans seems justified. Yet it ignores two things. First, as Mr Ellison admits, his conversion to the <font size=-1>NC</font> was a little accidental. In 1993, Oracle looked at the idea of building databases to deliver digital movies, and worked with Apple to develop simple set-top boxes to display them. Two years later, when the Internet thundered past the stumbling interactive <font size=-1>TV</font> trials, Mr Ellison got his idea of retailoring them as <font size=-1>NC</font>s, still fed by Oracle databases. He first blurted out his "vision" at a meeting with Mr Clinton and a number of software executives, then floated it at the Paris conference last year. The press latched on to the idea and Oracle raced to come up with prototypes to match the rhetoric.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second hitch is that over the past year, the differences between his vision and Mr Gates's have blurred. The Microsoft boss also talks of simple, cheap devices that draw many of their programs from the network to which they are connected (indeed, the firm introduced its operating system for such machines, Windows <font size=-1>CE</font>, this week). Both think that the new devices will get many of their parts from the <font size=-1>PC</font>, which benefits from great economies of scale. Whether to call the boxes <font size=-1>PC</font>s or not is really a matter of semantics. The disagreement is really over how much of the market will go to each type of machine. Mr Gates, who has made his billions on the premise that people always want more power on their desktop, not less, thinks that some variant of the traditional <font size=-1>PC</font> will dominate. Mr Ellison thinks that most people will prefer <font size=-1>NC</font>s.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given the fact that the technical gap between their two visions is so small, the struggle for leadership in the software industry may become a matter of personal will. Here, Mr Ellison does not have as much to lose or gain as Mr Gates: whether it is a <font size=-1>PC</font> age or an <font size=-1>NC</font> one, Oracle's databases will feed any networked device. But if Mr Gates yields the <font size=-1>PC</font>, then he loses the core of his business. That may explain why he seems to care so much more about the outcome than Mr Ellison. And so far in this industry, obsession has proved more rewarding than reflection.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a>

<h1>The judgment of Salomon</h1>

<font size=1>NEW YORK</font>
<p><b>Warren Buffett and Salomon Brothers, Wall Street's oddest couple, may be heading for divorce. Why?</b></p>

<p>EVEN Warren Buffett, the Nebraskan billionaire who has won worldwide fame for his long-term investment acumen, is not infallible. In an occasional column, dubbed "Mistake du jour", that he pens for the annual reports of Berkshire Hathaway, an investment company that he controls, he has admirably owned up to a few bungles over the years, most notably a disastrous $358m investment in <font size=-1>US</font>Air, an American airline.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But for the ultimate Buffett blunder, nothing quite compares with his appalling nine-year investment of over $1 billion in Salomon Inc, which owns Salomon Brothers, an American investment bank. He has bought shares when Salomon's stock was expensive; he has declined them when they were cheap. His attempts to influence the firm's strategy have occasionally backfired spectacularly. Now Mr Buffett has announced new plans for his troublesome investment. Will he fare better this time?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rest of Wall Street will be watching closely, not least because Salomon Brothers is often cited as one of the few big Wall Street securities houses that may be snapped up when America eventually abandons rules that prevent commercial banks from owning large investment banks. Many will also be curious to see whether Mr Buffett and Deryck Maughan, Salomon Brothers' chief executive, can make any further progress in their crusade to turn one of America's most aggressive trading powerhouses into a far more shareholder-friendly beast.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Berkshire Hathaway owns two types of Salomon shares. It has 6.6m of the firm's ordinary stock (about 6.3% of the total, making Berkshire Salomon's biggest shareholder). And it still owns 560,000 of the 700,000 preferred shares it bought for $1,000 apiece in 1987. These pay a fixed 9% dividend each year. They can be converted into Salomon's common shares, at $38 per share, or redeemed for cash when they expire. The preference stock must be converted or redeemed in five tranches, the first in 1995 and the last in 1999.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last year Berkshire decided to convert 140,000 preferred shares into cash, a decision that was interpreted as a warning from Mr Buffett to Salomon's managers to get their house in order. On September 12th, however, Berkshire announced that it intended to convert a second tranche of 140,000 into common shares when they expire next month. If it does so, it will increase its stake in Salomon to 10.3m common shares, or 9.8% of its equity.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This may come as some surprise to seasoned Buffett-watchers, for Salomon has been a worrisome investment for Berkshire Hathaway. Mr Buffett bought his common shares at the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994. Salomon had made record net profits of $827m in 1993 and its share price that December was close to $50. But in 1994 Salomon lost a net $399m as bond markets collapsed. By the end of that year, its shares had fallen by 25%, to $37.5 (wiping $76m from the value of Berkshire's investment) (see <a href="fn1.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last October, when Mr Buffett declined to convert his first tranche of preference stock into common shares, Salomon's share price was $40. He had decided, he said, that "there is something else I would rather have Berkshire do with the money." Ironically, Salomon has since been on a roll. It made a net $168m in the fourth quarter of 1995, and $567m in the first half of this year, the most profitable six months in the firm's history. Since last October its shares have climbed by 15%, to $46.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Mr Buffett's financial misjudgments have not been the only embarrassments he has suffered as a result of his investment. John Gutfreund, Salomon Brothers' former chairman, was a trusted friend of Mr Buffett's. "John Gutfreund runs an extremely good operation at Salomon," Mr Buffett told his shareholders at Berkshire Hathaway's annual jamboree in April 1991. But four months later Mr Gutfreund resigned amid allegations that Salomon had been rigging America's Treasury-bond auctions. (The firm later admitted breaking the rules and settled civil charges against it.)
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This episode convinced Mr Buffett that the firm's culture needed to change. But at least one of the reforms that he inspired had disastrous consequences. In 1994, Mr Maughan overhauled the way that Salomon paid its star traders, tying their salaries much more closely to the group's overall performance.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Over the following months, about a tenth of Salomon's managing directors resigned as their salaries plunged. One who left was Dennis Keegan, head of the bank's bond-arbitrage group (which bets the firm's own capital). His outfit made $1.4 billion in pre-tax profits for the bank in 1992 and $416m in 1993. Faced with this exodus, Mr Maughan abandoned Mr Buffett's compensation scheme last year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why so many bungles? Mr Buffett is certainly not the first investor to come unstuck on Wall Street. Investment banks may sometimes earn fabulous riches. When they ration out that wealth, however, shareholders are often to be found at the back of the queue. Salomon is no exception. In 1994 the firm paid its staff $1.4 billion, despite its huge losses that year; Mr Keegan was paid an astonishing $30m. Yet if managers try to pay traders any less than they think they deserve, they are quickly lured away by offers from rival firms.
Heading for the exit
So what will Mr Buffett do now? The fact that he plans to increase Berkshire's stake in Salomon looks like a vote of confidence in the firm. But it may not be. Mr Buffett may have had enough. Although he will increase his ownership of Salomon if he converts his preference shares, he made a second, more important, announcement on September 12th. Berkshire may issue $400m of bonds that can be exchanged, at some future date, for a substantial amount of the Salomon shares that it owns. (If, for example, investors owning the bonds can swap at $50 per share, then Berkshire will rid itself of 8m shares in the event that all of the bonds are swapped for equity, and not redeemed for cash.)
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So Mr Buffett finally appears to have done something shrewd with his investment. By announcing that he will convert his preference shares into common stock, he has sent a positive signal to the market while discreetly arranging a sale by the back door. At the same time, he may be able to reduce Berkshire Hathaway's borrowing costs: the higher investors think Salomon's share price will climb in the future, the lower the interest rate Berkshire will have to pay on the exchangeable bonds.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This wheeze also suits Salomon. It appears less damning than a straightforward sale of the firm's stock. Those who think that this is yet more proof of Mr Buffett's investment savvy have little reason to cheer, however. For he did not cook up this scheme. Salomon did.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a>

<html><head><title>The genetic illusion</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" width=78 height=39  alt="The Economist"></p>

<h1><center>The genetic illusion</center></h1>

WHAT is man? Philosophers have debated this question for millennia, reaching no very serious conclusion. Lately, however, philosophy has become rather less fashionable than genetics, which is in the throes of a hugely expensive effort, known as the Human Genome Project, to answer the same question. This project is already showing great promise. It should produce many medical benefits. But it will also throw up some ethical dilemmas. Should humans be genetically engineered; should insurers have access to customers' genetic make-up to assess their risk of disease? And, in the longer run, it is in danger of creating a philosophical misconception of its own: that men's actions are determined by their genes, not by their own free will.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is not the geneticists who are at fault. The trouble is that other people often read too much into what geneticists do. When a geneticist asks what man is, one obvious answer is: "99% a chimpanzee". This is the percentage by which a person's <font size=-1>DNA</font> appears to match that of his nearest non-human relation. What it is to be human is, in that sense, crowded into 1% of the 3 billion genetic "letters" that go to make up a person's genetic material--the human genome.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Reading those 3 billion letters is the task of the genome project, which expects to list all of them within the next few years in the hope of producing new forms of medical diagnosis and treatment (see <a href="sf1.html">page</a>). But this is not merely a matter of working out what the genes are. Biologists also need to interpret the messages genes carry, and how those messages interact to build a person. If and when the interpretation is completed, humanity will know its biological self better than was conceivable as little as two decades ago.

</p><p><b>After such knowledge</b>
<br>Yet anticipating that interpretation risks recapitulating mistakes that have dogged genetics since its inception. The subject got off to a bad start when the work of its founding genius, Gregor Mendel, was ignored for almost 40 years. The period of this ignorance--the last decades of the 19th century--was marked by the growth of eugenics. This movement proposed to improve humanity by a process tantamount to selective breeding. One strand of it, however, begat America's sterilisation and selective immigration laws of the 1920s, and ultimately led to the Nazi death camps.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another strand--concerned with the measurement of human intelligence--rapidly degenerated into a vacuous debate between those who thought intelligence to be largely inherited and those who believed it to be a product of a child's early environment: nature versus nurture, as the argument came to be known. By the time real scientific genetics started its careful, limited experiments on plants and fruit flies and fungi, ideological camps were already established, and prepared to pounce on any result that supported their point of view. Conversely, geneticists with particular points of view were not above making up results to support their own ideologies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is a real danger that this could happen again. The reaction against genetic explanations that followed the excesses of eugenics has lost much of its steam. There seems to be particular public interest in scientific results that purport to show that this or that aspect of human behaviour is under biological control. There is, it is said, a gene for "thrill seeking". Male homosexuality, one result suggests, is inherited down the maternal line. The brains of homosexuals are different from those of heterosexuals. The brains of dyslexics are different from those of people who can read easily. Few of these results have emerged from the genome project itself. But, as time goes by, some such information undoubtedly will, and will strengthen the idea that people's will is not as free as western philosophers have liked to suppose. Or, as it is often put, that biology is destiny.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet this would be an error. Clear limits exist to normal human behaviour, and such limits are obviously genetic. People do not, for instance, eat grass and moo. They do not, except in novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs, swing through the trees. But it is nevertheless true that they could choose to do these things if they wanted to, at least for a time.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The respectable scientific case against free will is a physicist's case--that every outcome is an inevitable consequence of the arrangement of matter that immediately preceded it. This is not, however, a biologist's case. And it is certainly not a geneticist's case. For "biology is destiny" carries a second, unspoken, premise: "genetics is biology". The conclusion that follows is: "therefore genetics is destiny". Sometimes it is. Men with a fault in the appropriate gene will be colourblind without exception. Usually, though, things are more complex. Height is certainly under genetic control, but genes do not explain why young Japanese are taller than their fathers. The cause is a change of diet. And nutrition is just as "biological" as genetics.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;About a dozen genes are reckoned to control height. Brains are built and regulated by thousands of them. And in addition to this the scope for environmental effects on brain development, and therefore on behaviour and intelligence, is both enormous and commonplace. It is known as learning.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The complexity of the way the brain develops and functions, and the interaction between genes and environment that is responsible for it, will certainly be illuminated by the genome project. Genes will emerge that, if present in one form rather than another, or present in particular combinations, predispose people to behave one way rather than another. Other genes will cause only those predispositions appropriate to a particular environment to develop. All such predispositions will be expressed in the same way--in the actual wiring of the nerve cells that make up the brain.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Does this make people prisoners of the way their brain is wired? This question is best addressed by asking not whether it seems difficult for someone to make a particular choice, but whether it seems impossible. Sometimes it clearly is. Certain diseases genuinely rob people of choice. Accidental brain damage can have the same effect. If neurobiology ultimately comes to show that the way someone's brain is wired really does limit their scope for choice in a given situation to no choice at all, then so be it. But even when the genome project is completed, the science that could come to that conclusion will still be a long way off--and just how far off can be imagined by thinking how much a person differs from a chimpanzee, yet how similar is their <font size=-1>DNA</font>. So much complexity from so little difference. Genetics has suffered before from a mountain of speculation being built on a molehill of knowledge, and humanity has suffered as a result. For now there is no reason to abandon the belief that people control their own actions--and should be held responsible for them.

<p><h2>Banned: the bomb</h2></p>
<p><p>The <font size=-1>UN</font>'s General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to open for signature a <b>Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty </b>that had earlier been blocked by India and Iran. India can still prevent the treaty coming into force. But other world leaders, including those of the five official nuclear powers, are queuing up to sign.
<p>Iraq's aircraft and air defences defiantly provoked American aircraft in the "no fly" zones. The United States threatened a <b>"disproportionate" response</b>, and flew <font size=-1>B</font>-<font size=-1>52</font> and Stealth bombers to the area. Earlier in the week, Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, had advanced to sweep Jalal Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan from its strongholds in Iraq's Kurdish enclave.
<p>Under Syrian pressure, <b>Lebanon</b>'s two Shia parties, Amal and Hizbullah, changed their minds to fight elections in southern Lebanon (as well as forthcoming ones in the Bekaa valley) on a joint ticket. The candidates they endorsed won overwhelmingly.
<p>Joachim Ruhana, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of <b>Burundi</b>, was murdered by gunmen. In an earlier development, Burundi's neighbours agreed to ease sanctions against the military regime in order to allow in humanitarian aid.
<p>A Commonwealth delegation reached agreement with <b>Nigeria</b> on sending a ministerial team to the country to discuss human rights abuses and a return to democracy.
<p>A relief convoy reached the Liberian town of Tubmanberg and found several thousand <b>starving people</b>. The town had been cut off for weeks by fighting between rival factions.
<p>President Albert Zafy of <b>Madagascar</b> quit after being impeached by the National Assembly. An election is set for November 3rd.</p>
<p><h2>Belgian crisis</h2></p>
<p><p>A Belgian court charged a former interior minister, Alain Van der Biest , and four others with the 1991 <b>murder of Andr&eacute; Cools</b>, a deputy prime minister. Information leading to the arrests may have come from investigations into the murder of four girls and the uncovering of a paedophile and car-theft ring. Outraged by apparent incompetence all round, King Albert called for reform of the judicial system.
<p>Russia's president, <b>Boris Yeltsin</b>, handed over most of his powers to the prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, before he has heart surgery later this month. He did not yield control of nuclear weapons or the right to name ministers and sign decrees.
<p>Europe's monetary committee agreed on a procedure for imposing sanctions against countries that run excessive budget deficits after they join <b>economic and monetary union</b>. Under the deal, still to be ratified, wayward countries could be required to put up non-interest bearing deposits and pay fines.
<p>Russian troops began withdrawing from <b>Chechnya</b> under the terms of the peace agreement.</p></td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<h2>American intrigue</h2></p>
<p><p>Susan McDougal, a business partner of Bill Clinton's in the failed <b>Whitewater </b>scheme, went to prison rather than testify about the president's role in the case. Analysts said this was unlikely to affect the president's chances in the election.
<p><b>Ross Perot</b>, floundering on in America's election campaign, picked as his running mate Pat Choate, an economist known mainly for his attacks on <font size=-1>NAFTA</font> and on pro-Japan lobbyists.
<p>The Senate passed the Defence of Marriage Act, which would deny federal recognition of <b>same-sex marriages</b> and allow states to refuse to recognise any that had been approved by other states.
<p>Mr Clinton asked Congress to find more than $1 billion a year for <b>anti-terrorist measures </b>at airports, federal offices and museums.
<p>At least 28 people in the United States were killed by <b>Hurricane Fran</b>, and 34 North Carolina counties were declared disaster areas.
<p>Further fighting in <b>Colombia</b> left at least 25 soldiers and policemen, and more guerrillas, dead. Vice-president Humberto de la Calle, having told scandal-wrapped President Ernesto Samper to resign because the country was "falling apart", was told in return that he himself should resign. He did.
<p>An opinion poll on <b>Nicaragua</b>'s October 20th presidential election found left-winger (and ex-president) Daniel Ortega now close behind the right-wing front-runner, Arnaldo Aleman. But in a (probable) run-off, he would be likely to be well behind.</p>
<p><h2>Troops out</h2></p>
<p><p>Japanese on the island of <b>Okinawa </b>voted decisively for United States military facilities on the island to be reduced, leading to fears that other regions of Japan may reject American troops.
<p>Malaysia said it was "offended" by statements by Singaporean politicians about possible <b>reunification </b>of the two countries. Singapore was part of Malaysia from 1963 to 1965.
<p>A quarrel between China and Japan over <b>disputed islands </b>in the East China Sea sharpened when the Chinese gave warning of "serious damage" to relations between the two countries unless a lighthouse built by Japanese right-wingers was removed from the islands.
<p>Thirty settlers were killed by tribesmen in <b>Bangladesh</b>'s Chittagong Hill Tracts. It was the worst massacre of settlers for many years. The tribesmen want all settlers to leave and for the region to be granted autonomy.

<p><h2>Rolling on</h2>
<p><p>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br><b>Unemployment in America</b> dropped sharply in August, to 5.1%, the lowest level in seven years. The Dow Jones climbed strongly, despite the prospect of higher interest rates. Of the big five economies, only America and Britain have succeeded in pushing down unemployment over the year.
<p>In the biggest expansion since it was formed in 1930, the <b>Bank for International Settlements</b>, the central banks' central bank, is adding nine new members from Asia and Latin America to its mainly industrialised member-countries. Among those invited to join, and forestalling moves among Asian countries to form their own (competing) network, were China, India, Singapore and South Korea.
<p>A report from the British government claimed Switzerland held <b>Nazi gold </b>worth $5o0m at the end of the second world war--close to $4 billion in today's terms and much more than was previously thought. The report could increase pressure on Switzerland to examine the role of Swiss banks in shielding Nazi firms. Britain reckons that Swiss banks could still hold 90% of the hoard, which was looted from occupied countries and from Jews, then banked in neutral Switzerland.
<p>Withdrawals from Morgan Grenfell's troubled mutual funds slowed, but the firm's parent, <b>Deutsche Bank</b>, has not ruled out the need to push more cash into the three funds. Deutsche Bank is considering transferring responsibility for the British operations to Frankfurt. The bank dispatched one of its top men to London to help sort out the mess.
<p><b>Kepit</b>, the Kleinwort European Privatisation Investment Trust, is to be broken up, an unusual move reflecting the trend towards protecting shareholders rather than managers. The episode is an embarrassing one for Kleinwort Benson Investment Management, which has seen the &#163;530m ($822m) trust limp since its launch 2.5 years ago.
<p>Sir Alastair Morton reckons <b>Eurotunnel</b> will reach agreement with its leading creditor banks on refinancing its huge debt before he retires next month as co-chairman. The Anglo-French operator of the Channel tunnel cut its losses to &#163;372m ($568m) in the first half from &#163;465m a year earlier, operating near break-even in the second quarter; financial charges shrank from &#163;355m to &#163;330m.</p>
<p><h2>Switched on</h2></p>
<p><p><b>Canal Plus</b> of France, recently thwarted in its plans to expand into Germany's digital-<font size=-1>TV</font> market, is to merge with most of the European assets of <b>NetHold</b> in a deal worth about $2 billion. This will make Canal Plus, with 8.5m subscribers, one of the biggest <font size=-1>TV</font> groups in the world. The owners of NetHold are two South African firms, Richemont, a luxury-goods and tobacco outfit, and Multichoice, a media holding company.
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p><b>America's discount</b> <b>drugstores</b> are consolidating. In a $1 billion deal, Phar-Mor will merge with ShopKo Stores, more than doubling the number of pharmacies in its chain. And in a second development Revco, the country's second-largest chain, launched a $330m hostile bid for Big B.
<p>(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>Trading in <b>Olivetti </b>resumed after a turbulent few days. Its shares had been suspended after Carlo De Benedetti stepped down as head of the Italian technology company and another departing executive accused the company of hiding the true extent of its losses.
<p>The <b>semiconductor industry</b> got some good news. One closely tracked indicator, the "book-to-bill ratio" for North American firms, rose slightly to 0.90 (for every $100 in shipments, chip firms received $90-worth of new orders) from 0.86 the month before. World figures, which arrive a month late, looked even better: 0.95 for July. But both are still far below the 1.16 figure of a year ago, suggesting that the industry is coming out of its year-long slump only slowly.
<p>America's Textron, whose 25 divisions worldwide range from Cessna aircraft to automotive parts, awarded a $1.1 billion, ten-year contract to<b> AT&T</b> to install voice, data and video communications.
<p>British women can now get <b>personalised jeans</b> from Levi Strauss, which is trying out its "Personal Pair" scheme in London after the new tailoring service proved popular in America and Canada.</p>
<p><h2>Wrecked</h2></p>
<p><p>Profits at <b>Renault</b> plummeted in the first half, and the French car maker warned of a loss for the full year. Net profits dropped by 91% to FFr158m ($31m), from FFr1.76 billion a year ago. Revenues fell 2.2% as a price war raged and recovery in Europe's commercial-vehicle market failed to materialise.
<p>Two big shipping lines are to merge their container operations, creating the world's biggest container group in a fragmented industry. Britain's <b>P&O</b> and <b>Royal Nedlloyd </b>of the Netherlands will have equal stakes in <font size=-1>P&O</font> Nedlloyd, which will have net assets of $1.5 billion and a $4 billion turnover. The news boosted the shares of both.
<p><b>Prudential Insurance</b>, already embattled in its life business, suffered a new blow. It lost a $4.5 billion-a-year contract to provide health insurance to the American Association of Retired Persons. Three competitors have taken over from it.

<h1><center>Funds and games</center></h1>
<p><b>Recent scandals in the fund-management industry are in danger of making regulators over-react
</b></p>

PETER LYNCH, Warren Buffett, George Soros. The fund-management industry has always been known for its stars, courted by investors and canonised by the press for their ability to beat the financial markets. More recently, however, two prominent fund managers have gained notoriety for less stellar deeds. Peter Young, of Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (<font size=-1>MGAM</font>) in London, appears to have put his investors in a pickle; Colin Armstrong, of Jardine Fleming in Hong Kong, is said to have misused investors' funds. The danger now is that the damage will extend beyond these two firms, if regulators respond by issuing a raft of new rules, rather than letting the industry heal itself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The pressure on them to do so is acute, because in both cases small investors were involved. When an investment banker or derivatives trader goes astray, it is usually his peers that are hurt: Nick Leeson took down the Barings blue-bloods, not the man in the street. But when Aunt Agatha is at risk, cries for the regulators to do something--anything--grow louder.

</p><p><b>Star-crossed investors</b>
<br>In fact, the industry has plenty of incentives to put its own house in order. Until recently, the rise of star managers was caused by the increased competition for new cash among unit trusts (mutual funds). It seemed an excellent marketing formula: find someone with a good track record, build up his public image to match his ego, and then leave him alone to work his magic. "People want to believe in magic, they want to believe in gurus," Mr Young was quoted as saying this week. But the industry is beginning to learn that the star system also entails huge risks. Not only is it a source of mischief, it also makes that mischief more visible when it is discovered. To remain competitive, funds will have to strive to avoid putting performance before propriety.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This requires two big changes. First, funds must reform the way they pay their managers. To lure the brightest stars, most firms allow them to engage in personal trading for their own account. This is a recipe for disaster, as it makes it far easier to engage in practices such as "front running" (buying a stock for yourself, then investing the fund's money in it to boost its price) and "rat trading" (waiting to see how trades turn out, and then booking the best ones to your own account). Although these practices are illegal in most places, they can be hard to detect; forbidding personal accounts would snuff them out overnight. Better to let managers invest in the same funds they manage--so that, to borrow one of Mr Buffett's folksy phrases, "they eat their own cooking" .
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Besides abolishing personal accounts, fund-management firms should also watch their stars more closely. Internal watchdogs are often afraid to trifle with the best performers, lest they leave in a huff. This is perverse. Since beating the market is difficult, a manager who thumps it consistently is either extremely clever, lucky--or a suitable case for monitoring. Indeed, it should not take long for funds that enact such reforms to score points with investors. In the past few years, an entire sub-industry of fund-tracking firms and financial journalists has arisen to monitor funds' behaviour.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But although funds are capable of making many changes themselves, some new regulation is still essential. For a start, regulators must improve their ability to spot malpractice when it occurs. Britain's fund-management watchdog--the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation--learnt of Mr Young's deeds through sheer luck. It is now looking exhaustively into <font size=-1>MGAM</font>'s actions, and trying to discover whether the fund's trustees did their jobs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Regulators can also help to clarify the ways in which unit trusts should disclose their funds' risks. Since all investors are different, these rules must remain flexible. Many investors, for example, prefer to turn their judgment over to a professional, who will hop between stocks and bonds, and between different countries, to chase the best opportunities. If a fund wants to market itself in this way, it should be allowed to. Other investors, however, want to decide for themselves which kinds of assets to invest in; they simply want their unit trust to do so cheaply and effectively. For these investors, it is crucial that a fund does what it says it will: a European equity fund, for example, should not be buying shares in Asia.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If regulators lay down effective disclosure rules, and ensure that they are complied with, it will become far easier for funds to tell investors what they are doing. After that, the need to compete should be enough to make sure that it is trustworthy managers who become the stars of the future.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a>

<h1>The proper study of mankind</h1>

<p><b>The Human Genome Project has made great strides in the past year. By describing and cataloguing all the genes in a human body, it will change man's understanding of man. But not necessarily in ways most people expected </b></p>

BIOLOGISTS are often accused by their colleagues in other disciplines of suffering from physics envy. Physicists, the jibe goes, work on more fundamental problems. Therefore they have bigger tools.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until recently, the jibe was true. Sub-atomic-particle researchers have vast machines to pry into the building blocks of matter. Rocket scientists try to construct dwelling-places in space. Cosmologists plumb the origins of the universe with big, expensive telescopes. Now, however, biologists are matching their colleagues' ambition. Until recently, no project has sought to follow the Delphic Oracle's advice--"know thyself"--and disentangle what is, perhaps, the most intriguing fundamental problem of all: the nature of humanity.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Human Genome Project, though it will not do this by itself, will be a start. It will give biologists a toolkit with which to describe, and hence perhaps to explain, human life. The aim of the project is to catalogue and analyse all the genes whose collective instructions go to build, and then to run, a human body. This collection of genes is known as the human genome. The description of the human genome will be akin to the description earlier this century of atoms and the particles of which they are composed. Those are the basic units of matter. Genes are the basic units of life.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The implications of this project, like those of atomic physics, are enormous, and, for the moment, unpredictable. The project's protagonists hope to discover new medical insights, which should lead to new forms of diagnosis and treatment. Gene therapy--the introduction into the relevant tissue of working genes to replace faulty ones--may one day cure diseases. Biotechnologists may find ways to add tailored versions of newly discovered genes into existing human genomes. And, if it is possible to describe what makes up the simpler organs of the body, it should also be possible, one day, to analyse what happens in the brain and hence much of what determines human behaviour. So at the end of the process stands the goal of a new understanding of human life itself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As happened with the description of atomic particles, all this opens up frightening possibilities and ethical dilemmas. Can new forms of life be created? If life can be mapped, can it be replicated? Might genetic weapons be made to spread diseases, either known or newly created? If a genetic basis can be described for criminal behaviour might criminals come to be seen as victims of their genes rather than violators of the law? Might individuals carrying such genes be persecuted even if they had done no wrong? If scientists can identify the genetic basis for height or brainpower, might parents be able to specify their children's height or intelligence? Can parents "choose" their children?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All those questions are for the future--some for a distant one. Meanwhile, there is one last thing that makes the Human Genome Project unlike any other big science project so far. It will lead to discoveries that will make some people a lot of money. And because of that, as well as because the thirst for knowledge seems unstoppable, the genome project seems certain to continue to its end--wherever that may be.
</p><p><b>The three billion names of God</b></b>
<br>Given the hopes and fears attached to it, the nuts and bolts of the project are surprisingly banal. The formal goal is to describe the sequence of all the <font size=-1>DNA</font> in the nucleus of a human cell--that is, to work out the order of the chemical "letters" that carry the genetic message (see <a href="sf2.html">here</a> for an explanation of what a gene is and what it does). Working out this sequence is routine and rather dull. The technology for doing it was invented in 1975, by Frederick Sanger, of Cambridge University, and though it has been refined since, it has not been fundamentally improved upon. Most genomics laboratories consist of rows of quiet machines tended by a few technicians. The air of excitement is unpalpable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sequencing <font size=-1>DNA</font>, though, is the easy bit. The hard bit is making sense of the findings: this is what the project is really about. There appear, depending on whom you listen to and exactly what definition you use, to be anything between 50,000 and 80,000 genes hidden in the human genome. A few hundred were known about in general terms before the project started (they could be identified when they came in more than one variety or when they went wrong and affected the workings of the body). The rest remained to be discovered--and the complications were formidable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>DNA</font> amongst which the genes are scattered contains some 3 billion chemical letters. Only about 2% of these letters actually carry the message of the genes. Some of the rest help genes to function in various ways but most of them are either of unknown function or are parasitic junk.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, Dr Sanger's technique is only reliable for pieces of <font size=-1>DNA</font> less than about 500 letters long. Solving the human genome, therefore, means breaking the <font size=-1>DNA</font> up into 500-letter-long pieces, sequencing the pieces, sticking them together in the right order, and then tracking down the bits that actually constitute the genes. It is not just number crunching.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So imagine the genome project as a giant jigsaw puzzle. First, you have to assemble the pieces: 3 billion divided by 500--ie, 6m of them. And 6m is the minimum number. It does not allow for any overlaps (and it is by matching up overlaps that the pieces are put together), let alone for the errors and duplications that are the currency of scientific research.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So how can it be done at all? The answer is by taking advantage of two saving graces. First, there are several ways of breaking the puzzle up into sub-jigsaws. The individual pieces in the sub-jigsaws can be sequenced and assembled separately--and the sub-jigsaws fitted together again. The second saving grace is that lots of people can work on the jigsaw at the same time--the more the merrier, in fact. This is the main feature, other than its practical applications, which distinguishes the Human Genome Project from other big science. You do not need to build a particle accelerator or space shuttle to do it. Anyone who can afford a sequencer, a computer and a connection to the Internet can play. Thus, though the project started in American laboratories, it is now a global venture.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As a result, progress has been rapid. Both "physical maps" (linked sequences of sub-jigsaws) and "genetic-linkage maps" (which track the genes as they are mixed together from one generation to another) were completed in late 1995. The sequence will follow as night follows day (or as funding follows research). Completion is now predicted for 2000 or shortly thereafter.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So scientists have now reached the stage at which they have defined the questions, established a method for tackling them and produced early results. These results, however, suggest that the project is likely to disappoint those hoping for miraculous medical breakthroughs and may reassure those who fear the eventual worst. For good or ill, the genome project will, at least for a while, produce less dramatic consequences than most people think.
</p><p><b>The secret labyrinth</b></b>
<br>Though the project was started largely because some top biologists realised it was technically feasible, it was sold on the back of its potential medical benefits. These will certainly come, but not as fast as politicians and the public have been led to believe nor, necessarily, in the way they might expect.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A genome project might be expected, mainly, to be about curing genetic disorders. Though hundreds of diseases--for example, Huntington's chorea and haemophilia--are indeed caused by single faulty genes, each one is rare. Natural selection has weeded them out. So even if they could all be eliminated by the project's discoveries, that would amount to less than 2% of the world's disease burden.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In most diseases the contribution of genes is fuzzier. A faulty gene may be a necessary but not a sufficient cause of a disease. Sometimes an environmental trigger may also be needed (some forms of schizophrenia are believed to fall into this category). Sometimes more than one gene may need to be faulty for an effect to show up (so-called polygenic diseases, such as colon cancer). Sometimes, a faulty gene may not be needed at all: some forms of breast cancer, for instance, are genetic (two genes that more-or-less guarantee its development have been isolated); other forms are not.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In short, the link between genes and disease is more complex than many people originally thought. When there is no simple relationship between a single gene and a disease, scientists cannot use traditional genetic identification (following bits of chromosome from one generation to another to see who gets the disease) to locate it on a chromosome. New tricks are needed to study such diseases. One of the most important is to see where genes are active.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To understand what is involved, imagine the project now not as a jigsaw but as a stamp collection. Geneticists have not merely to collect the genetic stamps, but also to stick them in the pages of the album corresponding to the places which use them. These, in the case of biology, are not countries but tissues. The trick of finding out which genes are active in which tissues was invented by Craig Venter, then at America's government-financed National Institutes of Health, now at the private Institute for Genomic Research in Rockville, Maryland. Instead of peering directly into the cell nucleus, Dr Venter looked at the messenger <font size=-1>RNA</font> that the nucleus sends out (again, see <a href="sf2.html">here</a> for the role of <font size=-1>RNA</font>). This is copied only from active genes, so examining it can give a good idea of what a particular sort of cell is up to. Dr Venter copied the <font size=-1>RNA</font> back into <font size=-1>DNA</font> and then sequenced short sections of it. These he called "expressed sequence tags".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By sticking his tags together with some nifty computer software, Dr Venter has been able to get a picture of what is going on in different tissues. He has identified the nuts and bolts of some 30,000 genes, and has worked out which are active throughout the body, and which have their activity confined to particular tissues. (Those who think it is the capacity of the brain that makes humans unique will be pleased to note that the brain has by far the largest number of unique genes.)
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr Venter, though, was able to do more. With a gene's sequence in the bag, he was able to work out what the protein it codes for will look like. That, in turn, helps explain what the protein is likely to do (the functions of lots of genes and proteins have been worked out in organisms such as mice and yeast that are more amenable to experimental manipulation than people). He reckons that about 40% of the genes he has discovered are for housekeeping--ie, doing the things needed to keep a cell's metabolism running. Some 22% are to do with copying <font size=-1>DNA</font> into <font size=-1>RNA</font>, and <font size=-1>RNA</font> into proteins. And around 12% make so-called "signal molecules" such as hormones.
</p><p><b>Cleaning up in the gene pool</b></b>
<br>This sort of knowledge is scientifically invaluable. It is also invaluable to biotechnology companies whose owners hope to make their fortunes by interpreting it to the advantage of medicine. For it moves the focus from treating genetic diseases to making therapeutic proteins for problems that might not be regarded as genetic diseases at all--such as proteins that help boost the human immune system. There are half a dozen such therapeutic proteins already on the market; more than 1,000 other genes wait on the world's patent registers, ready (their discoverers hope) to generate cash.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The growth in the number of interested companies is a sure sign that the genome project is no longer like the other "big science" projects that are controlled by governments. The project is passing from the stage of basic to applied research. To see how, take the case of Human Genome Science (<font size=-1>HGS</font>), a company run by William Haseltine, a Harvard molecular biologist turned entrepreneur. His company started off in partnership with The Institute for Genomic Research, though the two organisations are now estranged. It has succeeded in building up a long list of genes, and of the tissues in which they are expressed; it also has a portfolio of some 90 so-called "purified proteins" that it hopes might have some therapeutic value.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As yet, <font size=-1>HGS</font> has no products. But it, and a number of other new firms (particularly Incyte Pharmaceuticals, of Palo Alto, California), are already making money by selling genetic information to more established drug companies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The other way of making money from genomics is by genetic testing. This makes it easy to check for known faults in genes once they have been identified. Far easier, in fact, than developing a treatment. Most genetic diseases are still incurable and gene therapy has been a dismal failure so far.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Genetic tests are useful early warning signals of susceptibility in cases where early surgery is desirable (as with breast and colon cancer). But where neither cure nor treatment exists (as for example, in Huntington's chorea), it is hard to see what purpose such a test can serve except to inform decisions about having children or perhaps, to alert insurance companies that you are a bad risk. Insurance companies want this information. Customers, understandably, are reluctant to give it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The argument over genetic testing is symptomatic of what is--and is not--likely to emerge from the Human Genome Project. Fears of genetically engineered monsters look risible in the face of technology that cannot even put the genes needed to combat cystic fibrosis into the lungs of sufferers. And the flap caused whenever researchers think they have located a gene that influences behaviour is out of all proportion to the reality: most such claims have been withdrawn once further data have been collected.
</p><p><b>Are you the prisoner of your genes?</b></b>
<br>There is a common misconception that genetics is destiny. The early results of the genome project suggest that this is not so. It appears extremely rare that there is a single gene for anything--not even for most diseases, let alone for complex forms of behaviour, such as aggression, or sexuality. The determinants of such behaviour are embedded in a jungle of genes which affect many different things at once. It will be a while before anyone can isolate any part of this jungle. It is possible that they will never be able to do so because the nature of organisms is that they are more than the sum of their parts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What is certain, however, is that, though the project will not tell us everything about ourselves, it will hugely increase our knowledge. Some of that knowledge will be welcome (genetically engineered bacteria, once the bugaboo of those who oppose biotechnology, are now workaday tools in factories and laboratories across the world). Some, of course, will not be. But, once tried and tested, it will be presumed to be the truth and integrated into the way people think of themselves. Knowing thyself is not always a comfortable process. But it is better than ignorance.

<h1>How genes work</h1>

<p>GENES are often described as the blueprint for life. In reality they are more like a cake recipe, as Richard Dawkins of Oxford University once put it. Change one bit of a blueprint and only the corresponding bit of the machine changes. Alter one of a cake's ingredients and the whole thing may turn out different.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Genes are pieces of <font size=-1>DNA</font> (deoxyribonucleic acid); they are found, organised into chromosomes, in the nuclei of living cells. <font size=-1>DNA</font> molecules look rather like twisted ladders with millions of rungs. The two uprights of each ladder form the famous "double helix" but, to understand the genome project, the parts to focus on are the rungs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Each rung is made of a pair of molecules (called nitrogenous bases), out of a set of four known by the initial letters of their chemical names: <font size=-1>A</font>, <font size=-1>C</font>, <font size=-1>G</font> and <font size=-1>T</font>. <font size=-1>A</font> and <font size=-1>G</font> are larger molecules; <font size=-1>C</font> and <font size=-1>T</font> are smaller. Each rung contains one large and one small base. The shape of each base means that a pairing of <font size=-1>A</font> and <font size=-1>T</font> produces a rung of the same size as a pairing of <font size=-1>G</font> and <font size=-1>C</font>. The rungs fit into the ladder either way round, so reading the bases attached to a single upright yields a message written in four chemical letters, eg <font size=-1>ATGTCC</font>. Genes are sequences of several hundred, or several thousand of these letters.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a gene to do its job, it is not enough for the message simply to be present in rungs of <font size=-1>DNA</font>; it has to get into the rest of the cell. For this to happen, it must first be copied into a second sort of nucleic acid known as <font size=-1>RNA</font>. This is chemically similar to <font size=-1>DNA</font> but has only one strand. <font size=-1>RNA</font> is made by an enzyme called transcriptase. This unzips the two strands of a <font size=-1>DNA</font> molecule and builds up an <font size=-1>RNA</font> molecule out of bases that match those on one of the <font size=-1>DNA</font> strands.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These <font size=-1>RNA</font> molecules are messengers armed with a copy of the gene. They drift around the cell until captured by pieces of molecular machinery called ribosomes that read the molecules and turn their messages into proteins.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Proteins are the real work-horses of cells. Like <font size=-1>DNA</font> and <font size=-1>RNA</font>, they are chains of smaller molecules linked together. (The component molecules of protein are called amino acids.) Some proteins, such as keratin and collagen, hold tissues and bodies in shape. Others, such as insulin, act as messengers between cells or, like haemoglobin, transport useful materials (in this case oxygen) to places they would not otherwise reach in sufficient quantities. Others still, such as transcriptase, are enzymes regulating almost all of the chemical reactions that go on in a body.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Genetic messages are read and turned into proteins as follows: when an <font size=-1>RNA</font> molecule is attached to a ribosome, its genetic letters are read off three at a time. Each triplet is like a genetic word. The word represents an amino acid (there are 20 amino acids to choose from, and 64 possible triplets, so most amino acids are actually represented by more than one triplet). As each triplet is read, the ribosome adds the appropriate amino acid to the growing protein chain until it comes to a triplet that says "Stop" . Changing the order of the bases in the original <font size=-1>DNA</font> can, therefore, change a protein's amino-acid sequence and can thus change what it does. Such changes are known as mutations. Some mutations are devastating--faulty insulin, for instance, produces diabetes; faulty haemoglobin, anaemia. Some make little difference. And a very few improve things--thus providing the raw material for evolution.

<h1>Can happy days be here again?</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font>
<p>WITH scarcely seven weeks to go until election day, strategists in both the Republican and Democratic campaigns are working overtime. There are new advertisements to write, debates to win and undecided voters to be influenced. But perhaps all this frenetic activity is futile. Many of the number-crunchers reckon that the biggest influence on voters' behaviour has already occurred: the rate of economic growth in the second quarter of an election year. With revised figures showing the economy booming along at an annual rate of 4.8% in April, May and June, Bill Clinton cannot lose.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sensibly, the strategists do not put too much faith in such seers. But, as far as Mr Clinton is concerned, the good economic news just seems to keep coming. Far from slowing down over the summer, as many had expected, the expansion continues apace. Indicators of consumer confidence are buoyant; manufacturers' orders are accelerating; and, most important, the labour market shows no sign of running out of steam. A quarter of a million new non-farm jobs were created in August and America's unemployment rate fell to 5.1%--a low that has been matched only once since 1980.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As always, the statistics need careful interpretation. The dramatic drop in the unemployment rate comes mainly from a shrinking of the labour force. Many new jobs came from the public sector, especially in local education, where some states have brought in mandates to shrink class sizes by recruiting more teachers. The growth of private jobs has actually slowed since June. Nonetheless, with unemployment among men of 25 and over at 3.8% (see <a href="am1.gif">chart</a>), there is no question that the labour market is tight. And, unsurprisingly, wages are edging up: average hourly pay in August was 3.6% higher than a year ago, the biggest annual wage increase since December 1990.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The combination of low unemployment and swelling paypackets raises the chances of (and the need for) a rise in interest rates at the Federal Reserve's monetary-policy meeting on September 24th. Accelerating wages, the biggest single component in firms' costs, often herald inflationary pressure. At its previous meeting in July, the Fed decided against raising rates. It opted for an "asymmetric" position--meaning that it had a bias towards tightening in future. Today, with an ever-tighter labour market, members of the Federal Reserve Board are publicly voicing concern.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One might expect higher interest rates to be music to the Republicans' ears, particularly if they prompt a long-expected stockmarket correction. But, fortunately for Mr Clinton, the bond market seems to have already factored in a rate increase of between 25 and 50 basis points (hundredths of a percentage point). And the stockmarket rose on the day the strong employment figures were released. There seems to be a consensus that a modest rise in interest rates now will temper the economy's excesses and let the recovery steam ahead.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some Cassandras, however, are less sanguine. Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, thinks much higher interest rates are in the offing. He makes a striking comparison between today's economy and that of spring 1988. Then, too, the economy was well into the sixth year of a recovery; unemployment had fallen below 5.5% and stayed there until mid-1990. Meanwhile, wage-growth rose from 3% a year to nearly 4.5% and, in response, the Federal Reserve lifted interest rates by 300 basis points. The parallels today are sufficient, he believes, for an overall rise of 175 basis points (to 7%) before mid-1997, far more than most people on Wall Street expect.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No one believes that the booming growth earlier this year can be sustained for long without upward pressure on prices. But the issue of whether unemployment is already "too low" is trickier. Much depends on what you believe the <font size=-1>NAIRU</font>, or "non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment", is. This is the rate of joblessness that is consistent with no inflationary pressure. Economists long thought that America's <font size=-1>NAIRU</font> was around 6%, but unemployment has been well below that level for two years, with scant signs of inflation. Whatever the reasons for this (perhaps globalisation, possibly corporate downsizing), the optimists reckon that America's <font size=-1>NAIRU</font> has been brought down--perhaps to 5.5%. Few would put it much lower than that. So, with the actual rate at 5.1%, it is only a matter of time before increasing wage pressure pushes up prices.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The inflationary risk of higher wages depends on how far they are matched by productivity gains. If workers are producing more efficiently, then companies can afford to pay them more without raising overall costs. But evidence of greater productivity is mixed. The most recent statistics released this week show that in the year to June manufacturing productivity rose by 4.2%, while wages and benefits rose only 3.9%. But once you include the service sector of the economy, productivity gains are not keeping up with pay rises. Overall non-farm business productivity rose only 0.8% in the year to the second quarter and overall worker compensation by 3.7%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given that American companies have been investing more, this miserable productivity performance is a puzzle. One possibility is that improvements are not being measured properly; another is that they take time to come through. A third rationale--suggested by Robert Reich, the labour secretary, this week--is that there has not been enough investment in people to help them use all those fancy new machines that firms have bought.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a new study, Mr Reich's chief economist, Lisa Lynch, together with Sandra Black of Harvard University, measured the impact on firms' productivity of different kinds of investment geared towards people, as well as changes in workplace practices. They found that raising the educational level of employees in a firm by one year, for instance, improved productivity by 8.5% in manufacturing and 13% in non-manufacturing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The conclusion for Mr Reich is clear: use government policy to foster this kind of investment in people. Hence Mr Clinton's campaign proposals for tax credits for college education: a clearly-targeted proposal to address a specific problem. Meanwhile, the Republicans' across-the-board income-tax cut can be lambasted as fiscally dangerous and insufficiently targeted.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whatever the economic merits of targeted tinkering with the tax system, the state of the economy is clearly helping the Democrats. With wages rising and most Americans admitting that they feel better-off, Mr Dole's tax-cutting message is proving hard to sell. Signs of discomfort are becoming evident in the Dole campaign: new advertisements, which barely mention the tax cuts, are being aired on television. Clearly the strategists are still trying hard. But the game may already be over on the economic front.

<h1>Trends of the week</h1>


<b>Statistic: </b>Bill Clinton paid the 27th visit of his presidency to California (more than California's own Ronald Reagan made in his two terms). Judging by the polls, Mr Clinton looks set to win the reward for his frequent flying: California's 54 electoral college votes.
<P><b>Damning statistic: </b>According to a briefing from the Media Studies Centre, the 1996 race is likely to be the least-covered presidential campaign in recent memory. From January to the end of July, network coverage was down 43% compared with 1992, and down 51% compared with the stunningly soporific campaign of 1988.
<P><b>Reshuffle: </b>Mr Dole replaced his media team. A sign of trouble--and a portent of more aggressive ads?
<b>Non-events: </b>Mr Dole's "Listening to America" sessions, at which hand-picked friendly audiences praise the candidate.
<P><b>Sticker:</b> "Bob Dole Listens".
<P><b>Optimist: </b>Jack Kemp, campaigning in Harlem.
<P><b>Doppelg&auml;ngers: </b>To help candidates prepare for the presidential debates, ex-Senator George Mitchell plays the part of Mr Dole for Mr Clinton; Senator Fred Thompson, an ex-actor, plays Mr Clinton for Mr Dole.
<P><b>Least-wanted job: </b>Ross Perot's running mate, turned down by more than one recognisable name. The poisoned chalice was at last accepted by Pat Choate, an economist and fellow anti-<font size=-1>NAFTA</font> crusader. Mr Choate played Al Gore in rehearsals for Mr Perot's disastrous televised <font size=-1>NAFTA</font> debate with the vice-president in 1993.
<P><b>Ladbroke's odds: </b>Clinton 1-7; Dole 4-1; Perot (50-1 last week) no longer listed.
<P><b>Quote: </b>Dick Morris, former Clinton strategist-in-chief, now a writer with a $2.5m contract, on the White House collection of <font size=-1>FBI</font> files, as recorded in the diary of prostitute Sherry Rowlands and printed in the tabloid <i>Star</i>: "It was Hillary, in 1993. She ordered them. She's a paranoid lady--she did it." 
<P><b>Denial</b>: Mr Morris tells a congressional committee that Miss Rowlands got the wrong end of the stick.
<P><b>Morbid speculation: </b>Mr Dole's musing on what he would want on his tombstone: "The people trusted him".

<h1>NetNanny states</h1>

<font size=1>SINGAPORE</font>
<p>ASIA'S authoritarians are continuing their unequal struggle against the Internet. In China last week some users noticed that access had been blocked to over 100 sites on the World Wide Web, the multimedia part of the Internet. The ban seems to cover, among others, American newspapers, Tibetan exiles, the Taiwanese government, <i>Playboy</i> and <i>The Economist</i>. The Chinese government has said nothing about what is going on--although it did promise a clampdown against pornography last February. The ban still seems patchy. International wire-services that provide Internet access seem to be unaffected--which may have something to do with the fact that they are compelled to pay fat fees to the official Chinese news agency.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;New controls are also on their way in Singapore, where three local Internet "service providers" have more than 150,000 subscribers--5% of the population. In March the government began a drive to curb unwholesome activity in cyberspace, such as pornography and "material sowing social and religious discord."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until now, regulation in Singapore has relied largely on self-policing. Access providers were urged to install filtering software, such as Surfwatch, CyberPatrol or NetNanny. Some content providers, including political parties and religious groups, have to register with the authorities. But for those who managed to dodge the barricades to ogle hard-core porn or incite revolution, the chief constraint was the fear of being caught.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From September 15th, a new phase of regulation begins. Internet providers will introduce technology that enables them automatically to block access to sites banned by the regulator, the Singapore Broadcasting Authority (<font size=-1>SBA</font>). As might be expected, some Internet users are up in arms at censorship. Others, however, have more practical worries. Technology designed to censor material has hitherto been used on a much smaller scale, by companies. It tends to slow down connections to less-frequented Internet sites. The more banned sites there are, the slower it will be.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Optimists think the <font size=-1>SBA</font> list will be short. After all, Singapore is enthralled by the commercial possibilities of the Internet and cherishes its position as a regional communications hub. Others fear the worst. Already, big businesses, which have their own leased lines for Internet access, have secured an exemption from the new requirements. That only heightens the fear of some individual users that their access will be sharply curtailed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor has the government disguised its wish to censor objectionable political material as well as pornography. Internet "newsgroups" have provided perhaps the freest forums for political discussion Singapore has known. The question of re-merger with Malaysia, for example, has provoked a debate that has at times become overtly racist. The government is particularly worried by the fact that people can post their views anonymously, or under false names. Subscribers to a news group discussing Singapore were amused to find anonymous postings purporting to be from Lee Kuan Yew, the former Singaporean prime minister, hurling criticism--and sarcastic praise--at the regime. The real author of these messages has not yet been found.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In early September, Singapore and the six other members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations met in Singapore to discuss the promotion and policing of the Internet. Singapore is far ahead in the business and even administrative uses of the Internet (which can be used, for example, to apply for some government permits). But agreement on a common approach to regulation was difficult. There, too, Singapore is streets ahead.

<p><b> BY INVITATION</b></p>
<h1>Democracy's second age</h1>
<p><b>One of the biggest gaps between Britain's two main political parties concerns constitutional reform, where Labour is advocating far-reaching changes. Here Tony Blair, the party's leader, sets out his party's plans and defends them against the Tory charge that they would break up the United Kingdom</b></p>

<p>WE ARE now in the Second Age of democracy. It is time to give it a second wind. After a long battle, the First Age established universal suffrage. This finally came to the United Kingdom, in 1928, when the vote was extended to all adult women.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nearly 70 years later, however, Britain has changed radically. The attempt to change prevailing social and economic conditions (and the need to fight two world wars) hugely extended the scope of central government. In 1900, central government spending as a share of <font size=-1>GDP</font> amounted to 9.7%; in 1930 it was 13.0%. Today, it is over 42%--steady at that level since 1979.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In mid-century the majority of the country was self-consciously working class, and paid less than 10% of their income in tax. Today, the largest grouping is the middle class; the groups classified as "<font size=-1>ABC1</font>" by pollsters make up 52% of the electorate, and pay over 35% of their incomes in taxes. Even those in the bottom fifth of the income distribution pay almost 40%. So government now spends more public money and the majority of the population fund the expenditure.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These changes raise serious questions for democracy. Is it still supportable that the power to decide how these vast resources are spent should reside exclusively with a highly centralised national government? And do the more educated and wealthier citizens of today, albeit all of them with the vote, really have power over the system?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To make matters worse, some British institutions have not yet caught up even to 1928. They are actually pre-First Age. Think of the way Parliament works, sometimes seeming more private club than modern democratic forum; or the composition of the House of Lords; or constitutional conventions established in the 18th and 19th centuries.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The consequence of ignoring these questions is that politics becomes less respected, less accountable, more remote from people's lives. That is bad for Britain and bad for democracy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Contrary to the Tory<i> canard</i>, constitutional reform is not an issue for the "chattering classes", irrelevant to most people. Properly done, it will go to the heart of public concerns. It is important not only for its own sake, but because it makes possible the attainment of other vital goals: a stronger economy, better transport, good schools and crime prevention.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Walter Bagehot, the great Victorian editor of <i>The Economist</i>, declared at the outset of his classic text "The English Constitution": "Every constitution must first gain authority, and then use authority." It must, he went on, "first win the confidence and loyalty of mankind, and then employ that homage in the work of government." These are wise words, and they summarise very well my approach to constitutional reform (or democratic renewal, as I prefer to call it).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Changing the way we govern, and not just changing our government, is no longer an optional extra for Britain. So low is popular esteem for politicians and the system we operate that there is now little authority for us to use unless and until we first succeed in regaining it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For three decades the standing of Britain's constitution has been declining. Barely a third of the people now declare themselves satisfied with their system of government. Parliament's very <i>raison d' &ecirc; tre</i> is to express and redress popular grievances. When it has itself become the focus of those grievances, it is obliged to act.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We do not need to exaggerate to make the case. Britain is not recovering from war-time defeat or social collapse, nor is it tainted by totalitarianism. We are not faced with the necessity of building a new constitution from scratch, as for example was post-war Germany.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain is, however, struggling to find its way after the collapse of the grand 20th century ideologies of left and right. These too often placed ends above means, grand projects of social or economic reconstruction above the democratic requirement for consent, self-government and respect for rights. The result has been 80 years since the first world war of a steady accretion of power to ministers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;New Labour's aim is a partnership between people and politicians based on trust, honesty and a realistic assessment on both sides as to what government can deliver.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The challenge facing us is that which confronted the Victorian reformers in the last century who, almost uniquely, gave Britain democracy without revolution. It is to take a working constitution, respect its strengths, and adapt it to modern demands for clean and effective government while at the same time providing a greater democratic role for the people at large.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour's programme for democratic renewal is threefold: to strengthen the rights and obligations of citizens; to take decision-making closer to the people; and to improve the democratic credentials of Westminster.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Democracy can flourish only as part of a rich culture of rights respected and duties performed. Most of these rights and duties relate to community life beyond the sway of the politician or the ordinary scope of the courts. But the duty of the state's constitution to safeguard freedoms, and encourage the performance of duties, remains profound.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The British state presently does too little on these counts. Basic rights, to information, legal equality, due process and security of property, are too often flouted. And little attempt is made to encourage people to take more than a cursory part in their own governance. The idea that the people at large might play a greater political role is instinctively alarming to many in the elite for its implication of greater "direct democracy." It ought, instead, to be seen as critical to developing a richer notion of democratic citizenship.
</p><p><b>Tory Bourbons</b>
<br>The case for a freedom of information act and the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into British law is now generally agreed outside the Conservative Party and even by some within it. The onus must always be on public authorities to explain why citizens should not have access to information and not vice versa. Britain already has a <i>de facto</i> bill of rights through its ratification of the European Convention underpinned by a court in Strasbourg which delivers more hostile judgments against Britain than any other state. Only the strange mentality of the modern Tory Bourbons could think it satisfactory to force British citizens to go to France to enforce their rights because their own courts are incapable of doing so.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More information and guaranteed rights are only two means of achieving far broader democratic objectives. Greater use of referendums is another, to give citizens a veto over proposals to change their system of government, and to give legitimacy to the changes to which they do agree. Other democratic innovations, such as citizens' juries, are being piloted with some success to assist decision-making in the <font size=-1>NHS</font> and local government. Informed public participation is the key, complementing not replacing established decision-making by elected representatives.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most political decisions of concern to citizens affect their immediate locality. The revival of local government must be the prime means for achieving the second objective of taking government closer to the people. Local government's democratic voice needs strengthening, by establishing a closer engagement between local authorities and their electors. This is why I am so strongly attached to the principle of elected mayors for London and our leading cities--generating local chief executives with a direct mandate, able to mobilise their communities behind urban renewal as mayors across Europe and the United States do.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Strengthening the intermediate tier between London and the localities is also necessary. Here again our agenda is one of sensible, incremental change to meet modern democratic demands.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Scottish Office was established as long ago as 1885 to provide a Scottish dimension to administration north of the border. But it is Westminster-controlled and Westminster-oriented. The Scottish people rightly insist on something more democratic, in the form of a Scottish parliament with legislative powers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Tories claim that this would threaten the unity of the United Kingdom, yet they rightly consider their proposals for devolved government in Northern Ireland as perfectly compatible with the union. Their opposition to our decentralisation plans ignores the wisdom of the ages, as well as concrete experience in other countries. As William Gladstone, the Victorian prime minister, said: "The concession of local self-government is not the way to sap or impair, but the way to strengthen and consolidate unity."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Precisely this rationale has led every other large European democracy, including France and Spain with centralising traditions as strong as Britain's, to create a regional tier between central government and local authorities. Spain, for example, has met regional aspirations of varying strengths by adopting a rolling programme of devolution, across a lengthy timespan, in line with the flow of popular sentiment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We are proposing a similarly refined approach for the United Kingdom. Scotland with its distinct national, legal and cultural institutions is manifestly in a class of its own. Even the current secretary of state for Scotland, Michael Forsyth, concedes that once a Scottish parliament is established, it will be here to stay. In their own separate ways, Wales and London also have powerful claims to--and their people want--their own authorities.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Across the rest of England, popular enthusiasm for a regional political voice varies greatly. Our policy reflects this, allowing greater regional government as people demand it. In the north-east and north-west demand for greater powers is strong. In other places, there is less demand. So be it.
</p><p><b>Shaking up Westminster</b>
<br>Westminster has for too long insulated itself from change while imposing it on everyone else. Here again, Labour must settle some important unfinished business from a century ago, starting with the House of Lords. It delights and astonishes me that we are about to fight an election in which the Tories will be defending the right of ancestral dukes, marquesses, earls and barons to make the law in a modern democracy. And this in a society which John Major claims he wants to make "classless"!
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour will remove the right of hereditary peers to sit and vote in the Lords and introduce a more open system for nominating life peers. We will consult widely about an appropriate second-stage reform, but we should be clear that removing the absurdity of the hereditary element will be a huge step forward in itself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Effective democracy depends, above all, on the quality of the House of Commons. Electoral reform for the Commons has a totemic status among some of Britain's constitutional reformers. I appreciate the reasons for this, not least 17 years of "elective dictatorship" by Tory governments returned on minority votes, pushing through divisive and destructive policies such as the poll tax and rail privatisation, which is why I have confirmed John Smith's pledge to hold a referendum on the issue.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, I personally remain unpersuaded that proportional representation would be beneficial for the Commons. It is not, as some claim, a simple question of moving from an "unfair" to a "fair" voting system. An electoral system must meet two democratic tests: it needs to reflect opinion, but it must also aggregate opinion without giving disproportionate influence to splinter groups. Aggregation is particularly important for a parliament whose job is to create and sustain a single, mainstream government.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whatever the electoral system may be, something has to be done about the House of Commons itself, which, to more and more voters, seems arcane and ineffective, or worse. We need to improve the way we scrutinise and debate legislation, how <font size=-1>MP</font>s hold the executive to account, how we organise the legislative programme and how we deal with European legislation.
</p><p><b>Opponents of reform</b>
<br>Opposition to Labour's plans for constitutional modernisation come from two camps. The first group are opponents of principle. They are against any tampering with Britain's "perfect" constitution. The second group are tactical opponents. Though not against reform, either they believe that it is a distraction from the "serious" business of reducing unemployment, improving education and such like, or they recoil from the parliamentary battles required to enact constitutional reforms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first camp, led by John Major, is intellectually barren. For Mr Major, whatever is is best, from hereditary peers to the unaccountable quangocracy. Nothing like this has been heard since the Duke of Wellington thundered in defence of pocket boroughs and electoral corruption in 1830.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Major's position is more extreme than that of his predecessors. Although the Tories opposed most of the big constitutional reforms of the past two centuries, no previous Tory leader since Wellington refused to countenance<i> any</i> democratic reform. Balfour favoured radical reform of the Lords as long ago as 1911. Even Lady Thatcher once proposed all-party talks on a bill of rights. Ted Heath and Alec Douglas-Home were once supporters of Scottish devolution. London's elected authority was established by a Tory government (in 1889), together with the national system of county councils.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In truth, as Mr Major's more sophisticated predecessors recognised, the undoubted strengths of the constitution are the fruit of deliberate reform in centuries past. Its growing weaknesses need to be tackled in the same way. Renovation, as any disciple of Edmund Burke knows, is a prime means of conservation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Tory opponents of change are also fatally inconsistent. They themselves have carried through far-reaching constitutional changes in the past 18 years, although in ways that have made Britain less democratic rather than more.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The balance of power between local and central government has radically shifted in favour of the latter. The Single European Act and the Maastricht treaty extended the powers of the <font size=-1>EU</font>. And the Major administration itself promises significant constitutional re-engineering, including an elected assembly in Northern Ireland (without any cut in the number of Northern Ireland <font size=-1>MP</font>s, or any brouhaha about a "West Belfast question").
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our unwritten constitution has its vices. But its virtue is that it does not require neat solutions. It can cope with the diversity of the United Kingdom, the specificities of its nations and regions. The union that makes up the <font size=-1>UK</font> is a partnership based on give and take to the benefit of all. By respecting the differences of tradition, culture and institutions, we strengthen the union rather than weaken it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The more plausible critique of what we are proposing--and it is heard from some who count as supporters of New Labour--is that this programme is a distraction. Labour governments, they say, should be concerned with delivering jobs, growth and economic equality, not with airy-fairy notions such as democracy and participation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is historically unfounded. The role of left-of-centre parties around the world and down the ages has been to extend democratic power, while the right has struggled to reduce it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But in any case economic reconstructions and democratic renovation are not alternatives. They go in tandem. To take a historical analogy, extending the vote to the middle and working classes was not an alternative to making Britain the workshop of the world in the last century. It was only by incorporating and empowering the people who made it such that their energies and skill could be fully harnessed to the task of modernisation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain's constitutional exceptionalism would be tolerable if experience suggested it yielded social progress and economic success. The evidence points the other way.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Finally, there are those who argue that the path to constitutional reform is strewn with good intentions but failed plans. They remember the unsuccessful struggles of Harold Wilson's 1966-70 Labour government with House of Lords reform, and of Jim Callaghan's 1976-79 Labour government with devolution, and are overcome by an understandable faintheartedness.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Constitutional change can, I accept, be a fraught endeavour. In the end it is a question of political will, parliamentary skill and eventually popular support.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And in this regard, history is a poor teacher. Times have changed. Constitutional issues are now at the heart of political debate. We gauge that constitutional conservatism is dying and that popular support for change is tangible and steadfast. As important, we are prepared this time to put that judgment to the test by laying our most important proposals to the test of popular endorsement through referendums. We will seek a specific mandate from the Scottish people for the creation of a parliament, and for its tax-varying powers. We will set up regional government only where people vote for it. We will give the people the ultimate say on the system by which they elect their representatives at Westminster. Despite the initial concern these commitments sparked within the Labour Party, I am convinced that they are essential to ensuring that constitutional reform does not run ahead of public opinion. That would be fatal to it.

</p><p><b>Democratic renewal</b>
<br>In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a widespread perception that the right was "winning the argument" on the central economic issues of the day. Now the economic argument has changed, with Labour advocating long-term investment--above all in education--reform of welfare and leadership by Britain in Europe.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If I am not mistaken, in the mid-1990s, another perception is taking hold: that the centre-left is "winning the argument" on constitutional matters. Mr Major in his bunker reminds me of those Labour die-hards who went on arguing for nationalisation and statism long after their irrelevance was plain to the rest of the world.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We shall fight the general election <i>inter alia </i>on democratic renewal. More important still, with the support of the people we shall deliver what we promise on democratic renewal as an essential element in our project: the modernisation of Britain.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a>

<p><b>Advertising</b></p>
<h1>Too many puffs</h1>


<p>THE Advertising Standards Authority (<font size=-1>ASA</font>) may be, in the words of its own code, "decent, legal, honest and truthful", but is it effective? For years the self-regulatory body, which is financed entirely by the advertising industry, excited little controversy. More recently, however, it has been running into trouble. Complaints to the authority have risen by nearly a third at a time when its rulings are increasingly under attack from both advertisers and the public.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Politicians appear to have little respect for the authority. The Conservative Party openly defied the <font size=-1>ASA</font> over its judgment that the party's poster featuring Tony Blair with demonic red eyes was a breach of the code. "We are totally unrepentant," said a senior Tory official. Labour seems no happier with the <font size=-1>ASA</font>. Nigel Griffiths, its consumer affairs spokesman, says the <font size=-1>ASA</font> reacts too slowly to complaints. By the time it issues an adjudication the advertising campaigns have already finished, he argues.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Doubts over the authority's competence are not confined to politicians. Pressure groups such as Friends of the Earth, whose advertisements have been the subject of adverse rulings, often claim the authority is unprofessional and poorly informed. Others, such as Action on Smoking and Health, dismiss it as "weak and ineffective".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>ASA</font> also sometimes seems to be out of touch with public opinion. It recently rejected complaints about a Gossard bra poster featuring a semi-naked model reclining invitingly in a haystack accompanied by the slogan: "Who said a woman can't get pleasure from something soft?" The decision has provoked a storm of protest from women's groups. The authority ruled the advertisement's innuendo was acceptable on the grounds that parents could truthfully tell their children that the poster was praising the bra's qualities.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some such controversies, especially on matters concerning public taste, are inevitable. And the very nature of its task means that the authority can never please everyone. But charges of incompetence are more serious. This is the kind of criticism which the authority is now facing from food firms and anti-smoking groups over its handling of an advertisement run earlier this year by Philip Morris, a cigarette company.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The advertisement suggested the health risk from passive smoking was less than eating one biscuit a day. <i>The Economist </i>has learned that the authority provisionally decided that the advertisement was unacceptable because it gave a "misleading impression" of comparative risk but then, only after representations from the company, decided to seek independent advice.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Complaints about the advertisement were first made in June. But it was not until the middle of August that the <font size=-1>ASA</font> decided that it needed independent scientific advice, something which should have been obvious at the outset. By the time the <font size=-1>ASA</font>'s council finally rules on the complaint on September 13th, Philip Morris will have long since ceased running the advert. In France, by contrast, the courts ordered the company to call an immediate halt to a similar campaign and it is now also facing an action for damages.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The French approach risks state censorship and assumes that consumers are too stupid to make up their own minds. Self-regulation, or no regulation at all, makes better sense. But if self-regulation is chosen, there is not much point to it being done incompetently.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>ASA</font> should not have needed three months to judge whether this advertisement was misleading. Had it sought advice earlier, it would have quickly learned there is plenty of evidence available on which to judge the relative risks of eating fat-laden biscuits and passive smoking. Numerous studies have examined the fat issue. And as long ago as 1988 a government-appointed commission reported on the risks of passive smoking. Since then, the Royal College of Physicians has done a similar study.

<p><b>Teaching</b></p>
<h1>A shortage of sirs</h1>

<p>TRYING to teach quadratic equations to a bunch of unruly teenagers is hardly the cushiest of jobs. So as unemployment continues to fall, it is not surprising that teacher-training colleges are finding it hard to recruit prospective maths teachers. But there are growing worries that the supply of teachers may be dwindling just as the number of school-age children is growing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government asked teacher-training colleges in England and Wales to recruit about 2,000 people to train as maths teachers this autumn. John Howson of Brookes University in Oxford, who has just been appointed as the government's adviser on the supply of teachers, reckons they will end up with only 1,500, a shortfall of 25%. He also predicts shortfalls in other secondary-school subjects: 15% in science and 10% in languages. So far, though, there is no lack of people wanting to become primary-school teachers or to teach history or games.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government wants to expand the number of places at teacher-training colleges by about 30% over the next five years. This is partly because the number of pupils is expected to rise during that period from 9.5m to about 10m. But it is also because more than half of all teachers are over 40, and increasing numbers are leaving the profession well before retirement. According to official figures, a minuscule 0.4% of teachers' jobs are unfilled. In fact, Mr Howson says, these figures understate the problem of shortages: by January, when they are collected, many schools have decided to make do with whatever staff they can get, whether or not they are qualified in the subject they are teaching.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An official survey of 1,615 students who received a postgraduate certificate in teaching in 1995 gives further cause for concern about the quality as well as the quantity of trainee teachers: 88% of them had earned only a "pass" in their first degree (ie, lower than a third-class degree).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It seems to be mainly men who are turning away from teaching. In primary schools, the proportion of female teachers has risen from 78% in 1980 to 83% now. Last year, for the first time, there were more women than men teaching in secondary schools. The government is worried about one possible consequence: that, with fewer male teachers around, many boys--particularly those brought up only by their mother--are not encountering "positive role-models" during their formative years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Teaching is not the best-paid job, especially for those with degrees in maths and science. But it is not badly paid either. Between 1980 and 1992, teachers' pay grew faster than that of nurses, hospital doctors, police officers and most other non-manual workers, although their pay has been squeezed slightly since. Mary Russell, secretary of the Universities Council for the Education of Teachers, says that it is not starting salaries (at least &#163;12,400 a year) nor the pay of head teachers (up to &#163;55,600 a year) that pose the problem: it is a lack of mid-level jobs which discourages people from joining and staying in the profession.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So there may be something in Labour's proposal that a new breed of higher-paid "superteachers" be created. As well as continuing to teach, they would act as mentors to other, less-experienced staff. The government's Teacher Training Agency is looking at similar proposals. But the national teachers' pay agreement already gives schools a fair amount of leeway: for teachers with ten years' experience, their basic pay of &#163;21,000 a year can be increased by up to &#163;4,400 to reward excellence or to retain staff in subjects where there is a shortage.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to Mr Howson, the key to avoiding a serious shortage of teachers is to improve the battered image of teaching which, he feels, is more of an obstacle to recruiting and retaining teachers than pay. Many teachers blame politicians and school inspectors for their profession's poor image. The politicians and inspectors rightly reply that improving standards is the best way to raise any profession's prestige, including that of teachers.

<p><b>Medical science</b></p>
<h1>Partying post-op</h1>

<font size=1>GLASGOW</font>
<p>COMPANIES that announce breakthroughs in medical science usually get a hero's welcome. But whereas surgeons applauded when Health Care International (<font size=-1>HCI</font>), a private hospital, announced this month that one of its doctors had invented an anaesthetic machine which means people feel much less sick after operations and speeds their recovery, reaction in Scotland was less than ecstatic.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1994, <font size=-1>HCI</font> opened a swanky 240-bed private hospital to do expensive surgery on rich foreigners at Clydebank in Glasgow. Though it promised hundreds of jobs in an area of long dole queues, it went straight to the top of the local hate list. In an area which prides itself on being the cradle of socialism a century ago, it was regarded as an evil changeling, not least because the Tory government had promised a &#163;30m grant to help build it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The critics felt themselves thoroughly justified when, four months after it had opened, <font size=-1>HCI</font> went bust because its forecasts of patient numbers had been hopelessly optimistic. The Abu Dhabi Investment Company bought the bankrupt business, saving the government some embarrassment, although this did little to change local opinion, which regards it as a parasite on the National Health Service.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This view might also have been thought by critics to be justified when Gavin Kenny, a professor of anaesthesia at Glasgow University, shifted his research team from Glasgow Royal Infirmary to <font size=-1>HCI</font>, lured by lavish facilities. But Mr Kenny's move speeded up work on a machine which uses micro-computers to control the rate at which an anaesthetic is pumped into the blood of patients undergoing surgery.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such machines are nothing new. But Mr Kenny's device uses two micro-computers to achieve much closer monitoring of the pump feeding the anaesthetic into the patient. Extensive testing of the equipment has sufficiently impressed the authorities which regulate medical equipment in Britain and, so far, four other countries, to make this the first such machine to be licenced for commercial sale to hospitals.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The anaesthetic used by Mr Kenny's machine is propofol, which has been in use for about ten years. It reduces the sickness felt by patients after they wake up from an operation. However, difficulties in controlling the dosage have always meant that anaesthetists have also had to rely on anaesthetic gases breathed in through a face mask. These gases cause post-operative nausea in about half of all patients. Mr Kenny's machine reduces or eliminates the need for such gases. Tests at <font size=-1>HCI</font>, which is using Mr Kenny's machine on all its patients, and at other hospitals show that the machine cuts the proportion of patients suffering nausea to less than 10%. So most patients thus treated recover from the anaesthetic in hours rather than days, says Mr Kenny.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Anaesthetists who have either tried the machine, or seen it demonstrated at medical conferences, are enthusiastic. So are hospital administrators. Mr Kenny says that studies in America have shown that, although the drug costs about $14 (&#163;9) more per operation than conventional drugs, faster patient recovery time can save about $400 per patient. The British makers of the computer-controlled pump say they will cost about &#163;1,500, not much more than conventional anaesthetic pumps. Use of it was authorised only in August, but they already have orders for 400.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Edinburgh house in which Sir James Young Simpson, another Scottish doctor, discovered the first modern anaesthetic, chloroform, in 1846 has a commemorative plaque on it. Mr Kenny may eventually be as esteemed as Sir James. But whether his innovation encourages the Scots to pay more regard to <font size=-1>HCI</font> remains to be seen.

<h1>Sega's sonic hedge</h1>
<p>
SEGA ENTERPRISES, the Japanese firm that created Sonic the Hedgehog, is feeling prickly. The home video-games market, which turned Sega and its charmless mascot into household names, has been in the doldrums for three years, with sinking demand and a nasty price war. Worse, Sega appears to be on the losing side: revenues from its consumer sales are expected to be only &#165;114 billion ($1.05 billion) this year, down from &#165;301 billion in 1993, according to Morgan Stanley, an investment bank.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sega's attempts to revive its fortunes in the home rested on the Saturn, a fancy video-games machine it released last year. Unfortunately the PlayStation, a machine made by Sony, has proved much more popular in Europe and the United States. Now Sega's old rival, Nintendo, has launched an even fancier machine, the Nintendo 64. It looks set to knock Saturn for six in Japan.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Game over? Not quite. More than half of Sega's &#165;384 billion in total revenues come from two other markets: coin-operated arcade games and amusement centres. The first is doing well enough--Sega has about half the market--and Morgan Stanley reckons it will bring in &#165;114 billion this year. But it is the amusement centres that currently excite Sega executives.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On September 7th the firm launched Segaworld, a joint venture with Trocadero, owners of the eponymous building in London's touristy Leicester Square. Sega grandly calls Segaworld a "theme park for the 21st century" , but in reality it is a vast (110,000 sqare feet or 10,220 square metres) video-game arcade.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At around &#163;50m ($78m), Segaworld cost far more than the average games centre. But it charges far more, too. Segaworld expects 1.75m people, each paying an admission charge of between &#163;9 and &#163;12, to pass through its doors in the first year. When inside, Segaworld's six flagship interactive rides are free, but the coin-operated machines are not. The company reckons that each visitor will spend &#163;15 (including admission), bringing in a handy &#163;26m in the first year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While this will hardly make up for Sega's losses in the game-machines business in the immediate future, the firm thinks it might do so in the long run. It plans to launch dozens of these mega-arcade centres, the next in Sydney later this year. It already runs two similar centres, revoltingly called Joypolises, in Japan. Yasuo Tazoe, Sega's head of amusement theme parks, reckons that the company's parks might ultimately bring in &#165;200 billion annually in the Japanese market alone. Rather than earning just a series of one-off revenues from selling coin-operating machines, Sega should earn a steady cash stream, from per-use fees on the machines as well as admission fees.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Elsewhere, the spoils could be even bigger: in America alone the theme-park business was worth $12 billion in 1994. A lone hedgehog may not look like much next to Disney's beloved menagerie, but Mickey doesn't surf.

<h1>Karl Kehrle</h1>

THE achievement of Karl Kehrle, a Benedictine monk, was to breed a very decent British bee. Wherever in the world apiarists meet they speak in awe of Mr Kehrle's sturdy bee, which produces lots of honey and is reluctant to sting. Like the British themselves, it is a mongrel, combining the virtues of the native bee with those of worthy bees from elsewhere. Mr Kehrle once heard of a promising bee said to be found only in central Africa. Although in his 80s, in poor health and carried on the back of a friend, he tracked the bee down on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Selective breeding has been going on in a random way for thousands of years since animals and plants were first domesticated. Gregor Mendel (1822-84), like Mr Kehrle a monk, laid the foundations of what has come to be called genetics. Mendel did clever things with garden peas, but had no success with bees, whose sexual practices remained a mystery to him. Queen bees, it is now known, mate with a drone, or several drones, while on the wing. Then, loaded with sperm, they return to the hive for several years, producing huge numbers of bees. Mr Kehrle pioneered artificial insemination for bees, impregnating his queens with the sperm of immigrant bees. "A very delicate operation," remarked a colleague of Mr Kehrle.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His Buckfast bee, named after the abbey in Devon where Mr Kehrle was a monk, became an unusual export, earning many thousands of pounds for the order. Numerous Buckfast bees have been imported by commercial honey producers in the United States, where disease has caused widespread damage. (The Benedictines, a fairly liberal order, have a talent for making money: their abbey in northern France makes a liqueur, much in demand despite being too sweet for some tastes.) Mr Kehrle became a celebrity within the bee world, lecturing here, picking up an honorary doctorate there, written up in bee journals, made a vice-president of Britain's International Bee Research Association. A species of bee was named after him. It wasn't a bad career for someone who, as he occasionally remarked, had no formal education at all.
</p><p><b>The Italian clue</b></b>
<br>Karl Kehrle was born in Germany. His mother, a keen Roman Catholic, heard that the monks rebuilding their abbey at Buckfast, shut down in the reign of Henry VIII, needed workers. So Karl, not quite 12, was sent to England. He wasn't strong enough to lift stones, so he helped with the bees. By 1919, aged 21 and now a monk named Brother Adam, he was the abbey's master beekeeper. He set out to save the native British bee, which was being wiped out by a disease called acarine. He cross-bred Italian bees, which were free of acarine, with some of the abbey's bees that had eluded the disease. The cross-breeding was a process that was continued under Mr Kehrle over subsequent years with the help of other foreign bees.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some bee people, while admiring Mr Kehrle's skill as a beekeeper, note that his innovations owed much to the work of Ludwig Armbruster, a fellow German (later a victim of the Nazis), who, following up the work of Mendel, published research on bees and genetics. Mr Kehrle was, by contrast, a hands-on, practical man. But this was no bad thing. Someone has to turn theory into practice. He was unsurpassed as a breeder of bees. He talked to them, he stroked them. He brought to the hives a calmness that, according to those who saw him at work, the sensitive bees responded to. He was very upset when two of the abbey's queen bees were stolen, and remarked on the frailty of humans. Bees, he said, would never behave like people. "He loved the bees almost as much as he loved God," said a colleague.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A mischievous comment, perhaps. Yet even in the brotherly community of an abbey little jealousies can arise over a colleague who seems to have got more than his fair share of attention. In 1991 Mr Kehrle asked the abbey to provide him with a qualified assistant to help with research into the varroa parasite, which, like the acarine disease of the 1920s, is threatening British bees, and is at present controlled, although only partially, by chemicals. The abbot turned down the request, and apparently felt that, after 80 years at the abbey, it was time for Brother Adam to part from his bees and spend the remainder of his life on monkish duties. "I am sure that he would consider himself a monk first and a beekeeper second," said the abbot, not entirely convincingly. Mr Kehrle handed over his hives to young monks, but was never unwilling to give advice.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He said he wanted to live to 100. The astonishing thing is that he lived as long as he did. Physically, he was not strong. His journeys abroad in search of bees, often partly on foot or by donkey, were exhausting. He suffered several heart attacks. Doctors routinely told him he would never work again. Several times he received the last rites of his religion, but clambered from his bed to see how his bees were managing without him. If an interest in life can keep you going, it certainly worked with Karl Kehrle.</td></tr></table>

<h1><center>Saddamned</center></h1>

GIVE Saddam Hussein a glimpse of weakness and he will exploit it. By sending his tanks to help one Kurdish faction against another, he was not transgressing the letter of the international rules that tie him down. The spirit is something else. Mr Hussein was testing the boundaries, reinserting his armed fist--albeit by invitation--into the bit of Iraq that is forbidden to him. Had he met no resistance from the Americans, who hold the key to his chains, he might have construed inaction as a cue for escape.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bill Clinton gave him no chance to make that mistake. That is why America's cruise-missile attacks this week were justified: Mr Hussein's record for trickery and brutality means he should never be given the benefit of any doubt. But while these raids were the right answer to the immediate question, it would be a mistake to imagine that they make the bigger problem of how to live with Saddam any easier.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The legal basis for the raids was shaky. Yet when it comes to dealing with a proven international menace like Mr Hussein, law may sometimes have to yield to power. Too bad, therefore, if <font size=-1>UN</font> resolutions could not honestly be cited to justify America's strikes. Anyway, Mr Hussein must have known that Mr Clinton would retaliate. He has done so before after Iraqi misdemeanours, and it was unthinkable that, only two months before a president hopes to be re-elected, he would do nothing this time.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The raids on Tuesday and Wednesday morning destroyed Mr Hussein's air defences in southern Iraq, thus clearing the way for American, British and French aircraft to patrol an extended no-fly zone, reaching almost to Baghdad's southern suburbs (see <a href="ir1.html">page</a>). This zone--which, incidentally, has never received official <font size=-1>UN</font> blessing--was first applied to northern Iraq to protect the fleeing Kurds from Mr Hussein's vengeance, later to the south to protect Shia Muslim dissidents. The rules are not Saddam-proof. But the patrolling aircraft keep an eye on things, ensuring that the dictator cannot do anything really dreadful, at least without being spotted.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Iraq's 3.2m Kurds do pretty dreadful things to each other without any help from Mr Hussein. They exist in limbo, their land is split between two warring factions and they are crudely exploited by neighbouring states. Both Turkey and, more recently, Iran have launched violent raids across the border in pursuit of their own Kurdish dissidents. The latest Iranian incursions--about which the world only tut-tutted--ended in some kind of informal (and denied) alliance between the government in Tehran and one of the factions. This led the other faction to turn to Mr Hussein. He, leaping at the chance to return to forbidden territory, sent his tanks to dislodge the first faction from Arbil, the regional capital.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the Kurds' interests are no longer being spoken of by the Americans as their central concern. Rather, the Americans are now talking about the defence of the oil-producing countries that lie south of Iraq. In retaliating against Mr Hussein, they say, their choice of target--Iraq's southern air defences--was to protect an endangered region. This raises echoes of the Gulf war. In 1990 Iraq was palpably a danger to its neighbours, gobbling up one of the richest of them. But the concerns that held the Gulf-war coalition together have faded, and Iraq is much weaker, militarily, today than it was then. Certainly, the missile raids have been tepidly, or even critically, received by America's allies: only Britain, Germany, Japan, Canada, Israel and Kuwait have backed them. The first attempts by America and Britain to get a resolution deploring Iraq's incursion through the <font size=-1>UN</font> Security Council this week met with stiff resistance from the three other permanent members, France, Russia and China, and had to be tempered.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, the other Arab oil-producers, fervently anti-Iraq in 1990 and still no friends to Mr Hussein, now tend to be more worried about the mullahs in Iran--or about their own people, angered by a superpower bashing an Arab leader. With little direct experience of elections themselves, Arabs interpret America's Middle Eastern policy in exclusively electoral terms. This, they claim, explains why America seizes the chance to be tough on Iraq while shrinking from telling Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, to accept his country's commitments towards the Palestinians. Such cynics take it for granted that no vigorous American pressure will be put on Israel until after November--if at all.

</p><p><b>Be charitable, and vigilant</b>
<br>America cannot ignore such views, even if it disagrees with them. So far, this episode has not shown the Iraqi at his most wicked. If he responds as belligerently as he promises to, that judgment may change, but in this instance he has not yet shown himself bent on some evil purpose beyond his borders. That is why the response should remain proportionate. In particular, America should not join Mr Hussein in his disregard for his people. His latest adventure has imperilled the implementation of the oil-for-food deal which could save the lives of thousands of Iraqis now dying from malnourishment and lack of medicine. The deal is on hold at least until the country is safe for the <font size=-1>UN</font> monitors who will supervise it. America has now indicated that it will block it, reviewing yet again the laboriously negotiated monitoring arrangements. It should not: the further punishment of Iraqi civilians will not put an end to Mr Hussein's rule.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the other hand, the efforts of the outside world, through the <font size=-1>UN</font>, to prevent Iraq getting biological, gas or nuclear weapons, or the means to deliver them, must remain as relentless as ever. The West long ago decided it would not, or could not, deliver Iraqis from their tormentor. It will not do so now. It must, however, ensure that he never again menaces anyone else. For though he may be no immediate threat to his neighbours today, he remains a potential threat to everyone as long as he is in power. If the world is to live with him, it must never relax its efforts to confine his tyranny to Iraq, and to minimise it even there.

<p><h2>Iraq and America</h2></p>
<p><p>
<p><b>Iraq</b> sent its army into the northern autonomous enclave at the invitation of one Kurdish faction to displace a rival faction from Arbil, the Kurdish capital. In response, the Americans launched cruise missile raids against air defences in southern Iraq, and extended the southern no-fly zone almost to the outskirts of Baghdad. Britain backed the strikes, France and Russia disapproved.
<p>After long haggling and under American and Egyptian pressure, Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, met the Palestinians' Yasser Arafat, a thing he once said he would not do. The two agreed to continue the<b> peace process</b>. But Mr Netanyahu refused to set a date for Israel's overdue redeployment of troops in Hebron.
<p>Hutu rebels attacked government garrisons in northern <b>Burundi</b> and shelled the capital, Bujumbura. They hope to bring down the government of Major Pierre Buyoya, who seized power in July.
<p>Good news from <b>South Africa</b>: Nelson Mandela and Gra&ccedil;a Machel, widow of a former president of Mozambique, are a couple; it's official. But no marriage plans yet. Bad news: Bantu Holomisa, a former deputy minister, was expelled from the <font size=-1>ANC</font> for accusing a senior party member of taking bribes.
<p><b>Zimbabwe</b>'s civil servants ended a fortnight-long strike, after the government, already driven to offer a 20% pay rise, agreed to reinstate those it had sacked.</p>
<p><h2>Chechen peace?</h2></p>
<p><p>President Yeltsin's defence adviser, <b>Alexander Lebed</b>, signed a peace deal with the separatist Chechens' guerrilla commander, Aslan Maskhadov, that postpones a final decision on the breakaway republic's constitutional status for five years. But Mr Yeltsin, who is said this week to have agreed to a heart operation, has not yet backed the deal.
<p>In the first of a series of important <b>regional elections</b> in Russia, Dmitri Ayatskov, a technocrat with no formal party affiliation, was elected chief of the region of Saratov with 80% of the vote. This was a blow for the Communists, whose presidential candidate, Gennady Zyuganov, carried the province in July.
<p><b>Bernard Tapie</b>, a colourful and controversial French businessman-cum-politician convicted of fraud, said he would give up his seat in the National Assembly, but for the time being he is hanging on to his membership of the European Parliament.
<p>The European Parliament began to examine charges that the European Commission tried to suppress investigations into links between <font size=-1>BSE</font>, or <b>mad-cow disease</b>, and a similar disease in people. In a letter leaked to a French newspaper, a top farm Eurocrat discouraged a colleague's request for an investigation, saying that "all discussions on <font size=-1>BSE</font> inevitably cause problems in the beef market."
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>Ethnic Albanians in <b>Kosovo</b>, a province of Serbia, agreed to end their six-year boycott of Serbian schools. This may pave the way for an accord on the future of the province.
<p><b>Finland's government </b>said it would cut spending by 5% in real terms next year to 191 billion markkas ($42 billion) in order to meet the criteria for joining Europe's economic and monetary union.
<p>More than 2,000 <b>unidentified corpses </b>have been found dumped in Moscow Region this year, <font size=-1>2X2</font> television reported, quoting an official.</p>
<p><h2>Ever onwards</h2></p>
<p><p>The American election campaign kicked off in earnest. <b>Bill Clinton </b>shrugged off the resignation of Dick Morris, his chief campaign strategist, over a sex scandal and, aided by his forceful actions in the Gulf, regained his 20-plus-point lead over Bob Dole.
<p><b>Colombia </b>was shaken by guerrilla attacks in which nearly 80 people died. One army post was overrun, leaving more than 30 soldiers dead and many more than that in rebel hands. The guerrillas, active for decades but not on this scale, combine claims of left-wing politics with real-world kidnapping, sabotage of oil pipelines, and drug-running.
<p>In <b>Mexico</b>, a little-heard-of new "People's Revolutionary Army" launched attacks in several states, killing more than 15 people. The Zapatist rebel movement told the newcomers to stay off its
<p>Chiapas turf, but broke off talks with the government, to prove its own revolutionary credentials.</p>
<p><h2>Identity crisis</h2></p>
<p><p>Japan and China are in dispute over eight <b>uninhabited islands</b>, called the Senkakus (in Japanese) and the Diaoyu (in Chinese). Indonesia conducted a big military exercise around its Natuna islands, where it is engaged in a $36 billion joint venture to develop natural-gas fields.
<p>Hong Kong's chief justice, Sir Ti Liang Yang, became the latest candidate for the job of <b>chief executive </b>after the British colony is returned to China next July. Separately, China agreed that its representative would shake the hand of Chris Patten, Hong Kong's last governor, at the handover ceremony in 1997. The British were relieved.
<p>Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's former prime minister, said in Beijing that <b>China </b>would suffer "political and economic costs" if it mishandled the reunification of Hong Kong or Taiwan. China should give Hong Kong dissidents "time to adjust" to the transfer of power, he said.
<p>About 13m Japanese took part in an exercise designed to limit casualties in<b> earthquakes</b>. Japan experiences a tremor nearly every day.
<p>A species of <b>pheasant</b>, thought to be extinct and last seen in 1928, has been rediscovered in Vietnam.

<p><h2>Ciao, Carlo</h2>
<p><p>After 18 years in control, <b>Carlo De Benedetti</b> quit as chairman of Olivetti after pressure from Francesco Caio, the new chief executive, and foreign shareholders underwhelmed by his efforts to turn round the Italian electronics group. Its shares leapt before being suspended after another departing executive said that first half pre-tax losses of 440.2 billion lire ($270.2m) understated the company's true financial plight.
<p>Britain's <b>General Electric</b> pacified angry institutional investors by agreeing to raise the performance targets in a &#163;1.5m ($2.3m) incentive package for George Simpson, its new managing director. <b>Procter &amp; Gamble</b> in America gave John Pepper, its chairman and chief executive for the past (very profitable) year, a package that rose 18% in fiscal 1996 to $2.12m.
<p>Potash Corp of Saskatchewan, a top producer of potash and potassium, agreed to pay $1.2 billion for Arcadian Corp, a big nitrogen producer, beating an offer by Freeport-McMoRan, a New Orleans-based mining company. The deal gives Potash the three ingredients it needs to become the world's biggest integrated producer of <b>fertilisers</b>.
<p>Alcatel Alsthom of France and General Electric of Britain are pondering a merger of their <font size=-1>GEC</font> Alsthom train-making and power-plant joint venture with Framatome, already the world's biggest maker of nuclear-power plants. A merger would create an <b>engineering giant </b>second only to <font size=-1>ABB</font> Asea Brown Boveri, and, through a share swap, take Framatome out of the hands of the French state and into private ownership.</p>
<p><h2>Shored up</h2></p>
<p><p>Deutsche Bank stepped in with &#163;200m ($311m) in cash to restore trading in three investment funds managed by its <b>Morgan Grenfell </b>subsidiary in London. Dealing in the &#163;1.4 billion funds had been halted and a fund manager suspended when Morgan Grenfell found "possible irregularities". Investigators began an inquiry. The revelation came only days after <b>Flemings</b>, an investment banking group, was fined &#163;700,000 by regulators in London and Hong Kong and ordered to pay $19.3m in compensation to investors after one of its fund managers diverted profitable trades to his personal account.
<p>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">table</a>)<br>European <b>business students </b>prefer to work for consultancies, preferably American ones, and preferably multinational.
<p>The British government approved the &#163;3.2 billion ($5 billion) recovery plan by <b>Lloyd's of London</b> in the wake of overwhelming acceptance of it by names, the insurance market's investors, to complete one of the biggest turnarounds in corporate history.
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>Consolidation among American banks continued apace with the third largest such deal. <b>NationsBank</b> agreed to pay $9.5 billion for <b>Boatmen's Bancshares</b> in a takeover that will create America's fourth-largest banking group. The combine would have
<p>assets of $230 billion and a presence in 16 states, ranging from North Carolina to the mid-west.</p>
<p><h2>Turbulent</h2></p>
<p><p>The Farnborough air show in Britain set the scene for another dash by <b>Boeing and Airbus </b>in the race to develop a super-huge commercial jet. Boeing, which plans to stretch its existing 747 to accommodate 550 or more seats at a cost of $5 billion, reckons developing a new superjet could cost $15 billion; Airbus insists its <font size=-1>A3XX</font> fly for $8 billion. New orders claimed by Boeing at the show amounted to $6.3 billion, by Airbus $3 billion.
<p><b>A&eacute;rospatiale</b> of France became the first of the four Airbus Industrie partners to declare its results from the consortium, which is planning at last to turn itself into a limited company. The French firm made an operating profit from Airbus of FFr1.08 billion ($216m) in 1995, up from FFr734m the year before. A&eacute;rospatiale itself, which declared a big loss in its other businesses in 1995, said it would be well back in profit in 1996, a year ahead of schedule.</p>
<p><h2>The Saddam effect</h2></p>
<p><p>(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>The <b>price of oil</b> jumped after the United Nations suspended the "oil for food" deal, in which Iraq was to be allowed to sell $2 billion-worth of oil to buy food and other necessities, in the wake of Iraq's attack on the Kurds.
<p>August was Russia's first
<p><b>inflation-free</b> month since the start of economic reforms in 1992. The State Statistics Committee said consumer prices fell 0.2%, mainly because of seasonally cheaper food. Monthly inflation has been falling steadily since January 1995, when it stood at 17.8%.
<p>The European Union may block imports of <b>genetically engineered corn </b>from America over worries about it damaging human and animal health. The maize is designed to be resistant to a crop pest in Europe but contains another gene which some fear could increase resistance to antibiotics in animals that eat it unprocessed.
<p>Moody's Investors Service <b>downgraded Thailand</b> because of the country's reliance on short-term foreign borrowing. Its sovereign short-term debt rating was shaved from Prime-1 to Prime-2.

<p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" width=78 height=39  alt="The Economist"></p>


<h1><center>Monopolies in cyberspace</center></h1>
<p><b>Hands off Microsoft--for now</b></p>

BILL GATES'S Microsoft is one of the world's most innovative companies, his position as the world's richest man well deserved. But any firm that dominates its market as thoroughly as Microsoft dominates software rightly arouses the suspicion of regulators. There has been hardly a week in the past five years when antitrust investigators have not been scrutinising Microsoft. Is it now time for them to act?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reason for posing the question anew arises from the difficulties of Netscape. This firm, quicker than Mr Gates to spot the potential of the Internet, has captured about 80% of the market for the "browsers" that guide users through cyberspace. Until recently its success suggested that the software industry was too fast-changing for regulators to understand, or for any one firm to dominate for long. It had once been argued that since Microsoft's Windows operating system (the program that lies between all other software and the computer itself) is installed on most of the world's <font size=-1>PC</font>s, Microsoft would enjoy an unfair advantage in selling its own application programs. But then along came the Internet, and the rules seemed to change. Now there was plenty of room--or so it seemed--for nimble upstarts such as Netscape to catch the giant of software napping.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble is that the giant has woken up. Netscape achieved its early domination by distributing its browser for free. Though the program now costs $50, its technical superiority and brand name have kept it on top. But the latest version of Microsoft's browser matches Netscape's, feature for feature. Moreover, Microsoft gives its browser away, and has promised that it will always be free: indeed, it plans to eliminate it as a stand-alone product entirely, by making it part of Windows. It is distributing the browser over the Internet, and Mr Gates has arranged deals with most big on-line services and Internet providers to use it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Microsoft will probably win this battle, even though it has less than 20% of the market today. The combination of its technical excellence, marketing deals and free distribution will probably be too much for Netscape. If the young software firm cannot find another hit-product its fortunes could plummet as quickly as they rose. So it is hardly surprising that Netscape has now cried "foul", prompting yet another antitrust investigation by America's justice department.

</p><p><b>Microsoft is to be admired, not trusted</b>
<br>Should the trustbusters clamp down? Unless Microsoft is indeed guilty of some of the outright dirty tricks Netscape has accused it of, the answer on balance is no.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It will be a shame to see an innovator such as Netscape go under, if that is what happens, but the job of a trustbuster is not to keep alive plucky firms. It is to protect consumers by ensuring that a market remains competitive enough to spur innovation and keep prices in check.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For now, the software market still passes these tests. It remains relatively easy for new firms to barge into the market, as Netscape itself proved when it grabbed almost all the browser market within a year of its founding. Keen programmers are still coming from nowhere with world-beating programs and growing rich on them. And although a company such as Microsoft possesses huge advantages in marketing and distribution, the Internet has probably made the job of new entrants easier. Word on hot new products spreads quickly in cyberspace, and, if they wish to, technically proficient consumers can download software directly from the Internet into their computers. Another reason for confidence is that Microsoft keeps its operating system "open", making public the codes that enable competitors' applications to run smoothly on Windows.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What, though, if Microsoft chose to abandon this policy? And what about the complaint that Microsoft is, in effect, "dumping" its browser to put its competitor out of business? These are scarier questions. With $7 billion in the bank and ownership of the operating system, Microsoft could probably conquer practically any market if it wanted to badly enough. The justice department needs to intervene the moment it seems that Microsoft's formidable market power is threatening the interests of consumers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is, of course, easier to preach vigilance than to tell regulators how to recognise that moment when it comes. In the browser war, it is market power that threatens to clinch things for Microsoft: the deadliness of its product is not that it is better than Netscape's but that it is free. On the other hand, Microsoft is not yet in a position to foist an inferior or pricier product on consumers without a competitor popping up.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The worry is that this could swiftly change once more of Mr Gates's rivals have disappeared. Microsoft has already picked off rival after rival by making previously stand-alone software products into part-and-parcel of its operating system. Until now, the consumer has not visibly suffered. Just possibly, the simplicity of buying a seamless do-everything operating system from a monopolist is anyway worth more to consumers than they would gain if regulators were, say, to split Microsoft into a maker of operating systems and a maker of applications. But that sort of monopoly would need to be regulated on price. Those who thought the moral of Netscape's rise was that innovation can beat Microsoft can scarcely ignore the moral of the smaller firm's present peril.

<h1>Smashing the lock</h1>


<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><P>

FEW Americans can hate Saddam Hussein more than poor Bob Dole. By inviting American air strikes, Iraq's dictator gave President Clinton a chance to look resolute, and to dispel the idea that a Democrat cannot be trusted with military affairs. On the evening of September 3rd, after Mr Clinton had unleashed the first mini-storm of missiles on Iraq's air defences, an <font size=-1>ABC</font> News poll found that nearly eight in ten Americans approved of the president's action; and that, if it came to full-scale war with Iraq, a majority would choose Mr Clinton to lead it in preference to Mr Dole.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This capped a run of awful news for the Republicans. After their convention in San Diego, the Dole team had been buoyed by polls showing that the gap between their candidate and the president had halved to ten points. Their spirits held up through the Democratic convention. On the last day Mr Clinton gave a disappointing, laundry-list speech; and a sex scandal forced the president's Svengali, Dick Morris, to resign. But, on September 3rd, two new polls put the president's lead back at 21 points (see <a href="am1.gif">map</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The more closely Mr Dole examines his predicament, the more hopeless he must feel. A candidate's usual strategy is to focus attention on issues that put him in a better light than his opponent. In Mr Dole's case there are precious few of these. On education and family values, on Medicare and the economy, and even on traditionally Republican strongpoints like crime, taxes and the budget deficit, voters trust Mr Clinton more than Mr Dole, according to polls conducted by Gallup. The Iraqi crisis seems to have robbed Mr Dole of the defence issue, as also of the charge that Mr Clinton tends to avoid a fight. Each new set of encouraging economic figures blunts the appeal of Mr Dole's promise of tax cuts and regulatory reform.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The president's only point of vulnerability is "character". Asked which of the candidates has a higher moral character, voters prefer Mr Dole by a margin of 26 points. But it is peculiarly difficult for the Republicans to turn this fact to their advantage. If Mr Dole seeks to shift attention to Mr Clinton's personal failings, he will be accused of dirty campaigning; and this accusation may sully his own character in the public's eyes. Focus groups show that undecided voters--the ones who determine the outcome of elections--are especially turned off by <i>ad hominem </i>campaigning. It is as though Mr Dole holds a trump that he is not allowed to play.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are still two months to go, time enough for voters to change their minds several times. The televised debates are unlikely to help the tongue-tied Mr Dole. But other things may, notably a set-back for the president's foreign policy in Bosnia or Iraq, or progress (of which, inevitably, there are rumours) towards indicting Hillary Clinton for her alleged role in the Whitewater affair. Yet, barring calamity, the president's lead looks unassailable. He won the election in 1992 with 43% of the vote; this time round, polls predict he will get about 55%. Meanwhile polls give Mr Dole 35% or so; in this century, the lowest winning percentage of the popular vote was Woodrow Wilson's 42% in 1912.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Translated into electoral-college votes, Mr Clinton's lead looks devastating. The map below compiles the latest polls from each state. Some date from before the conventions, so should be treated cautiously; but, given Mr Clinton's continuing lead in national polls, they probably give a fair idea of the voters' mood. Taken together, the state polls (excluding Texas, West Virginia and Vermont) suggest that Mr Clinton would win 417 electoral college votes, compared with 81 for Mr Dole. This would represent more than a resounding victory. It would bury the Republican claim to a "lock" over the electoral college.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This lock is said to consist of the states listed in the tables that accompany the map. The 12 states in the first table have voted for the Republican candidate in all seven presidential contests since 1968. The 12 in the second have done so six out of seven times. Altogether, the 24 states in the lock are worth 238 electoral college votes--just 32 short of the total needed for victory. Given this powerful base, Republican candidates have been able to concentrate their time and advertising dollars on a few swing states: usually the industrial centres around the Great Lakes (Michigan, Illinois and Ohio) and in the north-east (New Jersey, Pennsylvania).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Dole team still talks as if the election will be decided on this traditional battle-ground. The truth is that Mr Dole may be pressed to hold the states in his own base. Of the 24 "lock" states, four are leaning strongly to Mr Clinton, and nine are leaning slightly towards him. And the biggest states are among the likeliest defectors. The 13 in which Mr Clinton now leads account for 176 electoral-college votes, a bit more than two-thirds of the total in the lock.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The biggest defector is California, where the latest poll gives Mr Clinton a lead of ten points (even though it was taken at the same time as the Republicans were holding their convention in San Diego). In 1992 a big Clinton lead in California persuaded George Bush to pull out of the state several weeks before the election. For the moment, Mr Dole vows not to do this, partly in order to force his rival to devote resources to California, and partly in order to help his party's congressional prospects there. He is betting that a part-Californian running mate, together with ruthless views on civil rights and immigration, will shake the president's lead. If it does not, Mr Dole may at some point decide that California is unwinnable, and concede the state's 54 electoral-college votes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Dole is also under threat in Florida, which is worth 25 electoral votes, and which narrowly tipped to Mr Bush in 1992. No poll has been taken in Florida since late June, when Mr Clinton had a lead of two points; another poll conducted a fortnight earlier had the president 13 points ahead. In his convention speech, Mr Clinton went out of his way to attract Florida voters, promising to conserve the precious Everglades, to stand up to Fidel Castro, and to protect the Medicare programme beloved of Florida's many pensioners. On September 5th-6th, hurricanes permitting, he was due to campaign in the state.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton will also have a go at North Carolina, part of the Republicans' supposed southern stronghold, and at Arizona, which has not voted Democratic since 1948. If Mr Clinton succeeds, and the Republican lock is smashed convincingly, you will see some acrobatic punditry. Just two years ago, after the Republican victory in the mid-term elections, there was talk of a historic realignment in the opposite direction: the Democrats' grip on both chambers of Congress had been broken for the first time in 42 years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What to make of this confusing mix of realignments? It may be that controlling Congress makes it harder to win the presidency. Americans dislike handing too much power to either party, so they tend to entrust each with Congress or the White House but not both. In 1994 they put Republicans in charge of Congress in order to check Mr Clinton's expansive view of government. In 1996 they seem set to put Mr Clinton in the White House in order to check the Republican government-cutters who run Congress.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or, alternatively, it may be that all theories of realignment are empty--or that, in the expression used by Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia, "dealignment" is the real trend. He reckons that, in the 1960s, 75% of Americans felt some kind of party allegiance; today, as few as 60% do. As a result, voters are more fickle, and electoral "locks" are outdated. It is no longer just a belt of industrial America that determines elections. Most of the country can swing.

<h1>Trends of the week</h1>

<p>
<b>Resilience: </b>Bill Clinton, boosted by a triumphant train trip, the Democratic convention and a quick bus tour with Al Gore, has restored his lead over Bob Dole to some 20-plus points.<p>
<b>September Surprise</b>: Saddam Hussein.<p>
<b>Word:</b> Bridge. Mr Clinton wants to build a bridge to the 21st century. Mr Dole calls it a toll bridge ("You gotta pay").<p>
<b>Coincidence: </b>The Clinton/Gore post-convention bus tour began in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, the birthplace of America's best-known Clinton-basher, talk-show host Rush Limbaugh.<p>
<b>Pain in the neck:</b> The White House disclosed that the presidential neck had a benign cyst, which was removed on September 4th. Mr Dole has cheekily been calling for full disclosure of Mr Clinton's medical records.<p>
<b>Local heroics: </b>Mr Dole wants to scrap the Energy Department to help pay for his proposed tax cut, but in Albuquerque he pledged to keep New Mexico's two national laboratories (10% of the department's budget). Mr Dole also campaigned hard in Utah, one of only three states that solidly support him.<p>
<b>Debate: </b>Whether Ross Perot should be included in the three planned presidential debates, starting on September 25th. It would suit Mr Clinton to have him in, and Mr Dole to have him out.<p>
<b>Ads:</b> Mr Perot began airing a half-hour <b>"</b>infomercial<b>"</b> called <b>"</b>Results, Not Free Candy<b>"</b> (paid for from the $30m in federal funds that the billionaire-candidate has decided to accept). The Clinton and Dole campaigns traded blows in ads on rising drug abuse.<p>
<b>Quote:</b> Mr Dole, in a <i>New York Times </i>interview: "We're going to compete for every vote...Jack Kemp is certainly reaching out to black communities. I've tried to over the years. Hispanics. So I'm very optimistic. I feel good. I'm confident. Sleep good. Work hard. I mean, I like to work. I like to campaign. I like people. I was out there the other night with flashlights..."<p>
<b>Ladbroke's odds:</b> Clinton 1-6; Dole 7-2; Perot 50-1.<p>
<b>Forbearance:</b> Eileen McGann, whose husband Dick Morris resigned as chief Clinton strategist because of a sex scandal: "I'm an adult. I accepted Dick's apology."<p>
<b>Sex fad: </b>Triangulation.

<h1>The Washington Wobbler v The Baghdad Bruiser</h1>

<p>AH, SADDAM. There is nothing quite like that infamous face, and the evocative accompaniment of Peter Arnett once again sending reports from Baghdad on <font size=-1>CNN</font>, to rally Americans and inspire them with a sense of foreign-policy purpose. It is the face of The Enemy. Since the collapse of communism, America has suffered from a shortage of compelling enemies--except in the fantasy world of this summer's blockbuster movie, "Independence Day", which invented a super-enemy from outer space. As a result, the country's foreign policy has tended to appear adrift. Threats to American interests have often seemed distant (as in Bosnia) or faceless (as the possible bombers of <font size=-1>TWA</font> flight 800 remain). Saddam Hussein lends American policy a wondrous clarity and unity.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At least for a few days. Then things get trickier. As you might expect from such a wily operator, the Iraqi dictator has picked the moment for his provocation carefully. For a number of reasons, America faces peculiar difficulties in calibrating its response.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One reason is presidential politics, with the election just two months away. Whether or not this weighs in Bill Clinton's calculations (perish the thought), his task is complicated by the suspicion of others, including America's allies, that it must. The president's plans for missile attacks on Iraq were laid between stops on his campaign bus tour. And his decisions have certainly done his re-election prospects no harm.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Early polls showed Americans to be overwhelmingly in favour of the missile strikes against Iraq ordered by Mr Clinton. Out of the news went the unsavoury story of Dick Morris, Mr Clinton's master-strategist who resigned after tabloid reports of his foolish affair with a prostitute, and in came images of the president acting as commander-in-chief. Criticism of Mr Clinton by his Republican rival, Bob Dole, for allowing the crisis to brew turned to patriotic expressions of solidarity once the military response was launched.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Dole is in any case on shaky ground when it comes to tough-minded advice on the handling of Mr Hussein. Mr Dole, remember, led an appeasing mission of senators who in 1990 met Mr Hussein in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul shortly before the invasion of Kuwait. Kansas was a big grain exporter to Iraq. They delivered a tough letter from George Bush but, according to the Iraqi transcript of the meeting, the then senior senator from Kansas and Senate minority leader told the Iraqi leader that a Voice of America journalist responsible for a broadcast that had caused particular offence to Mr Hussein had been sacked.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But what if the tension in the Gulf refuses to die down and, worse, claims casualties among the American air forces patrolling the now-enlarged no-fly zone over southern Iraq? That would surely aggravate divisions over the appropriate response to Mr Hussein--divisions which pose the second complication for Mr Clinton. Because Mr Hussein's military move came within Iraq's own borders, and in response to a request from one Kurdish faction fighting against another, the case for punitive reprisals looks to some less than black-and-white. Some of America's own allies, notably France, expressed public misgivings about the American riposte. The qualms of others--Turkey, Saudi Arabia--ruled out attacks on Iraq from their territory and so limited Mr Clinton's military options.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is far from obvious that the president could command adequate support for an escalation of his actions against Mr Hussein, if that is what he wanted to do. Opposition would come not only from abroad, but at home. A report published on August 29th by the Cato Institute, a libertarian Washington think-tank, argued that America should withdraw its troops from the Gulf because it has "no interests to justify the risks and costs" of attempting to manage security there.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact, America does have big security interests in the Gulf. It has interests in the supply of oil, in the stability of a volatile region, and in the protection of allies from the ruthless aggression of Mr Hussein, the would-be regional hegemon. The trouble is, until this week the Clinton administration has not spent much effort reminding anyone of those interests.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Which points to the third, and deepest, complication exposed by Mr Hussein: the failure of Mr Clinton to develop a clear set of foreign-policy priorities. In the absence of the Soviet threat, Mr Clinton can list a series of lesser post-cold-war threats, such as terrorism and weapons proliferation. But he has given little sense that he has in his mind a hierarchy of American interests or any workable principles by which to judge what he would do to defend them. Instead, Mr Clinton has opted for ad-hocery. This landed him in early trouble (over Bosnia, for example) but later produced some tentative successes (Bosnia again). On balance, there has been enough for Mr Clinton to brag about, but not enough for him to inspire confidence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;You might think that in such circumstances foreign policy would be right in the thick of this year's election campaign, with Mr Dole itching to attack a Clintonian weakness. But no. Foreign policy featured only briefly at both the Republican and Democratic conventions last month. After his laundry list of domestic policies in his acceptance speech in Chicago, Mr Clinton turned to Abroad almost as an afterthought. As for Mr Dole, he told the <i>New York Times </i>this week that his main message was about the economy, drugs, the budget, education; he would add "some foreign policy, some more trade, other things as they come up."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Saddam Hussein has now come up, in a big way. Whatever else Mr Hussein achieves, he has suddenly placed foreign policy where it should have been all along in an American election campaign: at its heart. It was not so long ago that an American president came to power believing, admittedly a tad simplistically, that dealing with the world was the principal job he had been elected to do. "All you need is a competent cabinet to run the country at home," said Richard Nixon. "You need a president for foreign policy."

<h1>Provocation and response</h1>

<p>SADDAM HUSSEIN'S neighbours, it appears, can now sleep more securely in their beds. That, say the Americans, as well as punishing Mr Hussein for sending his army, by invitation of one Kurdish faction, into the Kurdish area of northern Iraq, was the aim of their missile attacks on Iraq's southern air-defence network this week.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The attacks made it possible, and reasonably safe, to extend the ban on Iraqi aircraft flying in Iraqi air space. The southern no-fly zone has been stretched by 110km (70 miles) up to the 33rd parallel, almost the outskirts of Baghdad (see <a href="ir1.gif">map</a>). The zones were originally set, by the victors of the Gulf war, to help protect Mr Hussein's rebellious subjects from his vengeance. Maybe they help the neighbours too. But these, Kuwait apart, are yet to show their gratitude. America's action has split the coalition.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The strikes came early on September 3rd, with a follow-up 24 hours later. Most of the cruise missiles were launched from warships in the Gulf, others from bombers based in the Pacific, but refuelling in the air over Diego Garcia (owned by Britain, one of the few unquestioning allies). On September 4th, American and British, but not French, aircraft began patrolling up to the new limit; on one flight an American fighter fired a missile at an Iraqi radar tracking it. The huge banned area, over half of Iraq, includes a couple of air bases where the planes have either been moved north or are presumably grounded.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or are they? Mr Hussein responded to the raids with predictable belligerence. He ordered the "falcons" of his air force (which seems to be in even worse shape than the rest of his demoralised war machine, with about half of its 300 or so remaining combat aircraft grounded through lack of spares) to treat the no-fly limits as "non-existent." What if his pilots obey, and manage to shoot down a patrolling aircraft? For the Americans, said a diplomat, that would be "a make-my-day kind of thing" .
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Saudi Arabia, the Americans' launch pad and ally in the Gulf war, has been notably quiet this time. Iran, wrote a London-based Saudi weekly, is now a bigger menace than Iraq. Kuwait, Iraq's victim in 1990, cheered the Americans on. But the sum of Arab comment is that the strikes will not make much difference--except, maybe, to Mr Clinton's hopes of re-election. America's western allies are less openly cynical. But France and Russia alike stalled an early British and American bid to get the <font size=-1>UN</font> Security Council to deplore Iraq's action against the Kurds. America's response, said Russia, was inappropriate.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not unprovoked, though. On August 31st Mr Hussein sent 30,000 Iraqi troops and 400 tanks to help the Kurdistan Democratic Party (<font size=-1>KDP</font>), led by Massoud Barzani, displace the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (<font size=-1>PUK</font>), led by Jalal Talabani, from Arbil, the regional capital of the Kurdish enclave. The two factions, enemies for decades and at each other's throats for the past 18 months, use and are used by Iran and Turkey, as those two governments hunt their own Kurdish dissidents across the border in Iraq. Mr Talabani, said his rival, had ganged up with Iran; hence Mr Barzani's own plea for help to the army of Iraq.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Iraqi troops left Arbil as soon as the <font size=-1>KDP</font> had taken over from the <font size=-1>PUK</font>. And then? It depends whom you believe. The losers talk of mass executions and Iraqi security men staying on in civilian clothes; the <font size=-1>KDP</font> says fewer than 200 fighters were killed and no civilians. Inviting the Iraqi army in seems a desperate move--and a despicable one, to many Kurds--given Mr Hussein's record: he slaughtered thousands of Kurds in 1988, gassing villagers and destroying villages. But neither Iran, Turkey nor Iraq will give the Kurds independence. So, at some point Iraq's Kurds will have to seek a deal with its government--which could still be led by Mr Hussein.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Did the incursion break any <font size=-1>UN</font> or other rule? Probably not. The Americans quote Security Council Resolution 688, passed in April 1991, which tells Iraq to end its repression of the Kurds. Repression, Mr Hussein could say: my (momentarily) good friend Barzani asked us in. More awkward for the Americans, the resolution does not empower any <font size=-1>UN</font> member to enforce it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But that anyway is debating-chamber stuff. Real-world reactions to the affair will depend, as ever, on governments' view of their national interests. One consequence could be a grave threat to the deal under which Iraq was to be allowed to sell $2 billion-worth of oil over a six-month period to buy food and medicine. After five years of stalemate--due mostly to the Iraqis, then, for a much shorter period, the Americans--the strict monitoring arrangements had been negotiated and sales were due to start this month. Now they will be delayed, certainly until Iraq is deemed safe for the <font size=-1>UN</font> monitors, possibly longer, if delay is used as a form of economic punishment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Americans say it will be some time before they look again at the plan. But a long delay would hurt, probably kill, many ordinary, poor Iraqis. It might have a less obvious consequence. The <font size=-1>UN</font> agency that monitors the destruction of Iraq's nastiest weapons was to be paid from the oil sales. Without them, it will be broke.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a>

<p><b>Scottish politics</b></p>
<h1>A vote too far</h1>

<font size=1>EDINBURGH</font>
<p>POP into the Edinburgh offices of either the Scottish National Party (<font size=-1>SNP</font>) or the Scottish Conservative Party just now, and you find the same thing--cheery people brimming with optimism. This good humour is at odds with the political standing of both parties. The <font size=-1>SNP</font> has little hope of winning more than the four parliamentary seats it has now, while the Tories' opinion-poll ratings in Scotland remain stuck at little more than half the 26% share of the vote they won at the last election.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the reason for the jolliness is not hard to find. It is the dreadful hash that Labour is making of its plans for a devolved Scottish parliament. What Labour proposes--an elected parliament to run Scottish domestic affairs with limited taxation powers--is clear. It is how this will be established which is causing the merriment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In June, Tony Blair announced that there would be pre-legislative referendums in Scotland and Wales. These, he argued, would dispel doubts about whether voters wanted devolution and would help speed the necessary bills through Westminster. To counter the Tories' damaging campaign that the Edinburgh parliament would levy a "tartan tax" on Scots, he declared that the Scottish referendum would have a second question solely on the taxation powers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This seemed like a bright idea. But left-wingers and nationalist-minded members of his Scottish party were enraged. They reckoned that Scots would vote for a parliament but against being taxed by it, and that this would severely weaken the scheme. They also resented not being consulted before the announcement.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Blair and his Scottish spokesman, George Robertson, were unable to quell this rebellion despite much arm-twisting. At a meeting of Labour's Scottish Executive Committee on August 31st, after two hours of dead-locked discussion, Mr Robertson accepted an idea that a further referendum authorising a decision by the Scottish parliament to use the taxation powers would make it more likely that yes-votes could be secured to both questions in the first referendum. This two-legged, three-humped camel of a plan then squeaked through the committee by 21 votes to 18.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although Mr Blair thus avoided an embarrassing defeat by Labour's Scottish executive, he now has a worse headache. The <font size=-1>SNP</font> was quick to point out that getting independence only needs two votes (for them in the election and in a subsequent referendum on an independence settlement) whereas getting Labour's full plan for devolution needs five votes (for a Labour government, in the first two-vote referendum, for a Scottish parliament, and then in the second referendum).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>SNP</font> thinks that voters will never understand this; and the party loudly proclaims that Labour is abandoning its Scottish parliament plan. Editorials in the main pro-devolution Scottish newspapers, the <i>Herald</i> and the <i>Scotsman</i>, which have so far loyally backed Labour, also interpret the referendum manoeuvring as evidence that Mr Blair wants to ditch devolution.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is unlikely. He has already staked too much on it. Nevertheless Labour has given its opponents potent ammunition. On September 3rd, an obviously delighted John Major mocked Labour's latest plans as a "steeplechase of stupidities" in a speech to Scottish businessmen. As it is, Labour's divisive wranglings have cost it Scottish support already. An opinion poll published in the <i>Herald</i> on September 2nd showed that, compared with the previous month, Labour support had fallen by three points to 48%, while the <font size=-1>SNP</font> was up six points to 29% and the Tories were steady at 15%. Mr Blair is due to visit Scotland on September 9th to explain himself. He has a lot of fast talking to do.

<h1>Through the roof</h1>


THERE is now no doubt that house prices are rising steadily. Unlike last year, the pick-up in prices during the spring has continued throughout the summer (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>). According to figures published by the Halifax, a building society, on September 2nd, average house prices rose by 0.5% during August, to 5.7% higher than a year earlier. This is good for people wanting to sell their homes, particularly those who have been unable to do so because of "negative equity" (the value of their mortgage exceeding the value of their property). It is less good for buyers, although if higher prices tempt more people to consider selling their homes, there might be greater choice.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now that prices are rising, how much further will they go? Partly this depends on supply. Anecdotal reports suggest that for many owners prices are still too low for them to sell and, in particular, that there is a shortage of high-quality properties. That suggests that, if demand increases strongly, so might prices.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some economists claim that demand is hard to predict because average incomes are no longer a good indicator: in the 1990s, average incomes have risen steadily while the housing market has slumped. But according to Nigel Pain and Peter Westaway, two economists at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, housing demand reflects not current income but rather how confident people are about their future income. A good proxy for this is consumer spending, which is now soaring. Mortgage-interest rates are at their lowest for decades. Lenders are keen to lend--the average ratio of loan to house price for first-time buyers is 90%, higher even than in the 1980s. As a result, say Messrs Pain and Westaway, prices could rise by as much as 10% in 1997.

<p><b>Northern Ireland</b></p>
<h1>The soul of Ulster</h1>


<font size=1>BELFAST</font>

<p>WHEN Northern Ireland's political parties resume talks on September 9th, attention may no longer be focused on the exclusion of Sinn Fein, the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s political wing. Instead, the spectacle of unionists falling out with each other will be impossible to ignore.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the top of the agenda will be what to do about the fringe political parties--the Progressive Unionists and the Ulster Democrats--which speak for loyalist paramilitary groups. The ultimatum by the "Combined Loyalist Military Command" to leave Ulster or face "summary justice" delivered to Billy Wright and Alec Kerr, two hardline loyalists, has divided unionist politicians and left them in a quandary.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Loyalist leaders are fed up with Mr Wright in particular, who they cannot control and who has made no secret of the fact that he wants the loyalists to call off their own ceasefire. Worse for the loyalist leadership, Mr Wright brushed aside their deadline--midnight of August 31st--and held a series of media interviews in which he declared his determination to stay. As <i>The Economist</i> went to press, Mr Wright was still alive, and still granting interviews.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This has left unionist leaders in the awkward position of condemning a death threat against a man who wants to resume violence. Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party has demanded the explusion of the two loyalist parties from the talks, on the obvious grounds that their refusal to repudiate the threat to Mr Wright and Mr Kerr violates their commitment to the exclusively democratic means enshrined in the "Mitchell principles" which are supposed to be the basis for participation (and for Sinn Fein's exclusion because of the absence of an <font size=-1>IRA</font> ceasefire).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, has been more ambivalent. He held secret talks with Mr Wright during the stand-off between police and Orange Order marchers at Drumcree in June. Now he is offering to mediate between loyalist leaders and Mr Wright. Meanwhile none of the other parties at the talks, including the nationalist <font size=-1>SDLP</font>, wants the loyalist parties to be expelled. This is because they assume that this would lead directly to an ending of the loyalist ceasefire.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps it is not surprising that a squabble between the killers in their midst has divided unionists. Nationalists have frequently been divided by the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s violence, and a feud between warring factions of <font size=-1>INLA</font>, a republican splinter group, claimed a life this week. But unionist politicians are also about to face a rebellion from an unexpected quarter: Protestant businessmen.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In "Agenda", a <font size=-1>BBC</font> Radio Four documentary to be broadcast on September 7th, Bill Tosh, chairman of the Confederation of British Industry in Northern Ireland, says that business organisations will be asking for a place alongside the political parties when the talks convene next week. If that does not work, Mr Tosh says businessmen are ready to become even more directly involved in forging a political settlement and then making it work. "We want to get our hands on the problem and help with its resolution. And if it has to be through an appointed body to include ourselves, so be it."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This sounds like an outright challenge to unionist politicians. Many Protestant businessmen are keen to do more business with counterparts in the Irish Republic, which has the fastest growing economy in the European Union, and impatient with the lack of progress towards a political settlement. To unionist politicians this smacks of putting profit before principle. To outsiders it might sound more like the pragmatism and willingness to compromise which Northern Irleand has sorely needed for so long.

<p><b>Traffic</b></p>
<h1>Not bothered</h1>


<p>TWO years ago the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution published a 300-page report arguing that traffic growth was unsustainable and that vehicle exhausts were causing 10,000 deaths annually. Since then its detailed recommendations for restraining car use have not elicited any kind of formal response from the government--an unprecedented snub for a Royal Commission. Ministers have not even bothered to reject its recommendations publicly.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This has so angered the commission's members, who include some of the nation's top scientists, that they have decided to try again, determined this time that what they say will not be ignored by the next government. Sir John Houghton, the commission's chairman and a former chief executive of the Meteorological Office, will announce next week that the commission is to launch a further study into traffic growth. It is very unusual for a Royal Commission to revisit a subject on which it has just reported. But sources close to the commission stress that, if difficult decisions on restraining car use are not made, the consequences for the environment and the nation's health could be terrible.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The new study, which is deliberately timed to be published after the general election, will be designed to force the next government, be it Labour, Conservative or coalition, to face these hard choices. The commission's first report recommended increasing duties on petrol and diesel twice as fast as the 5% rate adopted by the government, thus doubling the price of fuel by 2000; halving spending on new motorways and trunk roads; and setting ambitious targets for increasing the use of public transport and shifting heavy freight loads from road to rail.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These recommendations proved anathema to Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, and Michael Heseltine, then president of the Board of Trade. They privately criticised the commission for having failed to quantify the cost of its proposals and their impact on business competitiveness. Brian Mawhinney, the then transport secretary, was predictably hostile: the commission alleged that his department was in the pocket of the road lobby. Even John Gummer, the environment secretary, distanced himself from the recommendations, claiming that increasing fuel duties would not have much impact on drivers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With few friends in the cabinet, the report had a cool reception in Whitehall. "It's all very difficult," one senior civil servant muttered. The only official response to the commission's recommendations was oblique references in the government's transport green paper, published earlier this year, which seemed to dismiss the commission's proposals for setting targets.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although the report has been officially cold-shouldered, its views have not been without influence, even within government. The building of new motorways and trunk roads has been severely reduced, rail fares have been pegged in real terms, and the call for a national strategy on air quality has been endorsed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is not surprising, in the run-up to a general election, that ministers have shied away from more radical proposals. Yet the issues raised by the commission's first report will not go away. Despite attempts by the government to massage the numbers, traffic is forecast to more than double by 2025. The current road system cannot sustain anything like that growth without traffic, eventually, grinding to a halt.

<p><b>Criminal Justice</b></p>
<h1>Racial bias</h1>


<p>ASK a group of youths on the streets of Brixton in south London what they think of the criminal-justice system, and you will get an earful. The almost universal opinion of young blacks that British justice is biased against them is hardly surprising given the current rates of imprisonment. New research findings to be published later this year show that young black males (Afro-Caribbeans and black Africans) are 12 times more likely to be imprisoned for rape, robbery and drug offences than young white males (see <a href="br2.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Are young blacks singled out for special treatment by the police and the courts or do they offend more often? Perhaps both. The author of the study, David Smith, professor of criminology at Edinburgh University, argues that young blacks do commit a disproportionately large number of crimes. And yet even Mr Smith admits that racial discrimination exists in many parts of the criminal-justice system. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is that discrimination which was the subject of a report published on September 2nd by the Penal Affairs Consortium, an alliance of 31 penal-reform organisations. The report argues that part of the reason why ethnic-minority groups as a whole, not just blacks, are heavily over-represented in the prison population (18% compared with 5.5% of the general population) is that there is discrimination at every stage of the criminal-justice system.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The study notes that black males are significantly more likely to be stopped and searched by the police than are white males. More than a third of those stopped and searched by police in Greater London in 1994-95 belonged to minority groups. Similarly, a review of seven police forces found that young blacks were less likely to be cautioned and more likely to be prosecuted and remanded in custody than comparable white offenders. It is significant that the sharpest discrepancies in imprisonment rates tend to be for those crimes such as drug possession where the police have most discretion about whether or not to prosecute. In crimes where there is less room for discretion, such as burglary, imprisonment rates vary less.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once on remand, black offenders were more likely to receive a jail sentence. A 1992 study into race and sentencing by Roger Hood, director of the Oxford Centre for Criminological Research, found that overall, black males were 17% more likely to receive a prison sentence than white males. Even after controlling for 15 key variables, such as the seriousness of the offence, the study found that blacks had a 5-8% greater chance of being sent to prison.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The extent of racial discrimination within the system has become much clearer since the 1991 Criminal Justice Act required racial monitoring by the police, the probation service and the courts. Even less in dispute is the fact that ethnic minorities are seriously under-represented in the staff of criminal-justice agencies. A report published this month by the National Association of Probation Officers found that only five out of the 514 circuit judges were from minority ethnic groups, two of the 339 district judges and 13 out of 897 recorders. And, despite a decade of attempting to recruit more minority policemen and women, their numbers remain tiny. In September 1995, 2,223, or just 1.75%, of the 127,222 police officers in England and Wales came from minority groups.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Little wonder that the view on the streets of Brixton is one of suspicion and distrust. In fact, this breakdown in confidence is itself one reason why young blacks fare so badly in the criminal-justice system. Young blacks are much less likely to admit an offence when questioned by the police, which means they cannot be cautioned and are thus more likely to be prosecuted. Similarly their tendency to plead not guilty in court, even if the evidence is overwhelming, frequently results in harsher sentences.

<p><b>Sun Microsystems</b></p>
<h1>Collateral damage</h1>

<p>AS THE shells fly in the battle between Microsoft and Netscape for the web browser market, one company flinches more than most each time Netscape takes a direct hit. Since the upstart Netscape first grabbed the lead in the Internet's largest software market less than two years ago, Sun Microsystems has been its most partisan supporter. Together, the pair have whipped up wild enthusiasm for Sun's new programming language, Java, that could challenge Microsoft's overall dominance of the software industry. What happens to Sun if Microsoft wins?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the face of it, the question might seem premature. Microsoft, after all, still has less than 20% of the browser market. But Microsoft's war machine has never run more impressively than it has in browsers. In less than a year, Microsoft has matched Netscape's software technically, signed up all the biggest Internet service firms to distribute its browser, and is giving its program away for free while Netscape charges $50 for its own. If current trends continue, Microsoft may have passed Netscape in the market by the second half of next year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That would be dark news indeed for Netscape, and would not make Sun shine either. Netscape has been Sun's strongest supporter in pushing Java. Although Sun first introduced Java early last year, few Internet surfers could use it until Netscape included it with a new version of its browser earlier this year. Netscape has also promoted the idea that its browser, along with Java, could in effect replace Microsoft's Windows operating system as the main way people and software interact with their <font size=-1>PC</font>. It talks of using Java in the coming wave of low-price "network computers".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Little surprise, then, that Sun wants Netscape to win. But it is not directly threatened by the prospect of a Microsoft victory, for two reasons. The first is that Java is close to establishing itself. With or without Netscape, hundreds of software firms are developing Java programs and have a vested interest in seeing them find a market. Microsoft would prefer developers to switch to ActiveX, its own Java-compatible Internet language, but it knows that its browser must be able to run Java too.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second reason is that, as much as Sun's reputation has been burnished by Java over the past year, direct revenues from the language are minimal. Nearly three-quarters of its $7 billion in sales for the year that ended in July came from workstations and servers--powerful machines running the <font size=-1>UNIX</font> operating system that are used on the desktop by engineers and to run networks and Web sites.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The hitch is that the server market no longer looks the redoubt for Sun that it once was. High-end <font size=-1>PC</font>s running Microsoft's Windows <font size=-1>NT</font> software are almost as powerful and cheaper than <font size=-1>UNIX</font> workstations: they have been gaining ground (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>). True, Sun's machines are powering ahead in the new market for Internet servers (though that is the area where what the company calls the "halo effect" from Java may matter most). All the same, it is clear that in the medium term Sun will need to discover a new market, outside the <font size=-1>PC</font>'s shadow. And this is where Java could matter greatly.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the competition in high-end computing increases, Sun wants to open another front, at the other end of the market: software for cheap and simple consumer devices, from mobile telephones to television set-top boxes, that connect to the Internet. Java was originally intended to be a language for set-top boxes and "embedded controllers" in electrical appliances and industrial equipment, but was quickly adapted for the Internet when the growth of the network exploded in 1994. Now Sun is returning to its original strategy. Along with Navio Communications, a new Netscape spin-off, it is working on ways to use Java and browsers with gadgets that most people do not think of as computers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sun is even developing its own processor chips expressly designed to run Java quickly on such machines. It reckons that such chips could make up half of the processor and controller market by 2000, bringing Sun $15 billion a year, as much as all its other businesses combined. This claim is questionable--manufacturers may be reluctant to let Sun create a hardware and software monopoly in small devices to match Microsoft's and Intel's lock on the <font size=-1>PC</font>--but it seems inevitable that telephones and other devices will become smarter.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The question is what will fire them: Java or something else? Microsoft, naturally enough, has its own plans for that market. It tried and failed to shoehorn chubby Windows code into telephones and fax machines. Now it is coming back with a slimmer version. It is too early to know how that will fare compared with Java. But it seems inevitable that the victor of the Internet wars will influence the winner in this potentially bigger market below the <font size=-1>PC</font>. Java has the lead at the moment. But if Microsoft captures the browser market, this is where it will surely try to use its clout next.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a>

<p><b>American banking</b></p>
<h1>Send in the marine</h1>

<p>WHAT ever happened to the urge to merge which characterised American banking last year? Hugh McColl, long the chairman of NationsBank, based in North Carolina, recently averred that big mergers were an "old paradigm". Banks should concentrate on the needs of their own customers. But Mr McColl, an ex-marine of aggressive mien and acquisitive habits, knows when to ignore his own advice. On August 30th NationsBank said that it would pay $9 billion for Boatmen's Bancshares, a smaller rival based in Missouri with assets of $41 billion.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;NationsBank thus becomes America's fourth-largest bank. It now has operations in 16 states, 13m customers and a clear lead in the race to become the first national retail bank. The deal startled Wall Street, which had unwisely taken Mr McColl at his word. But it has greater significance: it highlights the ever more intense search for efficiency by America's banks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The deal--America's third-biggest banking merger ever--comes after a brief lull. According to Houlihan Lokey Howard &amp; Zukin, a Los Angeles investment bank, the volume of banking mergers in the first half of 1996 slipped to $9.7 billion from $21 billion in the same period last year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For both sides, the Boatmen's deal carries clear attractions. Boatmen's shareholders get a 40% premium on their shares. And NationsBank is happy to pay it, for several reasons. First, Boatmen's gives it a large and respected business in trust and investment management, previously an area of weakness. Moreover, it is acquiring a unique franchise: a string of small acquisitions by Boatmen's has already turned it into the largest bank in five mid-western states. Third, NationsBank reckons it can squeeze $335m of annual costs out of Boatmen's flab within three years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some argue that the Boatmen's deal is the first portent of a new wave of banking mergers. Certainly, more are likely, if only because the market is still divided among almost 10,000 banks. Regional banks, taking advantage of the liberalisation of interstate banking laws, will drive consolidation. The largest of them--known as "super-regionals" --such as Norwest, Banc One, First Union and First Bank System, are evolving into diversified banks covering several regions. They hope eventually to become truly national retail banks. None can yet boast a national brand.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Several super-regionals have bagged big game recently. Last year First Union bought First Fidelity for $5.6 billion and Wells Fargo swallowed First Interstate after an $11 billion hostile takeover. These banks may now pause to digest their prey. Others, such as Norwest and Banc One, have been stalking banks in the mid-west and south-east.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But acquiring has become expensive. So keen was NationsBank that it paid 2.7 times Boatmen's book value in a market where paying twice book value is considered generous. If, as seems likely, other would-be sellers demand such prices, buyers will be deterred.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Instead, they will focus on improving their own efficiency. Although mergers help banks to rationalise branch networks and computer systems, there are other ways to do so. Several are closing expensive old branches and replacing them with lower-cost outlets in supermarkets and shopping malls. Wells Fargo has even begun renting space in its own branches to retailers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With an average cost-to-income ratio of 59%, American banks are now among the world's most efficient (see <a href="fn1.gif">chart</a>). Still, this conceals a huge disparity among them. Michael Mayo, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, an investment bank, reckons that over the next five years the average cost-to-income ratio may fall below 55%. Only the fittest, and those with marine training, are likely to survive.

<h1>Just when you thought it was safe...</h1>

ROME<p>DESCRIBING banks as Shylocks is now rather more than just colourful hyperbole in Italy. With about 3% of bank loans thought to exceed new legal limits for usury, imposed earlier this year, bankers are beginning to worry about their pound of flesh. This month the treasury ministry will begin implementing the law by dividing loans into different categories, grouping them by their riskiness. By March next year, it will announce the average interest rate for each category, and any loan on which interest is more than 50% above average will be deemed usurious, and thus illegal.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although the new law is aimed at banks, they are only small-time players in a booming loan-sharking business. According to the Bank of Italy, more than 300,000 families fell into the clutches of loan sharks--known as <i>cravattari</i>, or stranglers--in 1993, the latest year for its figures. They borrowed almost 4 trillion lire ($2.6 billion) and paid nearly 3.5 trillion lire in interest. Confesercenti, a retail traders' association, says that the business has grown ten-fold since then.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The authorities are barely scratching the surface in tackling the problem. Earlier this week, the <i>Guardia di Finanza</i>, Italy's financial police force, announced that they had uncovered 140 cases of loan sharking during the first seven months of the year and brought charges against 371 people. Despite a well-publicised effort to crack down, these figures are virtually unchanged from a year earlier.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The loan sharks were helped by Italy's recession in the early 1990s, which hurt many small firms. The Bank of Italy reckons that 90% of the money borrowed from <i>cravattari</i> during that period was used for financing businesses. Rather than blaming the business cycle, or the <i>cravattari </i>themselves, many people accuse the banks of extending too little credit to help small firms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is no doubt misleading to place banks in the same category as the <i>cravattari</i>. The interest rates that they charge are around 18% on personal loans, compared with the 150% to 200% annual rates charged by the <i>cravattari</i>. And by forcing the banks to swim with the sharks, Italy's authorities may foster a perverse outcome. The new law will probably force many banks to ration credit more tightly, leaving even more victims within reach of the ever-circling predators.<fly><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Italy's banks deny these claims vehemently. They argue that families and small firms are among the riskiest borrowers, with default rates that are 50% higher than those on large loans. Moreover, they say, default risks differ enormously across regions and borrowers, and so interest rates must vary widely to reflect these risks.

<h1><center>Fit to rule?</center></h1>

ANIMAL, vegetable or mineral? It is a question the people of several large countries may reasonably be asking of their political leaders these days. Deng Xiaoping, China's untitled but paramount leader, is 92 years old, never seen in public and, it seems, scarcely able to talk. At 65, Boris Yeltsin is much younger than Mr Deng, but he has already lived seven years longer than the average Russian male and looks far from well on the increasingly rare occasions when he makes an appearance. President Suharto of Indonesia is 75, spent several days in July having tests in a German hospital and, it is said, has grown seriously remote from his 190m people. For the citizens of these three countries, which together account for over a quarter of the world's population, a sickly gerontocrat means perpetual speculation and uncertainty. Is it also worrying for everyone else?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The worries may seem overblown. China is not notably worse governed now than it was a few years ago, when Mr Deng was a bit more sprightly. Certainly, the old man's decrepitude does not seem to have led directly either to chaos or to aggression. Such chaos as exists--and it is largely the benign anarchy of economic growth--probably derives from decisions he took when he had some command of his faculties: his last act of known significance, on a tour of southern China in 1992, was to call for uninhibited economic expansion, which has led to much boisterous prosperity (as well as some much less welcome inflation). As for aggression, China exhibits all too much of it, but it is far from clear that it would exhibit less either if Mr Deng were more effectively in charge or if he were unambiguously dead. Even the implications of Mr Yeltsin's parlous health may be exaggerated. Better, certainly, that Russia should be erratically governed by a sick democrat than consistently misgoverned by a healthy communist or a clear-eyed nationalist.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet to say all this is only to say that things might be worse, as indeed they might. They might also be better. The Chinese, and their neighbours, would be far better served by a leader who was able to take considered decisions and overrule, if necessary, colleagues who wanted to stand in the way of political reform and good relations with other countries. The Russians would be better served by a president who would end the war in Chechnya and attend to the creation of a sense of civic decency in their country. And the Indonesians would be better served by a president who would stop corruption and liberalise their country's political system.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Age alone does not disqualify politicians from getting things done. If Mr Deng is one day remembered more as a great reformer than as a brutal autocrat, and he may be, it will be because of the changes he wrought after his ascent of the greasy pole in 1978--at the age of 74. Old men, from Gladstone to de Gaulle to Nelson Mandela (75 when he became president of South Africa), have shown that great things can be achieved in old age. Bob Dole must certainly hope so. If elected in November, at 73 he would become the oldest man ever to assume the American presidency.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;History, however, suggests that old politicians do not usually make up in wisdom what they lack in youthful vigour and sharpness of mind. Almost all Ronald Reagan's accomplishments came at the outset of his term of office. Even then he was culpably hard to educate about the economic consequences of cutting taxes but not spending, and towards the end he was so detached as to be almost dangerous: at the Reykjavik summit in 1986, when he was 75, he was nearly beguiled by Mikhail Gorbachev into signing America up for a nuclear-free future.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Old men are, inevitably, also more prone to illness than younger ones, and illness undoubtedly impairs judgment. Roosevelt might well have driven a harder bargain with Stalin at Yalta had he not been dying. Eden might not have mismanaged Suez had he not been ill. Churchill and Mitterrand might have presided over more than stagnation in their final administrations had they not been beset by infirmity.
</p><p><b>In God, and democracy, we trust</b>
<br>Still, America, Britain and France all survived the experience of frail old leaders with relatively little upheaval. One reason is that in these countries power is not entirely concentrated in the hands of one person, sane or gaga. Another is that, when a mistake is made, the institutions and mechanisms exist to repair the damage and restore some kind of continuity. Democracies offer orderly procedures for choosing successors. That, no doubt, is why voters may be ready to elect elderly politicians to office, especially nowadays when they have reasonable grounds for believing they will be told about the onset of any serious affliction. Mitterrand disguised the extent of his cancer for a while, but it is unthinkable that the American press would today fail to report the degree of paralysis of a president, as it did in Roosevelt's day.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although established democracies may be able to weather the rule of the distempered or the disabled, two other kinds of country may not. One is the new democracies, of which there are many, where the succession mechanism may be untested, the institutions fragile. This is true of South Africa, whose reputation for relative political tranquillity rests largely on Mr Mandela, who, fit though he is for a man of 78, is hardly in charge of day-to-day events. Trouble may already be brewing there. Russia is even more worrying, if only because it is a nuclear power with an expansionist history and an uncertain commitment to democratic rules. Mr Yeltsin's second term has started badly, with all the characteristics of a coma interrupted by fits. If it continues thus, it may be hard to bring it to a decent end, and meanwhile the power struggle to succeed will intensify.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Outright autocracies, however, are far more dangerous, since they generally prescribe no procedure for the handover of power. True, China has an heir-apparent in the shape of President Jiang Zemin, but his succession is far from assured. In any event, the prickly, uncertain nature of Chinese politics is likely to continue after Mr Deng's death, at least for a while, even if Mr Jiang does take over. In Indonesia, no heir of any kind is in sight and speculation about who it will be is now rivalled by how and when the changeover will come.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, the problem of the aged leader does not stop there. Zaire boasts one of the world's longest-running despots in Mobutu Sese Seko (65). Jordan's King Hussein is younger (60) and much less wicked, but perhaps less physically robust. King Hassan of Morocco is 67. President Assad of Syria is 65. None of these men runs a model democracy, or even a model monarchy. None can be sure of bequeathing a trouble-free succession. If you are worried about your own health, worry also about the health of every antique autocrat.

<p><h2>Serbmandering</h2></p>
<p><p>The Bosnian president, Alija Izetbegovic, called for a Muslim boycott of the <b>Bosnian municipal elections</b> which Serbs plan to hold on September 14th. The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, charged with supervising the Bosnian elections, said it was postponing the official municipal poll because of alleged irregularities, though other votes would go ahead that day as scheduled.
<p>Russia's ailing president, <b>Boris Yeltsin</b>, went on holiday to a resort near Moscow. He refused two requests from Alexander Lebed, his special representative for Chechnya, for a meeting to discuss Mr Lebed's Chechen peace plan. Russian troops continued to withdraw from Chechnya's capital, Grozny, leaving it to separatist rebels.
<p><b>Estonia's parliament</b> failed to elect a new state president. Neither the reformist incumbent, Lennart Meri, nor his ex-communist rival, Arnold Ruutel, could muster the two-thirds majority needed, despite three rounds of voting.
<p>A conference opened in Stockholm on the international <b>sexual exploitation of children</b>. The search continued for the bodies of young victims of sex abuse in Belgium.
<p>The <b>Danish Supreme Court</b> agreed to allow 11 citizens to bring a constitutional challenge to Denmark's signature of the Maastricht treaty. The case may take four years. Until it is resolved, Denmark is unlikely to ratify amendments to the treaty being discussed by the <font size=-1>EU</font>'s inter-governmental conference.
<p>After hunger strikes and a two-month protest, 300 <b>illegal immigrants</b>, mostly from Africa, were evicted from a Paris church in an operation involving tear gas, batons and 1,000 police officers.
<p>The <b>hijacking </b>of a Sudanese airliner on a flight from Khartoum to Amman ended at London's Stansted Airport with the release of all passengers and crew. The Iraqi hijackers and their families were taken into custody.</p>
<p><h2>Heads will roll</h2></p>
<p><p>Two former presidents of <b>South Korea </b>were sentenced for their roles in a military coup and a massacre in Kwangju in 1980. Chun Doo Hwan was sentenced to death and Roh Tae Woo to 22.5 years in jail. Government critics said the two men had been put on trial to boost political support for President Kim Young Sam.
<p>Yakio Hatoyama, a member of <b>New Party Sakigake</b>, part of Japan's ruling coalition, said he was resigning to form a new party that would stand for "real democracy".
<p>Prosecutors arrested Takeshi Abe, the ex-head of Japan's <font size=-1>AIDS</font>-study team, for allegedly administering <b>untreated blood products </b>to haemophiliacs even though he knew that these might lead to <font size=-1>AIDS</font>. About 1,800 haemophiliacs have been infected with <font size=-1>HIV</font>, the virus that leads to <font size=-1>AIDS</font>, of which more than 400 have died.

<p>Four members of an opposition party in <b>Singapore </b>faced jail after being accused by the government of "contempt of Parliament". They had allegedly lied about the cost of the state's health care.
<p>More than <b>200 pilgrims </b>to a shrine at Amarnath in the Himalayas died in bad weather. The shrine has a naturally formed ice phallus of Shiva, a Hindu god.</p>

<h1><center>The quality of Korean mercy</center></h1>
<p><b>The trial and sentencing of South Korea's former leaders raise some hard questions--not least for authoritarians in the rest of Asia</b></p>


HOLDING hands as they stood together in the dock, Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo, two former generals and leaders of South Korea, were sentenced respectively to death and to 22.75 years in prison this week. That both men may yet be pardoned will not erase the discomfort many people felt at the sight of two once powerful men humbled in this way.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The sharpest discomfort will have been felt by other authoritarian rulers in Asia, who must wonder whether one day they too may face a reckoning in court. But even those pressing for democracy and the rule of law have reason to ponder events in South Korea. Several questions hang over the trial. Was this really justice in action? Even if the two men were guilty as charged, is it really wise or fair for an emerging democracy to treat former rulers with such harshness? And what impact will the sentences have on the transition to more liberal government elsewhere in Asia?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the first two questions--about the justness and wisdom of the trial--the answers must be equivocal (see <a href="as1.html">page</a>). There was a strong element of political expediency in the decision to prosecute the two men. Kim Young Sam, South Korea's current president, had originally said he would let history judge his predecessors. Many suspect that he changed his mind not out of a sudden desire to see history's wrongs righted but because he feared that Messrs Chun and Roh were considering a political comeback.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sympathy for the two old generals does not rest on that alone. The two men presided over a period of extraordinary economic growth, which made their countrymen significantly better off. Mr Roh even smoothed the transition to democracy, won a free election in 1987 and then, in 1992, stepped gracefully aside to allow a civilian to take his place as president--the very civilian who authorised his prosecution. In other words, the two men were not all bad. Some people argue that, whatever their misdemeanours, it would have been better to forgive and forget.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet Messrs Chun and Roh were not innocent men and their conviction has established an important principle: that South Korea's leaders are accountable before the law. Both men were convicted of offences--such as treason and accepting huge bribes--that would be crimes under any conceivable government. And though they did their countries much good, as well as some harm, it is hard to argue that the two men do not deserve any bringing to book. The Kwangju massacre in 1980, which solidified Mr Chun's hold on power, claimed at least 200 victims. There is clearly a demand, both from the families of the victims of Kwangju, and within South Korea as a whole, for some kind of accounting for the events of 1979-80. Such an accounting may help to draw a line under the years of military rule and the traditions of political corruption those events sustained. The good deeds of the generals can only be mitigating factors--and in fact it looks as though such considerations will lead to pardons for both of them.
</p><p><b>The lessons for dictators</b>
<br>The question of the impact of events in South Korea on the rest of Asia is more troubling. The current South Korean government can reasonably say that such intangible calculations are not really its concern. Its main preoccupation is to help its people to come to terms with the country's troubled recent history and, at the same time, to establish civilian government and the rule of law.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But it is probably true that neither the generals who run Myanmar, nor President Suharto in Indonesia, nor the Communist Party in China, will be encouraged to move towards democracy by the fate of Messrs Chun and Roh. After all, Mr Roh ceded power as gracefully as any military man can. Now he has fallen victim to the process of democratisation that he helped to foster. The moral drawn by Asia's nervous dictators may well be that, when democrats are at the door, lock them up rather than usher them in.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the sake of the rest of Asia, it might have been better if the South Koreans had followed the South African model: establish a commission to examine the past, and try to strike a balance between justice and reconciliation. Still, it is unlikely that, even if the South Koreans had behaved with more restraint, assorted rulers in Jakarta or Beijing would then have cheerfully ceded power. And the broader lesson of South Korea is that ordinary Asians, despite their alleged preference for strong leadership, will also increasingly demand--and get--accountable government and the rule of law. That, after all, is what was being demanded at Kwangju.

<html><head><title>Saving children from sex</title></head>

<h1><center>Saving children from sex</center></h1>
<p><b>Rich countries' laws won't stop poor countries' paedophiles</b></p>

EVEN in a world grown hardened to man's inhumanity to man, cruelty to children, and especially the sexual exploitation of the young, still has the power to shock. This week the first World Congress Against the Commercial Exploitation of Children met in Stockholm, bringing together government and non-governmental organisations (see <a href="eu1.html">page</a>). The figures it rehearsed were hideous: more than 1m children a year are added to the miserable total of youngsters used for commercial sexual purposes around the world; child prostitutes are visited by 10m-12m men a week; one-third of child prostitutes in Asia are <font size=-1>HIV</font>-positive. The emotion aroused by such numbers, and indeed by cases such as the abduction and murder of several young girls in Belgium, can easily lead governments into measures that mollify public outrage but do nothing to help potential victims.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Preventing the sexual abuse of children is difficult enough when it takes place within the borders of a rich country with adequate laws. But good communications have been kind to paedophiles. Thanks to inexpensive international air travel, they can easily reach pornographic materials and young victims beyond the scope of their country's disapproving courts. Wherever children live in poverty, they are at risk of commercial sexual exploitation. Their exploiters often include visitors from rich countries. Guided by word of mouth or by information on the Internet, sex tourists may behave abroad as they would never dare to behave in their own countries.
</p><p><b>Small beginnings</b>
<br>In frustration a dozen or so countries, mostly rich and western, have passed laws prohibiting their citizens from behaving abroad in ways that would be illegal at home. More such laws are on the way. Some countries insist, as a general legal principle, that their citizens can be prosecuted for breaking national laws abroad. Others are increasingly using the principle to deal with issues such as football hooliganism or hijacking. But the main drive to extend the reach of a country's courts beyond its borders is horror at the sexual exploitation of foreign children.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One problem with such measures is that they are particularly difficult to enforce. Courts in developed countries may set different standards for the collection of evidence from those set in the country where the offence took place, and some require witnesses to testify in person. Some sketchy evidence also suggests that courts may deal more lightly with an offence committed abroad than at home.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the bigger problem is that, by proposing to prosecute their own citizens for misbehaving abroad, rich countries may inadvertently give the impression that the commercial exploitation of children is mainly an offence committed by foreigners. In fact, by far the main customers of child prostitutes are locals. The first requirement for ending child prostitution is for countries, poor and rich, to pass appropriate laws. Indeed, one of the justifications for extra-territorial laws is often the inadequacy of poor-country laws. In some countries, for instance, the age of consent is low; in others, commercial sex with girls is outlawed, but not with boys.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even more important than passing laws is enforcing them fairly and vigorously. Too many countries have turned a blind eye to the excesses of the sex trade in the hope of luring tourists. The best way for richer countries to help is by giving aid and training: to the police, who may be in league with brothel owners, and to children at risk. Only when poor countries care more about protecting their children than their tourist revenues will this nasty global trade start to die.

<h1>Stable prices and fast growth: just say no</h1>

<p><b></b></p>
<i>Paul Krugman, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is one of the world's most distinguished economic theorists, who has done seminal work in international trade and finance. He is a noted slayer of sacred cows, and a part-time scourge of pseudo-economists in high places. He has won many academic honours, and quite a few enemies.</i>
<p>
<b>BY INVITATION <br>In this article, Paul Krugman questions current orthodoxies about monetary policy in rich countries (see <a href="sf1.gif">charts</a>)</b>


<p>MANY years ago, Paul Samuelson, who is widely regarded as the father of modern economics, memorably cautioned against basing economic policy on "shibboleths", by which he meant slogans that take the place of hard thinking. Strictly speaking, his was an incorrect use of the word: the "Oxford English Dictionary" defines a shibboleth as "a catchword or formula adopted by a party or sect, by which their adherents or followers may be discerned, or those not their followers may be excluded." But in a deeper sense Mr Samuelson probably had it right: simplistic ideas in economics often become badges of identity for groups of like-minded people, who repeat certain phrases to each other, and eventually mistake repetition for truth.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Public discussion of monetary policy is increasingly dominated by two such sects. The shibboleth of one sect is "growth"; that of the other, "stable prices". Those who belong to neither sect find it hard to get a hearing: it seems that you must believe either that central banks should aim for zero inflation to the exclusion of all else (and that stable prices will bring huge economic benefits) or that central banks should stop worrying about inflation altogether and go for growth (and that by so doing they can bring back the growth rates of the 1960s).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But we need not make this choice. We can and should reject both fatuous promises of easy growth and mystical faith in the virtues of stable prices.
</p><p><b>The case against growth</b>
<br>Bob Dole, the Republican Party's presidential candidate, is running on an economic plan which depends crucially on the assumption that over the next seven years the American economy can grow at an annual average rate of at least 3.5%--more than half as much again as the recent sum of labour-force and productivity growth. While his more conventional advisers have offered some unconvincing claims that his tax-cutting and tax-reforming plan will produce huge gains in economic efficiency, the main argument underlying this kind of "growthism" is the insistence of a vocal group of pundits that the only current obstacle to faster growth is mean-spiritedness at the Federal Reserve Board.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This pro-growth critique of America's central bankers cuts right across the usual left-right divide. On one side stands Robert Bartley, the ultra-conservative editor of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, declaring that the central bank is responsible for America's disappointing growth even in the long term: "if the Fed stamps out any growth in excess of 2.5%, the long-run growth rate of the economy will be less than 2.5%." On the other stands the liberal financier, Felix Rohatyn, whom President Clinton unsuccessfully proposed as the Fed's vice chairman. Mr Rohatyn has claimed that monetary policy can safely aim for 3.5% or even 4% growth in each of the next five or ten years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some simple arithmetic suggests why he is surely wrong. Over the past four years the American economy has achieved an average annual growth rate of less than 3%; nonetheless, this modest growth has been enough to reduce the unemployment rate by more than two percentage points. If the economy were to grow substantially faster over the next four years than it did over the past four, it seems hard to avoid the conclusion that the accompanying fall in unemployment would also be substantially larger. And since the current unemployment rate is only 5.3%, to believe that the Fed can safely target the kind of growth Mr Rohatyn advocates (or that Mr Dole is counting on), you must believe that unemployment can be driven below 3%--which is not only much lower than the current rate but well below even the rates that prevailed at the height of the Vietnam war--without creating inflationary pressures. How many people would be prepared to defend that proposition?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some growth proponents like to point out that the American economy grew at slightly more than 3.5% during the seven years from 1982 to 1989. But that was mainly a matter of recovery from a deep recession; over the course of that recovery the unemployment rate fell by more than five percentage points. To manage a comparable performance over the next seven years America would have to achieve a negative unemployment rate by 2003.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While they are rarely willing to confront this arithmetic directly, members of the growth sect do offer some arguments about why they think high growth targets are now feasible. Here is what one of the many influential publications supporting the sect said recently:<p>
<ul><font size=-1>For some time, </font><i>Business Week </i>has taken a strong pro-growth position. We believe that <font size=-1>U</font>.<font size=-1>S</font>. productivity is higher than government statistics indicate and inflation is significantly lower. We see the global economy as severely restraining the pricing power of companies which recognise that in the current competitive reality they must generate profit by boosting efficiencies, not prices. In other words, we believe the <font size=-1>U</font>.<font size=-1>S</font>. can achieve growth rates higher than 2% without renewed inflation.
</font></ul>
<p>Many people find these arguments convincing. You have to think about them a bit to realise that they make no sense at all.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Consider first the proposition that higher growth is now possible, because true productivity growth is much higher than the disappointing official numbers. There are good reasons to doubt this claim--the rhetoric of business productivity seems to have outpaced the accomplishment--but suppose that it were true. It would still offer no justification for a more expansionary monetary policy, or a higher growth target. Why? Because estimates of growth and estimates of productivity are based on the same data. Suppose the official numbers say that the American economy is growing by 2% annually, while productivity is rising only 1%. And suppose you think that the true rate of productivity growth is actually much higher, say 2.5%. Then you must correspondingly believe that true  growth is higher by exactly the same amount--that it is 3.5%. So you should not fault Alan Greenspan for failing to deliver a high growth rate; you ought to believe that he has already done so.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What about the argument that global competition prevents inflation? One might point out that the American economy is not actually that globalised: imports are only 13% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>, and at least 70% of employment and value-added is in "non-tradable" sectors that do not compete on world markets. One might also point out that if the economy really were as globalised as <i>Business Week </i>imagines, increased domestic demand would do little for American growth and employment--most of the extra spending would be on goods produced elsewhere. But the crucial point is that if you believe that prices throughout the American economy are closely constrained by foreign competition, you ought to conclude that changes in the dollar's exchange rate--which immediately change the costs of those foreign competitors measured in dollars--must have a powerful effect on the inflation rate. An episode like the 1993-95 rise in the value of the yen, which at a stroke increased the dollar costs of American industry's most formidable competitors by 50%, must surely have led to a sharp acceleration in American inflation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But it didn't; and this is decisive evidence that global competition does not, in fact, constrain prices the way the growth tribe imagines. Oh, and by the way: wouldn't a looser monetary policy lead to a weaker dollar? And if foreign competition constrains American prices, doesn't that mean that monetary expansion would translate into inflation more, not less, surely and rapidly in a globalised economy than in a closed one?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps one should not be too hard on <i>Business Week.</i> After all, the editorial simply repeated the arguments made by Mr Rohatyn, Lester Thurow and others of the growth sect; and the logic of its case was no more confused than usual. But that, of course, is the point.
</p><p><b>The case against stable prices</b>
<br>While the growth sect has converted America's Republican Party and much of its business press, central bankers remain notably unmoved. This is easily understood in the case of the Fed, which can with some justification claim credit for an unemployment rate that is close to a 20-year low. But European central banks, faced in many cases with unemployment at rates not seen since the 1930s, have been equally unwilling to heed the sometimes desperate calls of political leaders for lower interest rates (Jacques Chirac of France, for example, declared recently that France needed lower interest rates to cut unemployment). Instead, with hardly any exceptions, central bankers insist that the best thing they can do for the economy is to pursue unrelentingly the goal of price stability.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The ideology underlying this intransigence is nicely captured by the wording of "The Economic Growth and Stability Act", proposed last year by Senator Connie Mack, who was widely touted as Bob Dole's likely running mate before Jack Kemp entered the picture. Price stability, the act declares "is a key condition to maintaining the highest possible levels of productivity, real incomes, living standards, employment and global competitiveness." It's a confident declaration; you would never guess that there is hardly any reason to believe it is true.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fact is, however, that the costs of low inflation (ie, at the low single-digit rates that now prevail in rich countries) have proved theoretically and empirically elusive. Very high inflation, which leads people into costly efforts to avoid holding cash, is one thing; but the West is not remotely in that situation. Moreover, it is fairly certain that the costs of inflation, such as they are, are "non-linear": ie, 3% inflation does much less than one-third as much harm as 9%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, even if the gains from price stability are nowhere near as large as Senator Mack imagines, why not go for them? Because to do so would be very expensive. The great disinflation of the 1980s, which brought inflation rates down from around 10% to around 4%, was achieved only through a prolonged period of high unemployment and excess capacity--in the United States, the unemployment rate did not fall back to its 1979 level until 1988, and the cumulative loss of output was more than a trillion dollars.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is every reason to expect that a push to zero inflation would involve a comparable "sacrifice ratio"--that it would cost as much as half a trillion dollars in foregone output to wring the remaining three points or so of inflation out of the system. This is a huge short-term pain for a small and elusive long-term gain.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And even this may not be the whole story: there is some evidence that a push to zero inflation may lead not just to a temporary sacrifice of output but to a permanently higher rate of unemployment. This is still controversial. The standard view, embodied in the concept of the <font size=-1>NAIRU</font> (non-accelerating-inflation rate of unemployment), is that there is no long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment. But recent work by George Akerlof, William Dickens and George Perry* makes a compelling case that this no-trade-off rule breaks down when inflation is very low.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>NAIRU</font> hypothesis is based on the reasonable proposition that people can figure out the effects of inflation--that both workers and employers realise that an 11% wage increase in the face of 10% inflation is the same thing as a 6% increase in the face of 5% inflation, and therefore that any sustained rate of inflation will simply get built into price and wage decisions. There is overwhelming evidence that this hypothesis is right--that 10% inflation does not buy a long-term unemployment rate significantly lower than that which can be sustained with 5% inflation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But suppose that the inflation rate is very low, and that market forces are "trying" to reduce the real wages of some workers. (Even if average real wages are rising, there will usually be some industries in which real wages must decline to maintain full employment.) Is a 2% wage increase in the face of 5% inflation the same thing as a 3% wage cut in the face of stable prices? To hyper-rational workers, it might be; but common sense suggests that in practice there is a big psychological difference between a wage rise that fails to keep pace with inflation and an explicit wage reduction. Messrs Akerlof, Dickens and Perry have produced compelling evidence that workers are indeed very reluctant to accept nominal wage cuts: the distribution of nominal wage changes shows very few declines but a large concentration at zero, a clear indication that there are many workers whose real wages "should" be falling more rapidly than the inflation rate but cannot, because to do so would require unacceptable nominal wage cuts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This nominal wage rigidity means that trying to get the inflation rate very low impairs real wage flexibility, and therefore increases the unemployment rate even in the long run. Consider the case of Canada, a nation whose central bank is intensely committed to the goal of price stability (the current inflation rate is less than 1%). In the 1960s Canada used to have about the same unemployment rate as the United States. When it started to run persistently higher rates in the 1970s and 1980s, many economists attributed the differential to a more generous unemployment insurance system. But even as that system has become less generous, the unemployment gap has continued to widen: Canada's current rate is 10%. Why? A Canadian economist, Pierre Fortin, points out that from 1992 to 1994 a startling 47% of his country's collective-bargaining agreements involved wage freezes. Most economists would agree that high-unemployment economies like Canada suffer from wage inflexibility; Mr Fortin's evidence suggests, however, that the cause of that inflexibility lies not only in structural, microeconomic problems but also in the Bank of Canada's anti-inflationary zeal.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In short, the belief that absolute price stability is a huge blessing, that it brings large benefits with few if any costs, rests not on evidence but on faith. The evidence actually points the other way: the benefits of price stability are elusive, the costs of getting there are large, and zero inflation may not be a good thing even in the long run.
</p><p><b>A shibboleth-free policy</b>
<br>Suppose you reject both the miracle cures of the growth sect and the old-time religion of the stable-price sect. What policies would you advocate?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A shibboleth-free policy might look like this. First, adopt as a long-run target fairly low but not zero inflation, say 3-4%. This is high enough to accommodate most of the real wage cuts that markets impose, while the costs of the inflation itself will still be very small. Monetary policy, however, affects inflation only with a long lag, so you also need some intermediate target. A reasonable strategy is to try to stabilise unemployment around your best estimate of the level consistent with stable inflation at the desired rate, even while recognising that such estimates are imperfect. So you should be prepared to adjust the unemployment target if inflation is worse or better than expected. And of course if past misjudgments have caused inflation to move above--or below--the target, policy must seek to bring it back into line.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This proposal will presumably bring angry objections from both sides. The growth sect will denounce it as an acceptance of defeat, insisting that the West needs higher growth to raise living standards and solve its budget problems. Unfortunately, economics is not only about what you want, it is also about what you can get. Growth may be good, but achieving it requires more than simply declaring inflation to be dead.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Meanwhile, the stable-price sect will denounce this strategy as irresponsible, a return to the bad old inflationary ways of the 1970s. But the strategy is not outlandish--on the contrary, it is intended to be a description of the actual policies followed by several of the world's big central banks. In particular, what I have described is close to the behaviour predicted by the "Taylor rule" . This rule, which suggests setting interest rates automatically based on a comparison of the actual and potential output of an economy, successfully tracks the policies of the Federal Reserve. (It is ironic that the Fed, whose policies are in fact more growth- and employment-oriented than any other western central bank, is the target of most of the growth sect's attacks.) But the strategy described is also arguably a pretty good description of the behaviour of other central banks, including the Bank of England and even--dare one say it?--the Bundesbank, which talks a monetarist game but rarely meets its own announced targets.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course these sensible central banks will deny that they follow any such strategy. This is understandable. Anyone who has watched the press pounce on a novice central banker naive enough to speak intelligibly realises why more experienced hands prefer to cloak their actions in obscurantism and hypocrisy. But while hypocrisy has uses, it also has dangers--above all, the danger that you may start to believe the things you hear yourself saying. This is not a hypothetical possibility. Right now there are central banks--the Banks of Canada and France are obvious examples--which really seem to believe what they say about stable prices; their sincerity is costing their nations hundreds of thousands of jobs.
</p><p><b>Beyond the slogans</b>
<br>It is disturbingly easy to imagine a future in which each of the great monetary shibboleths becomes the basis of policy in a major part of the advanced world. In the United States powerful groups on both left and right now propagandise incessantly for the belief that Americans can grow their problems away; aside from raising the possibility that America will end up rediscovering the joys of stagflation, this campaign seriously weakens the country's already faltering resolve to put its fiscal house in order. But the bigger risk is probably in Europe, where--despite a far worse employment performance than in the United States--the rhetoric of price stability goes largely unchallenged, and is likely to have growing influence over actual policy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In particular, what will happen if Europe's economic and monetary union comes to pass? The new European Monetary Authority will operate under a constitution that honours price stability above all else; more important, it will feel obliged to show itself a worthy successor to the Bundesbank, which means that it will try to implement in practice the kind of policy the Bundesbank follows only in theory. The result will be that Europe's unemployment problem, which would be severe in any case, will be seriously aggravated.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Shibboleths make you feel good. They are an alternative to the pain of hard thinking and, because so many people repeat them, they offer a reassuring sense of community. But you must go beyond shibboleths, however comfortable they make you feel: monetary policy is too serious to be conducted on the basis of slogans.

<h1>The mighty fall in South Korea</h1>

<p>AS IF resigned to their fate, Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo--two former presidents of South Korea and army colleagues since their days at military academy--trudged into court on August 26th, holding hands and wearing prison uniform, to hear their sentences. There were no gasps of surprise, just an eerie silence as the judge wrapped up his two-hour statement and sentenced Mr Chun to death on charges of mutiny and treason for his role in the military coup of 1980 and the subsequent massacre of demonstrators in Kwangju. For his part in these events, Mr Roh was given a sentence of 22.5 years in prison. Outside in the drizzling rain, 600 riot police edged nervously around as a couple of dozen protesters yelled abuse and demanded a still harsher sentence for Mr Roh.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Apart from their crimes against the state, the two former presidents were also found guilty of receiving huge amounts in bribes from industry while in office, and were fined more than 500 billion won ($610m) between them. Both have until September 2nd to appeal against their sentences. Thirteen of their former military cronies were also given jail terms of four to ten years for crimes perpetrated during the coup and subsequent crackdown. A dozen of the ex-presidents' former aides were given prison sentences for their roles in collecting the bribes, along with nine businessmen who were found guilty of bribery.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The eight-month court case was supposed to heal the wounds that have festered since the tragic events of 16 years ago. After the assassination in 1979 of President Park Chung Hee (himself a former general) by his security chief, Mr Chun used his position in the army to snuff out the chance of political liberalisation. Instead, supported by Mr Roh, he seized power and proceeded to expand martial law throughout South Korea, claiming that the communist regime in North Korea was planning to take advantage of the chaos and massing its troops for an attack.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The invasion from the North never came. But the coup set off student protests in the south-western city of Kwangju in May 1980. The army's bloody crackdown there officially left some 200 protesters dead. Unofficial estimates run much higher. But, faced with further widespread protests in 1987, Mr Chun resisted the temptation to resort to force again. Instead, he eventually stepped aside in favour of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Mr Roh. Benefiting from a split in the opposition, Mr Roh won South Korea's first free presidential election in 1987.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;During his five-year term in office, Mr Roh won credit from his countrymen (as well as the court last week) for bolstering democracy and for improving South Korea's standing abroad. The country played host to the Olympic Games and joined the United Nations during his time in power. His friend and mentor, Mr Chun, was exiled to a distant temple in disgrace as part of a deal the two men struck in a bid to end the continuing criticism of their mutiny and suppression of civil rights. In 1992 Mr Roh stepped down, and Kim Young Sam was elected as South Korea's first civilian president in 32 years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Roh, and even Mr Chun, might eventually have been forgiven their military sins by a country grown rich and successful during their stewardship, had it not been for a scandal that broke last year. The hidden millions that Mr Roh had raised from various captains of industry came to light in October and quickly implicated Mr Chun. With both men behind bars, President Kim moved swiftly to get a special law passed that prevented the country's statute of limitations on the 1980 coup and the Kwangju incident from taking effect. The new investigation into the two incidents launched by President Kim led to the trial that started last December and culminated in this week's sentencing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The guilty verdicts were a foregone conclusion, although some were taken aback by the severity of the sentences on the ex-generals. Even more surprising were the tough prison terms received by the leading businessmen for bribery. Kim Woo Choong, the founder and chairman of Daewoo, and the heads of three other <i>chaebol</i> (industrial conglomerates), were given jail sentences of two years or more. The chairman of the Samsung group, Lee Kun Hee, had his two-year sentence suspended. All of them remain free for the time being. Daewoo's Mr Kim has just gone to China to open a new hotel and to Eastern Europe to visit his new car factories.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Big business has been rattled by the turn of events. The South Korean courts have traditionally been lenient towards businessmen charged with corruption. Their contribution to the country's prosperity has tended to excuse most misdeeds. Some believe the government is spoiling for a fight, blaming business (hypocritically) for the corruption that has long permeated politics. There is even talk that, if he avoids jail, Mr Kim may have to resign his position as chairman of Daewoo and go into exile abroad. He has run into trouble with the government on several occasions since he threatened to run against Kim Young Sam in the 1992 election.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The whole trial has been shot through with accusations of political opportunism. Government critics claim the case against the two former presidents was only brought to strengthen President Kim's influence before the general election last March. Cynics have also pointed to the hurried way the case against the two ex-presidents was mounted just as serious questions were beginning to be asked about illicit payoffs that President Kim is said to have received from Mr Roh to finance his own presidential campaign. Such questions remain to be answered.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Certainly, the prosecutions of Mr Chun and Mr Roh have helped President Kim crush the factions within the ruling party that remained loyal to the two ex-presidents. That should help him when picking a successor to run for the presidency in 1997. To ensure that he does not suffer a similar fate as his two predecessors, President Kim needs to have a friendly face in the presidential palace when he steps down. But he also needs at least to give the appearance of having handled the recent trial with dignity and fairness.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No one expects Mr Chun to be hanged. His lawyers are preparing his appeal, a procedure that could take the courts until next May to decide. But what if Mr Chun decides not to appeal? In his final statement in court, Mr Chun said he expected no mercy and wanted only to be the "last victim of political revenge" . Against their lawyers' advice, both Mr Chun and Mr Roh have privately hinted that they are ready to let their sentences stand. If that is what they decide to do, President Kim might then have a serious problem on his hands.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a>

<h1>Pity the children</h1>

<p>ONE of man's nastiest vices, the sexual exploitation of children, has become an international business. An international conference has therefore gathered to ponder ways to prevent it: the World Congress on the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, which met in Stockholm this week. Like most such conferences, it was long on "global partnership" and "stronger co-operation" . But its main outcome was to expose the powerlessness of rich-country governments to root out a practice for which there is great demand.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In any given year, 1m or more children (90% of them girls) join the sex trade, some as prostitutes, some in pornography. Child prostitution is mainly but not exclusively a problem in poor countries, and the conference rightly deplored rich tourists who travel to poor countries to have sex with children. Many rich countries are making an effort to scare--or shame--their citizens into behaving decently abroad. Some airlines show videos urging vistors not to have sex with children; signs in Taiwanese hotels warn guests not to bring children to their rooms. More than a dozen countries have passed legislation allowing citizens to be prosecuted at home for crimes committed abroad.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the child-sex market is predominantly domestic: Filipino child prostitutes have more customers from the Philippines than from Japan or the West. Child prostitutes generally cater for the lower end of the market, where tourists are unlikely to trawl. International efforts to stamp out child sex must therefore take a back seat to local ones. Laws passed recently in Thailand, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Brazil show that governments are getting more serious about restricting the child-sex trade, but enforcement is sporadic. It is still not unusual for child prostitutes to be arrested while their clients walk free.

<p><b>The National Lottery</b></p>
<h1>An easy-going lot</h1>

<p>WHEREAS the regulators of the privatised utilities are getting a reputation for being tough on the companies they supervise, Oflot--the National Lottery regulator--is looking like a bit of a soft touch. Last month, the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee said Peter Davis, director-general of Oflot, had made "serious errors of judgment" in accepting free flights from one of the firms in the Camelot consortium, which runs the lottery. And on August 30th a report from the National Audit Office (<font size=-1>NAO</font>) criticised Oflot for being slow to carry out checks on some of Camelot's operations, and for failing to ensure that Camelot's computers are secure.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>NAO</font> says that, apart from a few initial checks, it took Oflot more than a year from the lottery's launch in November 1994 to start work on a system for monitoring whether cheques drawn on Camelot's prize-payment account were all being paid to genuine winners. Progress has been slow in other areas too. Oflot is supposed to carry out an assessment of Camelot's marketing every six months, but no such assessment had been carried out almost a year after the lottery was launched.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the prizes won on the lottery fall short of an annual target laid down in Camelot's licence, the firm eventually has to hand over the difference to the funds that distribute a proportion of all lottery takings to a variety of good causes. Until then, it earns interest on the money. The <font size=-1>NAO</font> points out that this added &#163;6m to Camelot's profits of &#163;77.5m in the year to March. Last year, the House of Commons National Heritage Committee said Camelot should be made to hand over the interest as well. Camelot argues that this would require a complete renegotiation of its licence, and Oflot seems happy to accept this.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>NAO</font> also points out that the lottery's computers have crashed three times since it was launched. Punters' money was apparently not put at risk, but the report complains that no tests have been carried out to see what would happen if someone deliberately overloaded the computers or fed them false instructions to try to breach their security. Camelot says it has already done tests that exceed British Standard 7799 (which covers computer security) and that the software it uses has been widely employed in other countries' lotteries, and has so far proved resilient. Oflot accepts Camelot's assurances, and says it cannot see how the tests the <font size=-1>NAO</font> is calling for would make much difference.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The lottery has been a huge success, has raised larger sums than expected for a wide range of good causes, and has had no breaches of security. But Mr Davis would be wrong to dismiss the <font size=-1>NAO</font> report as nit-picking. If the public became worried that lottery money was at risk from computer hackers, or that Camelot was making an unreasonably big profit, there could be a big drop in the number of people taking part. Perhaps it is time for Oflot to follow in the footsteps of the electricity and gas regulators, and start taking a tougher line.

<h1>Inflated expectations</h1>

FEARS that inflation will be higher in two years' time should be taken seriously--which is why the Bank of England continues to urge Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, to consider raising interest rates soon. But it would not be astonishing if Mr Clarke's interest-rate policy were guided less by the inflation prospect for 1998 than by the predicted rate for the year to May 1997--by which time a general election will have to be held. The short-term picture may prove far rosier than the longer-term one, giving Mr Clarke all the excuse he needs not to raise interest rates.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clarke has promised to bring underlying inflation (which excludes mortgage-interest payments) to an annual rate of less than 2.5% by the end of this Parliament. This measure is expected to fall in August, from 2.8% in July. Last year's jump in seasonal food prices, due to hot weather, is unlikely to be repeated. Inflation will probably be unchanged during the autumn, and then start to fall steadily from December until well after an election has been held. So reckons Michael Saunders, an economist at Salomon Brothers, an investment bank.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He points out that output-price inflation--inflation in the prices charged to retailers by producers--has slowed abruptly, after an even sharper fall in input-price inflation (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>). Output-price inflation is now almost three percentage points lower than it was a year ago. According to Mr Saunders, on each of the seven occasions over the past 30 years when it has fallen by that much in a year, retail-price inflation has fallen over the subsequent six-months by at least 0.3 percentage points. If history repeats itself, Mr Clarke should hit his inflation target.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is not certain. Although input and output prices have soared and plunged over the past few years, underlying inflation has been remarkably stable. Partly that was due to fortuitously timed changes in indirect tax, but it also reflected retailers' varying of profit margins to smooth the impact of output-price changes. With consumer spending likely to grow strongly over the next few months, retailers may try to raise their margins. If they succeed, Mr Clarke can kiss his inflation target goodbye.

<p><b>Local councils</b></p>
<h1>Trimming the fat</h1>

<p>IN THE run-up to the budget in November, local councils will once more be pressing the government to let them increase their spending by more than the rate of inflation. Councils in England, which currently spend about &#163;50 billion a year, have already asked for permission to increase this by 5% next year. The government, desperate to keep public-sector borrowing under control, is unlikely to agree. Instead it may suggest to councils that they take a closer look at a series of recent reports by the Audit Commission, which monitors councils' finances. These suggest that there is plenty of scope for savings.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The commission's most recent report, published earlier this month, is a study of the lessons garnered from audits of councils carried out in the fiscal year 1994-95. It concludes that far too many council staff are calling in sick, "an indicator of poor morale and an opportunity for significant savings". The commission found that one council in London (it does not say which) cut &#163;500,000 from its pay bill simply by monitoring absences due to "sickness" more closely. The potential savings across the country from such a measure could add up to tens of millions of pounds.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The commission also says that fraud against local councils is on the increase, and urges that councils try harder to prevent it, rather than merely detecting it after the event. Auditors identified specific cases of fraud involving &#163;46m in 1994-95, although the commission believes the actual amount is far higher. A study published in January by the Department of Social Security reckoned that fraudulent claims for housing benefit (which is administered by local councils) may come to as much as &#163;1 billion a year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last year another highly critical report from the Audit Commission said that councils were spending &#163;500m too much on pay, especially senior officials' pay. The report argued that, when councils' budgets are trimmed, "senior <font size=-1>HQ</font> staff often escape unscathed while the council freezes vacancies or cuts the number of front-line staff." In some councils, a junior librarian has eight levels of management above him. In the leaner ones, there are just four.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As a result of such poor management, councils' bills for white-collar staff rose almost twice as fast as average earnings in Britain between 1987 and 1993. Last year's report caused a rumpus, but its estimates were probably cautious. They were based on the assumption that councils could cut their pay bills by 5%; a few councils that had made a determined effort saved 10%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reluctance of many councils to get rid of their staff and to hand work over to private firms means that they are unlikely to be getting the best value for money. A study published on August 30th by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent think-tank, looked at how the cost of collecting household rubbish changed after the government forced councils to invite tenders from private firms to do the job. It found that, four years after compulsory tendering was introduced, those councils whose own workforce won the contract had cut their costs by 10%. Those who had given the contract to private firms were saving 20%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In spite of councils' protests, the government is pressing ahead with the expansion of compulsory tendering: one of the prime targets for this is councils' finance departments, which cost about &#163;2 billion a year to run. It is likely that a large proportion of this could be saved. For instance, the Audit Commission has found that it takes just two people to handle 100,000 invoices a year at some council offices; in others the same job is being done by 14 people.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One source of possible savings has so far received little attention: councils' spending on property. Birmingham council announced this month that it wanted to cut the office space it occupies by 20% this year, by encouraging more staff to work from home or to share desks. Housing-repair staff and hygiene inspectors are likely to be among the first to start working from home. The council aims to save &#163;2.5m in total over the next three years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why are so many councils hesitating to make the most of the scope they have for cutting costs? Almost all of the efficiency gains would mean job losses, and councillors have traditionally seen themselves as important providers of employment in their local area. Council staff are highly unionised, and would not accept big job cuts without a fight.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, councils suspect, with some justification, that the more they save now, the smaller the grant the government will give them in future. Since government grants provide more than 80% of councils' income, this is a considerable disincentive to making the hard decisions needed to achieve big savings.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain badly needs a better way to pay for local services. The Labour Party has said it wants to restore local-government powers, but has not said much about the increased financial accountability, and autonomy, this would entail. One of its few specific proposals on the matter is to abolish compulsory competitive tendering while requiring that councils "obtain best value for local residents" --an intriguing combination. After the poll-tax fiasco, there seems to be little enthusiasm in any political party for another set of drastic reforms.

<h1>Beware Geeks bearing gifts</h1>

<p>THE Internet is well known as a pioneer when it comes to technology. Less noticed is its role on the cutting edge of management fashion. Nowadays, it is fashionable for firms to "outsource" product development to just about everybody. Leading Internet firms have developed this method a stage further: they have found an outside supplier so keen to tender his services that he is sometimes willing to pay for the privilege. The name of this fool? The consumer.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The ruse is based on a Greek letter. Add "beta" to the name of any software package, and your product need no longer work as it should--or at all. It can be full of bugs, crashing constantly, sometimes taking the rest of your computer with it. If it does, too bad. Expect no refund. Rather than compensate users, the software maker asks them to spend hours documenting the faults--for free.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Beta software is work in progress, released provisionally. Over the past year, Microsoft and Netscape have managed to get millions of Internet surfers to download beta versions of their Web browsers and document the flaws. Netscape offered users a <font size=-1>T</font>-shirt for each serious bug they found; Microsoft offered nothing but the thrill of helping Bill Gates conquer the world.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a new twist, Microsoft even charged users $32 for the privilege of testing Windows 95 last year. Most other beta programs are free--but then so are most programs available on-line. And, unlike other free programs, beta software usually carries a time-bomb that disables it after a month or two.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So why accept it? Partly for fun. Partly because it is often the only way to keep up with the Internet. Since April, both Microsoft and Netscape have released two big upgrades of their browsers, with several beta versions in between. Web publishers adopted features from the newest beta versions to make their sites look better than the competition. Viewers with "old" versions of the browsers cannot see these innovations.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Internet software firms argue that the beta system helps to speed up innovation (although many users would love to take a break from the frantic upgrade cycles). It also lets them rush out unfinished work and claim that they have developed new features ahead of their competitors. If it doesn't work, you were warned--and could you help us fix it?

<p><b>Telecoms mergers</b></p>
<h1>Two Davids join</h1>
<p><b>America's latest huge telecoms merger may lead the way to full-scale competition in its local-call market</b></p>

<p>SINCE America opened its local-telephone markets earlier this year, the mighty firms that formerly monopolised the business--the so-called Baby Bells--have been jumping into bed together with an athleticism that belies their bulk. So far, the two biggest deals have been the mergers of Bell Atlantic with Nynex (whose combined market capitalisation is $44 billion) and Pacific Telesis with <font size=-1>SBC</font> Communications ($43 billion). By this standard, the $23 billion deal that was announced on August 26th is something of a tiddler. But the merger of WorldCom, a 13-year-old long-distance carrier from Mississippi, and <font size=-1>MFS</font>, a nine-year-old Nebraskan telecoms firm, is more significant than it looks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;WorldCom and <font size=-1>MFS</font> are two of America's new breed of telecoms companies. WorldCom is the country's fourth-largest long-distance carrier, and owns thousands of miles of fibre-optic circuits. <font size=-1>MFS</font> has local fibre-optic networks in 50 American cities. Thanks to its recent acquisition of <font size=-1>UUN</font>et Technologies for $2 billion, it is also the world's largest Internet access-provider. This will make the new firm, <font size=-1>MFS</font> WorldCom, the first American telephone company since <font size=-1>AT&T</font>'s break-up in 1984 to offer customers every sort of telephony: local, long-distance and (since this is 1996) Internet access.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One-stop shops are said to represent the future of the telecoms business. In the international market, firms have fallen over themselves to provide them through alliances such as Concert (which brings together Britain's <font size=-1>BT</font> and America's <font size=-1>MCI</font>), and Global One (America's Sprint, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom). Why is <font size=-1>MFS</font> WorldCom the first company to take the leap in America?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the face of it the answer is that, until this year's Telecommunications Act, none of the big companies was allowed to offer both local and long-distance service. But although they are now free to do so, none has rushed in. The reason is that the law treats full entry into the local market by any company that is not a Baby Bell as a trigger that allows the Bells to invade the long-distance carriers' turf. None of the long-distance companies has wanted to face this unprepared. Hence their interest in less-than-full entry into local-call markets.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under the new law, a potential competitor has three ways to enter the local-telephone market. It can buy the Baby Bells' local service at rates guaranteed to be 17-25% less than the price the Baby Bells charge their customers, and then resell it to its own customers. It can lease parts of the local network &#224; la carte, for instance by hiring the local Bell's wires but providing its own switches; the Federal Communications Commission then says how much the Bells can charge. Or it can try to build its own rival network.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first of these--resale--is easy but hardly profitable. A long-distance firm hoping to win local-calling business would probably have to offer customers at least a 15% discount to switch. Take out marketing and other costs, and that leaves little or no profit. A would-be competitor might use such cheap local calling as a loss-leader to sell customers an all-in-one telecoms package, including other more profitable services such as long-distance calling. But every time customers called for repairs and found a worker from the local Baby Bell at their door, one-stop-shopping would seem a bit of a sham.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The &#224; la carte option offers a competitor the opportunity of fat margins on the parts of the job it does itself. But it leaves the newcomer dangerously dependent on its main competitor for other services. Even if the Baby Bells try to be scrupulously honest in their dealings with such intruders, they may not be very good at it. As Dan Reingold, a telecoms analyst for Merrill Lynch, an investment bank, puts it: "You go into a restuarant that has always served a set meal that never varies and now you want to pick <font size=-1>A</font> from this menu and <font size=-1>B</font> from that. You wouldn't be surprised if they delivered the wrong dish to the wrong table."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The third option--for a competitor to build its own network--is the surest but also the most expensive. It is relatively cheap to lay a few long-distance lines, but wiring every home costs a fortune. Moreover, this is where the trigger comes in. The new law says that if a Baby Bell faces a significant "facilities-based" competitor (ie, one with large networks of its own) it is allowed to enter the long-distance market.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, Sprint and <font size=-1>MCI</font>, the big three long-distance companies, this has, until recently, seemed a reason for caution. Their basic plan has been to experiment with the &#224; la carte and resale options first. However, as the limits of these two approaches have become clearer, the advantages of building networks from scratch have increased.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With its new merger, WorldCom has a head start. <font size=-1>MFS</font> has already built more local telephone networks than any firm except the Baby Bells (and <font size=-1>GTE</font>, which acts like a Bell). Even so, the new firm's local-telephone networks will still be well short of the level needed to trigger the Bells' entry into the long-distance market.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By using <font size=-1>MFS</font>'s local networks, WorldCom will be able to bypass the local-access charges it pays to local-telephone companies in those regions, saving it as much as $400m a year. Likewise, among <font size=-1>MFS</font>'s highest costs are the charges it racks up sending calls long-distance between the cities in which it operates. After the merger, it will be able to transmit these on WorldCom's lines, saving up to $40m a year. And <font size=-1>UUN</font>et, <font size=-1>MFS</font>'s Internet subsidiary, will be able to shave up to 50% from its running costs by using WorldCom's lines.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now attention is turning to Teleport, an Oregon-based telecoms firm, which has put $1.2 billion worth of local networks in the ground--just 10% less than <font size=-1>MFS</font>. Teleport's share price has risen 50% in the past month. The question is not whether it will be snapped up, but which long-distance firm will be the one to do it.

<h1><center>Which Bill Clinton?</center></h1>

HE NOW has more yesterdays, he says, than tomorrows. Given that the speaker was one William Jefferson Clinton, election-campaigner <i>extraordinaire</i>, it can safely be assumed that such melancholy was intended only as a reflection on the passing of his 50th birthday and not also on his prospects for a second four-year term in the White House. His opinion-poll lead over the Republican challenger, Bob Dole, may have narrowed appreciably during the Republican Party's convention in San Diego, but next week President Clinton has the chance to widen it again with his own party's spell in the camera lens, at the Democrats' convention in Chicago. Mr Clinton's position remains strong. But he has some weaknesses to overcome.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Chief among them is his own lack of consistency. The joke made by a senior adviser to Mr Dole, that the much-touted differences between Bob Dole and Jack Kemp, his running-mate, are less than those between Bill Clinton and Bill Clinton, rings uncomfortably true. For sure, Mr Dole is also vulnerable to the charge of inconsistency, for a man once contemptuous of tax-cutting "supply-side" economics is now running on exactly that platform. Mr Clinton can, and should, exploit this, and point to the fact that if Mr Dole really intends to cut taxes and balance the budget at the same time he will need to trim back public-spending programmes which he claims will be preserved. Yet the trouble is that Mr Dole's underlying image, of experience, humility, even staidness, is likely to reassure. The abiding impression produced by Mr Clinton's inconsistency does not.
</p><p><b>His biggest weakness</b>
<br>It is that you never know what you are getting with Bill Clinton. In political terms he has posed as a New Democrat, an Old Democrat and now, in effect, a moderate Republican. His style has swung even more violently: at times he has been a clever, energetic activist; an undisciplined, sometimes disloyal leader; a man of principle; a man of pragmatism; an idealist determined to set a moral course for foreign policy; a realist intent on defending American interests; a man who talks to terrorists; a man who condemns them. A guessing game is under way to divine how a second-term Clinton might behave (see <a href="sf1.html">page</a>); revealingly, the clues lie more in the constraints surrounding him than in the man himself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This, rather than scandals about sex or money, is likely to become the real "character" issue in this election campaign. Mr Clinton is a likeable man, good at empathising with ordinary people, excellent at waxing presidential at times of national tragedy. But can you trust a man who has changed his stance so often? Do you even know what you are voting for?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton's task, beginning with his speech formally accepting his party's nomination, will be to challenge these doubts, to re-interpret them, even to redefine this weakness as a strength. This he must do by stressing that there is no shame in learning from your mistakes, that the whole point about experience is that it makes you change your ways. In that cause his half-century, with its associated implications of maturity and greyer hair, has proved uncannily timely.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, voters will still have to be convinced that the change is for real. Fortunately, the two areas in which the Republicans are likely to focus their attacks are also areas in which experience can usefully be displayed. The first is economic policy. Mr Dole's claim, typical for a challenger, is that America's economy is growing too slowly, that wages are stagnant, and that he has a magic bullet with which to improve things. The Old Clinton would not only respond by rubbishing Mr Dole's bullet; he would also try to find one of his own. The Experienced Clinton should react differently: the economy can and must grow faster, he can say, but there is no painless way to make this happen overnight. Taxes must be reformed to boost incentives and encourage savings; regulatory thickets must be hacked away; a president must stimulate, and co-operate with, state and local governments to improve education. Fiscal stability is an essential backdrop for this task--and would be threatened by the Dole plan.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second opportunity for Mr Clinton to try to prove that he has matured lies in foreign affairs. This poses a harder task, for a strong, clear position in matters of defence and foreign policy has of late been more naturally associated with Republican presidents (Nixon, Reagan, Bush) than with Democrats (Carter, Clinton). And it is traditionally assumed that elections are won more on domestic issues than by foreign entanglements; indeed, Mr Clinton ran and won on exactly that proposition in 1992. Yet foreign policy is where presidential character counts for most: not character as saintliness, but character as decisiveness, as clarity of thought and deed, as an ability to set priorities, as calm leadership at times of crisis.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Experienced Clinton will not be wishing for a crisis in which to prove himself. But he must nevertheless show that he has learned his foreign lessons, by defining the challenges America faces, and defining his priorities--such as security in Asia rather than human rights in China--to show that he now knows when not to intervene as well as when to act. For what is needed above all in foreign policy is consistency: needed by foreigners, so that they know what to expect; needed by Americans, so that they know why American money is being spent, or lives lost. And needed, more than anyone, by Bill Clinton.

<center><table width=65%><tr valign=top><td valign=top width=30%>


<p><h2>Kremlin chaos</h2></p>
<p><p>A bloodbath loomed in <b>Chechnya</b>, then seemed to recede, as another shaky ceasefire collapsed and Russian forces prepared to take back parts of the republic's capital, Grozny, captured by rebels earlier this month. Boris Yeltsin's defence adviser, Alexander Lebed, made a last-ditch attempt to stave off a resumption of full-scale war.
<p><b>Mr Yeltsin's health</b> continued to cause worry. After being invisible since his inauguration on August 9th, the president appeared on television and was reported to be working in the Kremlin. But it was unclear whether he was making day-to-day decisions. Mr Lebed suggested that the president's signature on an important decree on Chechnya had been faked.
<p>The five Nordic nations said they supported the efforts of the three <b>Baltic</b> <b>countries </b>to join <font size=-1>NATO</font>, though two of the Nordics, Finland and Sweden, are not members themselves. The chancellor of hitherto neutral Austria, Franz Vranitzky, said his country was in no hurry to join.
<p><b>Greece</b>'s Socialist prime minister, Costas Simitis, was expected to call an early general election, hoping to strengthen his parliamentary position.
<p>Magistrates in northern Italy want to investigate <b>Umberto Bossi</b>, leader of the separatist Northern League, on the ground that some of his speeches could have incited his followers to assault opponents of his party.
<p>The United States appears reluctant to <b>renegotiate the rent </b>for its 18th-century official residence in Moscow, fixed in 1985 at 70,000 roubles. Then it was worth about $60,000; inflation has whittled that down to $13.</p>
<p><h2>The Taiwan thorn</h2></p>
<p><p>Taiwan's relations with China were again under a cloud after President Lee Teng-hui suggested <b>slowing down investment </b>in China, which has amounted to $30 billion over the past eight years. China offered to resume direct shipping links and start political talks. But the Chinese were riled when the Taiwanese deputy president, Lien Chan, turned up in Europe, possibly seeking business and diplomatic ties.
<p>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>In unprecedented scenes of violence before the government presented its budget, <b>Australia</b>'s Parliament building in Canberra was attacked by several thousand people protesting against proposed trade-union reforms and cuts in government spending. But the stringent budget, which included a 10% cut in foreign aid, was welcomed by the markets.
<p>South Korean police stormed a Seoul university, arresting more than 5,000 students demanding <b>unification </b>with North Korea and the withdrawal of American troops.
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>The Philippine president, Fidel Ramos, and a Muslim leader, Nur Misuari, agreed on a deal designed to end 25 years of <b>civil war in Mindanao</b>, which has claimed more than 100,000 lives.
<p>The <b>Thai government </b>of Banharn Silpa-archa was under threat after the opposition proposed to censure him for alleged corruption and mismanagement.</p>
<p><h2>Apartheid apology</h2></p>
<p><p>The former president of South Africa, F.W. de Klerk, told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that he was sorry for <b>human-rights violations </b>under apartheid, but said he had never sanctioned killings.
<p>Thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees fled from camps in <b>Burundi </b>claiming persecution by the army. Thousands of Zairean Tutsis, their citizenship denied, were driven out of eastern Zaire.
<p>Riots in southern Jordan, after the government more than doubled the <b>bread price</b>, were suppressed by the security forces. King Hussein's hints at Iraqi involvement were greeted with scepticism.
<p>Fighting between <b>Kurdish</b> <b>factions </b>broke out in northern Iraq. One of the factions, led by Massoud Barzani, claimed Iran was helping the other, led by Jalal Talabani.
<p>Palestinians rejected the suggestion that Israel's long overdue redeployment in <b>Hebron</b> should be linked to the closure of Palestinian offices in East Jerusalem.
<p>A former Iranian president, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, claimed that the Iranian regime was planning to <b>assassinate </b>him. He was testifying in Berlin at the trial of five men accused of murdering members of the Iranian Kurdish opposition.</p>
<p><h2>The third man</h2></p>
<p><p><b>Ross Perot</b>, founder and bankroller of the Reform Party, won his party's nomination for president and said this time he would take federal matching funds for his campaign, rather than rely (as in 1992) on his own fortune.
<p>America's Green Party nominated<b> Ralph Nader</b>, a free-spirited consumer advocate, as its candidate for president. Mr Nader said he did not want any federal money for his campaign, and also declared that he would not run on the Green Party's platform.
<p>In <b>Peru</b>, a congressional committee backed a reform that might let President Alberto Fujimori win a third term.
<p>Tax rises proposed by <b>Argentina's</b> new economics minister led theoretically pro-government trade unions to threaten a fresh general strike. But gunfire disrupted a meeting to fix the details.
<p>An era ended in the <b>Dominican Republic</b>: right-wing President Joaquin Balaguer handed over, at the age of 88, after seven terms of office, to right-winger Leonel Fernandez, who promised wide-ranging privatisation.

<p><h2>Buba relents</h2>
<p><p>(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>The <b>German Bundesbank </b>trimmed its key short-term repo rate by 0.3% to 3%. The news helped to relieve pressure on the French franc, encouraging the Bank of France also to cut its intervention rate by 0.2% to 3.35%. The Federal Reserve had earlier decided to leave American short-term rates unchanged.
<p>Shares in <b>tobacco companies</b> fell yet again, on news that President Clinton was about to approve the Food and Drug Administration's proposals to regulate tobacco as a drug.</p>
<p><h2>Latin foray</h2></p>
<p><p><b>Chrysler</b>, the smallest of America's big three car makers, is venturing further into Latin America. It has announced a new $315m factory in Brazil to assemble pick-up trucks and build diesel engines, and another $65m investment to expand its $100m car plant in Argentina.
<p>Germany's smallest car maker, <b>Porsche</b>, which is looking for a partner to help finance a move away from luxury sports cars and into upmarket sports utilities, is talking to Mercedes-Benz. For Mercedes, which is about to produce a sports utility of its own in Alabama for America's buoyant market for such vehicles, the benefits are unclear--other than to take up slack capacity in some of its factories.
<p>First-half profits at <b>Volvo</b>, Sweden's biggest car maker, fell by 28% to SKr3.9 billion ($590m). The firm's car unit seems to be turning round; but its overall results were hit by losses at its American lorry-making arm.
<p>The Dutch government confirmed that Samsung Aerospace of South Korea is again visiting The Hague to discuss buying <b>Fokker</b>. The aircraft maker collapsed in March after its main shareholder, Deutsche Aerospace, pulled out.</p>
<p><h2>Heir today</h2></p>
<p><p><b>AT&T</b>'s heir-apparent quit suddenly, leaving America's long-distance telephone giant searching for another president and <font size=-1>CEO</font>. Alex Mandl, who was number two in the group for less than a year, was tempted away by the challenge of running a new wireless-communications venture.
<p><b>Coca-Cola's coup</b> in persuading Cisneros Bottling in Venezuela to switch allegiance from <b>PepsiCo</b> has boosted Coca-Cola's 10-15% share of the country's (admittedly small) soft-drinks market to 60%. A stunned PepsiCo said the move by Cisneros was illegal; Cisneros complained that PepsiCo had rejected its expansion plans.
<p>The battle for the <b>Internet </b>heated up further. Ten of America's biggest technology and communications companies agreed to set up a $100m venture-capital fund to finance start-ups developing products that use Java, an Internet programming language. Noticeably absent was Microsoft, which is promoting a competing standard.
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>Meanwhile, <b>Netscape</b>, which is battling with Microsoft for control of the market for Web browsers, accused the software giant of antitrust violations. It claims that Microsoft is charging some <font size=-1>PC</font> makers more for the Windows 95 operating system if they include Netscape's browser with their machines.
<p>(See <a href="wtw3.gif">chart</a>)<br><b>America's trade deficit</b> (in goods and services) with China overtook its deficit with Japan for the first time. The June figures showed that the deficit with China rose by nearly 9% in the month to $3.33 billion. The deficit with Japan grew only 3.6%, to $3.24 billion, down from the $5.34 billion it stood at a year ago. Overall, America's trade gap in June was some 24% narrower than a year earlier, at $8.11 billion.
<p>Pre-tax profits at <b>BSkyB</b> jumped by 66% to &#163;257m ($398m) in the year to end-June, with new subscribers rising by 900,000 to 5.5m in Britain and Ireland. The satellite broadcaster's revenues rose 30%, squeaking above &#163;1 billion for the first time.
<p>Germany's <b>Hoechst</b>, through its AgrEvo agrichemical unit, is taking over <b>Plant Genetic Systems </b>in a two-stage deal that values the Dutch-Belgian research group at around DM1 billion ($672m). The deal, said Hoechst, gives it "critical mass" in plant biotechnology, and puts paid to speculation that Hoechst was losing interest in agriculture.
<p><b>Alan Bond</b>, a one-time tycoon who won the America's Cup yacht race for Australia in 1983, was jailed for three years for fraud. The ownership of Manet's painting, "La Promenade" , had been shifted to benefit a private family company to the detriment of Bond Corp. Another former Australian tycoon, John Elliott, was acquitted on charges of defrauding the Elders group.
<p>The break-up of Britain's Thorn <font size=-1>EMI</font> into two separately listed companies brought two different reactions from investors.<b> EMI Group</b> quickly saw its share price leap as investors reckoned the now unencumbered music company was not only a good investment but could also be ripe for a bid. Shares in <b>Thorn</b>, the consumer-rentals side of the business, went the other way.
<p>Two of America's biggest companies in the fast-growing <b>manufactured-homes market </b>are coming together. Champion Enterprises of Michigan is paying about $328m for Dallas-based Redman Industries.
<p>One of the biggest property developers in the world, Texas-based <b>Hines</b>, paid <font size=-1>MACIF</font>, a French insurer, about FFr1.5 billion ($295m) for a 50% stake in seven shopping centres, one of which will be the largest covered mall in Europe.

<p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" width=78 height=39  alt="The Economist"></p>



<h1><center>Wobbly tigers</center></h1>
<p><b>East Asia's economies are experiencing growing pains</b></p>

TO EXCITED onlookers, the East Asian tigers seem to be tiring. Their export growth has slowed. Several are running alarming current-account deficits; some currencies have come under speculative assault. Attacks of political jitters, ranging from Seoul to Jakarta, make matters worse. Some foreign investors are nervously asking whether more Mexican meltdowns could be in the making (see <a href="fn1.html">page</a>). Others have concluded that the miracle years, at least, are over.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Recent figures lend the pessimists some plausibility. Thailand's exports rose only 7% in value in the first half of this year, compared with a 27% rise last year. China's exports have actually fallen. Malaysia and Thailand look like running current-account deficits of 10% and 8% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> respectively this year--similar to the deficit that undid Mexico. Across the region growth forecasts are being whittled down. This is grist to the mill not just of current gloomsters, but also of those who argue that the East Asian "miracle" was always a myth, based not on genuine leaps in efficiency but on huge and unsustainable increases in capital and labour inputs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet the pessimism is premature. In the long run, East Asian growth will almost certainly slow, as economies mature; but that run is still some way off. The tigers' current ills should be temporary, caused in part by weaker demand in the rich world, and in part by easily rectified policy mistakes at home. Sluggish demand in Europe and a stock overhang in America have cut demand for electronic goods--a big chunk of East Asian exports--just as over-capacity has depressed semiconductor prices. The recent rise in the dollar, to which many Asian currencies are in effect pegged, has eroded the tigers' competitiveness. Yet even after these have been reflected in downward growth revisions, East Asia will remain by far the world's fastest-growing region.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More disturbing than any of these ills has been the intemperate response of some governments. The Malaysian prime minister has hinted at import controls on non-essential goods. South Korea and Thailand have begun official campaigns to discourage luxury imports. Such prescriptions treat the symptoms, not the disease, and they could have dangerous side-effects in economies that are highly dependent on free trade. Ministers would do better to tighten their monetary and fiscal belts than to toss out their Italian ties.
</p><p><b>Chasing their tails</b>
<br>Two key distinctions between East Asia and Mexico are that Asians save more than Mexicans, and that their current-account deficits reflect an investment boom, not a spending spree. Yet investment is not always good (any more than consumption is always bad). Foreign-financed investment will pay only if it boosts countries' long-term export potential and so generates enough income to repay the debt. Several current projects--Malaysia's new administrative capital or the world's tallest building in Kuala Lumpur among them--look unlikely to do that.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even more seriously, exchange-rate policy has often undermined monetary control by making it hard to raise interest rates. Most East Asian governments have held their exchange rates low to keep exports competitive. But heavy inflows of capital in recent years have caused rapid monetary expansion, which has in turn triggered inflation or higher imports. Easier money has also facilitated unwise investment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The correct cure is for governments to run even tighter fiscal policies to dampen domestic demand, and to unshackle their currencies. Thanks to current market nervousness, some currencies, such as the Thai baht, would probably fall at first. But in the medium term they would be likely to rise; unlike the Mexican peso in 1994, most East Asian currencies are undervalued. That may sound counterintuitive when their economies are running massive current-account deficits, but these reflect an excess of investment over domestic savings, not an overvalued exchange rate.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What about East Asian governments' fears that exchange-rate appreciation could further hammer their exports? Japan shows that this need not happen. Its exchange rate has risen strongly over the past two decades, with, until recently, few ill-effects on exports. Indeed, it is normal for emerging economies that are seeing rapid productivity growth to experience a rise in their real exchange rates. This can come about via higher inflation or, better, through an appreciation in the nominal exchange rate. Hobbled tigers may easily trip over; free tigers are less likely to.

<h1>Modesty ablaze</h1>

<p><b>In a new book this week, and at the Democratic convention next, Bill Clinton is putting his grand vision for leading America into the next millennium. Translated into practical policy, his agenda looks unambitious</b></p>


<p>NOT for Bill Clinton a quiet family gathering to mark his 50th birthday. No, on the eve of his birthday last Sunday the president celebrated with cocktails for 200 at the Sheraton in New York, a glitzy gala at Radio City (linked by satellite to parties at 89 other places), and finished up with a modest $10,000-a-plate dinner for 700 at the Waldorf-Astoria. There was a jumbo cake and a jumble of celebrities--Whoopi Goldberg, Tony Bennett, Aretha Franklin, Kenny Rogers, Shania Twain and many more. There was also the obligatory Clintonian tear, shed as his elementary-school teacher from Hot Springs, Arkansas recalled how she gave a busybody Clinton, aged seven, a <font size=-1>C</font> for conduct.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Here, you might think, was a fitting reflection of what America has learnt to associate with Clintonism: entertaining and irrepressible, yet prone to excess and full of baby-boomer self-indulgence. And inseparable from politics. The festivities raised an estimated $10m for the Democratic Party. But Mr Clinton is hard to pigeon-hole. Lest his partying seem a tad too ostentatious, he humbly spent his actual birthday with his vice-president rebuilding a burnt-down black church in Tennessee.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The president's half-century is emblematic in a subtler way. At 50, he looks different from the boyish Mr Fizz who came to the White House effervescent with energy and ideas; the face bears more lines, the hair is greyer, the eyes seem more sunken. He jokes about being eligible for membership of the American Association for Retired Persons. He reflects wistfully that being 50 means "more yesterdays than tomorrows". Ironically, the president (as well as his much older challenger) is having to contemplate the limits of age.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And his presidency has had to adjust to the age of limits. The office has given Mr Clinton a painful lesson in the politics of scarcity. He came to the White House bearing too many promises that he could not deliver. He was the self-advertised agent of change who became a veto-wielding change-resister, bent on restraining Republican revolutionaries. He championed a 1,400-page health-care reform, one of the greatest expansions of federal power since the New Deal, only to declare the era of big government over and to end the federal guarantee of welfare for the poor that had existed since before he was born.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Three powerful constraints have been at work. First, Mr Clinton won in 1992 with only 43% of the popular vote, a relatively weak mandate. It should have led him to reach across the party divide to build support for his proposals. Instead, Democrats in Congress persuaded him even before he reached the White House that they could work without Republican help. Mr Clinton's reward for overreaching was the rejection of his health-care plan and a fist in the face from voters, who in 1994 gave Republicans control of both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hence the second constraint: a Republican-run Congress that has largely set the agenda since early 1995. Mr Clinton turned out to be rather adept in his new role of counter-puncher to the Republicans. Still, to paraphrase the president, the era of big Clinton proposals was over.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Big proposals anyway tend not to come cheap, and in deficit-cutting times money is hard to find. The federal budget is the third big constraint on Mr Clinton. Once the federal government has paid for defence, debt interest and its commitments to health care for the elderly and other "entitlements", less than one-fifth of the budget remains for discretionary spending. Not much there for a would-be government activist like Mr Clinton to play with.
</p><p><b>Clinton being Clinton</b>
<br>All this should help to concentrate the minds of people puzzling over the sort of president Mr Clinton would be if he were to win another term in November (as polls still predict, see <a href="sf1.gif">chart</a>). In Washington, it is fashionable to begin such speculation by wondering how Mr Clinton would behave when, for once, he no longer had to think about his next election. He has been running for some office or other ever since, as a 16-year-old, he worked the dormitories at Camp Robinson in Arkansas to be elected one of his state's "senators" to the Boys Nation in Washington, <font size=-1>DC</font>. This year Mr Clinton never actually bothered to make a formal announcement of his re-election bid; it hardly seemed necessary for a president often caricatured as running a "permanent campaign" anyway.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If he wins, runs the speculation, could Clinton finally be Clinton? And what would that mean? Over the past four years he has variously seemed a New Democrat, an Old Democrat, and even an imitation Republican. He has been ill-disciplined and tightly controlled, a reformer and protector of the status quo. Republicans fantasise that an unfettered Clinton would be a liberal (to non-Americans, a social democrat) like his wife, Hillary, or his deputy chief of staff, Harold Ickes. Others fondly believe that he would be an unabashed centrist like Dick Morris, a consultant who has masterminded his return to favour.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such speculation is fun but largely fruitless (given the difficulty of tying down a man who is fraternising with stars one day and banging nails into church beams the next). It also misses the point, which is that even a Clinton free of campaign calculus would in all probability face much the same constraints that have shaped his first four years in the White House. In a three-way race, polls now show him gravitating back towards 43% of the vote. The chances that the Democrats will recapture both houses of Congress are slim (see <a href="am1.html">page</a>). And the budget arithmetic remains as stubborn as ever.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So detective work on a second-term Clinton starts with these constraints and then looks for other clues. Clues come from the pattern of other second-term presidencies, from Mr Clinton's record in his first term, from his agenda for another and from his new book "Between Hope and History" (Times Books). Taken together, they point to a curious hybrid, a mixture of Millennium Bill, orator-in-chief for a dawning "age of possibility", and Modesty Bill, born-again incrementalist in an age of constraint.
</p><p><b>If at first you succeed, try again</b></b>
<br>From George Washington to Ronald Reagan, the experience of presidential second terms has often been poor. The pattern is of disappointment or downright failure: re-elected Eisenhower achieved little; Nixon resigned in disgrace; the Reagan revolution happened in his first year. It is all too easy to see how a second-term Clinton could conform to the pattern.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Scandals such as Watergate and Iran-Contra are all too common in second terms. And with Whitewater and several similar matters unresolved, it does not take much to imagine a re-elected Clinton engulfed by scandal. The Clintonites hope they might have got some of these second-term blues out of the way in their first term. But since an independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, is still sifting through the evidence of Whitewater and the rest, that hope may be vain. The problem that scandal reveals is often hubris, a sense among people in a re-elected administration that they can now do anything they want--like pack the Supreme Court, to take the example of Franklin Roosevelt. Who would think the Clinton White House to be hubris-free?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are other pitfalls. Staff turnover tends to be high, and sometimes highly disruptive. The Reagan White House lost much of its effectiveness with the appointment of Donald Regan as chief of staff. The day after Nixon's re-election in 1972, his chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman, demanded letters of resignation from all cabinet officers and sub-cabinet appointees. It would be no surprise to see a big exodus of exhausted veterans of the first Clinton term.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Second-term presidents are wont to think increasingly about their place in history, and accordingly gravitate more and more towards foreign policy. That has already begun to happen with Mr Clinton, prompted by the loss of initiative in domestic policy to the Republican Congress. Conventional wisdom says second-termers have about two years to get any serious domestic legislation done, after which they become lame ducks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is awkward, for second-termers may lack the agenda and the verve for swift action. Most are returned to office not for what they promise to do but for what they have already done. As Chuck Jones of the University of Wisconsin observes, the past three re-elections (Eisenhower, Nixon and Reagan) have been strikingly similar: they were "approval elections", in which the president wins overwhelmingly while an opposing Congress is also voted back. Now, voters seem to like the job done by President Clinton and the Republican Congress, after initial stand-offs and government shutdowns. In a recent poll by <font size=-1>USA </font>Today/<font size=-1>CNN</font>/Gallup, 64% said they counted Mr Clinton's first term a success.
</p><p><b>The record so far</b>
<br>History, then, suggests that, even if he is re-elected, Mr Clinton's finest achievements may already be behind him. No matter. In "Clinton: The President They Deserve" (Fourth Estate, forthcoming), Martin Walker of Britain's <i>Guardian</i> newspaper argues that Mr Clinton has already achieved nothing less than a post-cold-war reordering of America's policy consensus. During his presidency, Mr Walker claims, Democrats and Republicans have come round to broadly similar views about leaner and meaner government at home, and free trade abroad. Mr Clinton read and (not surprisingly) admired Mr Walker's book.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The depth of this consensus is open to argument. So is whether Democrats or Republicans deserve most credit for it. But what is certain is that over the past four years Mr Clinton has come to adopt (or co-opt) some core Republican policies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;True, the process has often been chaotic. Mr Clinton campaigned as a social conservative but soon got bogged down in issues such as gays in the military and political correctness in cabinet appointments. For too long, the Clinton White House was a place of rambling meetings, run by a president who talked too much, tried to please too many people and micro-managed too many decisions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His policy reversals were numerous and ignominious. Having promised a middle-class tax cut, he raised taxes (only to let slip long afterwards that he thought he had raised them too much). He promoted a $30-billion stimulus package, which he later privately derided as "pure pork". (Thankfully, the pig was killed by Republicans in Congress.) His welfare reform arrived too late and, he subsequently confessed, was too weak. After projecting budget deficits as far as the eye could see, he suddenly converted to the Republican cause of a balanced budget by 2002. Above all, he saw health-care reform--the country's most urgent priority, he said, and his central piece of legislation--go down in flames.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet Mr Clinton has also shown himself to be resilient and capable of learning on the job. In foreign affairs, he has grown into the job through his stumble into Haiti (a tentative success) and his better-late-than-never intervention in Bosnia (ditto). He bravely defied public opinion to come to Mexico's aid in 1995. His peacemaking efforts in the Middle East and Northern Ireland have run into trouble, but he has gained kudos for trying. Few would have thought it when he came to power--and fewer still after America's public humiliation in Somalia--but it is no longer absurd to talk of Mr Clinton as a foreign-policy president.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At home, he has discovered a gift for sounding presidential at times of national tragedy, such as the bombing in Oklahoma City and the crash of <font size=-1>TWA </font>flight 800. He has learnt to use the presidential bully pulpit to talk eloquently about social issues, especially race. And over time, with both Democratic and Republican Congresses, he has signed a swathe of legislation, ranging from gun controls to health-care portability, and rises in the earned-income tax credit and the minimum wage.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The result is that Mr Clinton's record of achievement so far looks better than that of his Democratic presidential predecessor, Jimmy Carter. Three big pieces of legislation stand out. True, two of them--the passage of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (<font size=-1>NAFTA</font>) in 1993 and the recent welfare reform ("ending welfare as we know it")--were Republican-inspired and involved the president in an agonising confrontation with his own political supporters. But it took Mr Clinton to deliver enough Democratic votes for these measures, much as it took Nixon to go to China. The third, the budget battle of 1993, Mr Clinton won by the thinnest possible margin against unified Republican opposition. It was the basis of a fiscally prudent macroeconomic strategy that has paid off.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under the Clinton administration, the budget deficit has shrunk by more than half and (with a little help from American enterprise and Alan Greenspan's Fed) the economy has grown steadily, while inflation has remained in check. Americans have created more than 10m new jobs and unemployment, 7.1% of the workforce when Mr Clinton came to power, is down to 5.4%. The stockmarket has soared and the "misery index"--the unemployment, inflation and interest rates combined--is the lowest for nearly three decades.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is a decent record, but one that leaves Mr Clinton curiously short of ideas for the next four years. He has become the don't-rock-the-boat candidate, a bulwark against Republican excess. He has been criss-crossing the country with a collection of small but popular initiatives, promoting school uniforms or youth curfews, or brokering deals that give free cellular telephones to neighbourhood-watch schemes or give parents more control over what their children see on television. Little presidential initiatives seem to go down big: Mr Clinton's espousal of family leave (rules requiring firms to give parents time off for say, taking their children to the doctor) have been immensely popular.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So the Democratic Party he leads calls for smaller government and for a "moderate, achievable, commonsense agenda". In the age of limits, Mr Clinton has scaled himself back to the point where he no longer has any Big Idea. He is Modesty Bill.
</p><p><b>The agenda</b>
<br>That is not the way the president presents himself, of course. At the Democratic convention, he will bundle up his little ideas into something grander, complete with the vision thing. Happily for him, a second term would take him into 2001. Enter Millennium Bill, ready to define the quality of life Americans want in the 21st century.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And what might that be? Peace and prosperity, apparently. The two are related in the Clintonian vision: peace abroad requires a robust American economy. So a second term would see Mr Clinton galloping after various peace-making initiatives and adding new ones where opportunity arose, say, in Cyprus (presumably, he will have a more vigorous foreign-policy team to help him do this).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As for prosperity, in his new book, Mr Clinton reiterates his familiar mantra: "opportunity, responsibility, community". In so far as this meant anything in the first term, it boiled down to putting America's macro-economy into some sort of order. The second term, says the president's spokesman, Michael McCurry, would be about the micro-economy--about pay cheques and the details that affect "real" living standards.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The budget-balancing effort would continue, but education--which White House officials dub the key to higher living standards--would be at the heart of Clinton-2. Here the president has a blizzard of proposals: a $1,500 tax credit to help give all Americans the chance of at least two years in college; more money for public-school infrastructure and for pre-school programmes; encouragement for schemes that put computers in classrooms and keep schools safe.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sensible as this sounds, there is only so much that a president can do for education, which is mainly the responsibility of state and local governments. The federal government controls only 6% of America's education budget. Mr Clinton's own Treasury Department reckons that the best way to improve living standards for the middle classes is to have policies--such as further trade liberalisation--which make sense for the economy as a whole.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton might go for a bit more incremental health-care reform. He would like to promote portable pensions and campaign-finance reform (especially if Ross Perot, a third-party candidate, runs strongly on the issue). But overall it is the modesty of the once-expansive Mr Clinton's agenda that is so striking.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Will he be content for things to stay that way? The activist in him (and in Hillary) will surely seek outlets. If the era of big government is over, for example, might he not explore the possibilities of "smart" government? He has talked of "a different kind of government activism", of "rule-making", of a president's scope for doing "an awful lot of things by executive action" . The danger in this is that the president would revert to the sort of busybody behaviour that earned him a <font size=-1>C</font> for conduct back in second grade. He might become a meddler burdening his country with rules that cost money and, perhaps, intrude on civil liberties.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An alternative possibility could lie in another characteristic that affects second-term presidents: the tendency to focus on their place in history. Such long-term thinking has not been much in evidence in Clinton-1. But it might conceivably lead Clinton-2 to begin the necessary debate on reforming Social Security and other entitlements which threaten to cripple American taxpayers in the next century. Launching a reform of such magnitude would be unpopular and politically perilous. That is why it is conspicuously absent from his book. But it is the towering task for a true 21st-century president.

<h1>The speaker vanishes</h1>


<font size=1>SKIPPACK, PENNSYLVANIA</font>

ONE of the more substantial stories of the recent Republican convention in San Diego was that Newt Gingrich, the radical Speaker of the House, had done a disappearing act. Early this year, after Mr Gingrich's drive to balance the budget had resulted in a government shutdown, polls suggested that his unpopularity surpassed that of Richard Nixon during Watergate. So Mr Gingrich spoke only briefly in San Diego, and not during prime time. The stage was occupied instead by moderate Republicans more likely to charm undecided voters.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Gingrich's vanishing has nothing on Jon Fox, a Republican Congressman from Pennsylvania. On August 15th Mr Fox's campaign manager, Linda Gerhard, told your correspondent that she was not sure where her candidate was. On August 16th she said the same. The next day--a Saturday, and so a prime campaigning day--she professed unchanging ignorance. A couple of hours later, your correspondent attended an agricultural fair in Mr Fox's district. Funnily enough, the missing congressman was there as well, tugging at a poor goat's udders in a speed-milking competition.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Besides dodging the press, Mr Fox has grown wary of meetings with constituents. He generally gets on well with local folk, and was once pronounced (by the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>) "the zen master of constituency service". But Mr Fox is no longer loved by all, thanks to his links to the disappearing Mr Gingrich. Last year Mr Fox supported the speaker's plan to rein in the cost of Medicare, the health programme for the old. Enraged pensioners have heckled Mr Fox, and picketed his meetings. They have driven a steamroller up to his door, a gentle appeal not to steam-roll senior citizens. Now Mr Fox's staff refuses to tell callers where he plans to speak, lest seniors heckle him again. His tea ceremonies have become almost private affairs, with carefully selected audiences.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such Republican disappearances encourage Democrats to talk of winning back the House of Representatives this November. Two years ago, with Mr Gingrich very much in view, the Republicans took control of the House for the first time since 1952. They managed this by turning a host of disparate local campaigns into a national referendum on the unpopular President Clinton. Now, however, Mr Clinton's standing has improved, and his place as public demon has been taken by Mr Gingrich. This is what gives the Democrats their hope of winning back the House--though the Senate, which always kept its distance from Mr Gingrich's schemes, seems likely to remain Republican.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Democrats draw courage from House elections past. The Republicans currently hold 236 seats to the Democrats' 198, so if 20 seats changed hands they would lose their majority. This seems within reach: 12 of the 25 elections since the second world war have produced a swing this size or bigger (see <a href="am1.gif">chart</a>). Moreover, House landslides have a way of reversing themselves. Democrats gained 38 seats in 1964, only to lose 47 seats in 1966; Republicans gained 33 seats in 1980, but lost 26 seats two years later. This time round, 77 Republican congressmen are defending seats in districts that Mr Clinton carried for the Democrats in 1992. A Democratic victory, reversing the Republican landslide of two years ago, seems altogether possible.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Democrats' main targets are the 73 Republicans elected for the first time in 1994. The freshman class voted faithfully for Mr Gingrich's efforts to rein in federal spending and so balance the budget. For this generally honourable effort, they got little thanks: one poll found that 45% of Americans saw them as "extremists". Twenty-nine of the freshmen were elected last time with 55% or less of the vote: their seats would be more than enough to return the House to the Democrats. To press their advantage, the Democrats have linked House freshmen to Mr Gingrich in thousands of television ads. Some of the targets are losing their nerve: Mr Fox's disappearing act does not bespeak much confidence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And yet, in an equally telling way, Mr Fox's opponent is also concealing something. His name is Joe Hoeffel, and he too was milking goats at the Saturday fair, a bit more speedily than his rival. Afterwards he munched a hamburger, shook some hands, and headed off to a supermarket that had the two qualities campaigners seek: a lot of people, and only one exit. As shoppers emerged, Hoeffel leaflets were shoved into already overladen hands. You had to read the leaflet very carefully indeed to see that Mr Hoeffel is a Democrat.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This hiding of party label has an important purpose. Registered Republican voters outnumber Democrats in the district by two to one. So, although Mr Fox squeaked home in 1994 with just 49% of the vote--making him one of the freshmen-to-beat if the Democrats' hope of a reverse landslide is to be realised--he still has a huge advantage. Again, Mr Clinton carried the district in 1992, making it one of the 77 that Democrats count as winnable. But the truth is that Mr Clinton's narrow victory that year was largely thanks to the independent candidacy of Ross Perot, who drained the Republican vote. In 1988, in a two-man race, George Bush carried the district comfortably.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In short, Mr Fox's disappearing act illustrates the Democrats' ground for hope, but Mr Hoeffel's subterfuge shows why these hopes may well be disappointed. The Gingrich brigades are unpopular for now, but the dominant current of the past 15 years favours the Republican Party. More and more Americans live in the suburbs, fear crime, resent tax, hate government. This explains why, since 1988, Republicans have signed up 4.2m new members in the 28 states that register voters by party, whereas the Democratic Party has added only 1.4m. It also helps to explain why Republicans held the presidency from 1981 until 1993, and why even the victorious Mr Clinton was backed by only 43% of the voters.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a time, the Democrats retained control of the House despite this Republican advance. This was because the South, though willing to support Republican presidential candidates, retained strong ties to sitting Democratic congressmen. Gradually, however, these old timers are stepping down or switching parties. Younger Democrats can no longer count on tradition and civil-war memories to carry them to power. Their constituents are letting their social conservatism, not their historical consciousness, guide their choice of party.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This year alone, some 30 Democrats are retiring from the House, six of them from Texas. Republicans reckon this Texodus, together with other upsets in the old Confederate states, gives them a chance to expand their House majority. Democrats may pick up a seat or two in the liberal north-east; the west and mid-west look balanced. John Morgan, a Republican demographer whose predictions in 1994 proved uncannily correct, reckons his party will pick up a total of ten seats or so this November.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To frustrate this prediction, the unpopularity of Mr Gingrich and his party will have to be extreme. The signs are that it is fading. Bob Dole is doing better in the presidential race, which should encourage more Republican voters to turn out, so helping congressional candidates. In January an <font size=-1>ABC</font>/<i>Washington Post </i>poll, which asked voters which party's candidates they would be more inclined to send to the House, put Republicans nine points behind the Democrats; this month the gap was just three points. Until recently, Democrats were planning to attack House Republicans for not passing any laws. But Republicans have just scored a number of successes, notably welfare reform. They can no longer be accused of running a do-nothing Congress.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the time being, therefore, the House Republicans are feeling smug. But the past half-century has shown how volatile House elections have been, how mysterious the motives of voters. Outside the single-exit supermarket, Mr Hoeffel handed a leaflet to a muscular, dyed-blond man, who responded with a series of obscenities. For a full minute the car park echoed with his shouts, while his wife looked on nervously. Then the man got into his car, drove back up to the supermarket door and yelled: "I'm voting for you."

<h1>Trends of the week</h1>


<p><b>Bounce:</b> Most polls showed Bob Dole sharply narrowing the gap with Bill Clinton, thanks to a smoothly choreographed Republican convention and his well-received acceptance speech. But Mr Clinton can expect his own bounce at the Democrats' convention in Chicago.
<p><b>Turn-off</b>: Only 17.9m viewers tuned in to the networks' coverage of Bob Dole's speech at the Republican convention, 34% fewer than watched the closing session at the 1992 Houston convention.
<p><b>Air wars</b>: The Dole-Kemp campaign, out of money and outgunned in the airwaves in recent months, at last got its hands on $61.8m of federal funds and started firing back with its first new television advertisement since the spring.
<p><b>Tax wars: </b>Claim and counter-claim over which was the biggest tax increase in history: Clinton's in 1993, says the Dole campaign; Dole's in 1982 (when he chaired the Senate Finance Committee), counter the Clintonites.
<p><b>Nominations: </b>The Green Party picked Ralph Nader, a consumer advocate, as presidential candidate. Mr Nader wants grass-roots activists to challenge America's "corrupted" political duopoly. The new Reform Party, also challenging the duopoly, nominated Ross Perot.
<p><b>Issues of the week:</b> Ecofeminism and earth spirituality, both to be found on the Green agenda, to Mr Nader's intense discomfort.
<p><b>Dubious counting: </b>Ross Perot's votes, Bill Clinton's golf round, Bob Dole's spending cuts.
<p><b>Publishing sensation: </b>"Between Hope and History: Meeting America's Challenges for the 21st Century", by Bill Clinton (co-author of the 1992 blockbuster, "Putting People First" ). A must for wavering voters at $16.95.
<p><b>Song</b>: "Happy Birthday, Mr President".

<h1>The warder of the nation</h1>

<font size=1>HAVANA</font>
<p>THE knock on the door came in the middle of the night. Two plain-clothes men entered the home of the startled Cuban family, and dragged away the American who had just rented a room from them. Dozens of other visitors were caught in the dragnet that eerie night and hauled off to be questioned at a crumbling mansion known as "the centre for the control of foreigners".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The official in charge, with the patience of a man relishing his power, explained that foreigners simply must not move out of hotels into private homes. Nor may they rent private cars from locals. Never mind that the law does not forbid Cubans to make money this way, and that plenty have been doing it openly for months. After a few tense hours, the American was dumped back at his hotel, with the comment: "How else can we maintain control?"
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fidel Castro clearly has no intention of easing his grip. The end of the Soviet Union and of its subsidies forced him to allow a bit of capitalism, and a smaller dose of political freedom. But neither is welcome. The Cubans this week kicked out an American diplomat whose support of political dissidents had long irritated them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some of Mr Castro's enemies believe outside pressure can finish him. President Clinton has just appointed a senior envoy to drum up international support for the Helms-Burton law, which seeks to punish companies that invest in Cuba. But the United States' bully-boy tactics have outraged its friends. And the impact of American sanctions seems likely to be diminished by a slow economic recovery now under way in Cuba. As Mr Castro well knows, the real threat is from within.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He has never faced serious political opposition in Cuba. One reason is that an extensive network of informants ensures that none gets organised. Another is that the natural leaders of any opposition have mostly fled the country. The groups that did emerge could muster few followers: an old joke calls them "bicycle clubs", because all the members can fit on one.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When these groups at last organised themselves last year into a united front, called Concilio Cubano, the government watched warily. Infighting, prodded along by infiltrators, might have done for the group anyway. But as it gained momentum and support abroad early this year, the regime cracked down. Some 150 members were detained before it could hold its first official meeting in February; key organisers remain in prison. Dissidents vow to fight on, but the break-up of Concilio has turned them once again into isolated voices.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One human-rights advocate, pointing out a spy in the park across from his house, explains that activism in the interior is much harder than in Havana, with its bustle of people and friendly embassies. A movement for academic freedom was recently crushed. An activist says students and university staff in Havana are ripe for organising--but what can she do from the remote province to which she has been banished? The frightened mother of a persecuted journalist clings to the telephone number of a Concilio contact, written on her palm in case she is suddenly abducted.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A bigger threat to the system than political dissidence, argues Vladimir Roca, himself a brave voice of dissent, may be the arrival of a bit of free enterprise. The regime has legalised the dollar and self-employment--but then has clamped down on the result. When hundreds of tiny caf&eacute;s appeared, offering tastier fare than the state-run restaurants, they were hit with hefty taxes, seating limits and frequent inspections, to keep the market spirit within bounds. Farming has been partially freed. There is more food around, and more farmers and middlemen with money. So now this too is under threat. The same fear explains the clampdown on private car and room rentals, and on prostitution, widespread and tolerated two years ago.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While the more open-minded officials and academics have been receiving conference invitations, scholarships and other support from abroad, hardliners are worried. Raul Castro, Fidel's brother, calls those who want faster economic reform the "fifth column" of the Mafia and the <font size=-1>CIA</font>, and since March has been shoving them aside.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The regime is not alone in its concern about the impact of capitalism. The voice of Jose Conrado, the priest of Palma Soriano in eastern Cuba, was nearly drowned out by the pounding drums and raucous revelry of the carnival around his church last week. But the excesses of the annual bacchanalia bother him less than the "grave moral decay born of the economic situation" . The dual economy has forced Cubans to do anything--from engaging in prostitution to stealing from their employers--to make a dollar, he argues, for without that a family simply cannot eat.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A red banner in El Cobre, near the eastern city of Santiago, proclaims <i>Ayer, hoy y siempre</i>--yesterday, today and forever. It is not promoting communism, though, but another revolution slowly taking shape. The banner hangs at Cuba's holiest Catholic shrine. The growing moral emptiness of Castroism has led to a sharp rise in church attendance, both Catholic and Protestant, notably among the young. Initiations into <i>santeria</i>, a variety of cults derived from Africa, are on the rise. But here the regime is tolerant; it sees capitalism as a far more immediate threat.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even there it may be wrong: such capitalism as exists may in the end serve as a lifeline. But one threat is inescapable. A billboard in Granma province, depicting the heroes of the revolution, declares: <i>Ayer, hoy y ma&ntilde;ana--</i>yesterday, today and tomorrow<i>.</i> But it stops short of <i>siempre</i>. Even Fidel is not immortal. The revolution began in Granma, and support for it and the great leader remains strong there. Till when? Few believe the regime can long outlast the death of the one man who supplies its mystique. This month he turned 70.
