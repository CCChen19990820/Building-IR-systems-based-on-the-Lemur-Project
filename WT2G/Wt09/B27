<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
Around 1985 the spread of HIV among injecting drug users (IDUs) in the Netherlands 
became a serious concern to policy makers, drug service agencies and users themselves, 
organized in so called Junkie Unions. The first AIDS prevention initiatives, aimed at IDUs 
were established by these pressure or interest groups of drug users. In Amsterdam the AIDS 
inspired needle exchange was initiated by the MDHG, a user-based organization in 1984. The 
earliest AIDS prevention leaflet for drug users in the Netherlands was produced by the 
Rotterdam Junkie Union. Already in 1981 this union was distributing clean syringes and 
needles at places in the drug scene where IDUs gathered to prevent the spread of hepatitis. 
When it became apparent that HIV would also mean a menace to Dutch IDUs the Rotterdam 
Junkie Union immediately started a needle exchange. This was long before the municipal 
needle exchanges opened. At first, these activities were exposed to firm opposition from the 
police, the treatment agencies and the municipal authorities. Insight in the magnitude of the 
AIDS epidemic was yet to come about at these levels. In Rotterdam, where this research was 
conducted, the municipal needle exchange system was established in the first half of 1987. 
This rather late start was due to resistance in some parts of the treatment system. Among 
other arguments, it was felt that needle exchange would encourage injecting and undermine 
drug free treatment (1). Nowadays, these arguments are generally seen as obsolete and, more 
important, they have proven to have no scientific basis (2). At the end of 1986 HADON, an at 
that time small and experimental outreach and drug information program, took the initiative 
and set up a needle exchange. Soon the rest of the city was to follow.
<p>
In Rotterdam, as in many other Dutch cities, needle exchanges are predominantly tied to the 
methadone programs, mainly methadone maintenance programs. The advantage of this 
Rotterdam approach is that these programs are in contact with approximately 1000 regular 
heroin users (both smokers and IDUs) on a daily basis. However, estimates of the number of 
heroin users in Rotterdam vary between 2500 and 3500, (3, 4) not counting those drug users 
from the suburbs, that are also oriented on Rotterdam, both for drugs and help. The 
proportion of IDUs is approximately 25% for both in and out of treatment groups (5). 
Although the needle exchanges at the methadone programs are open to non-clients, few 
actually use them. This means that on a daily basis at least 60 % to 70% of the target group is 
not reached by the municipal needle exchange system. Additionally, the composition of the in 
treatment cohort is often subject to rapid changes (4). Furthermore many users have switched 
from heroin to cocaine as their drug of preference (6) and for this reason methadone 
presumably has become less valuable for them. Based on these grounds the outreach and 
information project HADON, which in 1989 fused with the Odyssee foundation, made 
reaching hidden populations of active out of treatment drug users, generally the unreached, 
into its main AIDS prevention priority. This chapter gives a brief description of the working 
methods of this project and present some results of the pilot evaluation study conducted.

<b>Program Description</b>
<p>
HADON is a neighborhood-based information program providing outreach, prevention and 
referral services to active out of treatment IDUs in the north of Rotterdam. The program 
started in 1985: before the health implications of the AIDS epidemic among the IDU 
population were generally acknowledged in Rotterdam. Due to this evolving epidemic the 
priority of the program has been shifted towards the prevention of HIV transmission. Besides 
the contacts in the project's storefront premises, the outreach workers visit on a regular base 
many places in the scene called User collectives. The outreach workers supply the attendants 
of these places with clean needles, condoms and up-to-date information on HIV/AIDS. The 
uniqueness of the program lies in its two-tiered organization of needle exchange. In addition 
to supplying these prevention materials in the storefront and while doing outreach, the 
workers stimulate certain key persons to exchange needles at their user collectives. This 
approach was initiated after several program attendants requested large numbers of needles, 
explaining they lived together with several other active IDUs. These user collectives are 
frequently visited by other IDUs from the same or related networks. Thus, visitors can 
exchange individual needles (individual exchange) or, upon  special agreement, exchange 
containers of used needles for boxes of 100 new needles (collective exchange). The 
containers are plastic and can hold approximately 200 used needles. The HADON collective 
exchange tier has been experimentally initiated in order to determine if the outreach 
component of the program could be extended and improved. Secondarily, the experiment 
examined if the motivation of visitors could be reinforced through stimulating a willingness 
to both exchange and collect used needles and take more responsibility, not only for their own 
individual health, but also for the health of their IDU peers. This second aspect is based on 
the observation that social support is a common phenomenon in user networks, as was 
demonstrated in previous chapters.

<b>Methods</b>
<p>
In this pilot evaluation study needle exchange contacts of the HADON program were 
registered. For each exchange contact the program staff registered date, minimal 
demographics the number of needles and containers dispensed and the number of needles 
returned. 
<p>
The collective exchange was defined as "making available large amounts of sterile needles 
and sharpsafe containers at strategic places in the scene so that there are always needles 
available at those places where drugs are used." Individual exchange has been defined as 
"those exchanges and supply transactions concerning small quantities of needles" (7). 
According to these program definitions a collective exchanger was defined as an exchanger 
who has at least once taken out a box with needles and a container and has at least once 
returned a container. When needles were returned in a container, the actual number of needles 
was estimated by a weighing procedure (8). Quantitative data analysis was conducted at the 
level of 1) the individual exchanger, and 2) the exchange contacts. Staff of the program was 
questioned on the contents of their work and their knowledge on the attendants and program 
routines were observed. Data on how the programs goals were addressed in the networks of 
contacted drug users was collected during the in this thesis reported ethnographic field 
research.

<b>Results</b>
<p>
From May 1988 to June 1989 the HADON needle exchange project involved 104 regularly 
registered exchangers. 1255 needle exchange contacts were registered. 25 clients (24%) were 
classified as collective and 79 clients (76%) as individual exchangers. The mean number of 
supplied needles over the 595 individual needle exchange contacts is almost 9. For the 660 
collective needle exchange contacts this number is 79. (table 14.1) During the research period 
a total number of 57328 needles were supplied of which 91% went out through the collective 
exchange. In total 46610 needles were returned, which gives an exchange-rate of 81.3%. 
Profound differences in exchange-rates were found between the two groups: 46.4% for 
individual and 84.8% for collective exchangers. (table 14.2) 
<p>
Table 14.2
<p>
The program's holding power was remarkable in retaining especially the collective 
exchangers. The mean number of contacts of individual exchangers is 7.5, for the collective 
exchangers this is 26.4. (table 14.3) 52% of the collective exchangers visited the program 25 
or more times. (figure 14.1) Moreover, the collective exchangers (only 24% of the clients) 
accounted for 52.6% of the total number of needle exchange contacts. The mean number of 
days between each needle exchange contact is 15.8. A breakdown for the days of the week 
does not show big differences in contact rate. Individual exchangers have their top day on 
Thursday and collective exchangers on Friday. (figure 14.2)
<p>
To complement these results, the ethnographic fieldwork data provide insight in how the 
program's goals are addressed in the networks of IDUs contacted by the program. Although 
during the fieldwork places were visited where hygiene regarding injecting was poor, the 
impression is that users who are engaged in the collective exchange are more aware of risk 
behaviors and put more energy in health maintenance and hygiene as can be seen in the 
following excerpts from fieldnotes:
<p>
Table 14.3
<p>
<blockquote>When Freek had finished injecting he rubbed some Hyrudoid balsam on the 
needle wound. "One of you guys want some too?", he asked Ronald and Frits. Frits took some 
of the ointment and rubbed it on his arm. "It's good stuff for your veins", said Frits. "Yes it also 
disinfects the wound", Freek replied. 
<p>
Richard is still cleaning up the room: "It is always possible someone is coming by and then I 
don't like this stuff laying around." The syringes, swabs and other papers go into the plastic bag 
that's already filled with other used spikes, bloody swabs, etc. "This is for Sak" (a worker of the 
neighborhood exchange program). For extra security Chris takes of the needle from the syringe. 
Then he takes out the piston totally and puts the needle inside the syringe. Then he puts back the 
piston and presses it so the needle inside crumbles together. "Now nobody can hurt himself on 
it. You have to be aware, I think." </blockquote>
<p>
As at many dealing addresses it is not allowed to inject the purchased drugs, IDUs often go to 
a friends place to inject. Karel is participating in the collective exchange and lets his friends 
and acquainted IDUs get off at his place:
<p>
<blockquote>Although it isn't out spoken, Karel agrees on Jerry wanting to take a shot at his 
place. Jerry wants to shoot up pure cocaine. He puts his spike on the table and asks Karel for a 
spoon. Karel asks, "Is that an old spike you want to use ?" Jerry replies, "Well, old, I've used it 
one time before, so it's still good for usage." Karel says, "I've got some new one's left from 
HADON", and hands one over to Jerry, "do you want some more for tonight or the weekend?" 
Jerry replies, "If you can spare them I'll take some with me." Karel gives him 4 in total. 
</blockquote>
<p>
The needles distributed through the collective exchange are thus having a reach beyond the 
user collectives. Besides for on the spot use they are distributed among other users to take 
home. For many IDUs the availability of clean injection equipment is a strong incentive to 
frequent those places. The ethnographic research was not limited to the work area of the 
outreach program. The following fieldnote was recorded at the shooting room of a dealing 
address in another neighborhood:
<p>
<blockquote>From the corner where she's still busy with the needle in her hand Anja asks, "Do 
you have a new syringe for me ?" Eric answers, "No, this is the only one I got. I was lucky, one 
minute before the pharmacy closed I bought it. Then Anja asks, "Can't I use it when you're 
finished. I can't use these anymore", pointing at the syringes laying around her on the floor. 
"They're all blunt, I can't hit a vein," she says as if she's crying or starting to cry. "Or let me only 
use the needle then. Please let me, I will clean it for you. Don't be afraid. I've got no AIDS. I've 
been tested recently at the methadone program." Eric still refuses, "I would like to help you but 
it's the only one I've got. I never lend out my spike to someone else, nobody, not when I have to 
use it myself again. When I'm not using it again it's their own risk." </blockquote>
<p>
Although needle sharing did not take place, the fieldnote illustrates the (often emotional) 
pressure to share a needle. In this case, in spite of the pressure Eric decided in the interest of 
his personal health and against the norm of sharing. Nevertheless, the situation can often be 
tense. When comparing fieldnotes 3 and 4 the functioning of a variable of perceived 
responsibility for safe use becomes apparent. In fieldnote 3, the perceived responsibility is 
given a collective quality. Because the needle exchange program dispenses supplies to IDUs, 
the possession of ample needles allows IDUs to reinforce subcultural norms of sharing, (9) 
yet in a safe way. In contrast, in fieldnote 4, traditional subcultural sharing norms conflict 
with the more recently emerged norms regarding safe use. The perceived responsibility is 
marked by a strong quality of the rugged individual junkie who resists the pressure of 
community sharing norms through adhering to a personal behavior code.
<p>

Not only were needles distributed among visitors of user collectives, an exchange of new 
needles among user collectives was also observed:
<p>
<blockquote>Harrie left with a bunch of new needles to the dealing place where Ronald and 
Frits had bought their dope. "They have a shortage of shooters there", he said before leaving.

<b>Discussion</b>
<p>
When the goals (extending the outreach component of the program, stimulating the users to 
take an interest into their own health and that of other users) are considered, the program is 
making an important contribution. In the evaluation study of the British needle exchange 
schemes a return rate of 62% was found (10). Often it is felt that a high return rate is the 
result of strict rules regarding a one for one transaction. The findings do not support this 
thesis. The high return rate of the collective exchange is not accomplished by strict rules but 
through trust, respect and a shared responsibility in combination with supplying the necessary 
tools for save injecting practices. Likewise, the retention rate of the collective exchangers can 
be regarded very high when compared with the findings of the British evaluation study (33% 
over 5 visits) (10). However, the number of dispensed needles, exchange rates and even 
retention or drop-out rates are insensitive measures of effectiveness. 
<p>
Figure 14.2
<p>
They are only crude indicators of the varying stages in the process of cultural change that is 
going on in the subcultures of IDUs. It is a fundamental misunderstanding to think that IDUs 
will confine their needle shopping to one distributor (11). An evaluation of the San Francisco 
Prevention Point needle exchange found that 13% of supplied needles were returned to 
exchange sites other than the supplying one (12). People use needle exchanges like they (and 
everybody) use any other shop and thus similar motivations determine when and what shop 
will be visited. 
<p>
An interesting difference is found between the top days of individual and collective exchange. 
On Thursday most unemployed users receive their social benefit monies and the individual 
exchange rises markedly. Friday (weekends the program is closed) is the top day for 
collective exchanges. It seems that individual exchangers are more driven by situational 
determinants (the availability of money), while the collective exchangers have included 
getting clean needles in their daily life as a planned activity. 
<p>
The ethnographic data show that the goals of the program were positively anticipated in the 
injecting community. Clean needles were at hand at high risk places when needed, distributed 
through IDU networks and even exchanged among user collectives. Similar results are found 
in the British needle exchange evaluation study by Stimson and colleagues. Not only did they 
find that the initially much higher needle sharing rates of the non-attenders of needle 
exchanges declined much more dramatically than those of the initially lower scoring 
attenders, but they concluded that, facilitated by needle exchanges, a climate is developing in 
which the sharing of used injection equipment is no longer the norm. The British researchers 
related this to the increased availability of needles in the community due to needle exchange, 
pharmacy sales and other sources. It was found that many attending users supplied their non-
attending friends --the high risk group-- with new needles (13).Thus, sufficient availability of 
clean needles at places where drugs are injected supports the newly emerging norms 
regarding safe use in a way that these do not conflict with other subcultural rules regarding 
sharing (9).
<p>
<i>A disturbing factor: police raids on dealing addresses</i>
<p>
A closer look at table 2. shows that after a steady grow of the issued needles from june 1988 
to january / february 1989 in march / april an immense downfall occurs. This collapse may be 
attributed to increased police raids on dealing / using addresses in that period. While the 
collective exchange is going down 60% from january to april, the individual exchange rises 
with almost 1000%. This may be called a short term effect as in the following months the 
individually issued needles join the downward trend of the collective exchange. This is due to 
the space reallocation of many of the regular visitors of the closed down addresses towards 
the west and other parts of Rotterdam. And in this west part of Rotterdam recently history 
again repeated itself (6). These findings do not only support the assumption that many active 
IDUs are actually reached by the collective exchange. They also show that repressive police 
activity can have a negative effect on AIDS prevention efforts (14, 15). A fine tuning of 
public health and judicial policy in favor of an effective AIDS prevention policy is urgently 
needed.
<p>
In conclusion, these findings suggest that the exchanging of needles can be made more 
effective by employing collective social means in contrast to individualistic psychological 
strategies. The use of naturalistic settings (e.g., the placing of the plastic container at user 
collectives and dealing addresses), existing drug user networks and appeals to injecting drug 
user's responsibility may be more powerful determinants of variations in needle exchange 
rates than psychological characteristics of individuals. In any case, engaging drug users 
themselves as an integral part and partner of the outreach work provides an interesting topic 
for further investigation and development. In Rotterdam, it will be interesting to see in the 
future whether this human resource and social manner of exchanging will be more effective 
than more technologically inspired approaches (e.g. needle exchanging machines) that are 
also planned for the city's AIDS prevention efforts.

<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
In recent years the use of cocaine has become of interest to both researchers and policy 
makers in Europe. However, there have been few studies that document European cocaine use 
patterns, circumstances and consequences. In several pilot studies conducted in Rotterdam, 
cocaine use patterns, circumstances and consequences have been described in the population 
of heroin users. (1 2) The Rotterdam cocaine studies were extended into a European context with 
compatible pilots conducted in Munich and Rome. Across these different European cities, 
relatively common and distinctive cocaine using groups and milieus could be specified. It was 
determined that cocaine use was prevalent across a wide range of social groups including 
actors and artists, blue collar workers, students, unemployed, white collar, pimps and 
prostitutes and people with restaurant, bar and cafe occupations. (3) In Amsterdam during the 
same time period, Peter Cohen completed an extensive study of 160 persons with an inclusion 
criterion of a minimum of twenty-five lifetime instances of cocaine use and an exclusion 
criterion of deviant subcultural origin (junkies, criminals, prostitutes). The results of the 
Amsterdam study were able to be compared with data from the North American cities of 
Miami (4 5) and Toronto (6). In the Amsterdam sample, the great majority (70.3%) had a lifetime 
prevalence of cocaine smoking and a sizable minority of free basing (18.1%). However, in 
terms of current prevalence, the large majority of the sample (73.6%) always used intranasally. 
Only a tiny percentage of the sample (0.6%) had a current prevalence where cocaine was 
always smoked. For those who had some smoking and basing lifetime experience, half the 
sample (50.8%) did so rarely for smoking and a much smaller percentage (16.9%) rarely for 
basing. The Amsterdam study revealed, at least for the non-deviant subpopulation of cocaine 
users, a rare current prevalence of cocaine smoking or basing patterns. (7) 
<p>
Despite the popular opinion that Europe was somehow generally behind the United States in 
the incidence of cocaine use patterns, the Dutch cocaine studies suggested that a number of 
American patterns could be observed and that they have been in existence for sometime. In 
both heroin user and non-heroin user populations, cocaine smoking has existed as a common 
form of self-administration. Historically, cocaine smoking in the form of free basing had 
entered the United States in the late 1970s among higher dealer circles. (8 9 10 11) By the 1980s, 
changes in the international cocaine market stimulated the release of a product called crack 
which was ready-made pieces of smokable cocaine-base that was marketed to a new consumer 
group, the young underclass. (12 13) James Inciardi documents these changes as follows:
<p>
<blockquote>The rediscovery of crack during the early 1980s seemed to occur simultaneously 
on the East and West Coasts. As a result of the Colombian government's attempt to reduce the 
amount of illicit cocaine production within its borders, it apparently, at least for a time, 
successfully restricted the amount of ether available for transforming coca paste into cocaine-
hydrochloride. The result was the diversion of coca paste from Colombia, through Central 
America and the caribbean, into South Florida for conversion into cocaine. Spillage from 
shipments through the Caribbean corridor acquainted local island populations with coca paste 
smoking, which developed the forerunner of crack-cocaine in 1980. Known as baking-soda 
base, base-rock, gravel, and roxanne, the prototype was a smokable product composed of 
coca paste, baking soda, water, and rum (10).</blockquote>
<p>
As Inciardi's account suggests, the smoking of cocaine involves a highly complex political 
economy which results in the production of a great variety of cocaine smoking products that 
appear and reappear at various times and places. In the Netherlands, the incidence of cocaine 
smoking has been documented at about the same time as in the United States (14)
<p>
On the demand side, the form of cocaine smoking is related to the interaction between user 
preferences, price, purity and perceived availability. This interaction results in the 
formalization of distinctive sequences and meanings associated with the consumption of a 
drug. These stylized interaction forms have been referred to as drug-administration rituals. The 
concept of ritual has been a mainstay in the ethnographic literature on drug use. Michael Agar 
has defined the conditions for ritual events: "For an event to be a ritual event it must prescribe 
a sequence of psychomotor acts and this prescribed psychomotor sequence must be invested 
with a special meaning for the person performing that sequence". (15) As Agar has argued, 
different ritual self-administration of the same drug may involve very different sequences of 
psychomotor behavior and quite different meanings for the user. In this regard Griffith 
Edwards statement about heroin may be said to apply to cocaine, insofar as the smoking 
provides a different effect then injecting. (16) Different from heroin, however, is that for cocaine 
the smoking effect may be comparable to or even more rapid and intense than injecting. (17 18 19) 
Moreover, even within the smoking route of self-administration of cocaine the effects may 
differ. Smoking from a (chamber) pipe provides a more intense effect than chasing.
<p>
In this chapter the emergence of a new Dutch cocaine smoking product, cooked coke 
(gekookte coke) is discussed within the broader context of older cocaine self-administration 
smoking rituals among heroin users. The prevalence, preferences and self-administration 
rituals of cocaine use are documented in a series of Rotterdam field studies. Special emphasis 
is placed upon the emergence of cooked coke highlighting its origins, sales and user 
motivations. The appearance of cooked coke is compared as an emergent social phenomenon 
with the appearance of crack cocaine in the Americas. It is suggested that political as well as 
economic conditions may account for both the appearance and spread of this specific cocaine

<b>Heroin Self-Administration Rituals and Cocaine Preference</b>
<p>
In the Netherlands, two predominant rituals can be distinguished in cocaine self-administration 
by heroin users --injecting and smoking. These cocaine rituals correspond to the predominant 
patterns of heroin self-administration. The most common mode of smoking cocaine (and 
heroin) is called "chinesing" (chasing the dragon or chasing) in The Netherlands. When 
chasing, some of the drug is put on an oblong piece of tin foil and heated from underneath. 
The drug melts, vaporizes and runs along the foil. The vapors are inhaled through a tube 
which is held in the mouth. With this tube the running and vaporizing liquid is carefully 
followed (chased) while inhaling. Depending upon the amount of cocaine-base placed on the 
foil, the chasing involves five to ten runs over the foil with a corresponding number of 
inhalations. In contrast, the same amount of cocaine-base administered in a free base pipe may 
only take one or two inhalations producing a much more intense impact effect. In both the 
observational study and the Central Station survey the preference for smoking rituals among 
Dutch heroin users is confirmed; only the minority of those people observed (23%) have 
injecting as their main self-administration ritual while the sizable majority (77%) seem to 
prefer the smoking form of self-administration. In the survey only 23% injected heroin and 
28% injected cocaine. It is clear from both the field observational data and the survey data that 
cocaine has become increasingly important to Dutch heroin users. The prevalence of cocaine 
use in this population is rising to alarming levels.
<p>
Figure 15.1
<p>
Figure 15.1 presents the drugs of first and second choice in the Central Station survey. While 
heroin is the drug of first choice for 34 respondents cocaine (and methadone) are drugs of first 
choice for a sizable proportion of the sample (8 for cocaine; 6 for methadone). Looking at 
drugs of second choice, cocaine is clearly the most prevalent drug of second choice (20 
respondents). Compared to the other drug classes (methadone, alcohol, pills and others) 
cocaine and heroin are in a class of themselves--both are the preferred drugs in this population. 
The data on the research subjects in the observational study (which was collected about a year 
later) show that 96% of the heroin users is combining their use of heroin with cocaine (N = 
105). In comparing the validity of these findings, 1988 data from the Rotterdam registration 
system of heroin users in methadone treatment report a prevalence of 72% (N = 1797) cocaine 
use, not as high as our community users sample but still almost three-quarters of this treatment 
sample. (20)

<b>Preparing Cocaine-Hydrochloride for Self-Administration</b>
<p>
The heroin users observed in this study either speedball (mix) the cocaine with heroin or turn-
take them (first cocaine followed by heroin). Additionally, all the dealing addresses that were 
studied sold both cocaine and heroin to their customers. As mentioned above, the way cocaine 
is ingested parallels the form used to self-administer heroin; injecting drug users (IDUs) 
generally inject cocaine-hydrochloride and heroin smokers normally chase or base cocaine-
base. In The Netherlands cocaine has been generally marketed in the hydrochloride form. 
IDUs simply dissolve the drug in water before injecting. Smokers convert the cocaine-
hydrochloride into cocaine-base themselves. They chemically remove the Hcl group by use of 
ammonia or baking salt (bicarbonate) before they ingest the drug via their preferred route. 
Chapter five presented this process in detail.

<b>The Emergence of Gekookte Coke</b>
<p>
Thus, cocaine smokers have to perform a rather laborious and time consuming routine to 
prepare the cocaine-hydrochloride. This tedious task needs specific tools and chemicals as well 
as a significant amount of time. This preparation routine can hardly be performed properly 
outside of a house or other similarly quiet place. In many Dutch cities retail heroin and cocaine 
dealing inside of houses which does not cause any nuisance to the neighborhood is often 
tolerated. In Rotterdam, most users buy and often use their drugs at these dealing places called 
addresses. At most addresses the dealer, who is almost always also a drug user, the 
opportunity is offered the customers to use the purchased drugs on the premises although 
generally IDUs are excluded from this privilege. Routinely spoons, ammonia, tinfoil, tissue, 
toilet paper and water are supplied by the dealer. 
<p>
Not all drug users have access to these places all of the time. Temporarily, some users are 
denied entry if they do not buy or are known to be in (enduring) financial need. Other users 
are denied access more permanently. Usually this is because their behavior and reputation does 
not conform to subcultural expectations. Among the permanently barred users, the most 
marginalized polydrug users can be found. Together with people that come to socialize, buy 
methadone or prescription drugs, these marginalized users drift toward the Central Station 
zone where they are both tolerated and constitute the majority of drug users. In this 
environment among these marginalized addicts, the emergence of a form of cocaine-base 
called gekookte coke (cooked cocaine) was first documented by the field research team in 
February, 1990. Intensive inquiry with users already recruited in the study revealed that 
cooked cocaine had already been available for quite some time at the Central Station. One 
informant maintained that it has been available for more than two years; another spoke of a 
half-year. Interestingly, however, when asked whether they knew where to buy crack, no one 
could say they knew where to find it. When asked for cooked cocaine, everybody immediately 
understood and said it was for sale at the Central Station.

<b>The Distribution of Gekookte Coke</b>
<p>
Cooked cocaine is sold at the Central Station mainly by Surinamese and Moroccan drug users. 
They do so to support their own drug habit. Other drug users were often observed bringing 
customers in exchange for a commission. Cooked cocaine is one among the many other drug 
products (heroin, cocaine-hydrochloride, methadone and prescription drugs) they offer. All of 
their selling is done in very small units. Normally, these street dealers buy a gram of cocaine-
hydrochloride and cook it with ammonia or sodium bicarbonate. Additional refining with ether 
is not performed. The resulting lump of cocaine-base is crushed, powdered and divided into 
small amounts, usually just enough for one smoke. These portions are packed in a small piece 
of plastic wrapper, folded into the form of a drop and sealed by melting the plastic. They are 
called een balletje (a little ball) and are sold for about ¦10.- (approximately $6.- or £3.-) each. 
Because of factors relating to both the packing of the drug and the rushed atmosphere of a 
street drug sale, the consumer has much less control over the purchased product. Thus, heroin 
or cocaine bought at the Central Station are seen as the worst buys in the city. For the purpose 
of the analysis of content some samples of cooked cocaine were collected. The following 
fieldnote documents the interaction:
<p>
<blockquote>It is Thursday night, 22.50 hour. I am walking through the Central Station hall, 
which is rather quiet. I decide to take the stairs down to the subway station. Halfway down the 
stairs, at the entrance of the bicycle storage department two Moroccan men in their early 
twenties and a middle aged Dutch woman are arguing loudly. They are not rushing bypassers 
hurrying for their train. Walking down the next part of the stairs, I am crossed by a Creole 
Surinamese man. "Coke?", he whispers. I smile and walk on. Downstairs, apart from a group 
of four users, the hall is empty. As I walk by I hear a voice whisper "Bruin, ... Coke?". At the 
end of the hall I slow my pace, observe the group for some seconds and walk their way again. 
The same voice speaks to me again. It is a blonde Dutch man in his late thirties with a very 
thin face. He asks if I want to buy coke. "I could see you are a user, although you look good", 
he flatters me. He has an unknown accent. I ask for gekookte coke (cooked cocaine). Then 
everything goes very fast. He starts walking and we take the stairs for the square in front of 
the station. In the entrance of the station hall he approaches a Hindustani Surinamese man of 
about 35 years and tells him I am a potential customer. For not one moment is there any 
mistrust and the dealer is willing to sell. The blonde man asks how much money I want to 
spend. He reports to the dealer that I want to buy for 25 guilders. Next the dealer hands me 
two tiny drop alike pieces of plastic, containing white powder. The blonde guy assures me the 
merchandise is of good quality. "If you like you can smoke in the phone booth", he says 
pointing at the one we are standing next to, "If you're not satisfied, you can come back to me." 
The dealer says that he regularly smokes in the phone booth so that is not a problem. As I do 
not have the exact sum and the dealer cannot change, he settles for 24 guilders. When I leave 
the blonde guy starts to negotiate about his commission.</blockquote>

<b>Motivations for Using Gekookte Coke</b>
<p>
All of our informants stated that cooked cocaine is sold at the Central Station for very 
pragmatic reasons: 
<p>
<blockquote>"You don't have to prepare it."<br>
"It is ready for smoking." <br>
"It's a gain of time." <br>
"It is not so conspicuous when you don't have to prepare before smoking."<br>
"You don't have to search for a place to cook the stuff anymore." <br>
"You don't need a spoon and ammonia." <br></blockquote>
<p>
The situation at the Central Station zone upon which these reasons are grounded is 
characterized by specific ecological conditions which have made the adoption of cooked 
cocaine functional to this group of drug users. There is neither the time nor space at the 
Central Station zone to cook cocaine-hydrochloride. Especially in the daytime, the zone is 
crowded by high concentrations of passing travellers. During these hours, the resident group 
of drug users and other marginals are closely watched by the police. Often they are summoned 
to move along. The hall of the station is easy to survey and in the past measures have been 
taken to limit the use of drugs at the station. Thus, there is an incentive to have a smoking 
product that can be smoked as quickly as possible in any available nook or nitche, for example 
a telephone booth. Included in the convenience advantages of cooked cocaine are that the user 
is freed from the necessity to carry around the paraphernalia and chemicals for the preparation 
of smokable cocaine.

<b>Discussion</b>
<p>
In light of the international uproar about crack cocaine precipitated by the experiences of the 
Americas, the appearance of cooked cocaine in the Netherlands, though sporadic and 
restricted to a relatively small subpopulation of drug users, is nonetheless worthy of attention. 
Cooked cocaine and crack are basically similar products. Both are forms of cocaine-base 
processed from cocaine-hydrochloride containing various impurities and adulterants that are 
added during production and trafficking. There are however some apparent differences. 
Cooked cocaine is prepared in quantities of a gram or less by users that sell the substance to 
their peers. On the other hand, crack generally is prepared in larger quantities in a kind of 
cottage industry setting. Williams described a teenage drug ring involved in crack sales. The 
basic recipe of this group's mixer started with 125 grams of cocaine-hydrochloride. Obviously, 
one essential difference between cooked cocaine and crack is the scale of production. (12) 
<p>
Another obvious difference between cooked cocaine and crack is the target group and 
population of users. In the United States crack has been marketed to new user groups that 
previously were not involved in heroin or cocaine use. In Rotterdam, the sale of cooked 
cocaine is limited to a small proportion of the existing heroin using population confined to an 
area where self-preparation of cocaine-base is hardly feasible. The majority of heroin users 
prefer to buy and self-prepare cocaine-hydrochloride at house addresses. The use of cooked 
cocaine has been restricted to the most marginalized polydrug users in the heroin using 
population. These users are the most vulnerable to the turbulence in the local drug market and 
cannot find a stable address or living arrangement in order to self-produce their own smokable 
cocaine. It is also notable that this group's social marginality seems to be correlated in part to 
ethnic group membership with Moroccan and Surinamese drug users being the most likely to 
sell and use cooked cocaine.
<p>
While the current prevalence of cooked cocaine in Rotterdam seems well contained, there do 
exist certain conditions that could lead to an expansion of this market. In contrast with many 
neighboring countries and the United States, in the Netherlands only a minority of 
heroine/cocaine users have been reported to inject. Most Dutch drug users smoke their 
drugs. (21 22 23) This suggests that in the heroin-using population in the Netherlands a ready 
market potential for crack cocaine --a cheap cocaine product especially designed for adapted 
hard drug smokers-- is already in existence. However, according to the Dutch Ministry of 
Health, crack use is not prevalent in the Netherlands (24). The research results presented here 
suggests that the reality is more complicated. Congruent with a number of other independent 
studies, a large proportion of Dutch heroin/cocaine users are currently preferring the smoking 
route of self-administration. The established ritual of chinesing or chasing of heroin has been 
applied to a new situation of the increased availability of cocaine on the heroin market. Basing 
of cocaine, a different way of smoking the same cocaine product, is also prevalent. And now 
the most recent development has been the appearance of cooked cocaine as a new packaged 
product on specific street drug markets. All of these developments can be contrasted with the 
non-deviant cocaine using population where nasal inhalation seems the most stable and 
prevalent route of self-administration and cocaine smoking in any form is rare. (7) 
<p>
The development of a stable smoking ritual in the Netherlands provides yet another example 
of the importance of economic factors on the determination of forms of drug self-
administration. In this regard, several recent studies conducted in both Britain and the United 
States have found that economic pressure is perhaps the most important factor in the initiation 
of injection as the stable and prevalent self-administration ritual. (25 26 27 28) Because this specific 
economic pressure is minimalized in The Netherlands, large proportions of Dutch drug users 
do not experience the necessity to initiate and maintain injection as do their British and 
American counterparts. An additional economic subfactor peculiar to the Netherlands is 
recognition of organized drug traffickers of the preference for smoking heroin. Thus, in the 
second half of the Seventies, Turkish and later Pakistan smoking heroin was introduced in 
large quantities. This marketing strategy by the traffickers further helped to stabilize the 
smoking pattern and preference. Analytically, this economic factor is a rather complex system 
in itself, consisting of a dynamic equilibrium of both demand and supply-side subfactors. 
<p>
The initiation, maintenance and emergence of the cocaine smoking patterns cannot be reduced 
to a single factorial explanation based solely on economic forces. Psychological factors also 
have a role to play. Thus, a current psychological determinant may be the fear of contracting 
AIDS through the use of unsterile needles. (29) Associated with this psychological factor are 
specific subcultural factors, e.g. The existence of certain needle taboos in specific ethnic 
groups. And the ritual form itself may produce a specific sociocultural reward for the 
participant including a sense of solidarity, meaning and emotion. (30) In the sociocultural context 
of an already dominant heroin smoking ritual, the economic factor of the increased availability 
of cocaine came into play in the heroin scene during the first half of the Eighties. (2) The 
preparation of cocaine for smoking became an important part of the self-administration ritual 
and added a new dimension of meaning to the drug subculture. The preparation of cocaine-
base is almost as an important part of the ritual as the actual act of smoking and its impact 
effect. Users perform the preparation sequence in a stylized manner with much precision and 
dedication. Preparation is an important act in which they do not want to be disturbed. 
Although idiosyncratic variations on this routine can be observed, the behavioral sequence is 
highly predictable and subject to various levels of ritualization. (15 31 32)
<p>
Along with the economic, psychological and sociocultural factors a significant political factor 
can be distinguished. The self-preparation of cocaine is preferred because this act allows the 
user to increase the control the user has over the product vis-a-vis the dealer. Yet, this routine 
can hardly be performed outside a building, frequently a dealing address controlled by an 
equilibrium of dealer and police forces. It is almost impossible to prepare smokable cocaine in 
crowded surroundings such as at the Central Station and other street areas where high levels 
of police repressive activity are directed. Under these political conditions, preprocessed, 
cooked cocaine has become available. The local political conditions have provided an 
exogenous stimulus to the economic equilibrium. On the supply side politics has changed the 
market and unintentionally encouraged entrepreneurial ventures in cooked cocaine. On the 
demand side cooked cocaine represents an adaptation to the exogenous political stimulus that 
satisfies the existing demand for smokable cocaine.
<p>
In addition to these local micro political subfactors, there may be other, more macro level 
political factors which have determined the emergence of both cooked cocaine and crack. 
Inciardi has contended that drug war interdiction policies could well be a factor in itself 
toward the creation of a higher demand for crack. 
<p>
<blockquote>Even if the federal War on Drugs is at all successful in the interdiction of 
cocaine coming into the United States, the use of crack will still persist. In fact, a successful 
war might serve to make crack even more desirable. Should interdiction drive the price of 
cocaine up to $300.- or even $400.- a gram, a few hits of crack could still be had for under 
$100.-.(10)</blockquote>
<p>
Together with sensationalist mass media coverage definition and governmental high-key 
prevention campaigns (33), the emergence of crack may indicate how a new drug fad can be 
inadvertedly created that reinforces the natural economic dynamics of supply and demand. In 
The Netherlands, despite official national government policy, local efforts that have a more 
warlike profile may be functioning to produce pockets of cooked cocaine use. Currently, the 
sale of cooked cocaine at the Central Station in Rotterdam cannot be said to signify a trend of 
wider significance. Nevertheless, there has been an increased tendency of police raids aimed at 
closing down dealing addresses in the west of Rotterdam. The result has been that many users 
who previously have had a stable address have been disconnected from their regular sources of 
supply. This turbulence has had unanticipated consequences. AIDS outreach workers who 
operate in that part of the city report that they have lost contact with a number of their clients 
only to find them again in the Central Station zone. (34) 
<p>
Somewhat associated with this local tendency has been, as in the United States, a decreasing 
availability and quality of cocaine. A Dutch heroin user echoes the sense of Inciardi's argument 
on the consequences of vigorous interdiction policies: "You know, you have to search well to 
get some good coke and when you find some, they tell you the price has gone up because 
good coke is hard to find, they say." Interestingly, this change of policy has not effected the 
heroin market. The price of heroin has remained stable at about ¦100.- a gram (approximately 
$60.- or £30.-) while the price of a gram of cocaine has risen from that amount to about 140 
guilders. If this tendency continues, a new Dutch situation may be ushered in where the 
marketing of commercially innovative, cottage industrial cocaine-base products such as crack 
will both increase the profit margin and meet the demands of users who are forced to adapt 
their drug-taking rituals to the changing conditions of a decreasing number of house addresses 
and an increasing time spent on the streets.

<b>Conclusions</b>
<p>
In conclusion, the local high-profile police experiments will be judged by their results given the 
Dutch commitment to a pragmatic drug policy. In the Netherlands, cooked cocaine will 
probably not spread in the heroin using population if the current preferences of users toward 
self-preparation of cocaine-base is reinforced. In a situation in which the majority of smoking 
users can prepare their cocaine-base without fear of being harassed, an effective protective 
factor (35) against the spread of a cooked cocaine epidemic in this population can be said to 
function. However, if local policy changes the conditions of, not only, the availability of 
cocaine, but also of the time and space allocations of drug users, this may result in a supply 
shift from cocaine-hydrochloride to cocaine-base at the level of middle market distribution. As 
a socio-economic phenomenon, Dutch cooked cocaine would be transformed into American 
crack. The risk of spillage into populations of non-deviant users of cocaine-hydrochloride 
which now purchase their cocaine through retail sellers outside the heroin scene may well 
increase through a mechanism of shortages. The risk of a crack epidemic could then become 
eminent. It might not be too much to say, that the current difference between cooked cocaine 
and crack is largely the result of drug control policy determinants. Cooked cocaine is the 
exception to the rule of a normalization policy that aims at socially integrating drugs and their 
settings into nitches of conventional society, while crack is the explosive by-product of a 
policy aimed at eliminating cocaine and its settings of use in the quest for a drug-free society.

<b>Introduction</b>

Because of the urgency of the AIDS problem, the initial research exploring the connections 
between HIV and injecting drug use tended to focus largely on quantifiable variables seen as 
directly related to the routes of transmission of HIV e.g. injecting frequency, number of needle 
sharing and sexual partners, the use of bleach or sterile needles. But the context of drug use, 
its natural settings, characteristic local user networks, larger social structures and official drug 
policy may have more significance for determining and, ultimately, for changing those concrete 
behaviors which are the basis of HIV transmission.
<p>
If any lesson can be learned from the AIDS epidemic so far, it is that biomedical research on 
the epidemics' patterns must be wedded to concomitant psychosocial research. While both the 
origins of AIDS and the prospects for efficient vaccines and treatments are still cloudy, the 
spread of infection is much better understood. This is largely due to the efforts of social 
science research. The first wave of HIV in the US and Europe occurred through several 
relatively well-specified routes of transmission --among them the sharing of contaminated 
injection equipment, generally referred to as needle sharing. This has been the basis of the very 
high incidence of AIDS cases among some populations of IDUs. (1 2 3 4) Social scientists, using 
network analysis, were able to identify the vectors of spread within the homosexual 
community (5) where this knowledge was almost immediately utilized by gay community-based 
organizations to mobilize and educate in the interest of AIDS prevention. Likewise the later 
findings of social science research relevant to AIDS in the IDU community have been a strong 
stimulus to encourage outreach activities and organizing of prevention programs in many 
countries, The Netherlands and the U.S. among them. (6 7 8 9) However these findings have 
sometimes led to a certain narrowing of focus in which the physical instrument of transmission 
--the syringe and needle-- have been somewhat fetishized. Perhaps because of the involvement 
of biomedical researchers unfamiliar with the worlds of the drug users, almost exclusive 
attention has been focused on the physical objects responsible for transmitting the virus -- 
needles and syringes-- often obscuring the fabric of social relationships in which these objects 
are used. None the less prevention strategies and messages (stop shooting and bleach before 
sharing), the institution of bleach bottle distribution and needle exchange programs, have all 
been a positive result of this research. Yet while such initiatives are a healthy antidote to some 
deep-seated prejudices and pessimism that drug users are so socially deviant and disorganized 
that they are either unwilling or unable to change their behavior; they bear the danger of too 
narrow a focus on one limited aspect of the complex realities of drug use. Several recent 
studies (10 11 12 13) have reported non IV drug use related to increased risk for HIV-transmission, 
e.g. crack use and its relation to sexual exposure. These should lead to a revision of the 
concept of risk and the ideas for prevention of HIV in this group. 
<p>
The concept of needle sharing is both analytically and practically an incomplete notion --even 
for understanding the spread of HIV among IDUs. The focus on the physical instrument of 
transmission may inhibit a deeper look, beyond needle sharing, into drug use contexts - the 
world of multiple sharing and care taking practices that constitute the bonds of relationships of 
drug users and their social networks. The earliest descriptions of these networks (14 15) 
emphasized the more negative aspects of the lives of drug users, characterized as ripping and 
running, and also revealed important structural features of a more positive nature. 
Subsequently, distinct temporal and social variables of drug use contexts were characterized (16) 
and daily, weekly and monthly variations were found to effect many IDU behaviors including 
congregating, buying drugs and seeking treatment --all with consequences for HIV risk. (17 18) 
Location and sites of drug use also provide important contextual variables as can be witnessed 
by the early recognition of the importance of shooting galleries for HIV-spread among IDUs 
in the Bronx. (17 19)
<p>
This paper compares the drug use contexts and their potential HIV consequences in two very 
different communities- Rotterdam and the Bronx. Rotterdam with a population of 580.000 has 
2500 -3500 opiate users (4.3-6.0/1000) of which an estimated 23% are injectors and 77% 
smokers. (20) In contrast, the Bronx with a population of 1.2 million, has 30-40,000 regular 
opiate users (25-33/1000) who are overwhelmingly injectors (>90%). If the South Bronx 
(population 500,000 / 20-30,000 IDUs) is considered separately, this rate is 40-60/1000. 
Rotterdam and the Bronx have both known massive physical and social destruction. 
Rotterdam was heavily bombed in May of 1940 devastating thousands of its buildings and 
displacing tens of thousands of families for a decade or more. Since the war, the city has 
slowly and carefully been rebuilt and today has an international reputation for its architectural 
innovations and urban renewal projects, especially the availability of high quality affordable 
housing for working class families. The Bronx is a city that has also been devastated -- in this 
case by urban blight and fire which, in the twenty years between 1960 - 1980, destroyed 
numerous buildings and displaced large populations. (21) The Bronx, however, has seen only 
limited urban renewal and its problems have worsened throughout the last decade. 
<p>
The two settings constitute a natural experiment in process for over 40 years. This paper aims 
at identifying a common set of variables that function (albeit under very different conditions) 
to influence injecting drug use practices in the two areas. These variables are differentially 
determined by social context and drug policy options all of which have HIV consequences. By 
identifying common variables that are sensitive to policy interventions, even though they are 
imbedded in very different conditions, it becomes possible to generalize and weigh the 
consequences of such policies beyond their particular application in a local community.

<b>The Micro Settings of Everyday Drug Use</b>
<p>
<I>Rotterdam</I>
<p>
The Addiction Research Institute of Erasmus University has conducted a field research study 
into the drug taking practices of heroin users in Rotterdam. In this study, 95 drug 
administration rituals were recorded: half involved injecting and two-thirds of those injecting 
used new, sterile syringes. Only three cases of re-using another's needle and syringe were 
recorded and, in these cases, circumstantial factors led to unsafe injecting interactions. (22) 
Needle sharing defined as two or more people actually using the only available syringe one 
after the other in a predictable, stereotypical and planned (ritual) sequence was not observed in 
the Rotterdam study. Thus, needle sharing does not appear to be a major feature of injecting 
drug use in Rotterdam. The sharing of drugs (23) however was found to be an important and 
frequent phenomenon, both among IDUs and non-IDUs, as drug use was rarely an individual 
act. Dealing places, private homes, and homes of friends were the most common places where 
drugs were ingested. Most of the drug sales observed at dealing address were followed by 
direct ingestion of (at least a part of) the drugs purchased. To have more individuals present 
than the dealer and the buyer was a typical feature of these dealing addresses. Often users 
purchased drugs in pairs, and frequently a pub atmosphere prevailed. While needle sharing was 
rare, in half the observations of injecting and non-injecting use, drugs were shared. IDUs were 
very frequently found to share drugs by a special technique using two syringes which has been 
termed frontloading (24). Discussion with researchers and drug users from numerous countries 
revealed that this technique is utilized far beyond Rotterdam. (25 26) It was hypothesized that this 
technique bears the risk of passing on microbiological and viral infections (including HIV) (27 28 
29) but this is unknown to most IDUs. In both Rotterdam and Amsterdam drug agencies have 
included frontloading in their prevention campaigns. But this kind of information campaign, 
aimed at rapid behavior change, may again function to isolate and emphasize the instrument of 
transmission (the needle) and overlooks the larger picture of drug sharing practices, which are 
embedded in a much broader pattern of social behaviors of heroin users. The Rotterdam data 
provide abundant evidence of a range of sharing behaviors among users which contradict the 
stereotype of predators, ripping off society and each other. While such behavior does indeed 
occur, another more prevalent pattern seems to be sharing and mutual support. Drug users 
share many valued things such as housing, food, money, clothing and child care. Often they 
help one another with daily problems associated with drug use lifestyles where sharing fits the 
broader context of coping with craving, needs for human contact, and the hardships of life on 
the margins of society. In this context the ritualized sharing of drugs serves as a strong 
symbolic binding force. These social behaviors were documented in many studies and in 
different places. (14 30 31 32) Sharing and its associated pattern of reciprocal aid, somewhat 
balances the constraints of the ripping and running world, (15) the competition, violence and 
mistrust of everyday life. Both the helping and sharing, and the ripping and violence, are all 
normal behaviors under abnormal and extreme conditions. 
<p>
<I>The Bronx</I>
<p>
Between 1985 and 1989 a series of studies were conducted in the Bronx at the Montefiore 
Medical Center, and elsewhere in N.Y.C. to determine HIV prevalence, rates and risk factors 
among IDUs in methadone treatment (40-50%) (11 33) and in street samples (50-70%) (34). These 
studies and others have demonstrated the clear connection between injection histories and 
practices and HIV risk, specifying frequency of injection, sharing of injection equipment and 
especially the use of shooting galleries and of cocaine. (11 33)  Clearly injecting practices occupied 
a central place in the transmission of HIV in the Bronx. Yet little was systematically known 
about the motivations or details of these practices, nor much about the specific settings in 
which injecting took place, or the experiences of the drug users themselves. While 
ethnographic studies examining the social context of drug use in New York and elsewhere in 
the U.S. did in fact continue throughout the AIDS era (35 36 37) these perspectives were often 
divorced from larger AIDS policy considerations. In New York City thinking about AIDS is 
dominated by the demands for acute medical care of the immense case load of people sick with 
AIDS -- 2000 per day in hospital beds and another 20 - 30.000 symptomatic in the 
community. This context would not normally be considered a promising environment for 
ethnographic research aimed at illuminating the context of drug use or discovering 
interventions which promote effective long term measures to minimize HIV spread. Yet, even 
in the Bronx, it has been possible to initiate a range of activities which produce 
ethnographically valid data and should form the basis for more effective outreach and AIDS 
prevention activities. These include studies of natural support systems in families of IDUs with 
AIDS (38), the emergence of durable support groups for HIV positive drug users and their 
partners, (39) new volunteer services (40), the incorporation of HIV infected individuals and former 
drug users as paid outreach staff (39) and engaging the issues of reproductive choice in groups of 
HIV+ women. (41) These activities are possible because they all operate within and build upon 
the natural support systems of drug users. By entering these systems in their natural settings it 
is possible to both learn and help. 
<p>
Several outreach programs have been created in the Bronx intended to provide AIDS 
education and risk reduction services to women involved in street life, active drug use and sex 
sales. But it was often found that in this population, concerns about HIV and AIDS were low 
on the list of priorities. The context of everyday life of drug use in the Bronx entails a broad 
spectrum of more immediately threatening risks. AIDS education, as it is commonly delivered 
in NYC, does not satisfy the needs of this population if it focuses only on AIDS and does 
nothing to address the more visibly stigmatizing and very damaging aspects of their everyday 
lives. An outreach approach for this group must include lessons in safer professional sex and 
proper needle use, and must match clients' perceived needs with public health goals. Merely 
teaching needle sterilization is not well accepted because it requires an extra step and more 
time and effort to prevent something that this group does not chronically worry about. But 
teaching trackmark prevention and more competent injection technique was well received in 
this group as it requires no extra time, no major change in behavior, can be taught in a few 
simple lessons, and provides information most IDUs desire because it helps them economically 
and permits more efficient use of drugs. An individual who is able to find veins quickly not 
only lessens his or her own risk of infection, theft of drugs, or arrest; but now has a skill for 
which other less talented injectors are willing to pay. This puts safer self-injection practices 
and AIDS education into the economic framework -- a perspective that is never absent in the 
Bronx drug scene. AIDS education, offered in this context, is perceived as more meaningful 
by the drug user and facilitates better connections with health care professionals.

<b>The Larger Social Context of Drug Use in Rotterdam and the Bronx</b>
<p>
Great differences exist between everyday life in the drug subcultures of Rotterdam and the 
Bronx; In large part because the social policies in the two cities have been so different. In 
Rotterdam, as in other Dutch cities after W.W.-II, much effort was put into the process of 
urban renewal of the old neighborhoods, and provision of health care, education and social 
services. The housing situation of even the lowest income groups in The Netherlands can be 
called decent. The devastated areas, and burnt out buildings characteristic of the South Bronx 
and other slum areas of New York are, in Rotterdam, only memories of the enormous 
bombing of the city in May 1940. In Rotterdam only a small minority of drug users do not 
have regular housing. (42) When unemployed, they receive social benefits (like any other 
unemployed citizen) and these are high enough to support the basic costs of living. Tied to this 
social benefit people receive free medical care on demand and legal and social services are 
generally free or at low cost. Drug treatment was funded beginning in the early l970s and is 
readily available for those who want it. In Dutch political organization these matters have the 
status of requirements of the state constitution. Recently Peter Hartsock from NIDA has 
described this as the social responsibility characterizing Dutch society. (43) Since the beginning of 
the 1980s a relatively open atmosphere concerning drugs and addiction has existed in The 
Netherlands. The drug problem is viewed as one of the many social problems society faces 
which cannot be solved by repression. A higher priority is placed on the strategy of controlling 
the use of drugs and their damage rather then on their elimination. (44 45) This policy is supported 
by broad political consensus. 
<p>
If Rotterdam reflects the positive consequences of a policy of social responsibility, the Bronx 
can be said to display the effect of decades of neglect, exploitation and political corruption. 
Between 1960 and 1980 large areas of the Bronx burned. This massive destruction of low cost 
housing (60,000 units) was due to several interacting factors - aging buildings, overcrowding 
associated with the influx of immigrants to NYC, and the reduction of vital city services, such 
as fire, sanitation, and building safety inspection. Consequently a large population (250,000) 
was uprooted and once vital communities were left in tatters: the total population shrank by 
20% as middle class families fled to the surrounding suburbs. This lead to the formation of a 
large underclass population in which over one million New Yorkers have now lived for two or 
more generations. New York estimates the number of adults periodically or permanently 
homeless to be as high as 50,000, (46 47) while the city's emergency shelter capacity stands at 
around 9000 beds. There is little existing stock of rooming houses, or SRO's (single room 
occupancy) remaining - most of these have been gentrified. 
<p>
Ironically, most of New York City's poor and homeless are by legal statute entitled to social 
and financial benefits, but not without identification documents. It is difficult for a person to 
get or retain the necessary ID (birth certificate, social security card) without a mailing address. 
Those who do manage to secure ID and public assistance benefits can easily lose them by 
failure to meet requirements for recertification of eligibility e.g. a quarterly face-to-face 
interview with a welfare worker in the central office. Health insurance (Medicaid) does come 
as part of the public assistance package, but only part of the drug users manage to maintain 
their eligibility. Furthermore most NYC public medical facilities are chronically overcrowded 
and are not receptive to any but the emergency needs of drug users and even to these only 
reluctantly. The demand for drug treatment greatly exceeds the available slots.

<b>Policy Determinants of Drug Use Contexts</b>
<p>
The Dutch drug policy has resulted in a stable availability, moderate prices and more 
consistent quality of drugs on the Dutch illegal market throughout the years compared with 
neighboring countries and the U.S.. (48) As in many other Dutch cities heroin and cocaine are 
mainly sold at so called house addresses: places where more or less stable social friendship 
groups of drug users gather and where they can buy and use their drugs in a relatively calm 
atmosphere. These places are often tolerated if they do not cause too much nuisance in the 
neighborhood. (see chapter nine) Only a minority of the subjects (23%) in the Rotterdam 
study used injecting as the main mode of administration, the other 77% smoked their drugs. 
This is made possible by the nature and purity of heroin available in The Netherlands. South 
West Asian base heroin (which is designed for smoking) has been available since the early 
1980s and the purity has been rather constant at ± 40%. (49 50) The average purity of (ceased) 
cocaine in 1991 was 80%. (51) Mainly because of economic considerations, it seems that many 
Dutch users do not feel the necessity to start injecting, as do many of their foreign counter-
parts. (48 52 53 54 55) The Dutch experience shows that when drug market variables are relatively 
stable over time, a well defined and stable smoking pattern can develop. (56) Widespread 
injecting can thus be seen as adaptation to a situation of low availability of drugs of known 
purity. Furthermore in The Netherlands the sale or possession of injecting equipment has never 
been restricted or a reason for arrest. Nowadays in Rotterdam (and in Amsterdam), when an 
IDU gets arrested (for example for committing acquisition crime) and is found to be carrying a 
used syringe, it is routinely taken in and exchanged for a sterile one. In 1991 the Rotterdam 
police precincts exchanged 2500 needles of arrested IDUs. (57) Finally the easy accessible drug 
treatment system in Rotterdam, ranging from low threshold methadone maintenance to 
detoxification clinics, therapeutic communities and resocialization and education projects, also 
adds a great deal to the stability of Rotterdam users. 1100 treatment places are available for a 
population of 2500 - 3500 heroin users (>33%). 
<p>
New York is a frontline of the War on Drugs. Over 250,000 drug related arrests occurred in 
1989. At any given moment, 20 to 25.000 drug users are incarcerated in city jails and an 
additional 10 - 15.000 in state prisons. (58) The majority of drug sales occur in unstable and 
dangerous settings. Packaged drugs are sold through holes in the boarded up doors or 
windows of abandoned buildings from which an unseen person passes an untried quantity of 
pre-packaged drugs to an anonymous customer, or pre-packaged drugs are sold by small 
groups of people who wander a particular block, or hover in a particular doorway. There is no 
privacy, and little time is allotted for each interaction. A good brand (quality) may attract lots 
of business, but this also attracts more police activity. This causes the constant moving around 
of dealer-collectives, resulting in the breaking of friendship ties and no quality guarantees 
whatsoever. Frequently, large numbers of young homeless drug users live together in 
abandoned apartment buildings, sharing the available resources. As there are no public toilets 
or washhouses, many homeless people live without access to clean water. Occasionally the 
crack house becomes a stable shelter. In one case in the Bronx, one functioned this way for 
nearly a year for more than 70 people. The place had two suspicious fires (and was ultimately 
demolished by the fire department) but not until the buildings were actually flattened and the 
rubble hauled off did the population disperse. Due to their high visibility and large numbers 
they were forced to take up residence in different locations and their own community support 
system was destroyed. 
<p>
The supply of heroin is often unstable in New York and this affects both price and purity. In 
fact, the purity level of New York City heroin is a complicated and confusing matter. Very 
little scientific data on the subject is available. Anecdotal sources (accounts from heroin users, 
service providers, field researchers and newspapers, such as the New York Times) present 
conflicting information. The quality of street level heroin is generally regarded as extremely 
unstable and varying by dealing site, time and brand name. (see below) The June 1990 Drug 
Price List Guide of the Narcotics Division of the New York City Police Department lists a 3% 
to 5% purity for $10.- glassines (dime bags), supposedly containing 1 to 3 grains (1 grain 
equals 65 mg), but also remarks that in some areas of the city purity may be as high as 25% to 
35%. (59) With a 1991 market share exceeding 70%, China White, a No.4 heroin has become the 
undisputed market leader of New York City's illicit heroin trade, supplemented by Pakistani, 
Nigerian and Mexican products. (60 61) 
<p>
Recent press publications have reported an upsurge in street heroin quality to levels averaging 
20% (62) to 40%. (60) A recent DEA Domestic Monitor Program study to determine the purity and 
price of retail level heroin showed an average purity in 20 exhibits analyzed of 41.4%, with a 
range between 2 and 76%. (63) The higher heroin quality has been related to bountiful supplies in 
the Golden Triangle, increasing import and dropping wholesale prices, and the increased 
control of traffickers over distribution, preventing that the drug is diluted as it passes down to 
the level of the street dealer. (60) To get some sense of the street validity of these figures, the 
author discussed them with three active NYC heroin users and several New York based 
colleagues, involved in drug use research, during work visits in June 1990, June 1991 and 
October 1992. The information indicating rising street purity was met with considerable 
skepticism. The consulted heroin users relegated the press publications to the realm of fiction. 
They felt that the bags they had scored over the last years at their regular copping zone's 
(South Bronx; Lower East Side; Williamsburg, Brooklyn) were of "the same shitty quality as 
always". "If the dope was that strong as these stories claim it is, people would fall out 
(overdose) the moment they got off". (64) In June 1990, one NYC researcher put it like this: 
"Rising quality? I don't believe that, The quality of heroin is about the same as it was 5-8 years 
ago and 15 years ago. Everything is in it, but the kitchen sink". (65) John Galea of the Street 
Research Unit in New York sincerely questioned the representativeness of the DEA survey for 
the NYC street scene. (66) And indeed, the sample is small, the sampling method unclear 
(location, undercover purchase or confiscated, etc.), and the established purity range 
extremely wide. 
<p>
Puzzled by the apparent discrepancies between the different sources, in June 1991, the author 
visited the laboratory of the New York City Police Department (NYCPD), where all 
confiscated drugs are tested in the process of preparing court cases. The following figures 
were kindly supplied by Ms. Bianchi, the chemist in charge of drug analyses. In 1990 her staff 
conducted 98.000 analyses (excluding FBI and DEA cases), 70.4% concerned cocaine and 
17.3% heroin. (67) Analyses results are recorded in hand-written logs. Because of this immense 
case load and the juridical incentive for the analyses, the results are not registered in a manner 
that makes scientific processing of these data possible. Browsing over the pages of the log 
with the results of quantitative analyses of heroin indicated that over the period from june 
1989 to june 1991 purity of street level samples (glassine $10.- bags) ranged from less than 
1% to almost 75%, while a few larger samples contained up to 98%. A subsequent 
conversation with the chief of the Special Projects Unit of the NYCPD Narcotics Division 
confirmed this picture. He claimed that for those users that have good connections ballpark 
heroin (high quality; ± 40%) is increasingly easy to procure. In his opinion, the purity of street 
heroin has definitely increased, but may fluctuate highly. (61) Clearly, these sources do not 
contradict the results of the DEA survey. 
<p>
The mismatch of these results with the opinions and experiences of the consulted researchers 
and heroin users is conspicuous. In addition to the already mentioned instability, two 
additional reasons may account for this discrepancy. First, these users may have unwittingly 
been using heroin which gradually increased in purity over a period of years. This assumption 
is supported by the account of a user who frequently traveled between New York and 
Amsterdam. His cross-atlantic consumer comparisons did not indicate large differences in 
purity. (68) Second, the average heroin quantity per street bag analyzed at the police laboratory 
decreased from ± 1.5 to 2 grains "some years ago" to only 0.25 to 0.5 grains in recent 
analyses. (67) Thus, while quality went up, quantity went down. A current purity of New York 
City's heroin of ± 40% on average does therefore not seem an unrealistic estimate, but local 
and temporal variations still make the product very unpredictable. The purity of ceased crack 
and cocaine hydrochloride is generally higher and more stable. Although the NYCPD 
laboratory has the impression of a slight decrease in purity over 1990 and 1991, 70% and up is 
normal. Because of the unstable purity, smoking heroin, which can be perceived as a 
protective factor for HIV contamination (69), is hardly a serious option for New York's opiate 
using population. 
<p>
IDUs have minimal access to sterile syringes in New York. The city's modest syringe exchange 
experiment was closed down for political reasons after one year of operating and the 
distribution of less than 400 syringes. The former Health Commissioner, Dr. Woodrow Myers, 
has withdrawn City funding for bleach distribution programs, contending that these 
approaches give the wrong message and condone drug use. The possession of a syringe is a 
misdemeanor, using it for drug injection a felony, and carrying a syringe is an invitation for 
police harassment. Given the legal status of syringes in NYC, renting injection equipment in a 
gallery is advisable. Not only does it protect the IDU from arrest on needles charges but may 
serve to convince (necessarily distrustful) dealer/gallery managers that an unfamiliar user is 
safe to admit to the venue. Shooting galleries with stable populations, consistent brands and 
family atmosphere exist, but this safer atmosphere is often threatened by chronic shortages of 
privacy, money, food, heat, drugs, or by intense harassment from police. Thus current drug 
policies foster less stable settings (abandoned buildings, cars, shooting galleries) where the 
same injection equipment is used over and over again by people often having no other 
relationship. 
<p>
Rotterdam's current policies have resulted in a relatively stable, aging heroin using 
population, (70 71) where annually, approximately 70% of the population is in contact with one or 
more drug agencies - 35% on a daily basis. Most Dutch drug users have more in common with 
their unemployed, but non drug using neighbor, than with the stereotypical alienated dope 
fiend. (69) In this context the messages of safe drug use and AIDS prevention can be 
communicated and more easily implemented and the actual sharing of needles and syringes has 
decreased significantly. (4 9 72) In New York City, with an estimated 200,000 IDUs, there are 
over 35,000 high threshold methadone maintenance slots available and another 6000 drug free 
therapeutic community beds. But, on a lifetime basis, fewer than 50% of New York's IDUs 
have had any contact with a treatment program and only 15 to 20% has daily contacts - most 
of these in methadone programs offering only minimal social services. (73) The typical New York 
IDU seems to be in far worse shape regarding health, legal and socioeconomic status then his 
or her Rotterdam counterpart. With the constant threat of arrest, unstable housing, and little 
secure income, AIDS just is not the biggest problem on the block for New York's drug users. 
<p>
Still the drug subcultures in both cities bear some remarkable similarities. Heroin and cocaine 
are the most used drugs in both populations and a large proportion of users substitute or 
supplement their use with methadone. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates are widely used to 
modulate the negative side effects of excessive cocaine use and to boost insufficient 
methadone doses. In New York it seems that drug users have complete pharmaceutical 
manuals in their heads and use whatever drugs they can lay their hands on. In Rotterdam this is 
an obsolete phenomenon, not seen since the early seventies when Dutch drug policy was still 
rather similar to American drug policy. 
<p>
The sharing of drugs and other resources is an important feature of the drug subculture in both 
cities. Drug users, labeled as structural outsiders and ostracized by mainstream society, have 
become mutually dependant in order to fulfill some basic human needs. The ritualized sharing 
of a most precious, scarce and binding object or substance has symbolic value and separates 
the in-group from the out-group. (74) In both cities drugs fulfill these requirements. But in 
Rotterdam, with sufficient availability of sterile syringes and AIDS education efforts, needle 
sharing has become a deviant act. There just is no structural scarcity, justifying a need to share 
injection equipment and hence the HIV risk is lowered. In the Bronx, even though there is 
clear evidence of drug user awareness of the risks of sharing needles or syringes, conditions 
dictate that even the most motivated IDU will still share injection equipment some of the 
time. (11) 
<p>
Interesting differences can also be seen in the level of ritualization expressed in the use of 
symbols and the different degree of organization and monetarization of mutual services. As 
explained before, retail drug sales at house addresses in Rotterdam are almost always weighed 
in the presence of the customer in a rather calm atmosphere. Buyers often sample their 
purchase on the spot, which gives them some degree of genuine control over purchased 
quality. Purchases are simply wrapped in packs of torn up magazine paper. In the lingo of the 
Rotterdam drug scene, heroin and cocaine have simply been known as bruin (brown = heroin) 
and wit (white = cocaine) for more than five years. In New York, drugs are almost always 
sold in public settings with great tension on the part of both the buyer and seller to move on 
quickly. Buyers have very little control over the pre-packed drugs they procure. The glassine 
heroin bags are stamped with striking and poignant brand names such as Miracle, Deathwish, 
Overkill, Untouchables, Check Mate, Obsession, Passion, Bodybag, Divinity, and Asesiño, 
(the murderer). A brand name symbolizes the dealing organization and the quality it 
represents. Thus, the New York buyer's only control is in this symbolic brand name. 
<p>
In Rotterdam, IDUs often administer their drugs at places that, on a face level, have some 
similarities with New York shooting galleries. However no explicit financial charges are asked 
for use of the setting although sometimes drugs are shared with the owner of the place. In 
both cities many IDUs suffer from collapsed veins and abscesses due to insufficient hygiene. 
Although many IDUs insist on injecting themselves, others are happy to get help from another, 
more experienced, injector. In contrast with the New York practice involving paid house 
doctors or professional hitters in shooting galleries (75 76 77 78), no explicit commercial 
counterpart of this service was found in Rotterdam. 
<p>
The presence of antibiotic dealers alongside heroin and cocaine dealers in the South Bronx is 
indicative of the interest that the street population takes in maintaining their health, and 
treating illnesses that do occur -- even if only to permit them to still hustle for drugs. In 
Rotterdam where most drug users have full health insurance this phenomenon has not 
occurred. 
<p>
All these phenomena, with similar or different outcomes in both cities, are firmly rooted in the 
respective drug subcultures. Although the drug subculture to many people seems a closed 
parallel world, mainstream cultural norms, policies and responses to (illicit) drug use plainly 
have important consequences on the everyday practice of drug users. These norms actually 
define and structure the features and social position of the drug subculture to a great extent. 
As Becker pointed out, the more any deviant group (i.e. deviant from the dominant cultural 
norms and values) is repressed and ostracized, the more it will profile itself as a deviant group 
and the more the deviant behavior, norms and values will get emphasized and reinforced in 
that group. (74) This results in a highly separated, intra-dependent, mono-focused subculture, in 
which members are very distrustful of mainstream culture. Inevitably this leads to skepticism 
about mainstream AIDS campaigns. In this respect the differences between the two cities are 
clear. Sharing and caretaking behaviors tend to be much less stable in New York than in 
Rotterdam and the more stereotypical negative behaviors associated with drug use are more 
likely in this harsh environment. Hence the powerful association of drug use, drug dealing and 
violence in NYC and the predictable hostility of the general public to the drug user.

<b>Future Work in Research, Practice and Policy</b>
<p>
The dynamics of the AIDS epidemic among IDUs in these two cities highlights the importance 
of basic knowledge of the lifestyles, behaviors and interaction of drug users in their naturally 
occurring social networks. Needle sharing is a partial representation of this complex reality, 
but overemphasizing the physical instrument of transmission is erroneous. The complex 
interaction patterns of economic and sociocultural factors involved in illegal drug use are 
equally important to the spread of HIV. It is this complex arrangement of interacting factors 
which should be the object of intensive future research. Without a clear concept of the 
everyday reality of drug use, quantification can be risky. Frontloading would not have been 
identified using a questionnaire, simply because, at first, the researchers were not looking for 
it. It was a serependipitous finding based on observation of the natural setting of drug use. 
Ethnographic studies provide the best opportunity for assembling a database pertaining to 
these naturalistic phenomena. Following this, quantitative instruments can be designed and 
utilized to test the specific hypotheses generated. 
<p>
Both qualitative and quantitative research can gain much in value if the knowledge of active 
drug users can be employed in all phases of research. This requires the active collaboration of 
practicing drug users, an idea that is gaining attention and application. (79 80) For example, the use of focus groups which can be very important in validating new instruments and evaluating
analysis outcomes. (40 81) Employing stabilized drug users in research teams will create natural 
entry into what is, for most researchers, a hidden parallel world. It can add a great deal of 
depth to analysis, disclose new leads and perspectives, and will surely stimulate scientific 
discussion in research teams on matters that before were undisputed or unrecognized (e.g. the 
extent and significance of needle sharing). It furthermore empowers the drug users as it gives 
them the opportunity to correct stereotypical or incomplete depictions. 
<p>
Priorities regarding goals and methods of drug services need to be reconsidered, particularly in 
places like the Bronx where only a minority of drug users are in daily contact with treatment 
and helping agencies. When it is acknowledged that the prevention of AIDS must have a 
higher priority than the dubious goal of a drug-free society, effective harm minimization 
strategies have to be designed, brought into practice and evaluated. (82) Active drug users 
without contacts with treatment or helping agencies will find themselves more often in risk 
situations than users who are in contact with these institutions. Reaching and educating this 
hidden population must be given top priority. This should be accomplished through a 
permanent street outreach and organizing process of active IDUs equipped with the necessary 
tools to change their behavior in the desired direction. Outreach work plays a crucial role in 
this process, as the only possible way to reach this population is to enter its own territory. 
<p>
However, outreach to this population should meet specific conditions. Rescue-style outreach 
programs frequently alienate or insult those they seek. AIDS education programs, while 
generally more comfortable dealing with sex and drug issues, frequently make the mistake of 
only talking about AIDS, sterile syringes, bleach and condoms. The outreaching hand is either 
trying to grab and rescue the people it wants to reach or pushing a message upon them. The 
AIDS prevention message is naturally of great importance, but can only be properly received 
when it fits within the existing knowledge base and everyday life of those involved. Active 
drug users themselves can have significant roles in the prevention of HIV spread and infection. 
Their information and exchange networks might be utilized in promoting risk reduction 
messages and behavior change through the social organization of the drug subculture. The 
message should be wrapped in a package that addresses the concrete and recurrent problems 
tied to this specific lifestyle and links up with existing norms and practices. Employing 
indigenous people as outreach workers in such programs will be of essential value. This is 
especially important in Europe as drug use among immigrant populations emerges as a major 
issue requiring attention. 
<p>
Both in Rotterdam and New York good examples can be found of innovative working 
methods that are in concordance with the rules and daily practices of the drug subculture. In 
Rotterdam most syringe exchange programs are tied to the methadone programs, which are in 
contact with less than 40% of the heroin users. These needle exchanges only reach a limited 
number of active, out-of-treatment users. As these users are perceived as being most at risk, 
HADON tries to fill this gap by running a needle exchange in close cooperation with active 
IDUs. At highly frequented places where drug injection is allowed (some dealing places, some 
private homes of injectors; not actual shooting galleries) sharpsafe containers and boxes of 
sterile syringes are available. The syringes are exchanged among the visiting injectors and 
distributed through the networks by IDUs themselves. (83) 
<p>
In New York, an underground needle exchange is run by volunteers from ACTUP and the 
National AIDS Brigade. These volunteers (many of them (ex-)users) do their covert work at 
places that are frequently visited by IDUs -- shooting galleries, street copping zones and other 
congregation sites. They offer a wide variety of injecting paraphernalia such as syringes, 
cookers, cotton, alcohol wipes, antibiotic ointment, bleach, water, a choice of needles, and 
also condoms. When needed and asked for, IDUs are referred and guided to methadone 
maintenance and other treatment modalities. (84) In addition, IDUs are thought valuable street 
skills for safer self-injection (preventing trackmarks, abscesses, edema, cellulitis, venous 
collapse, etc.) and safer professional sex (assessing the violence potential of johns, sneaking 
condoms onto them during oral sex, faking vaginal and anal sex with the hands). (75)
<p>
Both these initiatives are well accepted by the consumers and therefore offer a potentially 
effective mode for teaching and promoting lasting behavior change. However, both programs 
experienced strong opposition from established drug treatment programs, municipal policy 
makers and, in New York, the law: institutions not used to looking at these issues from a user 
perspective. So in Rotterdam, HADON got restricted from supplying drug wrappers printed 
with AIDS-prevention messages and needle exchange addresses to dealing drug users, 
although this was a perfect example of the application of marketing theory principles. And in 
New York, street health educators risk arrest and prosecution for their efforts to save lives, 
and bleach distribution programmes experience punitive budget cuts. It should be understood 
that mainstream morality regarding drug use, and old concepts of dealing with drug problems 
have become obsolete in the AIDS-era, and do not meet the criteria for effective AIDS-
prevention efforts. The drug services field is in serious need of pragmatic approaches based on 
sound knowledge of the drug subculture and its mechanisms.
<p>
Drug policy is a decisive factor (for better or for worse) in the course and development of the 
AIDS epidemic among drug users and, potentially, the wider population. Inappropriate drug 
policies in many countries may actually facilitate the dissemination of HIV infection. (85) Thus 
the continued spread of AIDS among IDUs should become a sentinel for the failure of 
prevalent drug policies. Several countries, among them Australia, France, Germany and 
Switzerland, are all in the process of reconsidering their current drug policy --especially about 
the use of methadone and possession of clean injecting equipment. While the AIDS epidemic 
appears to support the need for a public health approach and pragmatic drug policies built on 
harm minimization principles, the U.S. government still aggressively promotes its drug policies 
as an example for many western countries, despite its evident failure at home. And, while 
many Americans have raised their voice against this harm maximization policy (86), the war on 
drugs rhetoric is getting more and more intense. Oddly enough, this situation shows some 
peculiar similarities with the situation in the Soviet Union just before Michael Gorbachov took 
over, or the last days of the Berlin wall. In these cases the old fashioned communist rhetoric 
were the last desperate cries of a system on the verge of collapse, and completely discredited 
and rejected by the population. After more than 70 years of prohibition of free enterprise, 
Eastern Europeans now admit the failure of the communist experiment, abandon its ideologies 
and turn to pragmatic approaches to their countries' cataclysmic economic problems. 
Likewise, 75 years of policies based on drug prohibition have brought the world no solution 
for compulsive use by a minority of drug users -- indeed the problem worsens as this dogmatic 
policy is extended and it has brought our societies nothing but devastation and an ever 
increasing social and political predicament.
<p>
Perhaps it is time for some perestroika in the drug wars.

<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
Part one of this dissertation analyzed the rituals and rules that have developed in the 
subculture of regular users of heroin and cocaine. The presented data showed that both on 
individual and group level the functions and meanings of drug use rituals are multifold and 
intertwined, serving instrumental as well as symbolic goals. The analysis linked these rituals 
with other ritualistic behavior patterns, which serve several intrinsically human --individual and 
social-- needs. Part two presented studies on the health consequences of the observed 
administration, and sharing and exchange rituals, their relationship with policy and an 
intervention which utilized and reinforced common ritualized behaviors. 
<p>
A prominent feature of the studied rituals and rules is that they aim to control or regulate the 
drug taking experience. This is most apparent in the stereotypical behavioral sequences 
surrounding self-administration of drugs by the individual drug user, but it also plays a distinct 
role in many observed (ritualized) interactions, for example in the recurrent sharing of drugs. 
Thus, the data offer strong support for Zinberg's theory, that the control of drugs is largely 
established by (sub)culturally based social controls --rituals and rules (as Zinberg called them, 
social sanctions) which pattern the way a drug is used. Ultimately, users themselves regulate 
their use of intoxicants through a peer based social learning process, in which specific rituals 
and rules are developed as adaptations to the effects of the interaction between drug, set and 
setting. (1 2)
<p>
However, it has also become clear that the ability to self-regulate drug use is not evenly spread 
over all users. Some users seem able to use large amounts of cocaine (and heroin) without or 
with little of the characteristic problems described in chapter five, whereas others --typically 
the down and out users hanging around the Central Station-- actually use very little of these 
(expensive) drugs, but seem most susceptible to their related (psychological) problems. 
<p>
This paradoxical observation leads to two suppositions: 1) As was already contended in 
chapter 7, self-regulation or control is more than limiting ones intake. It equally refers to the 
prevention and management of drug related problems and should, therefore, be perceived as a 
multidimensional process. 2) The effectivity of rituals and rules in exercising control over drug 
use is apparently moderated by additional factors, which impact on the individual's ability to 
comply with these social regulatory processes.
<p>
Recapitulating, it is thus clear that, conforming to Zinberg's theory, rituals and rules are key 
determinants of drug use self-regulation processes. However, Zinberg's theory does not 
explain the intra-group variation in the ability to effectively utilize these social controls, found 
in this study. Nor does it account for the multidimensional nature of self-regulation processes. 
Besides rituals and rules, the theory does not explicitly address other potential factors which 
may impact upon the effectivity of these social controls. In that respect, Zinberg's theory is 
rather static. This does not make it invalid, but does, indeed, signify a need for revision. The 
theory requires certain adaptations and elaborations that will make it possible to explain the 
dissonant findings of this study. 
<p>
In this chapter an attempt is made to revise Zinberg's theory. The chapter will introduce and 
discuss two distinct (clusters of) factors that, in addition to the concept of rituals and rules, are 
thought to be essential determinants of the self-regulation processes that control drug use. 
These factors are Drug Availability and Life Structure. (3) The chapter will explore the nature of, 
and interactions between Drug Availability, Rituals and Rules, and Life Structure. The 
chapter's ultimate purpose is to present a hypothetical model which explains controlled use of 
drugs in terms of a dynamic interaction between these three distinct factors. Evidently, this 
model builds on the work of Zinberg as it seeks to specify and detail the variables that 
constitute the social setting, in which self-regulation processes take shape. 
<p>
To demonstrate the model, a secondary analysis of the 1989 treatment admission data of the 
Rotterdam methadone programs (RODIS) is presented. This secondary analysis was 
stimulated by some peculiar results in the 1989 RODIS report regarding the prevalence of 
cocaine use in different ethnic groups, which, apparently, resembled the two cocaine/heroin 
patterns found in the field study (see chapter 5.4.3). The 1989 RODIS report contains 
separate chapters on cocaine use and ethnicity, in which cocaine use (and whether or not this 
was experienced as problematic); life time prevalence of overdose, psychotic episodes, 
unconsciousness and seizures; the level of heroin use; and their mutual associations are 
considered. (4) These chapters provide the basic material for the present secondary analysis. 
<p>
First, these RODIS data are presented and discussed in light of the analyses in chapters five 
and seven. Ensuing, the issue will be further investigated in the secondary analysis. In the next 
step the findings of this analysis will be discussed in terms of the three determinants of the 
proposed model, whereafter a general explanation of the model will be presented.

<b>The Secondary Analysis of the RODIS Data</b>
<p>
<I>Distribution of cocaine use and problems associated with its use</I>
<p>
RODIS classified treatment applicants' cocaine use in three categories --non-user (32%), user 
(62%) and problematic user of cocaine (6%) (N = 1095). (4) Not surprisingly, the reported 
prevalence of overdose, psychotic episodes, unconsciousness and seizures increased from non-
users to cocaine users to problematic cocaine users. The prevalence of these problems was 
also analyzed for differences between the following (aggregated) ethnic groups: Dutch, 
Surinamese/Antilleans, Moroccans and foreigners. The Surinamese/Antillean group scored 
lowest on all four indicators, while the Dutch had the highest scores on three out of four. 
<p>
The ethnic composition of the cocaine use groups showed a highly compatible picture. The 
Dutch users were over-represented among non-users and, more dramatically, among 
problematic users. 36% of the Dutch users abstained from cocaine use, 55% used cocaine 
without perceiving it as a problem and 9% labeled their cocaine use as problematic. In 
contrast, among the Surinamese/Antillean users the prevalence of cocaine use was significantly 
higher (77%), but seemingly this resulted in fewer problems (3%). Problematic cocaine use 
was apparently absent among Turkish and Moroccan clients, while the foreign clients 
resembled the total population. 
<p>
Comparison of these data suggests that the bulk of the problems in the cocaine using groups is 
presented by the Dutch, whereas the Surinamese/Antillean contribution is negligible. Thus, 
while they use less frequently, Dutch heroin users more often experience problems with 
cocaine use and score highest on three out of four of the RODIS indicators of problems. A 
completely opposite picture is presented by the Surinamese/Antillean heroin users. They score 
lowest on all problems indicators, using cocaine significantly more often with considerably less 
problems. 
<p>
Table 17.1
<p>
<I>Distribution of cocaine/heroin patterns </I>
<p>
As was established in chapters five and seven, heroin use is positively correlated with cocaine 
use --heroin is employed to control the negative side effects of cocaine. This general trend was 
also clear in the RODIS data (see table 7.1 in chapter 7.2.2). However, the ethnographic 
analysis also suggested the existence of two different cocaine/heroin patterns (see chapter 
5.4.3). The ethnic breakdown of the quantity of heroin use of the treatment applicants in 
RODIS showed differences between the ethnic groups, which might confirm these patterns. 
Dutch users were rather evenly spread over the three categories, while the 
Surinamese/Antillean and other groups were more often using little or much heroin. (table 
17.1). (4) To further explore these differences, the RODIS data has been broken down to the 
genuine ethnic groups/nationalities. The resulting database consisted of 651 Dutch, 175 
Surinamese, 67 Moroccan, 34 German, 29 Antillean and 20 Turkish users. 17 users came from 
Belgium and Luxembourg, 38 from other EC-countries and 9 were non EC European 
residents. 9 users came from other Mediterranean countries and 34 from non European 
countries. 
<p>
Table 17.2
<p>
Table 17.3
<p>
The analysis of their cocaine use showed an increased difference between the Dutch and the 
Surinamese, while the cocaine use patterns of the Antilleans fell somewhat in between. The 
Moroccan and Turkish patterns did not change and the Germans more or less resembled the 
Dutch. Apart from the Surinamese and the Dutch, all other groups were either too small or 
too heterogeneous for further inclusion in the analysis. Table 17.2 shows the large difference 
in cocaine use prevalence between the Dutch and the Surinamese heroin users, applying for 
treatment in Rotterdam. 
<p>
To assess the relationship between cocaine use and level of heroin use in the two groups, these 
variables were cross-tabulated for the Dutch and Surinamese heroin users separately. Tables 
17.3 and 17.4 present the results of this procedure. Comparison of these tables first of all 
supports the suggestion that differences in heroin use are related to cocaine use. The patterns 
of heroin use of the Dutch and the Surinamese non cocaine users follow a rather similar 
distribution, corresponding with that of the total group of non-users (see table 7.1 in chapter 
7.2.2). In both groups, almost 3/4 of the people use either less than 250 mg (low level) or 
between 500 mg and 1 g (high level), with the Dutch displaying a somewhat higher prevalence 
of low level use. About 1/4 uses 250-500 mg (middle level). 
<p>
Table 17.4
<p>
These results also seem to confirm the cocaine/heroin patterns observed in the field study. 
Among Dutch cocaine users a gradual increase in heroin use can be observed --the middle and 
to a greater extent the high level increase, while the low level group decreases (pattern I). 
When Dutch users take cocaine, they counter the negative side effects of this stimulant with 
increasing doses of heroin. In the Surinamese group the high level increases considerably and 
the low level slightly, while the size of the middle group strongly decreases. When taking 
cocaine, Surinamese users either use much (pattern I) or little heroin (pattern II). Thus, a large 
number of cocaine taking Surinamese heroin users can do so without increasing their use of 
heroin as well. 
<p>
Recapitulating, the results of this comparison suggest that Surinamese users more often use 
cocaine, but experience less problems with the use of this drug, even without employing the 
typical subcultural self-medication procedures, involving increased heroin use. 
<p>
The results of these secondary analyses correspond largely with the analysis of the fieldwork 
data. The results presented in chapter five suggested that users, who are successfully involved 
in dealing are in a better position to exercise control over their drug use (and have strong 
incentives to do so), suffer less from cocaine related problems and depend less on the heroin 
controls cocaine ritual as they use much more cocaine than heroin (pattern II). Indeed, this 
correspondence can be understood by the relatively high involvement of the Surinamese users 
in consumer level drug transactions. Although all ethnic groups in this study were, to some 
extent, involved in consumption level dealing, the Surinamese dominated retail dealing, 
occupied the key positions in multi-ethnic crews, and had the best connections with the middle 
level suppliers, as these positions were often held by Surinamese also. Suppliers contacted 
during the field work were all Surinamese males, who abstained from heroin use. Several 
recent studies confirm the relatively higher involvement of the Surinamese in dealing. (5 6 7 8 9 10 
11) For example, in the study by Grapendaal and colleagues 55% of the dealers were 
Surinamese, whereas these only comprised 19% of their sample. (5) 
<p>
The suggestion that it is their higher involvement in dealing which enables the Surinamese 
users to exercise control more efficiently is examined in the following section in terms of 
availability, life structure, and rituals and rules.

<b>Determinants of Drug Use Self-Regulation</b>
<p>
<I>Drug Availability</I>
<p>
Maintenance of the high use levels typical in the population under study requires a sufficient 
availability of drugs and the necessary funds to finance this. Legal income is normally 
insufficient to cover high drug use levels. In general, the resources required can therefore only 
be generated through prostitution (which is not illegal in The Netherlands) or illegal activities, 
such as acquisition crime or (mostly consumption level) drug dealing. Success in one of these 
hustles is thus an important condition for maintaining high use levels. In the Dutch context the 
most lucrative hustle is dealing. Consumption level drug transactions are tolerated to a large 
degree. In contrast, stealing has become more difficult over the years, partly due to increased 
property protection. The heroin using population in The Netherlands is furthermore aging and 
criminal careers become too demanding for long-term and older users. (5) Not only are they fed 
up with the stressful daily pursuit of money, their skills (in terms of e.g. physical condition and 
appearance) have also deteriorated. 
<p>
Similar factors may influence the earnings of users involved in (street) sex work. The number 
of johns and the price for the sexual service may vary with daily fluctuations in weather, 
physical condition (e.g. signs of withdrawal), genital infections, periods and pregnancies 
(women only), and seasonal and event specific influences, such as Christmas or football 
matches. (12) Deterioration of appearance as a result of aging, poorly managed drug use and 
lifestyle is of major economic concern for sex workers. A successful hustle in crime or 
prostitution is therefore reserved for only a minority of users. Given the Dutch conditions, 
successful users --in terms of being able to consume (high quantities of) drugs without 
experiencing the, often axiomatically with drug use associated problems-- will thus most likely 
be involved in dealing. 
<p>
<I>Drug Availability Influences the Nature of Rituals and Rules</I>
<p>
Drug availability has thus a pivotal impact on the daily lives of regular drug users. Artificially 
limiting the availability of drugs may limit their intake of drugs to a certain degree, but at 
considerable (psycho-social) expense. Apart from creating a strong economic incentive for the 
sale of drugs in unregulated entrepreneurial circuits, restricting availability induces and fuels a 
psycho-social process, which greatly multiplies the ritual value of drugs --ushering in a 
narrowing of focus in the user. Fixation on the drug will lead to strong limitation of behavioral 
expressions when the drug is craved and difficult to obtain, and to impulsive indulgence when 
a dose becomes available. As a result, rituals and rules around the drug become less directed at 
self-regulation and safety in the sense of health, but more at safeguarding, covering and 
facilitating drug use and the related activities (e.g. drug transactions) itself. (13) In contrast, the 
absence of uncertainty as to the whereabouts of the next dose liberates the user from the 
recurrent obsessive worries with (obtaining) the drugs and the necessity to chase them. 
Sufficient availability thus creates a situation in which rituals and rules can develop which 
restrain drug use and induce stable use patterns. As the results indicate, this does not 
necessarily mean lower levels of drug use. When the drugs are sufficiently available, the 
studied users can seemingly sustain high consumption levels, without developing typical drug 
related problems. 
<p>
A sufficient drug availability can therefore be understood as a precondition for the 
development and effectivity of rituals and rules that regulate the patterns and levels of use.
<p>
<I>Life Structure</I>
<p>
An equally important condition is that the availability of drugs is stable. This requires that the 
hustles users engage in to generate drug money are successful on a stable basis. Recently 
Faupel constructed a typology of heroin users, based on a cross-classification of drug 
availability and life structure --which refers to "the regularly occurring patterns of domestic, 
recreational, work, and criminal activity that shape and constrain the daily life of heroin 
users". (3)
<p>
Figure 17.1
<p>
Faupel used this typology to explain the maintenance and breaching of the ethical standards of 
the heroin subculture by individual heroin users. An important finding of his research was that 
the careers of users who were able to uphold their ethical standards were not only 
characterized by a high availability of drugs, but also by a high degree of life structure. (3) 
<p>
Faupel emphasized the regular activities (both conventional and drug use related) that 
structure daily patterns as key determinants of life structure. (3) It seems logical to include 
people's connections, commitments, obligations, responsibilities, goals, expectancies, etc.. 
Relationships and aspirations that are demanding, and simultaneously have value in social (e.g. 
affection) or economical (e.g. income) ways are equally important determinants of life 
structure. Regular contacts with controlled and non-users are therefore of considerable 
importance, as is participation in structures and activities not (primarily) driven by drug related 
incentives. 
<p>
<I>Life Structure and the Stability of Drug Availability</I>
<p>
Faupel's findings suggest that, although a high drug availability is essential for the development 
of social controls, without a stable life structure it only offers them limited support. The 
importance of life structure is most clearly demonstrated by its absence as represented by the 
free-wheeling junkie (Figure 17.1). A sudden rise in availability of drugs or money --a big 
sting-- interferes with or undermines the daily, and largely fixed pattern of (both conventional 
and drug) activities, and may result in a sharp escalation of drug use. When then drugs and 
money are finished, the user very often finds himself in a worse position --habituated to a 
higher consumption level, while the connections required for a steady generation of income 
have been neglected. (3) The account of Assad in chapter 5.5 offers a perfect illustration.
<p>
Several recent Dutch studies documented a differentiated image of the heroin user that is only 
poorly compatible with the stereotype of the uncontrolled junkie. These studies indicate that 
the life structure of an increasing number of heroin users bears a considerable resemblance 
with that of their non drug using unemployed neighbor in terms of time allocation and social 
activities. (14 15 16 17) Many heroin users maintain a considerable number of non drug-related 
connections. Apart from family ties, one third to 40% share their housing with non-users 
(including partners), while one third to 40% of friends and acquaintances are non-users. (6 17) 
The typical (if one can speak in such terms) heroin user is ± 30 years old and spends more time 
on watching TV, than on chasing drugs, while the main income source is the social security 
system. (5 6 14 18) Methadone forms the basis of the drug menu and the amount of drugs he uses is 
more determined by the available resources than vice versa. (6 15) When involved in criminal 
activities he tries to uphold relatively high ethical standards characterized by a dislike of 
violence. (5) This depiction seems to represent the most common end phase of a long (> 10 
years) heroin career and is significant for the aging population. 
<p>
Using the concept of deviant career, Grapendaal et al. used the term normalized user for this 
type of user. In their study they furthermore distinguished the dealing user and the criminal 
user. Both these types used more cocaine and heroin than the normalized user. Their study 
suggest that the dealing user is a rather persistent type, while the criminal type is more often a 
phase preceding the normalized user -- at some point in the career this lifestyle becomes too 
demanding and the user calms down. (5) Another outcome may lead to a fourth type: the 
marginalized or down and out user, who lost the skills to make money, is often homeless, cut 
off from most former contacts, and troubled by intensive psychological problems begs other 
users for a mazzeltje (a taste) or searches the street for crumbs. 
<p>
This picture is largely in line with the conclusion of 17.3.1. Maintaining the demanding life 
structure of the successful criminal is only reserved for a limited number of users, during a 
limited period of time. When the necessary skills and resources are exhausted, the user either 
retires or marginalizes. In the first case, self-regulation strategies increasingly depend on 
activities that help the user to abstain from or, minimize use of illicit drugs, supported by 
regular use of methadone. In the latter case, the conditions to do so are absent. The durability 
of the dealer type, at the other hand, signifies a comparably stable pattern of relatively 
controlled use of heroin and cocaine, as part of a highly structured entrepreneurial career. 
<p>
Consumption level dealing can, indeed, be compared with any other small retail business, in 
particular with a small street or market vendor. Successful dealing is primarily a matter of 
good shopkeeping and obeys similar economic demands and rules. At the end of each day the 
small retailer must have earned the money to pay for his stock for the next day, the wages of 
employees, other business costs and the costs of living. When it was a good day or week, the 
surplus income can be invested or spent on luxury goods. This little entrepreneur must have a 
good sense of his financial position. So must the small dealer:
<p>
<blockquote>He counts the money and studies a list with numbers. Then he says, "Well, we 
made a small profit after all now." </blockquote>
<p>
Such simple bookkeeping has been observed several times. Just as his fellow marginal, but less 
criminalized colleague the small dealer does not normally have large (financial) reserves and 
therefore small mistakes can have major consequences:
<p>
<blockquote>Harrie complains that business is going bad last days. "Yesterday we lost ¦400.- 
on the dealing. We forgot the scale so that I had to do the weighing without." </blockquote>
<p>
A few more mistakes and the dealer is out of business. A successful dealer works often on 
fixed hours, with a stable team of employees and keeps precise track of the financial balance. 
He can, for example, not afford himself to show up at the dealing place at random times, 
unless he has monopoly power. But this is not the case in Rotterdam. The Rotterdam 
consumption level market for heroin and cocaine is in essence an open market with 
considerable, but generally peaceful competition. Besides a certain degree of commercial 
skills, a product of reasonable quality and the will to sell on tick and give betermakertjes and 
mazzeltjes (tastes) to regular customers in need, successful entrepreneurship requires stability 
and continuity. Such stipulations substantially structure the time allocation of those 
successfully involved in dealing. 
<p>
<I>Rituals and Rules</I>
<p>
Maintaining scheduled activities and fulfilling social obligations, etc. --thus maintaining a 
stable, high degree of life structure-- requires rather careful management of drug consumption 
and related activities. Such management is dependent on the development of, and compliance 
with, rituals and rules. (1) In The Netherlands, heroin users have developed rituals and rules to 
control the use of this drug in the course of twenty years of collective experience. Compared 
with the situation abroad, heroin users in The Netherlands experience relatively minimal 
repression. This, and the easy accessibility of the heroin substitute methadone, have been 
indispensable facilitators of the social learning processes that facilitate controlled drug use. Of 
course, this process has not been complete. A majority of the users in this study still 
experience problems with heroin. One reason is that heroin remains a very expensive drug, 
inducing availability problems. Likewise, there are almost no models of controlled heroin use 
available. Furthermore, people are socialized into heroin use in the context of a subculture that 
was formed under more repressive and unstable conditions. The addition of other drugs to the 
daily use patterns also complicated self-regulation processes. 
<p>
In particular, the nesting of cocaine in these heroin rituals disrupted the process to a 
considerable degree. But cocaine did not stop the pursuit for control. Adaptation to the 
changed pharmacological factor in Zinberg's concept (from heroin to cocaine) is a prominent 
feature of the current cocaine/heroin patterns. However, the combination of cocaine's 
pharmacology, high use frequencies and rapid delivery systems, results in subjective 
availability problems, which considerably burdens the adaptation process. It is therefore 
expected that the first signs of adaptation to cocaine will be found among users who have 
comparably easy access to cocaine and heroin, and a high degree of life structure. 
<p>
Again, this points in the direction of users involved in dealing. Not only their position provides 
the conditions required for their development and maintenance (sufficient level of drug 
availability and the degree of life structure to maintain it on a steady basis), dealing also 
provides the incentive to comply with regulatory rituals and rules. Controlling ones drug use 
during working hours is a prerequisite for successful participation in the drug trade. Leisure 
time drug use may likewise not interfere with occupational stipulations and it must thus also be 
contained by similar social controls. 
<p>
Of course, not only their privileged dealing position enabled the Surinamese users to better 
regulate their drug use. Several, partly related, factors further supported stability. For 
example, Surinamese users often exert rather intense social pressure on each other to remain in 
control. (10 19) To a certain extent, social control is also exercised by non-using partners and 
family. (20) The Winti folk religion may add further restrains. (20) Thus, in particular in the domains 
of life structure and ritual and rules, Surinamese users experience additional controlling 
factors.

<b>A Feedback Model of Drug Use Self-Regulation</b>
<p>
<I>The DARRLS-Trinity: Drug Availability, Rituals and Rules, Life Structure</I>
<p>
The dealers' higher level of self-control can now be explained as an example of the interaction 
between drug availability, rituals and rules, and life structure. The high drug availability of 
dealers is evident. Regular involvement in drug selling also provides the necessary degree of 
life structure. Successful consumption level dealing is subject to similar economic demands 
and rules as any other small retail business. It provides the structured activity, while relating 
with customers, crew and wholesale suppliers engender demanding connections, 
commitments, obligations, responsibilities and expectancies. Thus, the stipulations of 
successful entrepreneurship structure the time allocation of those involved in dealing to a large 
extent. To maintain dealing activities successfully, the dealing user must regulate his personal 
use, so that it does not interfere with (the schedules and demands that contribute to) taking 
care of business. Such rituals and rules can only develop under the condition of sufficient drug 
availability. 
<p>
Drug availability, rituals and rules, and life structure must thus be considered in coherence. 
The continuity of drug availability is dependent on the stability of life structure which results 
from rather strict compliance to the rituals and rules regulating patterns of drug use. Because 
availability is a precondition for the development and maintenance of regulating rituals and 
rules, the following hypothetical model can now be formulated: 
<p>
<blockquote>Drug Availability, Rituals and Rules, and Life Structure are a trinity --interactive 
factors in an internally coherent circular process, in which these factors are themselves 
modulated (modified, corrected, strengthened, etc.) by their outcomes. It is thus a 'feedback 
circuit' that determines the strength of self-regulation processes controlling drug 
use.</blockquote>
<p>
This model --the DARRLS-Trinity-- is graphically represented in figure 17.2. 
<p>
Figure 17.2
<p>
Rituals and rules determine and constrain the patterns of drug use, preventing an erosion of 
life structure. A high degree of life structure enables the user to maintain a stable drug 
availability, which is essential for the formation and maintenance of efficient rules and rituals. 
Self-regulation of drug consumption and its (unintended) effects is thus a matter of a 
(precarious) balance of a circularly reinforcement chain. 
<p>
<I>External Determinants of the DARRLS-Trinity: Effects of Drug Policy</I>
<p>
Although this feedback model is circular, it is not a closed and independent circuit. The three 
cornerstones of the feedback model are each the result of distinctive variables and processes. 
Drug availability is determined by price, purity and accessibility, which are mediated by market 
factors and governmental regulations. (figure 17.3) Rituals and rules are the product of 
culturally defined social learning processes. (figure 17.4) 
<p>
Figure 17.3
<p>
Figure 17.4
<p>
The shape and degree of life structure are the product of the regular activities, relationships 
and ambitions which may be drug related or not. General socio-economic factors and actual 
living conditions, personality structure and the prevalence of (non drug related) psycho-social 
problems, and cultural factors may further determine life structure. (figure 17.5) Clearly, 
external stimuli can impact on the feedback system, in particular on its ability to support 
controlled and adjust uncontrolled use. 
<p>
Figure 17.5
<p>
The social definition of drugs and their users, embodied in drug policy, can be seen to affect 
the model at all three cornerstones. Excluding alcohol and tobacco, most, if not all current 
drug policies are based on some degree of prohibition, rooted in criminal law. (21) Legalization is 
a term that is often used to represent the opposite of prohibition or the situation this term 
refers to. What is actually meant with the words prohibition and, especially legalization is not 
always evident. The words are often used in quite a holistic sense --not infrequently 
functioning as a smoke screen. The latter is then lumped together with related but distinct 
concepts such as decriminalization and normalization, whereas the former gets equated with 
the war on drugs. (21)
<p>
According to Webster's New World Dictionary (22) the word prohibition originates from the 
Latin word prohibitio and refers, besides to the 1920-1933 U.S. federal ban on beverage 
alcohol, to 1. "a prohibiting or being prohibited" and 2. "an order or law forbidding something 
to be done". The word is a derivative from the verb to prohibit, which Webster's describes as 
1. "to refuse to permit; forbid by law or by an order" and 2. "to prevent; hinder". Prohibition 
forbids, or commands individuals to refrain from, certain action or behavior. Drug prohibition 
commands people to refrain from the use of drugs, based on the premise that use of these 
substances is unacceptable. It is, however, obvious that a considerable number of people 
disagree with this point of view and consequently disobey such commands. In that respect it is 
clear that only the weaker connotation (to hinder) of the second meaning of the verb is 
applicable, as drug prohibition does not prevent drug use. Note that, although often implicitly 
assumed, prohibition is more a process than an unequivocal phenomenon, as both historically 
and geographically considerable variations can be found. 
<p>
Legalization, or the L-word as it nowadays is often euphemistically referred to in American 
discussions on drug policy, also refers to a process: According to Webster's the term means 
"to make legal or lawful". The word is derived from the adjective legal which originates from 
the latin word legalis, meaning 1. "of, created by, based upon, or authorized by law" and 2. "in 
conformity with the positive rules of law; permitted by law". Legalization is thus a process that 
reacts upon and seeks to abolish the prohibition of drugs, which is perceived as a failing and 
counter-productive process. (23) Legalization is not the alternative or opposite of prohibition, but 
merely paves the way for alternative drug control policies, outside of criminal law, which are 
expected to be more successful. Beyond this, the term does not entail any information on the 
nature of such policies. 
<p>
Clearly, both terms give rise to confusion and various interpretations. Drug prohibition does 
not necessarily mean a total war on drugs and legalization is not a synonym for free, 
uncontrolled availability of drugs --the terms do not represent a factual dichotomy and may, 
indeed, be merely expressions of the academic argot of the advocates of the competing 
perspectives in the drug debate. (21) Despite the preceding linguistic discussion, prohibition has 
come to symbolize the (variably enforced) illegal status of drugs, while legalization denotes 
the opposite state, in which drugs are legal. While this imposed dichotomy bears some obvious 
risks, it can serve the present investigation of the effects of drug policy on the DARRLS-
Trinity, when its limitations are kept in mind. Therefore, figures 17.6 to 17.9 present such 
dichotimized representations of the continuum from prohibition to legalization. 
<p>
Figure 17.6
<p>
Given the socio-political conditions of drug prohibition it is evident that availability is the 
weakest link in the chain as prohibition artificially limits drug availability. (figure 17.6) 
Prohibition may obstruct the possibilities for drug use to a certain degree, thereby limiting 
general prevalence. It has, however, been argued that this, so called, deterrence effect of 
prohibition primarily reinforces already existing anti-drug attitudes. (21) But prohibition induces a 
broad spectrum of reactions from users, aimed at circumventing its effects and provides the 
economic incentive for unregulated entrepreneurial ventures --prohibition turned drugs into a 
highly profitable commodity. While its aim is to make drugs unavailable, it has only created an 
uncontrolled availability. Overall the availability of drugs may be lower, but in situations, 
specific neighborhoods and sub-populations which are more susceptible drug availability is 
actually much higher. This may well be a main factor in the spread of drug use. (24 25)
<p>
Figure 17.7
<p>
Prohibition affects the formation of rituals and rules as it obstructs and interferes with natural 
social learning processes by which most aspects of social (appropriate) behavior are conveyed. 
(figure 17.7) The social controls that regulate substance use can be rooted in mainstream 
culture, as is for example the case with alcohol. The rituals and rules that sanction controlled 
alcohol use are mainly determined by general family centered (inter-generational) socialization 
processes, which offer socially acceptable models of alcohol use and reinforce moderate use. 
In the case of illicit drugs the efficiency of these primary socialization processes is severely 
damaged. As a result, rituals and rules surrounding illegal drug use largely depend on 
subcultural or peer group socialization, characterized by a larger emphasis and dependence on 
idiosyncratic and rigid rituals and only limited applicable rules. These rules and rituals will 
primarily reinforce those behaviors which constitute the raison d'être of the subculture. 
<p>
Prohibition likewise impairs the life structure of drug users. (figure 17.8) The user must 
participate in criminalized drug-driven networks to secure a steady supply of drugs. In these 
social networks he will relate with uncontrolled drug users. An increasing part of the activities 
will be centered around the acquisition of drugs. Meanwhile, secret drug users must manage to 
live double lives, as prohibition fuels stigmatization and ostracism when users are recognized 
as such. (26) Once labeled a junkie (all drug users are junkies), other undesirable traits are 
automatically attributed --criminal, unreliable, dishonest, pitiful, violent, etc.-- and this 
prevents and overrules the identification of more positively valued labels. (27) 
<p>
Figure 17.8
<p>
This results in the reduction of connections with non drug users, as both parties experience 
stress in interacting. It also obstructs contacts between controlled users, as they all fear 
disclosure. (26) Public knowledge of drug use may even lead to disproportional sanctions --
loosing a job or expulsion from school, denial of general (mental) health care and relegation to 
specialized care systems which are often combined with intense social control, eviction from 
ones housing, confiscation of possessions, imprisonment, etc.. The stigmatized junkie identity 
impedes participation in conventional roles and groups and progressively changes the lay out 
of day-to-day activities and the nature of relations. 
<p>
It can thus be concluded that prohibition interferes with the natural processes underlying self-
regulation. It generates and reinforces the stereotypical negative image (junkie, criminal, 
violent) and related behaviors, which are generally related to drug use per se. (figure 17.9)

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
It is evident that the use of intoxicants, even of those often referred to as hard drugs, does not 
inevitably lead to uncontrolled or harmful patterns of use. Just as with many other intensely 
pleasurable experiences, the use of intoxicants may become the predominating activity. Drug 
use is, however, rarely an isolated activity. Intertwined with many other aspects of life, it is 
normally a social activity. Drug use patterns --which drugs people use and how they use them-
- are subject to a multitude of social determinants, such as availability, trends and cultural 
patterning. Therefore drug use cannot be isolated from its social context. As Zinberg argued, 
control over the use of drugs is mainly determined by social variables. The presented feedback 
model of drug use self-regulation provides an interesting framework for the future study of the 
interactions between drug use behaviors and the factors that determine its social context.

<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
Traditionally, interest in the factual description of the behaviors involved in drug taking and 
the concrete social context in which these behaviors take place have been minimal. The advent 
of the HIV epidemic among injecting drug users (IDUs) painfully bore the consequences of 
this negligence. The present research, while not instigated by concerns for the spread of HIV, 
is certainly relevant to this issue. The study was directed at the indepth ethnographic 
description of the drug taking behaviors of regular users of heroin and cocaine. It aimed to 
reveal the functions and meanings of these specific behaviors for the individuals and groups 
involved in their regular use. Furthermore, the research examined the possible (public) health 
implications of the behaviors under study and this is where the connection with the HIV issue 
is made. In addition the research should shed some light on factors that determine (aspects of) 
these behaviors. In particular (social) factors that can be subjected to (policy) interventions 
were of interest. Thus, the project started with fairly general research questions, which have 
been specified along the analytical process (1) to those presented in chapter 3.2. 
<p>
A fundamental assumption of this research has been that, while the studied behavioral 
sequences have a functional basis, their functions and meanings extend beyond this pure 
instrumental functionality. The observed behaviors were thus expected to serve specific 
instrumental functions in the process of procuring drugs and introducing these into the body, 
as well as symbolic and social functions and meanings, both for the individual performers and 
their social networks. These complementary perspectives have been operationalized using the 
concept of ritualization. Chapter two provided an overview of the literature concerning ritual, 
its application in studies of drug use behaviors and of the factors that can be regarded as 
conditions of ritualization. This overview suggested a combination of economic (scarcity) and 
socio-cultural (subculture) factors as a main determinant of ritualization around drug taking. It 
furthermore suggested that these same factors are also of central importance to the issue of 
self-regulation, i.e. whether drug use is controlled or uncontrolled. 
<p>
Thus, the present study took a microscopic look at the daily drug taking rituals of regular 
users of heroin and cocaine and described the functions and meanings of these drug 
administration rituals in terms of pragmatic utility and social effects, e.g. group coherence. As 
the study went along, the importance of the concept of availability became increasingly clear. 
The preponderant influence availability plays in the daily lives of the study participants is 
perhaps the most conspicuous and consistent finding of the study. Actually, this is neither 
surprising, nor new. A serious contention is that the reduced availability of drugs resulting 
from prohibition constitutes the essence of the drug problem society currently faces. (2 3 4 5) 
<p>
Whereas ritual is the basic element of culture, this final chapter will address the impact of 
reduced availability on the level of the compound --the drug using culture itself. It will attempt 
to reveal some of the general processes involved and for that reason this discussion will not be 
limited to heroin, but also consider the cultural developments around two other drugs --
cannabis and MDMA. The current state of affairs of Dutch policy will be assessed for its 
impact on the developments around these different drugs. The ultimate aim of this chapter is 
to explore new directions for drug policy and practice, building on the successes of the Dutch 
normalization policy.

<b>Drug Availability, Ritualization and Culture</b>
<p>
<I>Drug Availability: A Decisive Factor</I>
<p>
Availability is at the root of individual choices for either chasing or injecting. Many of the 
observed transitions between administration rituals (see chapter six) were related to availability 
problems. Availability has also been a main determinant of the subcultural transition from 
injection to chasing as the dominant administration ritual for both heroin and cocaine. The 
combination of a stable and relatively high heroin quality on the Dutch illegal drug market and 
the easy availability of methadone provided an essential condition for the chasing ritual to 
thrive. (6) Availability can also play a role in cocaine related problems, such as loss of control 
and the initiation of injecting (chapters five and six). Cocaine's intense, but short lasting 
euphoric effect and the subsequent crash often result in high frequency administration 
schedules of sometimes every twenty (or less) minutes. Thus, while it may be just as easy to 
purchase as heroin and sold for approximately the same price per unit, the subjective or 
perceived availability of cocaine is for most of the observed users much lower than that of 
heroin. 
<p>
As a result of the generally unrestricted availability of syringes and needles, standardized 
needle sharing patterns have not developed in the Netherlands, preventing the addition of 
special meaning to such acts (chapter thirteen). As a result, most IDUs perceive needle sharing 
as an inexpedient, or even deviant act. This does not mean that needles are never shared. But 
in the few observed cases of needle sharing a strong link with situational (un)availability of 
needles could be established (chapter twelve). In contrast, standardized drug sharing patterns 
did develop, as a result of a structural low availability of the drugs preferred by the research 
participants. Drug sharing was found to be highly ritualized and surrounded by elaborate 
subcultural rules (chapter nine). Sharing drugs is of course not limited to the participants in the 
present study, but rather a common feature of many formal and informal gatherings within 
various social groups. Both from a historical and a geographical perspective there are probably 
few societies where drugs do not play, or have not played, a role in social ritual. (7) Illegal or 
not, sharing drugs brings people together and strengthens their mutual ties. Therefore, it was 
argued that drugs have intrinsic or primary ritual value. But, whereas drug use and social ritual 
have a strong and historical relationship, the significance attached to the drug sharing ritual by 
those involved --the intensity of ritualization-- varies with the availability of the drug. While 
there is little principal difference between offering a guest a cup of coffee, a cigarette, a beer, a 
cannabis joint or a taste of heroin --all are directed at smoothening interactions (8 9)-- the social 
meaning of the latter is of a much larger magnitude. 
<p>
Clearly, drug availability plays a crucial role in the construction of this social meaning. 
Submitting drugs and their users to economic and social repression, with the inevitable result 
of a reduced drug availability beyond the users' control, can be seen to have a series of definite 
consequences: 
<p>
<ol>
<li>It increases the economic value of the drugs. Increased economic value not only works as 
a strong stimulus for the formation of an illicit market intertwined with a subculture of users, 
but also translates into economic pressure towards more efficient administration rituals. 
<li>It increases the ritual value of the drugs, which turns the ritual object and its utilization 
into an attractive and effective symbolic object of subcultural identification. 
<li>Reduction of drug availability furthermore induces uncertainty about the probability of 
obtaining the ritual object, and thus about whether the ritual event may take place. This 
promotes opportunistic (unsafe) use patterns. Because the reduction of uncertainty and 
anxiety is a main function of ritual this uncertainty further increases the significance of the 
ritual performance. (10) 
</ol>
<p>
The overall result of these developments is a narrowing of focus and interest, as well as a 
severe reduction of behavioral expressions of the users. They will direct the major part of their 
activities towards realizing the performance of the drug use ritual. They will fixate on and 
cling to its undisturbed performance and the ritual will be narrowed down to its core functions 
--getting high and safeguarding this activity. This process not only has an impact on the 
individual users, but also determines the norms and orientation of the subculture. 
<p>
<I>Availability and Cultural Orientation: Survival or Progress</I>
<p>
In his analysis of peasant life, John Berger provided an interesting framework which reflects 
the dynamic relationship of ritualization and availability and its impact on culture. Peasant life 
shares some remarkable similarities with that of the drug users reported on in this dissertation. 
The peasant is committed completely to survival and "whatever the differences of climate, 
religion and social history, the peasantry everywhere can be defined as a class of survivors". (11) 
The peasantry is a self-supporting economy within an economy which makes it, to some 
degree, a class apart on the frontier of the formal or mainstream economic-cultural system. 
"They maintained or developed their own unwritten laws and codes of behavior, their own 
rituals and beliefs, their own orally transmitted body of wisdom and knowledge, their own 
medicine, their own techniques and sometimes their own language." (11) Peasants and drug users 
share a decisive economic consciousness which determines their actions and can result in a 
highly opportunistic attitude. But in order to survive, they must resort to "mutual fraternal aid 
in struggling against ... scarcity and a just sharing of what the work produces". "When 
peasants [and drug users] cooperate to fight an outside force, and the impulse to do this is 
always defensive, they adopt a guerrilla strategy --which is precisely a network of narrow 
paths across an indeterminate hostile environment." (11) As with the drug subculture, the 
peasantry's relation to the dominant culture, can therefore be characterized as heretical and 
subversive. These analogies are even reflected in their similar reputations. The drug users' 
equivalent of the peasants' "universal reputation for cunning", (11) is portrayed in terms such as 
"extremely egoistic cannibals" who "lie, steal and manipulate their fellow human beings" due 
to a "junkie syndrome". (12 13) 
<p>
Figure 18.1
<p>
The essence of peasant life, Berger explains, is dealing with scarcity (hunger) and insecurity, 
without prospect of improvement, by following a narrow path of tradition. "A class of 
survivors cannot afford to believe in an arrival point of assured well-being. The only, but 
great, future hope is survival." (11) Peasant culture can therefore be described as a culture of 
survival. "A culture of survival envisages the future as a sequence of repeated acts for survival. 
Each act pushes a thread through the eye of a needle and the thread is tradition". (11) In other 
words, in dealing with reality and the future, one relies on the repetitive and routine 
performance of a specific class of practices. Exactly those practices that have demonstrated, 
time after time, to (temporarily) alleviate scarcity, and bring about survival of both the 
individual and its culture (see figure 18.1). Beyond survival only uncertainty exists, as this falls 
outside of ones control. Berger contrasts the culture of survival with, what he calls a culture of 
progress. "Cultures of progress envisage future expansion. They are forward looking because 
the future offers ever larger hopes. ... The future is envisaged as the opposite of what classical 
perspective does to a road. Instead of appearing to become ever narrower as it recedes into 
the distance, it becomes ever wider" (see figure 18.2). (11) The resulting spectrum of feasible and 
opportune behaviors becomes more diverse, while their ritual value decreases. 
<p>
Figure 18.2
<p>
<I>A cultural continuum</I>
<p>
While Berger presents the two cultures as a dichotomy, mirror opposites of one another, the 
accuracy of this representation is questionable. Culture is probably more veraciously 
envisioned as a continuity, a flow from past to future, in which the labels survival and progress 
represent reversed positions which depend on availability (see figure 18.3). 
<p>
Figure 18.3
<p>
In periods of scarcity the culture goes back to the basics and refrains from activities which 
surpass the biological goal of survival, whereas in periods of plenty activities diversify and the 
goal of survival becomes more remote. Inevitably, this has important consequences for the 
daily activities and commitments and thus for the life structure of those involved. With regards 
to pattern and function of rituals (and rules) one can observe in periods of scarcity a declining 
number of participants in the ritual with closer connections, and an increasing meaning 
attached to the ritual object and the (undisturbed) performance of the ritual. In contrast, in 
periods of plenty the number of participants (with less intimate connections) increases, while 
the meaning attached to the ritual object and to participation in the ritual decreases. Ultimately 
the ritual object becomes de-ritualized and stops being the instrumental imperative (14) of the 
culture, which itself has progressed into a stage of dissolving into a larger culture.
<p>
<I>An illustration: The Dutch Cannabis Culture</I>
<p>
An interesting illustration of this process is found in the recent history of cannabis use in The 
Netherlands. While cannabis use was not unknown before, during the 1960s the drug became 
more widely available in the upcoming middle class hippie subculture. (15) This counter-cultural 
movement was experienced as a serious threat, not only because of its illegal drug use, but 
also because it questioned the establishment. In response use of cannabis (and other drugs) 
was problematized and repressed. As a result, smoking cannabis became a symbolic act of 
resistance, invested with symbolic meaning, uniting adolescents and young adults, who shared 
the hippie philosophy of life. The fact that use and consumption dealing of cannabis became a 
focus of law enforcement only reinforced this process. Elaborate smoking rituals could be 
observed (dimly lit rooms, specific music, candles, incense, sitting in a circle passing the water 
pipe, chillum, or joint, etc.). The drug was surrounded by a detailed argot, which leaned 
heavily on imported American slang. 
<p>
The contra-productive effects of repressing cannabis use were quickly recognized in the early 
1970s and a more tolerant policy developed. With the revision of the Dutch Opium-act in 
1976, possession of cannabis for personal use (30 grams or less) has been decriminalized in the 
Netherlands. Since then the availability has increased considerably as an open coffee shop 
based market developed. Nowadays, use of cannabis is no longer associated with a deviant 
subculture, while the hippie subculture was absorbed into mainstream society during the 
1970s. Ritualization has decreased significantly and rapidly. Smoking cannabis is almost 
completely normalized in the Netherlands and users can be found in most social strata. (16) One 
can smoke a joint in most public environments without risking police harassment. Cannabis 
has become readily available and is sold in semi-legal, so-called, coffee shops --to the Dutch 
more and more a normal offshoot of the retail branch, for many foreigners still a strange 
novelty and a tourist attraction. (17 18) The Dutch generally mix cannabis with tobacco, while 
more potent ways of administration (water pipes, chillums, hot knifing) have become obsolete. 
Using a roach clip to hold the butt as it burns down, and saving and rerolling the butts --a 
typical American ritual-- is unknown among Dutch cannabis users and considered an oddity:
<p>
<blockquote>"An American friend who visited me recently, offered me this little plastic bag as 
if it was an important present." He shows a little zip-lock bag, containing four to five grimy 
reefer butts. "He said he did not dare to take them on the plane home. It seemed he had a hard 
time forsaking them. I kept the bag as a funny, but dirty, memento." </blockquote>
<p>
The marihuana leaf, which, featuring on clothing and jewelry, used to be an explicit style 
symbol of cannabis users in The Netherlands, has not disappeared, but it has diffused to many 
non-users, thereby loosing its ritual binding force. (19) This does not mean that all ritual behavior 
surrounding cannabis use has ceased to exist in Holland. It may well be observed among new, 
unexperienced users, most likely in the period during and shortly after initiation. After all, 
rituals have an important educational function. (20) Likewise, many experienced users perform 
and enjoy idiosyncratic rituals when making a handsome and perfectly smoking joint. But the 
functions of these stereotypical behaviors have changed. Little symbolic elaboration remained, 
while social goals have faded. The remaining solitary rituals are principally practical. They 
focus at the task at hand and prepare the user for getting high. Once of great importance, 
many symbolic behaviors have lost their function --they have become "empty rituals". 
Nowadays, the social symbolic meaning of sharing a joint largely parallels that of sharing a 
tobacco cigarette.
<p>
<I>Back to the Heroin Culture</I>
<p>
The cannabis example provides an indication of the different ritual patterns determined by 
varying levels of availability associated with social and economic pressure. While similar 
variations in the intensity of ritualization in the heroin culture are often not so clear cut, a 
comparison between Rotterdam and the Bronx (chapter sixteen) established several 
differences in ritual patterns, especially around use and consumer level transactions, which 
underline the significance of availability. Within the Dutch heroin culture itself such variations 
can also be observed. Although the overall frequency of drug sharing in the two groups 
differed little, the drug taking and sharing rituals of many (older) IDUs seemed considerably 
more formalized than those of chasers. Sharing among chasers generally took a casual and 
opportunistic form, while IDUs' drug sharing seemed confined to smaller circles, epitomizing 
stronger social bonding. The subcultural transition to the softer and less harmful chasing ritual 
is perhaps the strongest indicator of the power of availability. (6) The sequential and gradual 
character of chasing results in a rather stable intoxication, which limits the contrast between 
being sick and high (nodding), characteristic of injecting. A contrast, which perhaps is 
important in explaining loss of control. (21) The absence of this compulsive contrast, in turn, 
limits the importance of, and fixation on, the event. Other behaviors become more feasible and 
the overall behavior pattern is less directed at survival. 
<p>
<I>The Dutch Heroin Culture: A Culture in Transition</I>
<p>
Thus, in terms of the above suggested cultural continuum, the Dutch heroin culture can be 
envisaged as being in transition --from a culture of survival (of which it still has many aspects) 
to a culture of progress, in which the heroin ritual is loosing much of its symbolic power. In a 
true culture of progress the drug may still be used, but instead of becoming the paramount 
determinant of behavior it will be part of a diversified pattern of behavioral expressions. In 
such a pattern heroin use is challenged and balanced by other determinants of behavior, 
fostering self-regulation processes that support controlled use. Little research has been 
conducted into this cultural transition hypothesis. However, one English study suggested 
lower dependency levels associated with chasing. (21) Likewise, the higher degree of self-
regulation among (Surinamese) heroin/cocaine dealers reported in the previous chapter and 
the subcultural transition from injecting to chasing in the Netherlands (6) are also in line with this 
hypothesis. Furthermore, anecdotal observations of the relative ease with which later 
generations of heroin users seem to (permanently) kick heroin, (22) and the recent anecdotal 
reports from Amsterdam on controlled heroin smoking among young Moroccans (23) also point 
in the hypothesized direction.

<b>New Drugs, New Rituals, New Cultures: the Example of XTC</b>
<p>
<I>The Cultural Setting</I>
<p>
The recent emergence of MDMA (XTC or Ecstasy) provides an interesting example for 
comparison, as it is not yet contaminated by the influence of years of drug policy. While in the 
Netherlands the drug was not completely unknown before, in 1987 MDMA use emerged on a 
larger scale. Although also used in other (private or (semi-)therapeutic) settings, the use of 
MDMA has mainly been associated with the youth culture that has formed around house 
music, or shortly House. This new style of dance music originally emerged about 10 years ago 
in the Chicago gay scene and has developed into a highly successful international music scene. 
Just as Rock and Roll and Punk, House rebelled against the established (popular) musical 
culture and induced international cultural change far beyond the music. Its influence is 
noticeable in fashion, art, architecture and the socio-political attitudes of large groups of 
adolescents. In the beginning of 1987 House became popular within the incrowd of Dutch 
clubbers, and rapidly became popular in larger groups of young people. As the introduction to 
a recent Compact Disc release explained, "House is made for the dance floor, with sizzling 
rhythms, pumping basslines and little or no melody. ... People are going wild to extreme dance 
music, dressing extravagantly and having a wicked time." (24) "House Parties" or "Raves" are all 
night dance events that emphasize a total dance environment using state-of-the-art disco high 
technology (light-shows, stroboscopes and smoke machines). (25) 
<p>
Whether on MDMA (or other drugs) or not, attendants may experience a "good" party as a 
revitalizing ritual. The Dutch musicologist and House musician Gert van Veen described 
House as follows: 
<p>
<blockquote>"It is a musical experience that goes back to primeval age. Music as magic, as a 
means to reach a higher state of consciousness. The dance marathons are a ritual, in which the 
disc jockey acts as a wizard. Records are the ingredients of his hallucinating potion, with 
which he leads his audience to a liberating catharsis." (26)</blockquote>
<p>
At some parties visited in 1989 turn table wizards carefully controlled the atmosphere at the 
dance floor and they were able to incite communal maslownian peak experiences in which the 
whole dancing crowd turned wild --squealing, blowing whistles and laughing. (27) Upon his first 
introduction to a dancing and sweating crowd at a House Party, Bilu, a civil engineer from 
Kenia said "Man, this is tribal!". (28) And indeed, a house party does resemble a tribal 
celebration. Furthermore, the house tribe carries its own specific style symbols, e.g. clothing 
and jewelry, which are remarkably similar to those of the 1960s hippies. The tribe has also 
developed its own argot. (29 30) 
<p>
<I>The Drug and its Users</I>
<p>
The use of MDMA spread simultaneously with House. A development which may well be 
stimulated by the extensive media hype, connecting the two. (31) MDMA has reached both new 
users with minimal or no drug experience and users with a varied experience with other illegal 
drugs. Both groups mix in the modern entertainment circuits. (25 31 32) In 1992 it was estimated 
that in Amsterdam approximately 10.000 people have ever tried the drug. (31 32 33) MDMA is 
now sold in various, at consumer level separated, markets (night clubs, discotheques, 
friendship groups pooling money) but is also part of the (tourist) street poly drug markets of 
Rotterdam and Amsterdam. Generally, the drug is orally ingested and its use has not yet been 
a reason for alarm. (25 31 32) Was the drug previously imported into the Netherlands --e.g. from 
the USA-- large busts in February 1992 and subsequent periodical publications indicate that 
the (illicit) Dutch amphetamine industry has broadened its market share and is producing large 
quantities of MDMA, which for a large part is intended for the seemingly ravenous British 
consumer market. (34 35) Recent anecdotal reports suggest that the incidence of MDMA use is 
still rising, while the drug has become accessible to new user groups. Drugs such as "magic 
mushrooms", LSD and amphetamine may also have gained in popularity, but it is too early to 
speak of a definitive trend. (36 37 38) 
<p>
Interestingly, while drugs play some role of importance, House is not a closed drug centered 
subculture in the Netherlands. Although there is a cultural core of House Freaks, almost all 
social groups are represented at parties. (25 31 32) The key identity indicator of the cultural core is 
not the drug, but the music and perhaps the fashion. The common denominator seems to be 
the lust for endured trance dancing. Heterogeneity is also typical for the Dutch XTC users. 
Most users are in their twenties and thirties, have urban lifestyles, comparably high education 
levels and seem well tied in non drug dominated networks, activities and interests, such as 
work or study. (31 32)
<p>
<I>XTC and Self-Regulation</I>
<p>
Observations of XTC use of the last three and a half years indicate that the controlling 
strategies applied by XTC users initially leaned heavily on rather strict and idiosyncratic group 
rituals. But surprisingly rapidly these rituals seem to have been replaced by more generally 
applicable rules. (39) Adelaars suggested that users with prior illicit drug experience apply this 
experience to regulate smoothly their XTC use, whereas virgin users apparently find more 
difficulties in doing so. (31) Apparently, these experienced users adapt established and 
internalized rules to a changed (drug) situation, which seemingly gives them an advantage over 
users, whose MDMA use is the first experience with illicit drug use. Harding and Zinberg 
described similar processes among cannabis users in the USA, who adopted alcohol rules to 
their marihuana use. (40) Drug information programs are regularly approached by (potential) 
users in search of information about XTC. In response, the Amsterdam Jellinek Center and the 
National Institute on Alcohol and Drugs (NIAD) have both produced folders with objective 
and balanced information about the drug, including rather specific instructions for safe use. 
From a harm reduction perspective, this is a most sensible approach. 
<p>
Considered in terms of the feedback model it can be assessed that the level of repression of 
XTC consumers and consumption level transactions has until now been rather low, resulting in 
a comparably high availability. XTC can be purchased at a reasonable price without much 
difficulties, or intensive involvement in criminal subcultures. This allowed for the development 
of rituals and rules aimed at safe and controlled use instead of concealing and safeguarding the 
use of the drug itself, for example through the formation of a closed subculture. Moreover, 
information on XTC and instructions for safe use are available not only via peer 
communication channels but also from established institutions. The drug has even been a 
regular topic in the pages of Achterwerk, a national radio and television weekly's readers' mail 
feature for children and youth. In this, alongside letters about e.g. familial conflicts, friendship, 
sexuality and pets, experiences with and opinions of the drug, are openly discussed. This has 
greatly facilitated the formation, and widespread acceptance of rules for safe use. The degree 
of life structure of most current XTC users seems to be relatively high and largely determined 
by non drug related contacts and activities. XTC is mostly taken within the confined context 
of recreational activities --whether this is at a House Party or at home with friends-- and part 
of a differentiated pattern of activities. In comparison with the heroin culture, the Dutch XTC 
culture (if one can speak of one) is a culture of progress. While the drug is an ever interesting 
conversation topic (price, contents, effects), this is merely recreational dope talk and only one 
of the many subjects when users meet. The drug is not the instrumental imperative (14) of the 
house culture, but merely an adjunct in a rather hedonistic pursuit of pleasure and social 
identity. Given the conditions set by Dutch drug policy, this situation was not really 
unexpected. (40 41) 
<p>
At this point three Dutch drug cultures have past in review. The cannabis culture, which 
basically has seized to exist. (42) The heroin culture, which is becoming less oriented at survival 
and differs explicitly from its foreign counterparts on some important parameters. While there 
is little research available for thorough comparison, (41) it seems that the Dutch XTC culture is 
significantly more integrated in mainstream society than, for example in the United Kingdom. 
In Britain ravers are driven into an underground subculture, while the prevalence of XTC use 
has increased much faster than in Holland. British XTC users seem to have much higher use 
frequencies and taking several tablets a night is not exceptional. (43 44) Sensationalistic media 
accounts suggest a high rate of problems, (35) while at least seven deaths have been associated 
with XTC use. (43) Apparently, the UK does not provide a climate in which rituals and rules for 
safe and controlled use can nurture. Although several British drug information centers aim to 
stimulate this process with sensible, well designed education campaigns, based on harm 
reduction principles (44), the following explanation of a British clubber in Amsterdam indicates 
that such efforts have to compete with repressive law enforcement, a tradition of poorly 
managed alcohol control and an, almost unanimously, sensationalist media discourse: (35) 
<p>
<blockquote>"In London, it's like in the pubs shortly before eleven. Everybody tanks up 
before it is too late. With E it's just the same thing, lad. You better pop'em now, while you're 
having a good time. You may not get another chance. Tomorrow this thing may be all over, 
but who cares about tomorrow. Hear me? That's what I like about coming to Holland. Here 
people can have fun without the coppers chasing you, there is time to chill out. Take a break, 
you know. Here, ... people care about tomorrow."</blockquote>

<a name="arb"></a>
<b>Prohibition: An Arbitrary Phenomenon</b>
<p>
These different cultural climates are the result of a dynamic societal interplay of forces, such as 
economic interests, (geo-)political priorities, social definition, (collective) social learning, 
(historical) development of social regulatory processes, scientific knowledge, which can all 
differ per country. The outcome of this proces is, of course, subject to change and may be 
taken as an expression of the human ambivalence towards the use of psychoactive substances. 
In spite of international (UN) treaties, there is no global agreement on which drugs are, or are 
not, acceptable. Nor has there been one at any given time. Furthermore, societies may change 
their opinions on certain drugs over time, and have, in fact, done so often. (45) From a historical 
perspective, drug prohibition is a relatively recent, but also arbitrary phenomenon. On the 
other hand, tobacco, coffee and alcohol have all known periods of prohibition or, at least 
strong moral disapproval. Louis XIV banned tobacco sales and pope Urban VIII 
excommunicated its users. (46) In some countries draconian punishments were introduced, e.g. 
the slitting of nostrils in Russia and the death penalty in Turkey. (7) In 17th century England, 
coffee was considered a dangerous drug and outlawed. (46) For many people the word 
prohibition is synonymous with the US' ban on alcohol at the beginning of this century. The 
following quote from Robert Hughes' The Fatal Shore, depicting life on a hulk (a 19th century 
English prison ship), not only provides a historical illustration of the variable process 
outcomes, but also presents a fine metaphor of the human ambivalence regarding drug use. 
<p>
<blockquote>"I cannot help it, sir," he would say to the Captain. "Then I will cut the flesh off 
your back," the Captain would reply, and indeed the Boatswain used to do his utmost, for 
stepping back a couple of Paces he would bound forward with his arm uplifted, take a jump 
and come down with the whole weight of his Body upon the unfortunate victim, at every Blow 
making a noise similar to a paviour when paving the streets.  At length the poor fellow (as I 
often heard him say) became weary of his life. He found that his blameless conduct in every 
other respect could not save him from the consequences of this trifling breech of discipline ... 
and from being one of the best he became the worst character in the Yard. When I left it, he 
was in the Black Hole for having bitten off the first joint of the finger of Mr. Gosling the 
Quartermaster, who had put it in his mouth to see if he could detect any Tobacco. 
(47)</blockquote>
<p>
The quote shows the great value people attach to the use of intoxicants and the trouble they 
are willing to undergo to maintain established use patterns when availability is restricted and 
use repressed. As Hughes wrote,
<p>
<blockquote>[t]he great emblem of desire and repression in hulk life, more than sex or food 
or (in some cases) freedom itself, was tobacco. Possession of tobacco was severely punished, 
but the nicotine addict would go through any degradation to get his "quid." Silverthorpe noted 
how this cycle of addiction and flogging broke prisoners down: "They grow indifferent ... they 
go on from bad to worse until they have shaken off all moral restraint." (47) </blockquote>
<p>
Under such repressive conditions, the use of a desired substance gains a symbolic merit for the 
users, while to the non-users it becomes a metaphor of debauched evil. Then drugs truly 
become "herbs of heaven and hell". (46 48)
<p>
None of the bans on the currently legal drugs were successful in convincing users to abstain 
and all were overturned, but not before black markets were created and flourishing. Nowadays 
these intoxicants are legal and their use is regulated within a lawful context. Nevertheless, 
their use is not without risk. (5 49) Coffee, as well as alcohol and tobacco, however, have 
become indigenous to (Dutch) culture and fulfill a multitude of positive social functions. The 
large majority of users consume coffee and alcohol in a controlled fashion. Perhaps because 
tobacco was until recently promoted as a safe drug, many users are addicted. Still, the use of 
this drug does not lead to the profound social misery, which is automatically associated with, 
for example, heroin. Apparently, users have learned to balance the positive and negative 
effects of these drugs. Aware of the detrimental nature of excess, use patterns have largely 
voluntarily been subjected to implicit and explicit social controls --rituals and rules, which 
display and define appropriate human behavior and are part of normal human socialization 
processes. 
<p>
Regulating these drugs within a lawful context acknowledges that they fulfill essential 
biological and social functions for the human species. Of course, these functions are not 
restricted to the use of currently legal substances, but merely an expression of an ubiquitous 
pattern. As the American psychofarmacologist Ronald Siegel expressed it concisely, "[w]e 
need intoxicants, because the need is as much part of the human condition as sex, hunger, and 
thirst. The need --the fourth drive-- is natural, yes, even healthy. To say No is to deny all that 
we are and all that we could be." (7) Therefore, society needs to accept that drug use in itself is 
not a detrimental behavior or an expression of deviance, but a structural and normal 
phenomenon with a permanent character. The choice of drugs available, however, has 
increased significantly over the last 25 years. Through the internationalization of culture --
whether in person (through faster and cheaper travel possibilities) or through the increasingly 
faster mass communication media-- around the world, people have become aware of prior 
unknown options. (50) Drugs are not exempted from this ubiquitous trend towards a global 
culture. Interpreting Entzinger's recent remarks on the phenomenon of immigration, one can 
argue that "[o]nce [drug use] is accepted as a given, it is of great importance to work towards 
a positive outcome --for the [consumer], as well as for the receiving society." (50) Drugs are 
here, and they are here to stay. Society must thus learn to live with their use, minimize the 
harm of use and turn it to its benefit as much as possible. 
<p>
The following sections will investigate how the Dutch have tried to apply (certain aspects of) 
this line of thinking in dealing with the use of illicit drugs. After a brief sketch of its 
assumptions some results and the current state of affairs will be discussed. Subsequently, 
recommendations for future policy will be presented.

<b>Dutch Drug Policy in Perspective</b>
<p>
<I>"Society will need to learn to cope" </I>
<p>
Drug problems first developed in the Netherlands in the second half of the 1960s. Before, use 
of illegal drugs was not completely unknown, but was limited to specific sub-populations and 
not considered a real problem. (51) Already in the early 1970s it was recognized that a single 
repressive approach to drug use would create more problems, than it solves. (52) This 
recognition resulted in the development of the normalization policy --a drug policy rather 
distinct from those in most other countries. This policy --a mixture of pragmatism, 
compromising, down-to-earthiness, strategic planning, but also of trial and error and maybe a 
little luck-- is, however, an example of the general principles of Dutch social policy making 
and mirrors policies on related social and moral matters, such as homosexuality or abortion. 
For that reason some observers have referred to the Netherlands as an "advanced and 
sophisticated society, a societal testing station, a laboratory for moral and social topics". (53)
<p>
The basic assumptions of the normalization policy were formulated in the beginning of the 
1980s. The policy is mainly directed at the problematic use of illegal drugs and the 
management of drug related problems. (54) Acceptance of the permanent character of the 
presence of drug use implicates that "society will ... need to learn to cope with the dangers 
they pose". (55) Therefore, the prevention of problematic drug use and drug related harm has 
been given priority over the prevention of drug use per se. In strong contrast with repression 
and social ostracism, the key features are "encirclement, adaptation and integration". 
"Although Dutch drug legislation is still a part of criminal law, it is generally considered as an 
instrument of social control, the results of which should be assessed with each case, and it 
should not be considered as a mouthpiece for passing moral judgment." (54) The penal approach 
is made subordinate to the public health goals. An important goal of the policy is to de-
mythologize drug use and the junkie status. To take away the special meaning attached to 
drug use, users should not be treated as criminals or dependent patients, but as normal citizens 
who are capable of taking sensible decisions and respond to normal demands and 
opportunities. (54) 
<p>
<I>Some Results</I>
<p>
The low level of policing of individual use and consumer transactions of illicit drugs --an 
important cornerstone of the normalization policy-- has resulted in a rather steady availability 
of a variety of illegal drugs, in particular in the large cities. Increased availability of drugs is 
often thought to affect consumption by increasing the prevalence of use. (56) It is therefore 
interesting to see if Dutch policy has resulted in increased use prevalence. Several recent 
household surveys documented the use prevalence of both licit and illicit drugs. The following 
table presents an overview of household surveys conducted in Amsterdam, (16) a suburban area (57) 
and a rural community. (58) 
<p>
The table shows that the use of illegal drugs in metropolitan areas is higher than in suburban 
and rural areas. This has been related to typical urban lifestyles --young one and two person 
households, who frequently make use of entertainment and cultural facilities, such as (movie-
)theaters, discos and clubs. (16) Controlled drug use is often an integrated feature of such 
outgoing lifestyles. In Amsterdam the same instrument was administered in 1987 and 1990. Of 
the differences found in Amsterdam between the two years, only the reductions in the use of 
tobacco and sleeping pills are statistically significant. All other differences are not. Thus, while 
drugs are comparably easy to procure in Amsterdam, these data indicate a stable use 
prevalence over time. This suggests that the normalization policy did not result in increased 
use of drugs. (16)
<p>
It is furthermore interesting to explore how users outside the typical heroin using population 
regulate their drug use. Of particular interest is, how these users handle the comparably 
powerful psycho-stimulants cocaine and MDMA. In 1990 the Rotterdam Consultation Bureau 
for Alcohol and Drugs (CAD) registered 1537 client contacts (alcohol: 747; drugs 790). In 66 
cases, this concerned people whose primary drug was cocaine and 42 of these were new 
contacts (heroin users are excluded). In 1989, 53 people (45 new contacts) presented 
themselves with a cocaine problem. In 45% of these cases cocaine was part of a multiple drug 
use pattern, mostly combined with alcohol or cannabis. (59) With a recently estimated 12.000 
cocaine users in Rotterdam, these numbers are hardly alarming. (60) 
<p>
Table 18.1
<p>
Systematic data on MDMA related treatment applications are not available. In Rotterdam and 
Amsterdam people often request information about MDMA. In Rotterdam, the number of 
XTC related treatment applications is estimated at one a month or less. (61) XTC related 
treatment applications in Amsterdam were inventarized by Adelaars. Until autumn 1990 he 
found none. (31) This does not mean that the use of cocaine and XTC is completely without 
problems. For example, most subjects in a recent cocaine study by Cohen reported experience 
with craving and other negative effects of cocaine. (62) A recent XTC study by Korf et al. 
reported similar findings --many of their subjects have experienced a range of unpleasant 
effects during or after MDMA use. (32) In both Cohen's cocaine study and the XTC studies by 
Adelaars and Korf et al. these unpleasant effects were generally related to periods of high use 
levels. (31 32 62) A consistent finding in all three studies is that when people experience problems 
with the use of cocaine or XTC, they decrease or (periodically) discontinue their use. As 
Cohen writes: "Many indications were found that experienced cocaine users controlled their 
use ..., there are no indications that [this] group lost control and developed into compulsive 
high level users with a marginalized life style in order to support drug consumption." (62) All 
three studies described elaborate self-regulation strategies. Thus, while experience with the 
negative effects of these drugs is not uncommon, only few users apply for treatment and use 
patterns are subjected to social controls. 
<p>
The normalization policy has been exceptionally successful in the case of cannabis. In practice 
both possession and consumer level transactions have been de-facto decriminalized. As was 
discussed above, the subculture that initially surrounded the use of this drug has completely 
dissolved, while the table shows that the prevalence of use has stabilized at a moderate level. (63) 
It can be concluded, that the normalization policy, which characterized the 1980s, has been a 
major factor in the stabilization and control of the drug problem in the Netherlands. It must be 
emphasized that in particular the restrained and astute approach of the Dutch police has been 
of crucial significance. 
<p>
<I>Some Unresolved Matters</I>
<p>
Not surprisingly, the normalization policy has not been a 100% successful. While the Dutch 
heroin culture is rather stable and easy-going, with comparably little accretion of novice 
users, (57 58 64 65 66 67) policy has, for example, not prevented the formation of a shunted off 
residual group of marginalized and demoralized users, whose needs are poorly served. Over 
time, problematic drug users have changed from rebellious white middle class youth to 
immigrants, illegals, psychiatric patients and long term prospectless skid row users. The drug 
treatment and care system has become a repository in which various groups with many 
different problems are dumped. (68) Whatever the background and make up of their problem, 
merely based on one aspect --uncontrolled drug use-- individuals are relegated into a system 
that at best offers treatment or maintenance of the symptom which has been marked the 
defining feature. 
<p>
Methadone, which in itself plays a very important and beneficial role in the Dutch approach, is 
generally dispensed in large scale programs, in which management, automation and 
registration goals are equal to, if not higher than provision of practical health care and social 
services. Many heroin users in the field study experienced the treatment in these programs as 
infantilizing and intrusive of their private lives. Often social control objectives dominate staff-
client interactions and clients are treated as patients, whose motives are routinely distrusted. 
Many individuals have been subjected to this treatment system for ten years or more. One 
could say that they have become dehumanized commodities of professional treatment 
networks --the legal branch of the "heroin structure". (69) Beninger referred to this practice as 
the "trafficking in drug users" (70) --another example of post-modern institutionalization. (71) 
<p>
In a way, program staff are caught in the same system --tired of playing the intrinsic power 
games (e.g. around methadone doses), they experience their work as burdening, repetitious, 
little challenging and unsatisfactory. Their job does not bring them much prestige. A recent 
survey among the staff of the Amsterdam Jellinek Center showed that 40% is looking for 
other jobs because of the massive workload (72) and burn-out is a frequent phenomenon. 
Working in the same position for many years, a considerable number of drug workers are 
under-educated and have a low market value on the job market. (68) Instead of quitting their 
jobs, they make their hours, but adjust their efforts downward. Their perception of their client 
group is often very negative and frustration is projected on clients leading to rigid and 
sometimes haphazard enforcement of disempowering program rules. This contributes to 
tension between staff and clients, not infrequently culminating in violent outbursts. This in turn 
leads to increasing use of sanctions and security measures such as plexiglass between clients 
and staff, while private security personnel maneuver clients through turnstiles. 
<p>
An unintended negative side effect of methadone programs --and perhaps of specialized drug 
treatment in general-- is that they, to a certain extent, endorse the subculture and block 
societal integration. (73) In contrast with policy formulations, (54) known heroin users are not 
treated as normal citizens and they may well be the most stigmatized group in society --
denoted as Junks by the public and media, as well as by policy makers and the treatment and 
care agencies. A Rotterdam drug prevention worker summarized the impact of Dutch drug 
treatment practice on the heroin using population cynically but concisely as "stabilize, 
consolidate and segregate". (74) Whereas the Dutch parliament by motion expressed that drug 
users should be involved in policy making, (75) currently they play no role of significance. 
Especially in the AIDS-era, these are very worrying developments. 
<p>
<I>Some New Matters</I>
<p>
Currently, HIV prevention for drug users is primarily relegated to the traditional drug 
treatment and care agencies. Often the social workers of these agencies have problems 
discussing safer use/sex. Their message rarely transcends the level of do not share needles or 
use a condom, and is hardly placed in a broader context of general health maintenance. While 
the Netherlands played a pioneer role in implementing needle exchange, these are mostly 
integrated in the methadone maintenance programs. Yearly, treatment agencies may contact 
60-70% of the population, on a day to day base they only reach less than 40%. Some schemes 
only serve their own methadone clients. Those most at risk, e.g. out-of-treatment frequent 
cocaine injectors, are poorly reached by these schemes. The needle exchanges furthermore 
only offer a limited choice of items --generally only one type of syringe/needle and one or two 
types of condoms, whereas demand and daily practice are profusely varied. Furthermore, there 
is little information on HIV seroprevalence outside of Amsterdam and possibilities of early and 
profilactic treatment are poorly utilized. 
<p>
Due to a combination of reasons an increasing number of users are pressured into the streets. 
As a result, nuisance problems (often of a visual nature) have increased, with a simultaneous 
growth in drug tourism. In other cities similar trends are observed. The completion of the 
urban renewal process in Rotterdam (resulting in a decreasing number of empty places for the 
house address scene) is one important reason. The decentralization of the Rotterdam police 
force is another. Decisions regarding public order and drug related nuisance --e.g. about 
whether or not raiding a house address-- are now made at precinct level and not weighed 
against the interest of the local drug policy. When a certain number of complaints are received, 
the precinct may form a local unit, which prepares and executes a raid. Some precincts are 
more active, whereas others seem to maintain the usual, more restrained approach. Already at 
the end of 1989 it became apparent in this study that the house address scene was the object of 
increasing police pressure and, in two publications, possible public health consequences were 
discussed (chapters 14, 15). A related and third reason is the increasing emphasis on social 
safety in the social renewal policy. In a 1991 Rotterdam survey 86% named public order as the 
biggest problem. In 1988 this was only 47% and in 1990 64%. Degeneration, decay and 
pollution of the urban environment ranked second, while foreigners rose on the Rotterdam 
problem inventory from 9% in 1990 to 17% in 1991. Among Turkish and Moroccan residents 
public order was experienced less of a problem. In 1991 their main worries were more tangible 
--unemployment and housing. (76) In operation taking back the street the precincts cooperate 
with autochtonic, in particular elderly, residents. As one neighborhood activist explained the 
strategy: "Complain as often to the police so that they bust the premises, if only because 
they're fed up with our calls". (76) Seemingly, the social renewal policy is primarily an outlet of 
fears and emphasizes repressive approaches. It is questionable whether a policy based on fear 
will prove successful in the long term. 
<p>
The traditional drug assistance organizations have not really responded to the changed space 
allocations of drug users, nor to the increased prevalence of cocaine use, which further 
augments the problems in this population. Alternative (volunteer) organizations, such as the 
Paulus Church in Rotterdam, try to fill the gaps, but, having only minimal resources, get 
overwhelmed. Recently, the increased nuisance incited a blaze in the Dutch discussion on drug 
policy, which displays a considerable backlash in thinking. Politicians throughout the political 
spectrum trumpet populistic solutions (such as compulsory treatment and increased police 
pressure on congregation sites of drug users). Others want to introduce medical heroin 
dispension to decrease the nuisance. Of course, doctors disagree, while most treatment and 
care services for drug users remain significantly silent. Seemingly, little has been learned in the 
twenty years since heroin was introduced in the Netherlands. 
<p>
Looking at the recent developments around XTC this seems all the more the case. Large XTC 
seizures followed by a wave of mostly negative and sensational media reports in the first half 
of 1992 prompted outcries to ban "illegal house parties where increasing numbers of under-
sixteens indulge in excessive use of alcohol and ... XTC." (77) Some parties were busted or 
banned, others were surveyed by undercover police. While some authors predicted a 
"pollution of the market" when XTC was scheduled in November 1988, (78) this was not 
immediately noticeable. The recent seizures have, however, resulted in scarcity on the market. 
Prices went up and especially XTC tablets offered at parties and other irregular channels (as 
opposed to friendship networks that pool money) vary highly in quality. 
<p>
This destabilized XTC quality demonstrates again that availability is the feedback model's 
factor, which is the most vulnerable for repressive drug policy. In addition to the unstable 
quality, variants of MDMA, such as the more potent MDA and weaker MDEA are being 
marketed as XTC, as well as other related drugs, such as amphetamine. At the time of its 
introduction (second trimester of 1992) MDEA was still legal. According to Jamin, Adelaars 
and Blanken, the introduction of MDEA demonstrates how the drug trade tries to by-pass the 
opium law. (79) Ketamine has recently also been sold as XTC in the Netherlands. (80) In England 
the drug seems to have gained some popularity after initial marketing as XTC. (81 82) Ketamine is 
a pharmaceutical drug used in anesthesiology with powerful hallucinogenic properties. 
"Compared to MDMA, Vitamin K is Tenth Gear. Where everyone who favoured ecstasy 
spoke of its mildness, the K people always led off by talking about its power." (83)
<p>
The turmoil on the XTC market thus introduced a considerable potential of secondary harm. 
Furthermore, according to some informants, reduced availability of XTC resulted in anxiety 
and drug-seeking behavior among users in some parts of the club circuit. De Loor observed 
that heavy users are becoming isolated from the moderate ones, who blame them for the 
negative media attention. (80) The feedback model predicts that such a repressive approach 
would induce the formation of a drug-driven, survival oriented subculture, users' alienation 
from mainstream cultural information sources, and obstruction of natural processes of self-
regulation. These observations may well be the first signs of such a development.
<p>
It can thus be concluded, that, once innovative, currently the normalization policy shows 
several signs of self-contempt and fatigue, especially at the practical level. It is questionable 
whether in its current form it is suitable to deal with the demands of the 1990s.

<b>Revitalization of Dutch Drug Policy</b>
<p>
<I>Transforming the Leading Policy Incentive: Towards a Controlled Availability of 
Drugs</I>
<p>
There is thus a clear need to adjust the policy. When the Netherlands wants to maintain its 
position on the innovative frontier of the international discussion on drug policy, it must 
pursue new ways and approaches to counter the above discussed problems. Goldstein and 
Kalant recently wrote that "the practical aim of drug policy should be to minimize the extent 
of use, and thus to minimize the harm." (56) Most attempts to reduce the extent of use have relied 
on prohibition based supply reduction strategies. Not only have these strategies failed to check 
the use of drugs in countries with a tradition of illicit drug use, but (injecting) drug use is 
increasingly spreading to new regions. This spread may even be the result of drug prohibition 
as this has provided the economic incentive for the illicit drug industry, and spreading patterns 
often follow the routes of illicit drug trafficking. (84) Likewise, prohibition of one drug may 
induce the emergence of other, more potent drugs and more efficient drug administration 
rituals. Within months after the establishment of anti opium laws in Hong Kong, Laos and 
Thailand heroin use appeared suddenly and injecting came up. (85) Equally important is that these 
conventional strategies have introduced a plethora of secondary harm (see chapter ten). While 
Goldstein and Kalant seemingly refer to primary harm --harm directly related to the use of a 
certain substance, e.g. deteriorated tissue integrity of the nasal septum, due to frequent 
intranasal cocaine use or fetal alcohol syndrome in babies born from alcoholic mothers--, this 
may well be exceeded by the magnitude of secondary harm (harm related to drug policy), in 
particular since the advent of the AIDS epidemic. Minimization of harm associated with drug 
use, therefore, should be the practical aim of drug policy. Reduction of the extent of use may 
well be part of the strategy, but prohibition has proven to be unsuitable for this purpose, as it 
has resulted in the almost total absence of government control over the chain between 
producer and consumer. By criminalizing the drug trade, control has been handed over to 
illegal enterprise, resulting in an uncontrolled availability of drugs. 
<p>
Recently one of the architects of the normalization policy, Eddy Engelsman, contemplated on 
a drug policy outside of criminal law. (86) Abandoning criminal law as the (dominant) policy 
instrument does, of course, not imply abandoning all control. Drugs are and have always been 
key commodities. Just as any other key commodity (food, housing, legal drugs), these need to 
be regulated. But by abandoning criminal law the chain between producer and consumer can 
be regulated more efficiently by simpler enforceable regulation systems. While this would be a 
preferable situation, it would be contra-indicated to change the law abruptly and legalize all 
drugs from one day to the other. This would disturb the natural progression of the described 
cultural transition process. Both users and mainstream culture need the time to adapt to 
increased availability of drugs. 
<p>
Instead, the Dutch normalization policy should be revitalized --from containment of 
problematic drug use and management of drug related problems, the leading policy incentive 
should be shifted towards actively influencing the nature of drug use and directing drug using 
cultures towards less harmful patterns of use. The above explained cultural transition process 
of the heroin culture should be more actively influenced --its orientation at survival lessened 
while encouraging a transition towards progress. Likewise, the social controls that 
communicate safe use patterns in the XTC culture must be stimulated. The results of the 
present study suggest that such interventions are certainly feasible, especially in the 
Netherlands. But this will require sophisticated strategies and innovative interventions 
focussed on the drug culture(s) and its determinants. A step-by-step decriminalization of the 
various drugs --leading to, what one might term, a controlled availability-- should be part of 
the policy instruments, but is not the only one available. In the broader perspective of current 
Dutch social policy thinking, such a development would, in fact, offer a meaningful example of 
social renewal. Evidently, these activities should be monitored closely by research. 
<p>
<I>Increased Drug Availability and Prevalence of Use</I>
<p>
It is often argued that increased drug availability will result in increased use. (56) Drugs 
themselves are considered to have such powerful reinforcing properties that mere availability 
will lead to (uncontrolled) use. Animal experiments are often presented to support this thesis. (87) 
However, Rhesus monkeys given four hours of daily access to cocaine during which drug 
delivery resulted from each lever press regulated their intake to a remarkable degree and 
showed stability in their daily cocaine use over periods of months. (88) In contrast, increasingly 
restrictive experimental regimes result in higher responding rates (and thus use levels). For 
example, monkeys in a progressive ratio schedule (89) would vigorously press the lever up to 
12.800 times in order to get a shot of cocaine, depending on the dose. (90)  In as much the drug 
taking behavior of these caged animals can be compared with that of humans in their natural 
setting, these experimental regimes more likely measure factors which resemble different 
aspects of prohibition in a highly stressful social setting, than a single pharmacological drug 
effect. Furthermore, in laboratory experiments with two rat colonies --one in a conventional 
experimental environment, the other in a simulated natural environment, a rat park-- affinity 
for opiate drugs could be established only under restricted conditions. (91)
<p>
Another argument often put forward is that of the per capita higher prevalence of use and 
addiction among physicians and other medical professionals, who have easy access to drugs. (56) 
These professions, however, are often very stressful with long working hours. More 
importantly, drug taking medical professionals risk heavy sanctioning, such as loss of 
professional license and criminal prosecution. Because of this threat and the social stigma 
involved with the use of illegal drugs, these drug using professionals are almost without 
exception solitary covert users. They are highly secretive about their use and do not associate 
(knowingly) with other drug using professionals. (92) This seriously hampers the formation of 
controlling rituals and rules as there is no exchange of information between, nor support or 
pressure from, (drug using) peers. 
<p>
The rising prevalence of illicit drug use in production regions or the prevalence of opiate use 
in nineteenth century Europe and North America is likewise presented to support the thesis 
that increased availability will result in increased prevalence of drug use. However, table 18.1 
indicated that in the Netherlands the use of drugs has stabilized, despite their relatively high 
availability. In addition to what was said above about the role of prohibition in the current 
spread of drug use, it can be argued that today's socio-economic conditions do not compare to 
those of the previous century, in which many drugs furthermore were rather indiscriminately 
promoted. Nowadays knowledge of and experience with drug use has increased greatly --not 
only of the pharmacology of the substances, but, more importantly, also of the social 
(learning) processes involved in drug taking. Likewise, prevention and education has become a 
science. Anti-tobacco and alcohol moderation campaigns indicate that lower use levels and 
self-regulation can well be established within a lawful context. 
<p>
<I>A Demand for Positive Rules</I>
<p>
Negative rules deny the pertinence of behavior (thou shall not!) without offering acceptable 
alternative models of conduct. Almost all current drug laws are negative rules which do not 
make sense to those who use drugs and thus brake them by definition. Therefore negative 
rules are difficult to enforce. In every situation where people are subjected to rules, which they 
do not agree with or see the rationale of, they will look for and create channels to evade these 
rules and protect their interests. Thus, in every closed institution (prison, boot camp, 
psychiatric clinic) one will find an informal/underground communication and exchange system 
that distributes restricted information and commodities (e.g. food, electronics, (bootlegged) 
alcohol and other drugs). (93) Likewise, many people disagree with speed restrictions on multiple 
lane highways --not only do they break them, but they also try to circumvent enforcement with 
radar warning devices. Positive rules, at the other hand, make sense even to those who break 
them and thus are easier to enforce. Traffic lights and way of passage rules, for example, are 
ubiquitously accepted. (94) But, illustrations of positive rules can be found in all social groups. 
Figure 18.5 depicts an example of a positive rule regulating tobacco smoking on a birthday. 
The text translates into: "We would prefer that you did not smoke in this living room until our 
daughter Tessa Fairy is in dreamland and we give you the sign."
<p>
Figure 18.5
<p>
The implementation process of a controlled availability of drugs must be accompanied by 
education and prevention activities aimed at strengthening the social determinants of self-
regulation. While a certain extent of ritualization around drug use is a positive requirement of 
self-regulation processes --in particular some re-ritualization around alcohol use may be 
beneficial to users and society as a whole-- the use of illicit drugs should be de-ritualized. The 
symbolic power of sharing a dose of heroin should be weakened as well as the current status 
of heroin use as a key indicator of subcultural identity. The strong reliance on, often (group) 
idiosyncratic, rituals should be superseded by more general applicable rules. These should take 
the form of positive rules that sanction socially acceptable patterns of use. 
<p>
<I>Social Policy and Life Structure</I>
<p>
In general, the life structure of drug users is not a specific target of drug policy, but rather the 
subject of general socio-economic policy. Unfinished education, unemployment, lack of 
perspective and other (psycho-social) life stressors have all been associated with problematic 
drug use. (95 96 97 98) In that respect, socio-economic destitute is perhaps the main determinant of 
increasing prevalence of (uncontrolled) drug use in and around the poverty stricken 
production regions. This emphasizes the multi-dimensionality of the proposed model. It may 
be a rather moth-eaten phrase, but drug policy must be embedded in a broader framework of 
socio-economic policy that aims to provide citizens with the skills and chances to pursue a 
satisfactory life. The potential role of drug treatment in this area will be addressed further 
below.
<p>
<I>Availability of Cannabis and XTC</I>
<p>
Actually, the time for adjustment of the cannabis policy is riper than ever. While there are no 
availability problems at the consumer level, in the current twilight zone situation the cannabis 
trade seems to be increasingly controlled by non-legal enterprise. The number of coffee shops 
is growing and some are apparently less willing to comply with the --typical Dutch-- implicit 
rules, for example regarding nuisance, advertisement and availability of other (il)licit drugs. 
Completely unrestricted opening hours, furthermore, result in a --quite undesirable-- 
unregulated availability. Further decriminalization, --which may imply legalization-- would 
allow for a controlled availability through effective regulation of (domestic) cultivation, 
geographical spread of sales outlets, opening hours, product range, advertisement, quality 
testing, etc. (99) New drugs, such as XTC could be subjected to an experimental period, in which 
their controlled availability through regulated channels should be guaranteed. Such a strategy 
would probably not only eliminate the fast developing black market, but prevent considerable 
potential harm when supported by well considered and targeted information campaigns. 
Political ignorance and fear of foreign critique, however, result in indecisiveness and 
procrastination. Even worse, proposals for a more repressive approach of cannabis have 
recently surfaced. Likewise, while the Rotterdam drug squad is unhappy with the illicit status 
of XTC and complains about the recent pollution of the XTC market, (100) this development is 
very likely the result of the targeted actions of inter-regional organized crime squads (IRTs), 
picking an easy mark. (101) The prolonged criminalization of these drugs can be considered a 
serious crime against public health. 
<p>
<I>Strengthening Rituals and Rules of Users of Cannabis and XTC</I>
<p>
In the domain of life structure users of cannabis and/or XTC probably need not be targeted as 
a distinct population, as their lives are fairly integrated in non drug dominated networks. In 
contrast, the formation of rituals and rules directed at moderation and safe controlled use of 
these drugs will require extra attention, especially in the case of XTC. In addition to 
mainstream media --school, public service announcements similar to the national alcohol 
moderation campaign-- subcultural channels may also be utilized, for example to distribute 
information on how to handle in case of adverse effects of drug use. A good example of this 
approach is a recent flyer from MDTIC in Liverpool on how to prevent, and handle in case of, 
heatstroke. This glossy party flyer-like folder uses lay-out, style symbols and argot of the 
English rave culture to present a life-saving message and is distributed via subcultural 
networks, such as certain records and clothing stores. (44) Not only can these media be used to 
strengthen and transfer existing, but also to feed new cultural norms. Gay Men's Health Crisis' 
billboard advertisement campaign in the U.S. stating that "9 out of every 10 gay men use 
condoms" in a time that perhaps one out of 10 actually did so, provides a good example. The 
key issue is to go beyond simplistic don't do this, don't do that messages and provide positive 
identification models, non-judgmental advice, and practical examples of safe conduct. When 
such valuable information is introduced into the community it will be disseminated by users 
themselves utilizing natural network links and peer pressure. (102) 
<p>
<I>Availability of Heroin</I>
<p>
The real challenge, however, is to be found in the heroin culture. Self-regulation processes in 
this community are seriously hampered by two decades of repression. Policy must be directed 
in ways which empower users, stimulate self-regulation, and make it possible for them to take 
responsibility for their lives in general and drug use in particular. Medical dispension of heroin 
or injectable drugs is perhaps beneficial for a subgroup of users, for example those with 
serious stages of HIV disease, but will not have a significant impact on the heroin culture as a 
whole. It does not take away craving for cocaine, nor does it stimulate self-control, as control 
over the use level remains in the hands of an outside force --the doctor who writes the script. 
Therefore, enlarging drug availability must be organized outside the realm of drug treatment 
or care. As explained before, instant legalization is likewise not advised. Instead, heroin and 
cocaine should gradually become easier available, and, applying the expediency principle, 
consumer transactions should no longer be prosecuted. 
<p>
A lot can be learned from the decriminalization of cannabis and the current policy towards 
house addresses in Rotterdam. Future policy must be a logical elaboration of, and thus be 
grounded in, the current street practice of tolerated house addresses where drugs are sold and 
used. This implicates an important role for the police. The police must extend its tolerant 
approach to a more active, regulating one. Use and vending of drugs at house addresses or in 
certain cafes should no longer be a reason for intervention, unless it involves inadmissible 
nuisance or other unlawful activities (e.g. fencing). An alternative or complementary 
possibility is the creation or endorsement of low key members only club houses, which can 
best be envisaged as a hybrid of the coffee shop and the opium den, (103) where drugs can be 
purchased for reasonable prices and used in a relaxed atmosphere. In addition to tolerating 
these venues, the police should actively explain this policy to the people that run them. When 
use and consumer sales are no longer reasons for intervention, and when given the proper 
support, users will be more than willing to cooperate with the authorities to control nuisance. 
<p>
An interesting example of this proposed policy --apparently practice precedes policy again-- is 
provided by the recent off-the-record cooperation of a police precinct, a neighborhood social 
safety project (a positive exception) and a house address in the west of Rotterdam. In contrast 
with the rather repressive social control approach sketched above, drug use itself is accepted 
to a certain degree in this neighborhood and provisions are taken to reduce the harm for both 
the neighborhood and the users. For example, a steel sharpsafe has been installed in a park 
where injecting happens regularly and a space has been provided to a group of users. This 
tolerated house address offers both smokers and injectors a place to use. While clean needles 
are supplied, the provisions for smokers are, however, more favorable. The place has 
distributed a newsletter among its visitors issuing the house rules, information about health 
issues and other significant topics. HIV prevention materials are supplied by a local outreach 
team while health workers have access to the place. Its visitors have been active in removing 
abandoned needles off the streets and parks in the neighborhood and the side walk in front of 
the place is frequently swept. Police officers visit the place several times a week to discuss the 
state of affairs and to provide practical advise to visitors. This regulatory approach is being 
extended to several dealing addresses while simultaneously, a number of really vexatious 
addresses have been closed down, leading to a decrease of nuisance in the neighborhood.
<p>
In general, these places should discourage injecting by offering limited provisions for injecting 
(however, without stimulating unintended unsafe situations) and make more moderate modes 
of administration, such as smoking more attractive. Perhaps a few separate venues for 
injecting should be created. Quality control would become feasible and new, milder, smokable 
products (e.g. heroin reefers) can be introduced at lower prices than injectables. Coca tea or 
"Cokee" may be served free as there are some indications that this may reduce cocaine 
craving. (7 104) 
<p>
<I>Changing the Rituals and Rules of the Heroin Culture</I>
<p>
The proposed controlled availability policy will induce a gradual adaptation of rituals and 
rules. However, when left to its own virtue it will take some time before these cultural changes 
become apparent. One should not forget that most of the current rituals and rules have been 
developed over a period of two decades and during that period they have proved highly 
functional. Merely feeding the culture with information is insufficient for establishing rapid 
change. But, in light of the HIV epidemic among IDUs rapid speed is of the essence. Such fast 
interventions cannot be expected from the established treatment agencies. A view which is 
apparently shared by the authorities as a recent government report doubts the effectivity of the 
current efforts. (105) The report considers merely providing leaflets and syringes insufficient. It 
states that prevention policy needs to be stronger and more innovative in relation to methods 
of approach. The report recommends to involve (ex) users in approaching out-of-treatment 
populations and employing drug users as para-professionals. Institutions are suggested to 
encourage self-organization of drug users and offer them facilities to do so. (105) There is thus a 
recognized need for immediate action directed at changing the rituals and rules of the heroin 
culture regarding HIV related behaviors. 
<p>
Only few peer support initiatives have been undertaken in the Netherlands. One Rotterdam 
outreach program cooperated with active IDUs to distribute clean works via established 
network relations (described in chapter fourteen). In the Deventer No-Risk project active and 
former drug users were recruited to educate out-of-treatment users. They supplied prevention 
materials (needles, condoms, etc.) and provided HIV prevention trainings to other users 
urging them to subsequently pass on the information in their networks. (106) Another pilot project 
in Nijmegen worked with two former sex workers to provide peer education. (107) While all of 
these projects suggest that involving drug users in prevention activities is feasible and 
promising, they also revealed some obstacles in the realm of continuity, status problems, 
cooperation with other professional organizations, credibility, training and support, etc. (107 108)
Very similar problems are described by Broadhead and colleagues, who studied the San 
Francisco NIDA outreach demonstration project. (102 109) They referred to these problems as 
agency problems, which can occur in any bureaucratic organization. A major problem of the 
Dutch peer support projects has been the lack of sufficient funding, in particularly for proper 
scientific evaluation. As a result, it is not possible to adequately assess their contribution. 
Likewise, these projects have a rather weak theoretical basis. Nevertheless, peer 
support/pressure seems an important method for HIV prevention. The current challenge is to 
operationalize the concept in ways that preclude or overcome the indicated problems. 
<p>
Recent sociological research offers interesting perspectives on the formation and enforcement 
of norms, valuable for the concept of peer based HIV prevention. (110 111) In general, emergence 
of norms is dependent on three factors: 1) inclinations or actors' preferences regarding their 
own behavior; 2) regulatory interests or actors' preferences regarding the behavior of others; 
and 3) enforcement resources or measures for enforcing norms, for example access to 
sanctions and information. Most studies of norm emergence have focussed on inclinations or 
enforcement resources, but these recent studies emphasize the role of regulatory interests. (111) 
Regulatory interests create the demand for norms, while contradictory inclinations determine 
the supply cost of normative compliance, giving the emergence of norms a market-like quality. 
Social norms can only emerge when the regulatory interests that order cooperation outweigh 
the contradictory inclinations that lean toward defection. (102) 
<p>
As knowledge of the AIDS epidemic diffused into the IDU community, new regulatory 
interests to reduce high risk behaviors emerged. But, while IDUs share these regulatory 
interests in preventing HIV infections, there are numerous contradictory inclinations resulting 
from the recurrent risks inherent to survival in the heroin culture (police harassment or arrest, 
overdose, rip offs and violence). The reduction of these conventional risks often relied on 
strategies that entail risks for HIV infection (not carrying works, use of shooting galleries, 
using with a partner and needle sharing). (112) Nonetheless, as chapter twelve explained, new safe 
use norms have emerged. The aim of future interventions must thus be to strengthen already 
existing risk-reduction norms and where necessary stimulate their adoption. 
<p>
Based on Heckathorn's theory of group-mediated social control, (110 111) Broadhead and 
Heckathorn have designed a model to harness the potential contributions of IDUs' peer 
support, which, they claim, will preclude the discussed agency problems. (113) This model, 
"termed client-driven intervention (CDI) is based on two design principles. First, to preclude 
agency problems, IDUs are provided with modest, but direct incentives to take over the 
functions traditionally performed by outreach workers. Second, to foster the creation of risk-
reduction norms or bolster already existing norms, [the program relies] on secondary rather 
than primary incentives. [T]he aim is not merely to affect the behavior of individual IDUs, but 
to alter the manner in which IDUs exercise influence over one another." (102) (emphasis in 
original) In this design IDUs will receive a modest payment or primary incentive for their 
participation in an interview-test-education session. Ensuing they will be receiving additional 
payments for recruiting peers, educating them and distributing prevention materials. These 
latter payments will be provided afterwards and are secondary incentives as they reward 
measured changes in their peers' behavior. In their proposed study Broadhead and 
Heckathorn will compare a CDI with a traditional outreach design. 
<p>
The CDI model seems also promising for utilization in the Netherlands. The socio-political 
conditions may even be superior compared to the USA. The possibilities of more formal forms 
of drug users' self-organization, at the other hand, have not yet been sufficiently examined in 
the Netherlands. Both the success of the Dutch Junkiebonden (junkie unions) during the 
1980s (114) and the current Australian practice of engaging drug user self-organizations in HIV 
prevention (115 116) suggest an important reservoir. It will be highly interesting to assess the 
validity of the two models for the Dutch situation. A comparative study is currently being 
planned. (117)
<p>
<I>Improving the Life Structure of Marginalized Users</I>
<p>
When drugs become normally available the need to spend much time on drug related activities 
and with other drug users diminishes. Many users will be able to pick up conventional 
activities and responsibilities (such as work) again, and their social network will gradually 
consist of less drug related connections. On the other hand, persistent involvement in illicit 
drug use limited the feasibility of developing legal professional skills and made the 
development and maintenance of criminal skills useful and opportune. Criminal activities not 
infrequently developed prior to or simultaneously to the drug use career (66) and a considerable 
number of people have never been legally employed. The informal job market (drug dealing, 
acquisition crime, prostitution) provides meaning and structure to the lives of many people 
with little chances of legal employment. (73) These factors may seriously hamper the 
normalization of the life structures of many users. This will be exacerbated by the high level of 
stigmatization and the resulting impaired self-concept. Furthermore, as was discussed in 18.3, 
for many marginalized users drugs are only one of the many problems. Homelessness, a 
complete lack of perspective, psycho-social problems and an impaired health status (HIV) are 
among the problems that will further frustrate making changes. 
<p>
These are among the problems to be addressed by future treatment and care policy. Mindful of 
the discussion in 18.3, however, it is doubtful if the established treatment and care system --
with its large emphasis on maintaining or curing opiate addiction-- is equipped to take on 
these new challenges. It appears too much to be a one size fits all approach with little tailoring 
towards needs and potentials of individual clients. (86) Therefore, revitalization and 
reorganization of the treatment and care system is an important element of future policy. Old 
dogmas and structures should be reconsidered and examined on their significance in the 
context of the new policies. New objectives need to be formulated and perhaps new 
organizational frameworks established, that cut through existing barriers. Without making any 
pretensions to comprehensiveness, the following paragraphs will discuss some of the areas to 
be considered. 
<p>
Drug users have the same right to health care as any other citizen in the Netherlands. Their 
treatment and care needs should be met by appropriate approaches, whether these are 
provided by general or specialized (psycho-social) health care organizations, including drug 
treatment programs. Drug use in itself may not be a ground for refusal. Independent intensive 
case management, which matches clients' needs with the services offered can make an 
important contribution to this aim. These cost-effective case managers can be envisaged as a 
type of consumer brokers, who can work to help clients negotiate the multiple and complex 
systems of existing institutions and further serve as advocates on behalf of marginalized clients 
who are not accustomed to doing so for themselves. Case management can help marginalized 
users to regain some control over their lives again and prevent others' slipping into (further) 
marginalization. It will also lead to a more efficient utilization of the existing service capacity. 
Perhaps the provision of services to drug users should obtain more of a free market quality. In 
New Zealand, for example, the introduction of free market health care has seemingly had a 
positive effect on the empowerment of users, as they gained the same status as consumers of 
any other health care provision. (118) 
<p>
Financial management (e.g. benefits, bills, debts) can prevent many of the currently typical 
problems, such as evictions from housing. In Rotterdam, a low threshold SRO (single room 
occupancy) would meet the needs of many currently homeless users. In that way, they would 
also be much easier to approach by other service providers and become more responsive to 
public health interventions, such as HIV prevention or TB campaigns, as it has been 
established that homelessness and the resulting inability to plan and organize is associated with 
enduring risk behavior and positive serostatus. (119) 
<p>
One of the main determinants of life structure is a steady pattern of daily activities. It is almost 
undisputed that work fulfills an important role, both in respect to daily patterning and in terms 
of social status and self-respect. So called re-socialization programs which offer skills and job 
training have been in function for quite a while, but their results are not always clear, as little 
evaluation has been conducted. Often these projects are part of the same organization that 
runs the methadone program and only clients qualify. One can wonder whether a certificate 
from a drug re-socialization program is an advantage in a job interview. Often programs are 
rather inflexible without exploring and developing personal skills and talents. A skillful con 
man may well be trained to be a successful insurance salesman. It can furthermore be 
questioned whether the activities many of these programs offer match the demands of the 
labor market. It is therefore advisable that these specialized projects are incorporated by, or 
form solid referral agreements with general job training programs. The goal must be to help 
people get real jobs. Experiments in this direction are currently underway and seem 
promising. (120 121) Currently, most projects are open only to ex-users, or persons who only use 
methadone. It is advisable to relax this criterium to stabilized users. Likewise, methadone 
programs should be more flexible to working schedules of employed clients. 
<p>
Additional (illegal) drug use is often a ground for expulsion from treatment. It is a truly bizarre 
phenomenon that upon discovery of use --whether this entails an occasion of recreational use 
or a relapse into symptomatic behavior-- people are debarred from treatment. Wouldn't it be 
equally or more justifiable to intensify the treatment? After all, in many cases problematic drug 
use has been the reason for seeking treatment in the first place. 
<p>
Methadone dispension should be separated more from other services. Treatment is now often 
polluted by all sorts of power games around this synthetic substitution drug. By separating the 
two, treatment goals become clearer and trusting relationships between client and therapist are 
better possible. Methadone dispension schedules could be personalized. For some clients it is 
best to pick up their methadone seven days a week, for others once a week suffices. In 
Rotterdam the methadone dispension has recently been computerized. Perhaps providing 
clients with a PIN-code card should be considered, so that they themselves can choose the 
time of pick up, resulting in a more even spread over the day. This would decrease their 
dependence on the system and limit the scene function of the methadone programs. Many 
clients would be better served if they could get their methadone from their general 
practitioner, guaranteed that the GP receives the proper support. (122 123)  One can imagine that when drugs become easier available, the demand for methadone would be reduced anyway.  Its 
function would probably also change as it would less frequent be used as a maintenance and 
more as a crisis or reduction drug. 
<p>
A seriously under-developed area in the Dutch drug services field is health maintenance. The 
need for a health maintenance approach will grow with concerns about HIV infection, but it 
would be erroneous to limit such an approach to HIV care or AIDS prevention. Currently, 
licenced nurses invest the majority of their time in methadone dispension --an incredible waist 
of human resource and training, which decreases job satisfaction and contributes to the 
negative image many have of their clients. With the right additional training, their skills can be 
utilized in helping their clients learn to maintain their own health, given the resources available 
to them. 
<p>
The policy changes and interventions discussed in this section, while not a panacea and 
certainly necessitating the same scrutiny as any other well intentioned advice, are logical 
extensions of the current normalization policy. It is expected that they will gradually reduce 
the problematic nature of illicit drug use to its genuine proportions and allow users as well as 
society at large to deal with the effects of drugs in a more rational manner. As has been put 
forward before, the proposed changes must be carefully monitored by research. Therefore, the 
final section of this chapter will consider some research issues.

<b>Considerations for Future Research</b>
<p>
The studies reported in this thesis all considered certain aspects of drug use behavior in its 
natural environment. Little detail is yet known about the behaviors of drug users outside 
treatment institutions, in particular in Europe. Some epidemiological studies are available, but 
these explain little of the drug taking behavior itself, nor of its functions and meanings. As 
explained before, this lack of knowledge has been the reason for choosing ethnography as the 
principle methodology of the project. (124) This approach has been highly fruitful, as many 
different aspects of drug use could be described and interrelated in a wider context. The lack 
of existing knowledge was likewise the reason for the rather general initial research questions. 
The resulting wide scope allowed for the formulation of several hypotheses along the research 
process --of which some have subsequently been assessed in a quantitative manner-- and the 
serendipitous discovery of frontloading. 
<p>
In particular in the rather virgin field of AIDS and drug use there is still much to discover for 
which we may be blind when merely relying on standardized measurements. As Turnbull 
wrote: "It is too easy to go into a field situation expecting or hoping to find this or that, for 
invariably you come out having found what you wanted. Selectivity can do great things in 
blinding one to a wider reality." (125) The need for studies which add to our basic knowledge of 
drug use, its relations with HIV and the factors that obstruct or promote safer and controlled 
drug use is obvious and urgent. Exactly here, ethnography has much to offer as it has a rich 
and fruitful history in exploring and explaining drug use behaviors. It is a large and precious 
reservoir of theoretical and practical knowledge, which can be drawn from in designing AIDS 
and drugs studies. 
<p>
In addition to this open focus ethnography, there is a clear need for controlled field 
intervention studies which develop simple, practical methods and strategies for checking the 
spread of HIV in the drug user community, grounded in its cultural traditions. In that respect, 
it is of crucial importance to contact those populations that are currently unreached. In order 
to generate reliable and valid data, such studies --consider the name Experimental 
Comparative Ethnography-- must include multiple research sites and experiment with new 
methodologies that refine ethnographic techniques for intensive case-finding and description, 
for example randomized snowball sampling, (126) network analysis (127) and Experience Sampling. (64 
128) The urgency of the AIDS pandemic underlines the necessity of cooperation between, and 
integration of, qualitative and quantitative approaches, in particular in search of innovative 
methodologies. Attempts in this direction are e.g. undertaken in some of the American NIDA 
demonstration projects. (129) Unfortunately, in many of these projects the ethnographic 
component has been made subservient to the collection of large statistically analyzable data 
bases. Instead, ethnographers should take an active role in designing multimethod studies, that 
are driven by ethnographic analysis. Ethnography is especially suited to give direction to such 
multidisciplinary projects as it can build bridges between policy and hidden populations (130) 
which are essential for successful drugs and AIDS policies. Ethnography provides the 
information, skills and experience required for working with indigenous research collaborators 
and, above all, it can generate the theoretical framework and testable hypotheses for 
subsequent quantification. Thus, ethnography provides not only the eyes and ears of the 
research but also its thriving analytical power. An interesting example of such an inventive 
cooperation is provided by the above discussed CDI design. (113) 
<p>
In this thesis a theoretical model has been presented for explaining self-regulation processes in 
human drug taking. In the previous chapter the model was used to explain the paradoxical 
cocaine/heroin patterns of the study subjects. But application is not limited to this population. 
It may equally be applied to other populations and other drugs. The model seems suitable for 
application in qualitative, quantitative and mixed designs. It can be utilized in cross-cultural 
comparisons of drug policies and different populations or subcultures using the same drug. 
The model may likewise be used in longitudinal and evaluation studies. An important future 
task will be to operationalize and refine the model and its determinants. The following 
variables can then be considered for inclusion:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Demographic and background statistics
<li>General and personal socio-economic circumstances
<li>Drug use variables (type, dose, frequency)
<li>Social network variables
<li>Individual and social ritualization processes (e.g. the nature of rituals; the intensity of 
ritualization)
<li>Nature and power of rules
<li>Drug users' subjective experiences and time patterning regarding their drug use
<li>Psycho-social health
<li>Physical health
<li>Treatment history
<li>Drug availability, both at the general and the personal level.
<li>Legal and social status of drugs
<li>Parameters of subculture (e.g. argot, sign language, style symbols)
</ul>
<p>
Another matter in need of further study is the apparent graduality and multidimensionality of 
self-regulation processes and their relevance in the development of comprehensive definitions. 
As was explained in chapter three, the development of valid definitions of drug use related 
states has been a long and unrewarding task. Feeling a need for a concise definition of, for 
example, controlled drug use, one may be tempted to define such a notion in terms of 
quantifiable measures. But beyond the extreme examples, sheer quantity is an insufficient 
measurement. Quality of use --operationalized in the factors that constitute the feedback 
model-- should therefore play an important role in attempts to define these issues. (131) 
<p>
Future drug use research in the Netherlands should concentrate on the factors that determine 
self-regulation processes. As this has recently also been suggested in a position paper on 
research of the Dutch ministry of health, (132) this should have consequences for funding. 
Utilizing the feedback model several studies can be suggested, for example:
<p>
<ul>
<li>An Experimental Comparative Ethnography of XTC use in selected cities in the 
Netherlands (e.g. Rotterdam or Amsterdam), the United Kingdom (London, Manchester or 
Liverpool) and the USA (New York or Chicago) for example, will provide significant 
information on this comparably new and unpolluted drug phenomenon. 
<li>Another study might focus on the suggestion that new groups of heroin users (e.g. young 
Moroccans in Amsterdam) are seemingly able to regulate their use of this substance in ways 
that avoid loss of control. 
</ul>
<p>
Finally, two research issues, significant to the prevention of HIV need to be addressed. First, 
as the HIV infection potential of Syringe Mediated Drug Sharing techniques has been recently 
established, (133) the prevalence, circumstances, and possibilities for prevention of HIV 
transmission through these techniques need to be studied. Secondly, as ammonia is almost 
ubiquitously available on dealing addresses, it is worthwhile to assess its potential as a viricide 
in needle cleaning simulations. (134) If this agent would prove effective it could be promoted 
among IDUs in the Netherlands. As it is a familiar product in the heroin/cocaine scene, 
acceptation as a simple disinfectant may be much easier than when bleach would be promoted 
as such.

<b>Part I: The Study of Drug Taking Rituals</b>
<p>
<i>The Behavioral Sequences Around the Use of Heroin and Cocaine</i>
<p>
The present study confirmed the existence of two main heroin administration rituals with an 
uneven distribution --injecting, which was the main route for a minority of 23%, and 
smoking, almost exclusively chasing, which was generally applied by 77% of the research 
participants. There was a large overlap with cocaine administration rituals. Generally, heroin 
injectors inject cocaine (hydrochloride) as well, while most heroin smokers inhale vaporized 
cocaine (base), by way of chasing. However, during the course of the fieldwork a growing 
tendency towards smoking cocaine in a pipe (basing) was observed. In particular many 
smokers have adopted this practice, while they continue to chase heroin. A number of IDUs 
also applied this smoking technique. 
<p>
Chapter four showed that the ingestion of heroin by both chasers and IDUs is subject to a 
fixed, stylized and predictable behavioral sequence, which a user must master through 
practice, observation of, and instruction from more experienced users. Therefore it fulfills the 
first condition for ritualization, a prescribed psychomotor sequence. Chapter four also 
provided the first documentation of the instrumental functionality of the observed drug taking 
rituals. All elements in the behavioral sequence and the employed paraphernalia have a 
defined purpose, which can be derived from observing the ritual as well as from the exegetic 
explanations offered by its performers. 
<p>
A similar conclusion can be drawn regarding the ingestion of cocaine, whether it is used 
purely or in combination with heroin. In the late 1970s and early 1980s cocaine became 
widely available and used in the circles of regular heroin users. At the end of the 1980s 
cocaine use has become rather endemic in this population --in the present study sample of 
active drug users 96% used both cocaine and heroin, while the prevalence of cocaine use 
among clients of the Rotterdam drug treatment agencies is almost 70%. The results presented 
in chapter five illustrate the powerful appeal cocaine has for the study participants, as they 
often went through great sacrifices to continue the use of this drug. Cocaine has thus 'nested' 
in ritual procedures developed around heroin use, which were initially less geared to the 
consumption of often large quantities cocaine. High level cocaine use brought about a large 
number of problems in the study population, such as craving escalation, resulting in 'binging' 
and increasing 'pill' use, which disturbed rather balanced heroin (-methadone) use patterns. 
Impaired judgment and outbreaks of violence, social withdrawal, paranoid thinking and 
depression could also be associated with high levels of cocaine use.
<p>
To counter these problems, existing heroin rituals were gradually adapted to integrate cocaine 
use. At first glance these adaptations may seem minor and rather insignificant. For example, 
little changed in the sequence of preparing a dose, especially for IDUs. Smokers smoothly 
extended their preparatory activities to include the cooking of base cocaine, using ammonia 
and, to a lesser degree, bicarbonate. These ritualized preparatory behaviors are generally 
highly standardized and instrumentally functional, whereas sometimes they are colored by 
idiosyncratic interpretations. Nevertheless, careful scrutiny shows that cocaine changed both 
the chasing and the injecting ritual significantly in several ways. Cocaine introduced a 
second, more potent, smoking ritual --basing-- and induced a variable daily ingestion pattern 
at an increased use frequency, in which cocaine and heroin are alternated, mixed or both. The 
latter change was directed at maintaining cocaine use, while simultaneously encountering the 
drug's adverse side effects. A major feature of this change is the altered position of heroin. It 
is an expression of the main instrumental function of drug use rituals --self-regulation. 
<p>
<i>Transitions between Administration Rituals</i>
<p>
Chapter six investigated the transitions between smoking and injecting observed among the 
research participants. While variations of different cocaine/heroin combinations were 
common within the ritual of preference, transitions between administration rituals were only 
infrequently observed. Besides a few rather idiosyncratic reasons, most of the observed 
transitions from smoking to injecting could be traced to economic pressure, the increased rush 
experience delivered by the injection and loss of control. The observations and several 
comments of respondents imply a strong association with cocaine use, for economic 
(smoking cocaine becomes too expensive) as well as for hedonistic (the better rush) reasons. 
Transitions in the opposite direction were often associated with attempts to regain control, 
especially over cocaine use or social pressure, for example when socializing with non-
injectors or when working in a dealing collective of exclusively smokers. For some older long 
time injectors, smoking their drugs was the only option left open, as they literally ran out of 
accessible veins. Chapter six also documented some evidence for cultural/religious barriers to 
injecting among Moroccan and especially Surinamese users. The prevalence of injecting drug 
use among these minority users is far lower than average. However, in spite of such 
protective cultural barriers, injecting has increased, in particular among Moroccans. Again 
cocaine is implicated as a possible 'facilitator'. 
<p>
<i>Function and Meaning of Drug Use Rituals</i>
<p>
The expressions of ritual observed around the administration of heroin and cocaine have 
important instrumental functions in the day-to-day management of drug use --both in solitary 
and in social ritual situations-- and are significant in defining the social relationships between 
the drug users in their social networks. For this reason these behaviors have gained symbolic 
merit. The instrumental functions described in chapter seven center around maximizing the 
profits from a given dose of drugs, managing the level of drug use and balancing the positive 
and negative effects of the ingested drugs, and preventing secondary problems. Behavior 
directed at maximizing the drug effect can be observed in the preparation of the drug, in the 
actual administration and shortly thereafter. Through standardization of the behavioral 
sequence, which may contain behaviors that do and/or do not fit a means to an end scheme, 
users try to control the yield of the drug administration. 
<p>
Standardization is also applied in controlling the level of intake and minimizing adverse 
effects. this is especially apparent in the ritual patterns that have been developed around 
cocaine use, which besides giving intense euphoria has some well known negative 
consequences. Heroin plays a crucial role in controlling cocaine. Both drugs are used in 
patterns that optimize the desired effects while simultaneously curbing the undesired side 
effects of cocaine. The nesting of cocaine in heroin rituals has altered the function of heroin 
to a great extent. The drug has become intertwined and subservient to cocaine --it is used to 
modulate the effects of cocaine, which has taken over its function of primary source of 
pleasure. Maintaining these cocaine/heroin patterns requires a steady availability of money 
and/or drugs, which many users cannot sustain on a permanent basis. Then they resort to 
control strategies that include periodical abstinence (mostly of cocaine) and averting 
situations that can induce ritual interactions resulting in using. In contrast with stereotypical 
portrayals, it is concluded that the study participants put much effort in trying to control their 
drug use. 
<p>
Chapter eight investigated instances of symbolic elaboration developed around drug taking 
behavior at the level of the individual drug user. Examples were found of ritual objects (e.g. 
drug paraphernalia) of which the construction or use enhances or symbolizes a positive 
outcome of the ritual sequence and reduces anxiety. Likewise, parts of the ritual sequence can 
become just as important as the complete process, as for the user they are indicative for the 
results of the whole procedure. Indications of 'special meaning' were further found in, what 
may be called obsessive performance of the ritual, or continued performance after the 
rationale was no longer present. This kind of behavior was particularly apparent in IDUs, 
who, for example, were observed to inject solutions containing drug quantities too minuscule 
to sort an effect. One may call such behavior 'hyper ritualization'.
<p>
Just as in any other social group, rituals are very important instruments in defining the social 
context of the drug subculture. They display and communicate the subcultural norms 
regarding social relationships and socially appropriate behavior. Chapter nine analyzed the 
social implications of the rituals and rules that have evolved around group drug use. An 
important function is the maintenance of the social structures that are essential for the 
satisfaction of the needs of drug users --the places and channels which secure the relatively 
undisturbed purchase and use of drugs. The so called 'house address', where drugs are sold 
and used, and where users socialize, plays a crucial role in these structures. Within certain 
limits house addresses are tolerated by the police and this is communicated to the user 
community. Thus, house addresses are not under a constant threat of police busts and this 
resulted in a rather relaxed atmosphere at these places. The relative absence of ambiguity and 
anxiety over police interventions induced a clear set of rules, which are primarily aimed at 
securing dealing activities and use of purchased drugs. Whereas there is little fear of, for 
example undercover operations, only limited ritual interactions surround the actual drug 
transactions. The most successful house addresses are thus those with clear and strictly 
enforced house rules.
<p>
The most explicit social ritual has developed around the sharing of drugs, which is a very 
frequent activity. The drug sharing ritual can take a rather formal shape, as was observed in 
'dyads' of IDUs, or be more casual, for example when drugs are shared in a 'pub-like' 
atmosphere among visitors of a house address. The sharing ritual is subject to several rules, 
e.g. regarding reciprocity and helping sick users. While some instrumental functions are 
apparent, for example preventing withdrawal, the drug sharing ritual symbolizes a broader 
pattern of social interaction in the drug subculture. Drug sharing expresses the almost 
universal subcultural rule of "share what you have" and is an important way to socialize and 
(re)establish relationships. In the latter sense it matches the cup of coffee (indeed, a drug) 
offered to a visitor. Drug sharing plays a crucial role in the social organization of drug users. 
It smothers conflicts and creates a special bond. It provides a feeling of identity and a support 
system, which satisfies basic human desires for intimacy, social solidarity and harmony. 
Therefore, the main social function of the drug sharing ritual is the maintenance of the drug 
using network and, ultimately, the drug subculture. These 'tribal' characteristics are shared 
with all other forms of human organization. Drug sharing is thus merely an expression of 
fundamental and normal human interaction.

<b>Part II: Drug Use Rituals, Health Problems and Drug Policy</b>
<p>
Part II of the dissertation reports on seven substudies concerning the relationship between 
drug use rituals, drug policy and health problems, in particular the spread of HIV among 
IDUs. The literature study reported in chapter ten compares the (physical) health 
consequences of the two main administration rituals. It centers around the risk of (fatal) 
overdose and physical harm related to regular use. While under legal and controlled 
conditions injecting may perhaps be preferable, it is concluded that ,given the current 
condition of prohibition, smoking is a less harmful drug administration ritual. 
<p>
Chapter eleven offers a comprehensive investigation of the HIV transmission risks associated 
with drug sharing among IDUs. The drug sharing techniques frontloading and backloading 
were not only observed in Rotterdam, but in several places in Europe and the USA. Recent 
American research confirmed the hypothesis of the presented study --a strong statistical 
association with HIV infection was found. As the prevalence of needle sharing is rather low 
in the Netherlands, frontloading is probably a main route of HIV spread in this country. 
<p>
The subject of the study reported in chapter twelve is the sharing of needles, syringes and 
other injection paraphernalia. It was first of all concluded that needle sharing did not serve 
ritual purposes among the observed IDUs. This 'high-risk' activity appeared to be mainly 
determined by three factors: (i) (un)availability of sterile injection equipment, (ii) experience 
with the injecting ritual and its protective skills and (iii) drug craving, in particular for 
cocaine. While most IDUs in the study were relatively careful with syringes and needles, such 
caution was not extended to other injection attributes and materials. Spoons, filters and water 
containers were more than once casually shared, which indicates a serious lack of knowledge. 
The analysis further suggested that sharing of injecting paraphernalia may often be reinforced 
by deteriorated venous condition. Finally, the drug injection interactions discussed in the 
chapter were plotted to expose the hypothetical HIV transmission routes. This demonstrated 
the complexity of risk behavior associated with drug injecting in groups. 
<p>
The question whether needle sharing can be considered a ritual interaction is the central issue 
of chapter thirteen. First, this chapter reviewed the literature on this issue. Several authors 
make bold statements regarding the ritual properties of needle sharing, but all fail to support 
these with data or relevant references. A questionable practice of chain-referencing was found 
leading back to a study published in 1970. It was concluded that none of the reviewed papers 
offered substantial evidence for the thesis that needle sharing is a ritual. Ensuing, this chapter 
examined needle sharing in light of the relevant definitions of ritual and ritual object. It was 
demonstrated that the attachment of symbolic elaboration to the instrumental act of needle 
sharing is principally subject to the 'perceived availability' of drug injection equipment. 
Furthermore, injection equipment can only obtain 'secondary' ritual value, while drugs have 
'intrinsic' or 'primary' ritual value, because of their direct relationship to the effect of the 
excecution of the ritual. These two factors, the absence of standardized needle sharing 
patterns and the diminished functionality of needle sharing, due to (knowledge of) the HIV 
epidemic make the addition of special meaning to the instrumental act of needle sharing not 
likely. Even in the USA, where needle availability is severely restricted, there is no 
substantial evidence in support of ritual needle sharing. On the contrary, a growing number of 
scientific publications show significant behavior change towards safer injection practices.  
Finally, the chapter investigated the sources of some of the boldest statements on this issue 
and concluded that 'the needle sharing ritual' better qualifies as a deceptive political 
soundbite, used by high rank US officials in the 'war on drugs', than as a valid scientific 
concept. 
<p>
From these studies and the international literature it has become clear that needle availability 
is an important factor underlying needle sharing. Not only structural scarcity but also 
situational --on-the-spot-- shortages can result in unsafe injecting practices. Therefore, the 
Rotterdam outreach program HADON cooperated with known IDUs to target unknown IDUs 
and significant places (e.g. house addresses) for delivery of clean needles. Chapter fourteen 
reports on a pilot evaluation study of this collective needle exchange program. The needle 
exchange patterns of the IDUs participating in this collective scheme are compared to those 
of users, who exchanged needles on an individual basis. It was found that this approach 
extended the reach of the program to a great degree and that it was well received in the IDU 
community. The results were, however, negatively influenced by police activities aimed at 
closing down places where drugs were used and sold. It is concluded that engaging IDUs in 
peer group directed prevention efforts is both feasible and promising.
<p>
The following two chapters discuss some aspects of the relationship between drug policy and 
drug use rituals. Chapter fifteen focusses on the micro-ecology of the street based drug 
market at the central railway station zone in Rotterdam, where the more marginalized 
segment of the city's drug using population congregates. In contrast with elsewhere in 
Rotterdam one can purchase pre-processed smokable cocaine in this area. As has been 
explained in preceding chapters, most users prefer to prepare their own cocaine base from the 
cocaine hydrochloride bought at the house addresses. The marketing of 'cooked cocaine', 
which basically is crack, is an exception to this rule and can be explained by the specific 
ecological conditions characteristic for the Central Station zone. Because of the high 
concentration of passing travellers and the constant surveillance of the railroad police, there is 
neither time nor space to cook cocaine hydrochloride. This made the availability of a ready 
for use product functional to this group of drug users. It is furthermore a clear indication of 
the flexibility of the drug taking rituals in this population. 
<p>
Chapter sixteen took a rather opposite approach and compared the drug use contexts in two 
very different cities. It described and explored certain patterns of drug use, sharing, and 
natural support systems found among IDUs in Rotterdam, the Netherlands and the Bronx, 
New York, USA. By specifying details of the micro-settings of everyday drug use in both 
locales, it became possible to identify certain common elements and consequences of 
personal and social behavior driven by drug use per se (e.g. drug preference), and to 
differentiate these from behaviors and consequences determined by drug policy and the social 
context in which drug use actually occurs. These policies and the social context they create 
could in turn be shown to relate to risks for HIV transmission, e.g. the increased likelihood of 
sharing injection equipment.

<b>Part III: Self-regulation, Drug Culture and Drug Policy</b>
<p>
The analysis of the drug taking rituals (and the rules they represent) presented in this 
dissertation demonstrated that rituals and rules are important regulatory agents in the lives of 
regular drug users. Furthermore, they are regulatory agents in more than one aspect. These 
social controls regulate the individual drug taking experience, but are equally important in 
determining social relations and socially appropriate conduct. In other words, rituals and rules 
help to make sense of the drug experience as well as of the social world in which these drugs 
are used. The latter feature is believed to be a basic function of ritual, both in traditional and 
(post) modern societies.    In this perspective, the rituals of the study participants diverge thus 
little of those in other social groups. Only the object around which the ritual is organized (the 
ritual object) differs. Furthermore, economic (e.g. scarcity) and socio-cultural factors (e.g. 
subculture) play a crucial role in the formation, nature and maintenance of the observed 
rituals and rules. This relationship and its impact on the drug user's ability to regulate her/is 
drug using behavior is of great importance, in particular for public health and harm reduction 
considerations. Whereas several examples of non-compliance with these subcultural social 
controls were recorded in the present study, such infringements could generally be associated 
with certain specific conditions, which are best described as reduced 'drug availability' and/or 
limited 'life structure'. 
<p>
Therefore, chapter seventeen explored the nature of, and interactions between Drug 
Availability, Life Structure, and Rituals and Rules. Based on this exploration it presented a 
hypothetical model of self-regulation based on these three clusters. The presented model 
builts on and elaborates the theory of the late Norman Zinberg. The results of the present 
study suggest that cocaine/heroin users, who are succesfully involved in dealing experience 
considerably less drug related problems and are more capable in regulating their use, although 
they generally use more cocaine. This can be explained as follows. Succesful user/dealers are 
in a position of sufficient drug availability. This prevents fixation on (obtaining) the drug and 
allows for the formation and maintenance of regulating rituals and rules, which, in turn, 
support the degree of life structure required for maintaining dealing activities that generate 
the necessary resources to maintain drug availability. Generalization of this reasoning lead to 
the formulation of the following hypothetical model: Drug Availability, Rituals and Rules, 
and Life Structure are a trinity --interactive factors in an internally coherent circular process, 
in which these factors are themselves modulated (modified, corrected, strenghtened, etc.) by 
their outcomes. It is thus a 'feedback circuit' that determines the strength of self-regulation 
processes controlling drug use. The chapter further discussed the impact of certain external 
factors on the model, in particular drug policy. Exploring and comparing certain aspects of 
prohibition and legalization, the chapter concluded that prohibition interferes with the natural 
processes underlying self-regulation. Legalization, at the other hand, is not an instant remedy 
for this interference, but merely paves the way for alternative drug control policies, outside of 
criminal law, which are expected to facilitate natural processes of self-regulation. 
<p>
Whereas ritual is the basic element of culture, chapter eighteen adressed the drug 
phenomenon on the level of the compound --the drug using culture itself. It discussed the 
cultural developments around heroin, cannabis and MDMA in the Netherlands and their 
relationship with Dutch drug policy. The chapter furthermore explored new directions for 
drug policy and practice, building on the successes of the Dutch 'normalization' policy.

<center><b>AN OVERVIEW OF THE CONCLUSIONS</b></center>
<p>
<ol>
<li>The ingestion of heroin and/or cocaine by way of smoking (primarily chasing and to a 
lesser extent basing) and injecting fulfill the conditions for ritualization. The behavioral 
sequences are highly standardized and stylized, and of special meaning to the performers. 
They are highly functional in the process of getting high. (Ch. 4 and 5; R.Q. 1.1) 

<li>The drug administration rituals of the observed drug users are, in general, rather stable. 
Transitions between smoking (primarily chasing) and injecting rituals were only infrequently 
observed. When occurring, these were associated with availability, (loosing or regaining) 
control over drug use, social pressure, or hedonistic motives. (Ch. 6; R.Q. 1.2)

<li>Cocaine has become the engine of the former heroin scene. It is used in varying 
combinations with heroin. The addition of cocaine has resulted in a large number of (psycho-
social) problems in the study population, and is associated with initiation into injecting. 
Basing may be a precursor for cocaine injecting. These problems are for a large part related to 
the low 'subjective' availability of the drug. Cocaine has disturbed rather controlled 
heroin(/methadone) use patterns. Its use has been nested in rituals developed for heroin use 
and taken over its function of primary source of pleasure. As a result, a functional 
relationship between heroin and cocaine has been established. Heroin use has become almost 
completely intertwined with and subservient to cocaine use. It is mainly used to modulate the 
effects of cocaine, in particular to ameliorate cocaine's disturbing side effects. (Ch. 5 and 7; 
R.Q. 1.1, 1.2, 1.5 and 1.7) 

<li>Both the smoking and the injecting ritual fulfill important instrumental functions, such as 
maximizing the yield of a given dose of drugs; controlling the level of drug use and managing 
positive and negative effects of the drugs; and preventing secondary problems. These 
instrumental functions are represented in the construction of the paraphernalia, as well as by 
the behavioral sequences themselves. (Ch. 4, 5 and 7; R.Q. 1.5 and 1.7)

<li>Both administration rituals contain elements of symbolic elaboration. The construction 
and use of certain paraphernalia, certain ritual cues, parts of the sequence, and the order of the 
sequence can obtain a power beyond the instrumental functionality --they can for example 
invoke the start of a ritual sequence (getting high), enhance the experience of the drug effect, 
and reduce anxiety. The data suggests that symbolic elaboration is stronger among IDUs. (Ch. 
8; R.Q. 1.5 and 1.6)

<li>The social functions of the drug administration rituals are most obvious in the recurrent 
sharing of drugs. Drug sharing includes instrumental functions, e.g. preventing withdrawal, 
but is also an important means to socialize, establish and reinforce relationships and is 
ultimately aimed at maintaining the social network/subculture. The sharing ritual is subjected 
to several rules, e.g. regarding reciprocity. Drug sharing is not unique for illegal drug users, 
but resembles a fundamental and normal human behavior. (Ch. 9; R.Q. 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 and 
1.7)

<li>In terms of the risks of overdose, physical harm, and communicable diseases it is clear 
that, given the current conditions of prohibition, the smoking ritual entails less health risks 
than injecting. (Ch. 10; R.Q. 2.1)

<li>Syringe mediated drug sharing techniques, such as frontloading and backloading can 
transmit HIV and other microbiological infections when unsterile syringes are used. In the 
Netherlands frontloading may well be a major route of HIV infection. Drug sharing situations 
often entail multiple possibilities of transmission. (Ch. 11, 12; R.Q. 2.2)

<li>Needle sharing is primarily determined by the structural or situational availability of 
needles, while drug craving and inexperience with the injecting ritual are important additional 
factors. Because of a lack of knowledge, other injection paraphernalia are often casually 
shared. (Ch. 12; R.Q. 2.3)

<li>The thesis that needle sharing is a ritual cannot be supported by substantial evidence in 
the scientific literature. In general, needle sharing cannot be considered a ritualized behavior 
pattern, as the behavioral sequence does not fulfill the requirements of the relevant 
definitions. (Ch. 13; R.Q. 2.4)

<li>Engaging active IDU's in HIV prevention activities is an necessary and feasible approach. 
They have access to places and populations which are not accessible for traditional service 
providers and can utilyze their natural information and exchange networks. (Ch. 14; R.Q. 3.2) 

<li>As a general rule, crack is not available in the Netherlands. Dutch cocaine (and heroin) 
smokers prefer to prepare the cocaine base themselves, and economic pressure towards 
preprocessed cocaine base is absent. Only under the specific ecological and socio-political 
conditions of the Rotterdam Central Railway Station a preprocessed product, 'cooked cocaine' 
has emerged. Currently, this phenomenon is well contained. However, (local) policy changes 
affecting the availability of cocaine as well as the time and space allocations of drug users --
that is, when they are pressured into the streets--, may result in entrepreneurial adaptations 
towards middle market level distribution of base cocaine (a.k.a. crack). (Ch. 15; R.Q. 3.1)

<li>Cross cultural comparisons of patterns of drug use produce interesting data about the 
influence of the social context of use and drug policy, on the construction of drug problems, 
and about the extent to which these factors impact on the risk for HIV transmission. (Ch. 16; 
R.Q. 3.1)

<li>Whether drug use is controlled or uncontrolled depends on the application of rituals and 
rules, which constrain and regulate use patterns. The nature of these rituals and rules is 
determined by the availability of drugs. A sufficient availability allows for the formation of a 
set of rituals and rules aimed at safe and controlled use. A high life structure provides the 
incentive and the structure to maintain a 'controlled' availability and apply regulating rituals 
and rules. Strict enforcement of drug prohibition has a negative impact on all three factors, 
hampers effective self-regulation processes and induces a survival oriented subculture. (Ch. 
17 and 18; R.Q. 1.7, 1.8, 1.9 and 3.1)

<li>The Dutch normalization policy is in need of revitalization. The leading policy incentive 
should be shifted from containment of problematic drug use and management of drug related 
problems, towards actively influencing the nature of drug use and directing drug using 
cultures towards less harmful patterns of use. This new policy must allow for a controlled 
availability of drugs through a wider application of the expediency principle; by way of 
culturally sensitive intervention studies stimulate the formation of safe use norms; and adapt 
the existing service system to make it more responsive to the needs of consumers, change the 
belief systems of current problematic drug users so as to instill a sense of entitlement and 
belonging to the community at large, and, by so doing, induce the concrete quality of life 
improvements by which they can improve their own life structure. (Ch. 18; R.Q. 3.2 and 3.3)

<li>Future drug use research in the Netherlands should concentrate on the factors that 
determine self-regulation processes. Developing and evaluating effective community based 
interventions to curb the spread of HIV constitutes an equally important research priority. 
(Ch. 18; R.Q. 3.3)

<li>The preponderant influence (drug) availability plays in the daily lives of the study 
participants is perhaps the most conspicuous and consistent finding of this study. (all 
chapters; R.Q. 1.2, 1.3, 1.8, 1.9, 2.3, 2.4 and 3.1)

In order to understand fully the purpose and scope of this particular part of the survey conducted by the 
Mayor's Committee on Marihuana, a brief digest of the history of the growth and usage of this drug is 
essential.<p> 
 Indian hemp, from which marihuana (the American synonym for hashish) is obtained, has been known to 
man for more than three thousand years. This plant, although originally indigenous to Central Asia, is now 
found in practically every section of the world, growing either wild or cultivated, legally or illegally.<p> 
 When originally discovered, the use to which this plant was principally put was the conversion of its fiber 
for commerical purposes in the production of cord, twine and textiles. Shortly thereafter its pharmaceutical 
properties were employed in the practice of medicine and surgery. Authoritative proof is available that the 
Chinese found it valuable as an effective anesthetic in surgery as far back as two thousand years. It was not 
until approximately the tenth century that the peoples of Africa and Asia began to use it in a rather 
indiscriminate manner for its intoxicating effects.<p> 
 Very shortly after its usage became popular, this drug engaged the attention of the various African and 
Asian governments, as well as of lay persons interested in medical, religious and sociological problems. 
Some of these very early investigators propounded the theory that physical and mental deterioration was 
the direct result of smoking hashish. Others extolled its benefits, deeming it actually essential to life, and 
urged people to indulge in it.<p> 
 During this early period, the peoples of Europe were aware of the use of hashish in Africa and Asia, and 
considered it a vice particularly common to the peoples of those continents. In the nineteenth century their 
interest was raised to a high pitch because of the fictional reports of the smoking of hashish given by the 
romanticists of that period.<p> 
 These individuals, who had the power of the pen, experimentally indulged in the smoking of hashish, and 
described in an expansive, subjective manner the effects the drug had upon them. A review of the fanciful 
literature reveals that in most instances these writings referred to the authors' experiences with toxic doses. 
Summed up, the conclusions were that hashish could cause psychotic episodes and even death and that 
prolonged use would result in physical and mental deterioration. The exalted position held by these 
romanticists tended to influence the Europeans to accept their conclusions as scientific monographs on the 
subject of hashish, so that the smoking of hashish did not become popular with them. However, in recent 
years there has been a fairly wide participation on the part of Europeans in smoking hashish or marihuana, 
but it is referred to as an American vice. This allows one to infer that whereas the knowledge pertaining to 
this habit was very early recognized in! 
 Eur 
ope, at the present time participation in it is from their point of view the direct result of its introduction into 
Europe not from Africa and Asia, but from America.<p> 
 In America, Indian hemp was planted in the New England colonies, solely for commercial purposes, as 
early as the seventeenth century. At the present time it can be found growing either wild or cultivated, 
legally or illegally, in practically all our states. Lawful cultivation is confined principally to the states of 
Kentucky, Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. It has been estimated that not more than ten thousand acres 
are devoted to its legal production. It is of value commercially in the manufacture of rope, twine, and 
textiles. The seed is used for bird-food, and the oil extracted from the seed is occasionally used as a 
substitute for linseed oil in the prepara tion of artists' paints. A rosin extracted from the plant is used in the 
production of pharmaceutical preparations.<p> 
 Since the history of hemp cultivation in America dates back to the seventeenth century, it is exceedingly 
interesting, but difficult to explain, that the smoking of marihuana did not become a problem in our country 
until approximately twenty years ago, and that it has become an acute problem associated with a great deal 
of publicity only in the past ten years.<p> 
 The origin of the word "marihuana" is in doubt. Some authorities are of the opinion that it is derived 
from the Portuguese word "mariguano," meaning intoxicant. Others are of the opinion that it has its 
derivation in the Mexican words for "Mary and Jane." The introduction into the United States of the 
practice of smoking marihuana has been the subject of a great deal of speculation. The most tenable 
hypothesis at the present time is that it was introduced by Mexicans entering our country.<p> 
 It is accepted that in Mexico marihuana smoking is an old, established practice. Therefore, it would 
appear logical to assume that Mexican laborers crossing our border into the Southwest carried this practice 
with them. Having used marihuana in their native land, they found it natural to continue smoking it in the 
new country, and planted it for personal consumption. Once available, it was soon made use of by our 
citizens. At the present time, the smoking of marihuana is widespread in this nation.<p> 
 Believing that marihuana smoking might be deleterious, and knowing it to be widespread, federal and 
municipal governments, private individuals, and such agencies as the Opium Advisory Association, the 
International Narcotic Education Association, and others investigated the subject. These investigative 
organizations have contributed a great deal of data and pertinent information to the knowledge of the use of 
marihuana.<p> 
 The mass of information so obtained when untangled can be summed up with the general statement that a 
majority of investigators are of the opinion that marihuana smoking is deleterious, although a minority 
maintain that it is innocuous. The majority believe that marihuana smoking is widespread among school 
children; that the dispensers of the drug are organized to such an extent that they encourage the use of 
marihuana in order to create an ever- increasing market; that juvenile delinquency is directly related to the 
effects of the drug; that it is a causative factor in a large percentage of our major crimes and sexual 
offenses; and that physical and mental deterioration are the direct result of the prolonged habit of smoking 
marihuana.<p> 
 As a result of these official and semi-official conclusions in regard to the disastrous effects produced by 
this habit, the newspapers and magazines of our country have given it wide publicity. At this point it may 
be profitable to give the conclusions of some of the investigators and quote the publicity associated with 
it.<p> 
 In a pamphlet <em>"Marihuana or Indian Hemp and Its Preparations"</em> issued by the International 
Narcotic Education Association, one finds:<p> 
 
<blockquote> 
Marihuana is a most virile and powerful stimulant. The physiological effect of this drug produces a 
peculiar psychic exaltation and derangement of the central nervous system. The stage of exaltation and 
confusion, more marked in some addicts than in others, is generally followed by a stage of depression.<p> 
 Sometimes the subject passes into a semi-conscious state, experiencing vivid and extravagant dreams 
which vary according to the individual character and mentality. In some the stage is one of self-satisfaction 
and well-being. In others, it is alarming, presenting the fear of some imminent and indefinite danger or of 
impending death. Later the dreams are sometimes followed by a state of complete unconsciousness. 
Sometimes convulsive attacks and acute mania are developed.<p> 
 The narcotic content in marihuana decreases the rate of heart beat and causes irregularity of the pulse. 
Death may result from the effect upon the heart. 
 Prolonged use of marihuana frequently develops a delirious rage which sometimes leads to high crimes, 
such as assault and murder. Hence marihuana has been called the "killer drug." The habitual use of this 
narcotic poison always causes a very marked mental deterioration and sometimes produces insanity. Hence 
marihuana is frequently called "loco weed." (Loco is the Spanish word for crazy.)<p> 
 While the marihuana habit leads to physical wreckage and mental decay, its effects upon character and 
morality are even more devastating. The victim frequently undergoes such degeneracy that he will lie and 
steal without scruple; he becomes utterly untrustworthy and often drifts into the underworld where, with 
his degenerate companions, he commits high crimes and misdemeanors. Marihuana sometimes gives man 
the lust to kill unreasonably and without motive. Many cases of assault, rape, robbery, and murder are 
traced to the use of maribuana.<a name="back1"><a href="laguard7.html#inea">[1]</a><p> 
</blockquote> 
 
 In an article published in the New York Daily Worker, New York, Saturday, December 28, 1940, there 
appeared under the column headed <em>"HEALTH ADVICE":</em><p> 
 
<blockquote> 
A DRUG AND INSANITY.<br> 
 Bill Wilson was strolling by his favorite soda joint on the way home from high school when he heard a 
familiar voice whisper loudly, "Hey, Bill, c'mere." Behind the Texaco billboard, he found his side-kick 
Jim, who said excitedly, "I got some reefers!" "Reefers, what're they?" Mysteriously, Jim reached into his 
pocket and pulled out two large cigarettes. "Marihuana!" Jim's pupils dilated. "Come on over to the club 
and we'll smoke 'em. Boy, that's fun!"<p> 
 Bill is only one of thousands of new marihuana smokers created yearly among boys and girls of high 
school age. What is this drug? It is a narcotic in the same class as opium and is derived from a plant, which 
grows wild, extensively in some parts. For this reason, it is hard to control and the drug is easy to obtain at 
very little cost.<p> 
 Smoking of the weed is habit-forming. It destroys the willpower, releases restraints, and promotes insane 
reactions. Continued use causes the face to become bloated, the eyes bloodshot, the limbs weak and 
trembling, and the mind sinks into insanity. Robberies, thrill murders, sex crimes and other offenses 
result.<p> 
 When the habit is first started, the symptoms are milder, yet powerful enough. The smoker loses all sense 
of time and space so that he can't judge distances, he loses his self-control, and his imagination receives 
considerable stimulation.<p> 
 The habit can be cured only by the most severe methods. The addict must be put into an institution, 
where the drug is gradually withdrawn, his general health is built up, and he is kept there until he has 
enough willpower to withstand the temptation to again take to the weed.<p> 
 The spread of this terrible fad can be stopped only when the unscrupulous criminals trafficking In the 
drug are rooted out. 
</blockquote><p> 
 
 Dr. Robert P. Walton, Professor of Pharmacology of the School of Medicine of the University of 
Mississippi, has written a most comprehensive book on the subject of marihuana, embodying in detail 
pharmacological and social studies.<a name="back2"><a href="laguard7.html#note2">[2]</a> A chapter 
on the <em>"Present Status of the Marihuana Vice in the United States"</em> was prepared by Dr. Frank 
R. Gomila, Commissioner of Public Safety of New Orleans, and C. G. Lambou, Assistant City Chemist. 
They refer to New Orleans as being possibly the first large city in the United States where the drug habit 
became widely established among the native population, and they therefore believe that the authorities in 
this city had a decided opportunity to observe the progress of the smoking of marihuana as a social 
problem. Referring specifically to the use of marihuana among school children, they state that reporters in 
New Orleans not only heard about but observed large numbers of boys of ! 
school age actually buying and smoking marihuana cigarettes. One peddler was so brazen as to keep his 
stock under the street stairs to a girls' high school.<p> 
 Inquiries further revealed that school children of forty-four schools in New Orleans (only a few of these 
were high schools) smoked marihuana. As a result of exposure and widespread agitation,<p> 
 
<blockquote> 
Verifications came in by the hundreds from harassed parents, teachers, neighborhood pastors, priests, 
welfare workers and club women. Warrington House for boys was full of children who had become 
habituated to the use of cannabis. The superintendent of the Children's Bureau reported that there were 
many problem children there who had come under the influence and two who had run away because they 
couldn't get their "muggles" at the Bureau. The Director of Kingsley House for boys received many pleas 
from fathers of boys who had come under the influence and were charged with petty crimes. After 
personally seeing these boys in an hysterical condition or on the well-known "laughing jags," the director 
termed the situation decidedly grave. The Waif's Home, at this time, was reputedly full of children, both 
white and colored, who had been brought in under the influence of the drug. Marihuana cigarettes could be 
bought almost as readily as sandwiches. Their cost was two for a quarter.! 
 The 
 children solved the problem of cost by pooling pennies among the members of a group and then passing 
the cigarettes from one to another, all the puffs being carefully counted....<p> 
 The result of these investigations ended in a wholesale arrest of more than 150 persons. Approximately 
one hundred underworld dives, soft-drink establishments, night clubs, grocery stores, and private homes 
were searched in the police raid. Addicts, hardened criminals, gangsters, women of the streets sailors of all 
nationalities, bootleggers, boys and girls-many flashily dressed in silks and furs, others in working clothes- 
all were rounded up in the net which Captain Smith and his squad had set.<p> 
 . . . Notwithstanding the thoroughness with which this police roundup was carried out, it did not entirely 
eradicate in one stroke a vice which had already become so well established. During the next few years 
New Orleans experienced a crime wave which unquestionably was greatly aggravated by the influence of 
this drug habit. Payroll and bank guards were doubled, but this did not prevent some of the most 
spectacular holdups in the history of the city. Youngsters known to be "muggle-heads" fortified themselves 
with the narcotic and proceeded to shoot down police, bank clerks and casual bystanders. Mr. Eugene 
Stanley, at that time District Attorney, declared that many of the crimes in New Orleans and the South were 
thus committed by criminals who relied on the drug to give them a false courage and freedom from 
restraint. Dr. George Roeling, Coroner, reported that of 450 prisoners investigated, 125 were confirmed 
users of marihuana. Dr. W. B. Graham, State Narcotic Officer, de! 
clar 
ed in 1936 that 60 per cent of the crimes committed in New Orleans were by marihuana users.<a 
name="back3"><a href="laguard7.html#note3">[3]</a> 
</blockquote><p> 
 
 The Mayor's Committee on Marihuana decided to confine its investigations to a limited area. For a 
number of reasons the Borough of Manhattan seemed to be the most profitable section of the city in which 
to concentrate. In order to crystallize our particular project we deemed it advisable to direct our efforts to 
finding answers to the following questions:<p> 
<ol> 
<li>To what extent is marihuana used? 
<li>What is the method of retail distribution? 
<li>What is the general attitude of the marihuana smoker toward society and 
 toward the use of the drug? 
<li>What is the relationship between marihuana and eroticism? 
<li>What is the relationship between marihuana and crime? 
<li>What is the relationship between marihuana and juvenile delinquency? 
</ol> 
 In the course of our investigations, we have made extensive use of subjective data obtained from those 
who were actual smokers of marihuana and directly acquainted with its effects and those who were not 
smokers, but, because of residence, occupation or other interests, were acquainted with the general 
subject.<p>

 In October 1939 Police Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine designated Deputy Chief Inspector Daniel 
Curtayne, Lieutenant Edward Cooper, Sergeant Bernard Boylan and Detective Joseph Loures of the 
Narcotic Squad of the Police Department of the City of New York to cooperate with the Mayor's 
Committee on Marihuana. These police officials submitted a list of intelligent young officers with a 
suitable background. From this list six officers were selected: two policewomen, and four policemen, one 
of whom was a Negro. They were: Mr. James Coen, Mr. William Connolly, Mr. Benjamin Weissner, Mr. 
John Hughes, Miss Adelaide Knowles and Miss Olive Cregan. These police officers were encouraged to 
read literature on the subject of marihuana and to familiarize themselves with some of the characteristics of 
the plant, as well as of marihuana cigarettes. They became expert in detecting the aroma of burning 
marihuana, and were thus able to recognize it and to identify its use in a social gathering! 
.<p> 
 Regular assignments were made by the director of the survey. At intervals each officer dictated a general 
report on his activities and findings to a stenographer engaged by the Committee. Frequent conferences 
were held in the office of the director of the survey, at which time individual reports were discussed in 
detail and evaluated. An attempt was made to give the "marihuana squad" a psychological approach to the 
performance of their duties.<p> 
 At no time were these officers permitted to make known their activity to other members of the police 
force, or to make arrests. This arrangement was considered essential in order that they might maintain an 
effective role of investigator without being in any respect recognized as police officers. Although they 
were members of the police force and constantly in contact with violators of law, their immediate superiors 
cooperated to an extreme degree by allowing the "marihuana squad" to report directly to the director of the 
survey.<p> 
 While on duty the squad actually "lived" in the environment in which marihuana smoking or peddling 
was suspected. They frequented poolrooms, bars and grills, dime-a-dance halls, other dance halls to which 
they took their own partners, theatres-backstage and in the audience-roller-skating rinks, subways, public 
toilets, parks and docks They consorted with the habitues of these places, chance acquaintances on the 
street, loiterers around schools, subways and bus terminals. They posed as "suckers" from out of town and 
as students in colleges and high schools.<p> 
 We highly commend these officers individually for their exceptionally good performances. The aid given 
by Deputy Chief Inspector Daniel Curtayne, Lieutenant Edward Cooper, Sergeant Bernard Boylan and 
Detective Joseph Loures throughout deserves mention and appreciation. At times we must have been a 
source of annoyance to them, but our requests were always cheerfully met and assistance heartily 
extended.<p> 
 
<a name="meth"><strong>Method of Retail Distribution</strong></a><br> 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 
 In general, marihuana is used in the form of a cigarette. Occasionally some individuals chew the "weed" 
and seem to get the same effect as do others through smoking. The common names for the cigarettes are: 
muggles, reefers, Indian hemp, weed, tea, gage and sticks. Cigarettes made of marihuana differ in size as 
do cigarettes made of tobacco: they are long, short, thick or thin.<p> 
 The price varies in accordance with the accepted opinion as to the potency of the marihuana used in the 
cigarettes, and this appears to be determined by the place of origin. The cheapest brand is known as "sass-
fras," and retails for approximately three for 50 cents. It is made of the marihuana that is grown in the 
United States. Smokers do not consider such marihuana very potent. They have found that they must 
consume a greater number of cigarettes in order to obtain the desired effect colloquially termed as "high." 
This opinion, expressed by smokers in the Borough of Manhattan, is at variance with that of some 
authorities who believe that marihuana grown in the United States is as potent as the marihuana grown in 
other countries.<p> 
 The "panatella" cigarette, occasionally referred to as "meserole," is considered to be more potent than the 
"sass-fras" and usually retails for approximately 25 cents each. The hemp from which the "panatella" is 
made comes from Central and South America.<p> 
 "Gungeon" is considered by the marihuana smoker as the highest grade of marihuana. It retails for about 
one dollar per cigarette. The "kick" resulting from the use of this cigarette is reached more quickly than 
from the use of "sassafras" or "panatella." It appears to be the consensus that the marihuana used to make 
the "gungeon" comes from Africa. The sale of this cigarette is restricted to a clientele whose economic 
status is of a higher level than the majority of marihuana smokers.<p> 
 A confirmed marihuana user can readily distinguish the quality and potency of various brands, just as the 
habitual cigarette or cigar smoker is able to differentiate between the qualities of tobacco. Foreign-made 
cigarette paper is often used in order to convince the buyer that the "tea is right from the boat."<p> 
 There are two channels for the distribution of marihuana cigarettes-the independent peddler and the "tea-
pad." From general observations, conversations with "pad" owners, and discussions with peddlers, the 
investigators estimated that there were about 500 "tea-pads" in Harlem and at least 500 peddlers.<p> 
 A "tea-pad" is a room or an apartment in which people gather to smoke marihuana. The majority of such 
places are located in the Harlem district. It is our impression that the landlord, the agent, the superintendent 
or the janitor is aware of the purposes for which the premises are rented.<p> 
 The "tea-pad" is furnished according to the clientele it expects to serve. Usually, each "tea-pad" has 
comfortable furniture, a radio, victrola or, as in most instances, a rented nickelodeon. The lighting is more 
or less uniformly dim, with blue predominating. An incense is considered part of the furnishings. The walls 
are frequently decorated with pictures of nude subjects suggestive of perverted sexual practices. The 
furnishings, as described, are believed to be essential as a setting for those participating in smoking 
marihuana.<p> 
 Most "tea-pads" have their trade restricted to the sale of marihuana. Some places did sell marihuana and 
whisky, and a few places also served as houses of prostitution. Only one "teapad" was found which served 
as a house of prostitution, and in which one could buy marihuana, whisky, and opium.<p> 
 The marihuana smoker derives greater satisfaction if he is smoking in the presence of others. His attitude 
in the "tea-pad" is that of a relaxed individual, free from the anxieties and cares of the realities of life. The 
"tea-pad" takes on the atmosphere of a very congenial social club. The smoker readily engages in 
conversation with strangers, discussing freely his pleasant reactions to the drug and philosophizing on 
subjects pertaining to life in a manner which, at times, appears to be out of keeping with his intellectual 
level. A constant observation was the extreme willingness to share and puff on each other's cigarettes. A 
boisterous, rowdy atmosphere did not prevail and on the rare occasions when there appeared signs 
indicative of a belligerent attitude on the part of a smoker, he was ejected or forced to become more 
tolerant and quiescent. One of the most interesting setups of a "tea-pad," which was clearly not along 
orthodox lines from the business point of view, wa! 
s a series of pup tents arranged on a roof-top in Harlem. Those present proceeded to smoke their cigarettes 
in the tents. When the desired effect of the drug had been obtained they all merged into the open and 
engaged in a discussion of their admiration of the stars and the beauties of nature.<p> 
 Because of the possibility of spreading disease, note should be taken of what seems to be a custom 
known as "pick-up" smoking. It is an established practice whereby a marihuana cigarette is lit and after one 
or two inhalations is passed on to the next person. This procedure is repeated until all present have had an 
opportunity to take a puff or two on the cigarette.<p> 
 Occasionally a "tea-pad" owner may have peddlers who sell their wares in other localities and at the same 
time serve as procurers for those who wish to smoke marihuana on the premises.<p> 
 One also finds other methods of retail distribution. After proper introduction, one may be able to 
purchase the cigarette in certain places. This is not an easy procedure, but it can be accomplished. In some 
bar-and-grills, restaurants, and bars our investigators were able to establish contact with someone who in 
turn, would introduce them to a peddler who apparently made regular rounds of these places in order to sell 
cigarettes. It appears that the owners of such places are not aware of this practice, and in many instances 
they would discharge any employee known to be directly or indirectly associated with the sale of 
marihuana.<p> 
 On rare occasions public guides, if properly approached would refer one to a place where the "reefer" 
could be bought. There was no evidence that the guide received money when acting as go-between. 
Terminal porters, mainly Negroes, appeared to be more directly connected with the traffic of marihuana. 
They were more conversant with the subject and it was easier for them to establish contact between 
purchaser and peddler.<p> 
 Marihuana smoking is very common in the theatres of Harlem according to the observations of the 
investigators. We have reason to believe that in some instances, perhaps few in number, employees actually 
sold cigarettes on the premises. In the Harlem dance halls smoking was frequently observed either in the 
lavatories or on the main floor. The patrons as well as the musicians were seen in the act of smoking. There 
was no evidence of sales being made by employees on the premises, or that there was any gain on the part 
of the owners or employees in permitting this practice. Whereas the smoking of marihuana was not 
encouraged, nothing was done to prohibit such practice.<p> 
 There are specific sections in the Borough of Manhattan where the sale of marihuana cigarettes appears 
to be localized: 1) the Harlem district; 2) the Broadway area, a little east and west of Broadway and 
extending from 42nd Street to S9th Street. While it is true that one may buy the cigarette in other districts, 
it is not as easily obtainable as in the two localities mentioned.<p> 
 
 
<a name="ment"><strong>The Mental Attitude of the Marihuana Smoker Toward Society and 
Marihuana</strong></a><br> 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 
 Most of the smokers of marihuana coming within the scope of our survey were unemployed, and of the 
others most had part-time employment.<p> 
 Occasional, as well as confirmed, users were all aware of the laws pertaining to the illegal use of the 
drug. They did not indulge in its use with a spirit of braggadocio or as a challenge to law as has been 
reported by some investigators in other districts. They did not express remorse concerning their use of 
marihuana, nor did they blame this habit as a causative factor in the production of special difficulties in 
their personal lives. Except for musicians there appeared to be no attempt at secretiveness on the part of the 
habitual smoker. This attitude is in marked contrast to that usually taken by those addicted to morphine, 
cocaine, or heroin.<p> 
 The consensus of marihuana users is that the drug is not harmful and that infrequent or constant use of 
marihuana does not result in physical or mental deterioration.<p> 
 In describing the most common reaction to the drug they always stated that it made them feel "high." 
Elaboration of just what the smoker meant by "high" varied with the individual. However, there was 
common agreement that a feeling of adequacy and efficiency was induced by the use of marihuana and that 
current mental conflicts were allayed. Organic illness was not given as a cause for smoking "reefers."<p> 
 A person may be a confirmed smoker for a prolonged period, and give up the drug voluntarily without 
experiencing any craving for it or exhibiting withdrawal symptoms. He may, at some time later on, go back 
to its use. Others may remain infrequent users of the cigarette, taking one or two a week, or only when the 
"social setting" calls for participation. From time to time we had one of our investigators associate with a 
marihuana user. The investigator would bring up the subject of smoking. This would invariably lead to the 
suggestion that they obtain some marihuana cigarettes. They would seek a "tea-pad," and if it was closed 
the smoker and our investigator would calmly resume their previous activity, such as the discussion of life 
in general or the playing of pool. There were apparently no signs indicative of frustration in the smoker at 
not being able to gratify the desire for the drug. We consider this point highly significant since it is so 
contrary to the experience of! 
 use 
rs of other narcotics. A similar situation occurring in one addicted to the use of morphine, cocaine, or 
heroin would result in a compulsive attitude on the part of the addict to obtain the drug. If unable to secure 
it, there would be obvious physical and mental manifestations of frustration. This may be considered 
presumptive evidence that there is no true addiction in the medical sense associated with the use of 
marihuana.<p> 
 The confirmed marihuana smoker consumes perhaps from six to ten cigarettes per day. He appears to be 
quite conscious of the quantity he requires to reach the effect called "high." Once the desired effect is 
obtained he cannot be persuaded to consume more. He knows when he has had enough. The smoker 
determines for himself the point of being "high," and is ever conscious of preventing himself from 
becoming "too high." This fear of being "too high" must be associated with some form of anxiety which 
causes the smoker, should he accidentally reach that point, immediately to institute measures so that he can 
"come down." It has been found that the use of such beverages as beer, or a sweet soda pop, is an effective 
measure. Smokers insist that "it does something to the stomach" and that it is always associated with 
"belching." A cold shower will also have the effect of bringing the person "down."<p> 
 Smokers have repeatedly stated that the consumption of whisky while smoking negates the potency of 
the drug. They find it is very difficult to get "high" while drinking whisky, and because of that smokers 
will not drink whisky while using the "weed." They do, however, consume large quantities of sweet wines. 
It is their contention that this mild alcoholic beverage aids the drug in producing the desired effect. Most 
marihuana smokers insist that the appetite is increased as the result of smoking.<p> 
 We have been unable to confirm the opinion expressed by some investigators that marihuana smoking is 
the first step in the use of such drugs as cocaine, morphine, and heroin. The instances are extremely rare 
where the habit of marihuana smoking is associated with addiction to these other narcotics.<p> 
 
<a name="mar"><strong>Marihuana and Eroticism</strong></a><br> 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 In the popular agitation against the use of marihuana, its erotic effects have been stressed repeatedly. As 
previously stated in this report, our investigators visited many "tea-pads" in the Borough of Manhattan. It is 
true that lewd pictures decorated the walls but they did not find that they were attracting attention or 
comment among the clientele. In fact one of the investigators who was concentrating his attention on the 
relation between marihuana and eroticism stated in his report that he found himself embarrassed in that he 
was the only one who examined the pictures on the wall.<p> 
 Numerous conversations with smokers of marihuana revealed only occasional instances in which there 
was any relation between the drug and eroticism. At one time one of our investigators attended a very 
intimate social gathering in an apartment in Harlem, having succeeded in securing the position of doorman 
for the occasion. There was a great deal of drinking, and the dancing was of the most modern, abandoned, 
"jitter-bug" type. This form of dancing is highly suggestive and appears to be associated with erotic 
activity. The investigator made careful observation of those who were dancing, and found that there was no 
difference between the ones who were and the ones who were not smoking "reefers." Similar impressions 
were received after careful observations in public dance halls, places where they knew that some persons 
were under the influence of marihuana.<p> 
 Visits to brothels which occasionally also served as "teapads" revealed that the use of marihuana was not 
linked to sexuality. These observations allow us to come to the conclusion that in the main marihuana was 
not used for direct sexual stimulation.<p> 
 
<a name="crime"><strong>Crime</strong></a><br> 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 One of the most important causes of the widespread publicity which marihuana smoking has received is 
the belief that this practice is directly responsible for the commission of crimes.<p> 
 During our investigation many law enforcement officers, representing various federal, state and local 
police bureaus, were interviewed and asked for a confidential expression of opinion on the general question 
of crime and marihuana. In most instances they unhesitatingly stated that there is no proof that major 
crimes are associated with the practice of smoking marihuana. They did state that many marihuana smokers 
are guilty of petty crimes, but that the criminal career usually existed prior to the time the individual 
smoked his first marihuana cigarette. These officers further stated that a criminal generally termed as a 
"real" or "professional" criminal will not associate with marihuana smokers. He considers such a person 
inferior and unreliable and will not allow him to participate in the commission of a major crime.<p> 
 In the period beginning October 1939 and ending November 1940, the Police Department made 167 
arrests for the possession and use of marihuana. Classified according to race they were: white, 33 men, 4 
women; Latin-American, 26 men, 2 women; Negro, 83 men, 6 women; Latin-American (colored) 9 men, 1 
woman- British East Indies 1, Filipino 1, Chinese 1. Classified according to age, 12 per cent were between 
the ages of 16 and 20, 58 per cent between the ages of 21 and 30, 24 per cent between the ages of 31 and 
40, and 6 per cent between the ages of 41 and 50. 
 During the period under discussion, the Police Department confiscated approximately 3,000 pounds of 
marihuana.<p> 
 The sale and use of marihuana is a problem engaging the vigilance of the New York Police Department. 
However, the number of officers available for such duty is limited. Officers specifically assigned to the 
Narcotics Division of the Police Department are acquainted with the problem, but the majority of the 
officers are fundamentally without authoritative knowledge regarding this subject.<p> 
 The relation between marihuana smoking and the commission of crimes of violence in the city of New 
York is described by Dr. Walter Bromberg, psychiatrist-in-charge of the Psychiatric Clinic of the Court of 
General Sessions, in an article published in the <em>Journal of the American Medical 
Association:</em><p> 
 
<blockquote> 
In the south of this country (New Orleans) the incidence of marihuana addicts among major criminals is 
admittedly high. Sporadic reports from elsewhere in the country of murders and assaults due to marihuana 
appear in the press frequently. It is difficult to evaluate these statements, because of their uncritical nature. 
The bulletin prepared by the Foreign Policy Association lists ten cases "culled at random from the files of 
the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics" of murder and atrocious assault in which marihuana was directly responsible 
for the crime. Among the ten patients, the second, J. O., was described as having confessed how he 
murdered a friend and put his body in a trunk while under the influence of marihuana.<p> 
 J. O. was examined in this clinic; although he was a psychopathic liar and possibly homosexual, there 
was no indication in the examination or history of the use of any drug. The investigation by the probation 
department failed to indicate use of the drug marihuana. The deceased, however, was addicted to 
heroin.<p> 
 Our observations with respect to marihuana and crime were made in the Court of General Sessions over a 
period of five and a half years. The material in that court is limited as to residence to New York County, 
although it must be remembered that the offenders come from many sections of the country and are of 
many racial types. This is important, because the British investigators have noted in India that cannabis 
does not bring out the motor excitement or hysterical symptoms in Anglo-Saxon users that occur in natives. 
There are several other difficulties in collecting reliable material, one being the complete dependence on 
the history and statements of the prisoners without an opportunity for objective tests or other corroborative 
check, as in the case of other drugs, e.g., heroin or morphine. During routine interviews of some 17,OOO 
offenders in six and a half years, several hundred have been found who had direct experience with 
marihuana. Their testimony checks with experi! 
mental results and clinical experiences with regard to the symptoms of intoxication, the absence of true 
addiction, and the negative connection with major crime. Especially is this noteworthy among sexual 
offenders and in cases of assault or murder. The extravagant claims of defense attorneys and the press that 
crime is caused by addiction to marihuana demands careful scrutiny, at least in this jurisdiction....<p> 
 Most of the narcotic cases in New York County are heard in the Court of Special Sessions, where 
misdemeanants are handled and where indictments on charges of the possession of drugs for use are 
returned. In the Court of Special Sessions in the same six-year period, of approximately 75,000 indictments 
for all crimes, 6,000 resulted in convictions for the possession and use of drugs. Since neither the law, the 
district attorney nor the police department makes any distinction between the several kinds of narcotics in 
arraignments or indictments, there were no figures from which to estimate the number of users of 
marihuana as distinguished from the number of users of other drugs. A system of sampling the 6,000 cases 
was therefore adopted in order to furnish an approximate estimate of the total number of marihuana users 
who came into conflict with the law.<p> 
 In this sampling the records of 1,500 offenders, or 25 per cent of the 6,000, were examined. Of these, 135 
were charged in connection with marihuana. From this fact it was estimated that about 540 offenders, or 9 
per cent of all drug offenders coming to the Court of Special Sessions in six years, were users of 
marihuana. In analyzing this sample of 135 cases, it was found that 93 offenders had no previous record, 
the previous charges or charges of 8 concerned only drugs, 5 had records including drug charges and 29 
had records not inctuding drug charges. Among those with longer records, that is, from four to seven 
previous arrests, none showed progression from the use of drugs to other crimes.<p> 
 As measured by the succession of arrests and convictions in the Court of General Sessions (the only 
method of estimation) it can be said that drugs generally do not initiate criminal careers. Similarly, in the 
Court of Special Sessions, only 8 per cent of the offenders had previous charges of using drugs and 3.7 per 
cent had previous charges of drugs and other petty crimes. In the vast majority of cases in this group of 
135, then, the earlier use of marihuana apparently did not predispose to crime, even that of using other 
drugs. Whether the first offenders charged with the use of marihuana go on to major crime is a matter of 
speculation. The expectancy of major crimes following the use of cannabis in New York County is small, 
according to these experiences.<a name="back4"><a href="laguard7.html#note4">[4]</a>

<a name="marih"><strong>Marihuana and School Children</strong></a><br> 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 
 One of the most serious accusations leveled against marihuana by special feature writers has been that it 
is widely used by the school children of this nation. These authors have daimed that it has so detrimental an 
effect on development that it is a major factor in juvenile delinquency. This phase of the marihuana 
problem was deemed serious enough to merit primary consideration in our study of the marihuana problem 
in New York City-specifically in the Borough of Manhattan. We decided to attack this aspect of the 
problem along the following lines: 
<ol> 
<li>To observe schools in order to see if pupils bought marihuana cigarettes from any peddlers operating in 
the neighborhood. 
<li>To investigate thoroughly complaints made by parents to school and police authorities relative to 
marihuana and its use by school children. 
<li>To interview principals, assistant principals, and teachers of many of the schools in New York City 
with reference to our project. 
<li>To gather relevant statistics from various city bureaus and private agencies. 
</ol> 
 
 Unknown to the school authorities, our investigators had under surveillance many of the schools in the 
Borough of Manhattan. They would observe a particular school for a number of consecutive days, watch 
loiterers and suspicious characters in the locality, and, under certain circumstances, follow some of the 
children. This procedure was repeated at varying intervals in different localities. From time to time the 
investigators would return to some of the schools which they previously had kept under surveillance. 
Attention was naturally concentrated upon those schools from which emanated the most numerous 
complaints and which were located in suspected neighborhoods. We must admit that it would have been 
possible for such sales to have taken place during the time that our investigators were not on duty, but we 
came to the conclusion that there was no organized traffic on the part of peddlers in selling marihuana 
cigarettes to the children of the schools we observed.<p> 
 Certain of the school authorities deserve special commendation for their alertness in singling out 
suspicious characters loitering in the vicinity of their schools. While investigating one of the suspected 
schools, our investigators who were loitering in the neighborhood were suspected and treated as 
"suspicious characters" by the school authorities.<p> 
 During the period of this survey the Police Department while engaged in an entirely separate criminal 
investigation received a lead indicating the sale of marihuana to children in a certain high school. As a 
result, one pupil was arrested and convicted for selling cigarettes to his classmates.<p> 
 In the Harlem district we discovered a few places where school children gathered during and after school 
hours for the purpose of indulging in smoking ordinary cigarettes, drinking alcoholic beverages, and 
engaging in homosexual and heterosexual activities. One of our investigators, having gained entrance to 
such a place, ostentatiously displayed marihuana cigarettes which he had with him. The madam of the 
place promptly cautioned him against using the "weed" and insisted that at no time did she permit any 
person to smoke it on her premuses.<p> 
 A surprising number of school children smoking ordinary cigarettes were noted. A checkup revealed that 
these cigarettes were being illicitly sold by men on the street and in candy stores in the "loose" form. It is 
possible that this trade in ordinary cigarettes is occasionally misinterpreted as trade in "reefers."<p> 
 Interviews with school authorities were very significant, and it is of value to summarize briefly some of 
the statements actually made by them. The locations of the schools and the names of the persons quoted are 
in our official files. 
<ol> 
<li>High School. Predominantly white. The principal stated, "The school has never had any connection 
with marihuana, not even a rumor." 
<li>High School. Predominantly white. The principal at first appeared to be evasive and did not readily 
volunteer information, but after repeatedly being pressed with the question stated that the school "had not 
had any difficulty with the subject of marihuana." 
<li>High School. Predominantly white. The principal em phatically stated, "I have had no trouble with 
marihuana in my school." 
<li>A vocational school in the Borough of Queens. Mixed. "I have never heard the slightest thing about 
marihuana in connection with this school." 
<li>High School. Queens. Mixed. "We never had the slightest connection with marihuana in any way." 
<li>Junior High School. Harlem. Predominantly Negro and Latin-American. The principal stated that there 
had been a few marihuana cases among the boys about eighteen months ago. His assistant volunteered the 
information that there had been some boys in the school who had "reefers" in their possession. On other 
occasions some of the boys appeared to be intoxicated and when examined confessed to having smoked 
"reefers." He further stated, "It was difficult to be sure if sleepy, perspiring, pallid-looking boys were 
feeling the effects of marihuana or were just recovering from too much 'partying' or drinking." He 
volunteered the opinion that since marihuana was an acute problem among the adult population in that 
particular district, it could be assumed that marihuana could occasionally become a problem in the school. 
<li>Junior High School. White and Latin-American. On the fringe of Harlem. Principal and assistant 
principal stated that they have never had the slightest difficulty arising from marihuana. 
<li>Junior High School. White and Negro. Bordering on Harlem. The principal, because of his short tenure 
of office, was unable to express his opinion on the subject. The chief clerk stated that marihuana had never 
been a problem in the school. She was certain, however, that it was sold in the neighborhood. 
<li>Junior High School. White, with a high percentage of Negro and Latin-American. The principal stated, 
"As yet we have had no contact with marihuana although, considering the neighborhood, it would not be 
unlikely." 
<li>Junior High School. Latin-American, Negro, and some white. The principal stated, "We have had no 
trouble with marihuana." He was of the opinion that because of the locality it would be possible for some 
older boys to smoke it without anybody being cognizant of it. He added that he would let us know if any 
boys were detected smoking. During the period of the survey no such report was made. 
<li>Junior High School. Latin-American predominating. The principal stated that she had not had any 
trouble with marihuana. 
<li>Junior High School. White predominating. The prin cipal stated, "I have had no contact with it." 
However, due to the location of the school, which was near Harlem, she stated she would notify the 
Juvenile Aid Bureau if such a problem arose. During the period of the survey no such report was received. 
<li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that no information concerning the use of any 
narcotics had ever come to his attention and was equally insistent that teachers would have reported any 
such information to him. 
<li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that she had never found anything to indicate the use 
of any drug in the school. 
<li>Junior High School. White and mixed. The principal stated that last year he had suspected that a group 
of chronic truants were using marihuana but he was unable to obtain any direct evidence. 
<li>Junior High School. White. The principal and his assistant stated that they had no real evidence of any 
marihuana problem in the school, and they do not believe that the drug is used to any extent. 
<li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that although she had no tangible evidence of 
marihuana smoking among the students, she has problem groups that gather in premises where she is 
inclined to think that marihuana could be obtained if they wished to get it. She is certain no marihuana is 
used in the school itself. We investigated thoroughly the suggestions made by the principal as to premises 
where marihuana might be sold but we were unable to gather any evidence of its sale. 
<li>Junior High School. White. The acting principal and a teacher in the school who had been there for a 
number of years stated that there had never been any evidence of the use of marihuana or any other drugs 
in the school. 
<li>Junior High School. White. The health director of this school stated that any evidence concerning the 
use of narcotics by pupils would have been called to his attention, but none had been. 
<li>Junior High School. White. The authorities stated that there had been no traces of marihuana smoking. 
<li>Junior High School. White. The authorities stated that there had never been the slightest suggestion of 
marihuana smoking in the school. 
vJunior High School. White. The assistant principal stated that he knew of no marihuana problem in the 
school. 
<li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that because of the publicity given to marihuana 
smoking she had been on the alert to discover indications of its use in her school but had found no evidence 
of marihuana in the school or of anything that would lead her to believe that any one of her students used 
marihuana outside of the school. 
<li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that nothing pertaining to the use of narcotics had been 
reported to him in all the years he had been there. 
<li>High School. Predominantly white. Authorities, including the medical department, stated that no 
student had ever been reported for being under the influence of marihuana. 
<li>High School. Predominantly white. The principal stated, "There is no indication of a marihuana 
problem in the school." 
<li>Grammar School. The principal stated that anonymous letters had been received from time to time 
from pupils in the school in reference to marihuana. One letter was actually signed by a pupil of the school, 
who reported the sale of marihuana in a candy store in the vicinity. The principal with held the name of the 
pupil but requested us to investigate the report. We kept this school, the immediate neighborhood, and all 
candy stores in the vicinity under strict surveillance, but were unable to gather any evidence which would 
indicate that the pupils of this school were obtaining marihuana. 
<li>Junior High School. Negro. Queens. The assistant principal stated that he had never heard anything 
about marihuana being a problem in his school. We had received a complaint about this school and one of 
our investigators had an informal chat with one of the teachers of this school who, because of her interest 
in the school children, appeared to be more conversant than anyone else with general problems at the 
school. She stated that she was certain marihuana was used by some of the students. She elaborated on the 
subject and recalled that a few months prior to the interview she had sent home five students (three 
Negroes and two Italians) whom she had noticed acting "dopey" in the classroom after the noon recess. She 
was not positive they were under the influence of marihuana but was fairly certain that they were under the 
influence of some drug. A student had told her that these boys used "reefers" and, noticing their stupor, she 
had concluded that they were under the influ! 
ence of marihuana. Superficial examination showed her that their condition was not due to drinking whisky 
or any alcoholic beverage. 
 In this school it was not necessary to notify the principal if a student was sent home. The teacher did so 
on her own account, arriving at a diagnosis without informing the principal of the condition. There was no 
doctor or nurse to examine the students. 
<li>Grammar School. Negro. The principal and the social worker attached to this school stated that some 
time prior to the interview they had heard that cigarettes were being sold to children in Harlem. We were 
told of a certain man who was suspected of selling them to the children. The social worker was certain that 
a year before the interview marihuana cigarettes were sold on a certain street in Harlem to school children, 
but she had no knowledge as to whether the condition existed at the time of our investigation. 
 While working on another part of the survey, we interviewed a young Negress, approximately 20 years 
of age, who was a marihuana smoker. She stated that she and another girl started to smoke marihuana 
cigarettes while attending this particular school. 
<li>High School. Mixed, predominantly white. The principal stated that he was positive that there was no 
marihuana problem in his school. 
<li>High School. Predominantly white. A student was arrested for selling marihuana cigarettes to other 
pupils. We kept this school under surveillance after the arrest. Although we heard rumors that the sale of 
marihuana would start again, we were unable to gather any evidence of this. Our investigators attended the 
dance of the graduating class of this school at one of the hotels in the city. The dance was well conducted 
and had a large attendance. There was no evidence of smoking at this affair. The principal was cooperating 
with the Juvenile Aid Bureau of the Police Department in conducting the investigation of the marihuana 
problem in his school. 
<li>High School. White and Negro. Although rumor is widespread that "reefer" smoking is common at this 
school, thorough investigation did not produce evidence of it at the time of our investigation. We did 
obtain information, which we consider authoritative, that in 1935 a man was offered the concession to sell 
marihuana cigarettes to the students of this school. He refused the offer. The principal of this school stated 
that there had never been any trouble as a result of marihuana smoking and he knew of no actual cases. 
<li>High School. White, Negro, and Latin-American. The director of health education, who was 
conversant with the subject, stated that the school had no problem with regard to marihuana smoking on 
the premises but that a Puerto Rican student who lived in Harlem had informed him that he could obtain 
marihuana cigarettes in his locality. 
<li>College. White, some Negroes and Latin-Americans. We did not interview the authorities. Observation 
of the be havior of and conversation with students did not reveal any marihuana problem. 
<li>College. White, some Negroes and Latin-Americans. This college is located near one of the famous 
"tea-pads" of Harlem. Many of the students pass the house regularly. Continued observation did not reveal 
any student attendance. 
<li>Junior High School. Negro. Most of the boys of this school were familiar with the subject of 
marihuana. The pupils of the school are incessant smokers of ordinary cigarettes. We were unable to obtain 
any information which would indicate that they used "reefers." Some students were observed entering a 
house in which there was a "tea-pad," but we never found any of the occupants of this "tea-pad" to be 
pupils of the school. The counselor at the school stated that during the previous term there were suspicions 
regarding the use of marihuana. 
<li>Junior High School. Negro. The principal, who is considered qualified to discuss this subject, stated 
that for the three months prior to the interview there had been no marihuana problem. She ventured the 
opinion that a few cases do arise in the spring and summer. Observation of this school reveals that 
practically every day young boys between the ages of 18 and 20 loitered near the gates of the schoolyard at 
the close of the session. Some of these boys were known to our investigators as "reefer" smokers, and they 
associated with the girls of the school. Two young girls known by our investigators to be "reefer" smokers 
stated that they started to smoke marihuana while at that school. 
<li>High School. White, many Negroes and Latin-Americans. Many students smoked ordinary tobacco 
cigarettes. Numerous complaints and rumors were associated with this school. The principal stated that in 
1934 they had an acute marihuana problem but that at the present time they did not think it existed. They 
are constantly on guard, especially at the beginning of a term, because they get many new students from 
the Harlem district. We are of the opinion that there are definite signs indicating that there is some 
marihuana smoking in the school. 
<li>High School. Negro and white. The principal of this school stated that they did not have a marihuana 
problem. We are certain, however, that this school does to some extent present an acute problem for we 
have observed a few students smoking "reefers" away from the school. We have reason to believe that 
some of them smoke it while at school. The girls attending this high school have a very low moral 
standard. 
</ol> 
 
 On the basis of the above statements and findings, we feel justified in concluding that although 
marihuana smoking may be indulged in by small numbers of students in certain schools of New York City, 
it is apparently not a widespread or large scale practice.<p> 
 In the belief that actual facts concerning the role played by marihuana in the production of juvenile 
delinquency could best be revealed in the records of the Children's Court of New York City, we 
interviewed the proper authorities on this subject. On the basis of the Children's Court records for 1939, 
marihuana is not an important factor in the development of delinquency.<p> 
 
 
<a name="con"><strong>Conclusions</strong></a><br> 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 
 From the foregoing study the following conclusions are drawn: 
<ol> 
<li>Marihuana is used extensively in the Borough of Manhattan but the problem is not as acute as it is 
reported to be in other sections of the United States. 
<li>The introduction of marihuana into this area is recent as compared to other localities. 
<li>The cost of marihuana is low and therefore within the purchasing power of most persons. 
<li>The distribution and use of marihuana is centered in Harlem. 
<li>The majority of marihuana smokers are Negroes and Latin-Americans. 
<li>The consensus among marihuana smokers is that the use of the drug creates a definite feeling of 
adequacy. 
<li>The practice of smoking marihuana does not lead to addiction in the medical sense of the word. 
<li>The sale and distribution of marihuana is not under the control of any single organized group. 
<li>The use of marihuana does not lead to morphine or heroin or cocaine addiction and no effort is made to 
create a market for these narcotics by stimulating the practice of marihuana smoking. 
<li>Marihuana is not the determining factor in the commission of major crimes. 
<li>Marihuana smoking is not widespread among school children. 
vJuvenile delinquency is not associated with the practice of smoking marihuana. 
<li>The publicity concerning the catastrophic effects of marihuana smoking in New York City is 
unfounded.

<H2>THE CLINICAL STUDY</H2> 
 
<P><A NAME="plan"></A><B>PLAN AND SCOPE<BR> 
</B><I><A HREF="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</A></I></P> 
 
<P> Interest in the effects of marihuana on the human subject follows two 
main lines: first, concerning what may be called pleasurable effects which 
account for its widespread use- and second, regarding undesirable effects, 
including those leading to criminal and other antisocial acts.</P> 
 
<P> In his monograph on marihuana, Walton has reviewed at length the literature 
on hashish experience. He has grouped these descriptions as retrospective 
accounts by professional writers and physicians who have taken the drug 
through curiosity or scientific interest, reports by physicians concerning 
patients who have taken excessive doses, and observations by psychiatrists 
on subjects under marihuana influence. In all of these instances a dose 
toxic to the individual had been taken and the effects described correspond 
to psychotic episodes of greater or less degree.</P> 
 
<P> In the literature there are commonly described two basic types of effect, 
one of excitation, psychic exaltation, and inner joyousness, with divorcement 
from the external world; the other a state of anxiety with fear of consequences, 
such as death or insanity. Either one of these types of reaction may be 
experienced alone, but usually both are present during the intoxication. 
They occur in no regular sequence but replace each other in rapid succession. 
The euphoric and anxiety states are generally accompanied by mental confusion, 
a rapid flow of dissociated ideas, and a feeling of prolongation of time 
and spatial distortion. Sexual desires or phantasies may also occur.</P> 
 
<P> The detailed descriptions of the experience vary. Those given by trained 
writers, such as Ludlow and Bayard Taylor, are vivid and dramatic, embodying 
sensual, visual, and auditory illusions-phantasies of overpowering splendor 
and beauty, on the one hand, and intense suffering and horror on the other. 
The authors, familiar with stories of hashish effects and gifted with strong 
imaginative powers, undoubtedly were expectant of much that happened. The 
account given by the eminent Philadelphia physician, H. C. Wood, while 
following the same general pattern, has much less embellishment. He describes 
a feeling of well-being and inner joyousness and buoyancy and the performance 
of antics which he knew to be foolish but was unable to control. He was 
able to recall no illusions or hallucinations. Later a state of anxiety 
came on, developing into an overpowering fear of death.</P> 
 
<P> A number of studies by psychiatrists on selected subjects have been 
reported. An excellent example is that of Kant and Krapf. Each acted as 
subject for the other and the effects of marihuana are described and analyzed 
at length. In general, the objective in such studies is the interpretation 
of the reactions in terms of disturbances in psychological processes and 
functionings.</P> 
 
<P> The descriptions referred to have been given by persons of a higher 
social class, well educated and accustomed by training to act in conformity 
with conventional social behavior. Although a state of irritability may 
occur and threats of suicide be made by individuals of this type under 
toxic doses of marihuana, it is noteworthy that in none of the descriptions 
is there found an expression of antagonism or antisocial behavior which 
led to acts of violence or what would be called criminal conduct.</P> 
 
<P> Of more direct interest are the publications of Walter Bromberg, psychiatrist, 
Bellevue Hospital, Psychiatrist-in-Charge, Psychiatric Clinic, Court of 
General Sessions of New York County. Marihuana users who are brought before 
the court or admitted to the hospital come under his observation and he 
has reported at length on the psychiatric observations of 29 of these who 
showed psychotic reactions. He describes two types of reactions, one an 
acute marihuana intoxication with a psychotic syndrome, the other a toxic 
psychosis. Acute intoxication occurs in any individual if the marihuana 
is taken in sufficiently large doses. It comes on promptly and passes off 
some hours later. In marihuana psychosis, the symptoms are much more severe 
and of longer duration. He describes a number of cases in which the psychotic 
state continued for a number of days and required hospitalization.</P> 
 
<P> The toxic psychosis seen in marihuana users occurs at any time and 
is of indefinite duration. Bromberg states that the relationship between 
cannabis and the onset of a functional psychotic state is not always clear. 
The personality factor is of undoubted importance and other toxic agents, 
such as alcohol and other drugs, as well as endogenous elements, may be 
involved. The symptoms, except for the longer duration, resemble those 
observed in persons under marihuana intoxication, but often take on the 
characteristics seen in schizophrenic or manic- depressive psychosis.</P> 
 
<P> A description of 11 cases admitted to Bellevue Hospital is given for 
illustration. The marihuana was taken in the form of cigarettes. In this 
group were 5 Negroes, 2 of whom were women, 1 Puerto Rican, and 5 whites, 
one of whom was a Mexican and another a boy of 16. Except for one of the 
whites, a homosexual, they were all of a low intellectual and social order. 
One of the Negroes was arrested for following women in Central Park. The 
others were admitted at their own request, or were sent in by the police 
or family. Three of the group had definite sexual stimulation but in none 
was there an outburst in the form of an attack on women. The Puerto Rican 
became confused and excited and began chasing people with an ice pick. 
Shortly after his discharge he was readmitted to the hospital, was diagnosed 
as definitely psychotic, and was transferred to a state hospital as a schizophrenic. 
The majority of the group, 8 in fact, had psychopathic personalities and 
3 of these were transfe! rred to state institutions for further care. The 
group as a whole is representative of those who come into the hands of 
the police because of abnormal conduct and who are the source of the sensational 
newspaper and magazine stories.</P> 
 
<P> Bromberg's findings concerning the lack of a positive relationship 
between marihuana and crime are described in the sociological section of 
this study.</P> 
 
<P> In marihuana literature, the action of the drug is usually described 
from retrospective observation of the effects on a single individual. Relationship 
to varying dosage, to the subject's personality and background, to environmental 
conditions when the drug was taken, is given little if any attention. It 
is the lack of information concerning these and other factors involved 
in marihuana reaction which has given rise to the present confusion regarding 
its effects.</P> 
 
<P> The clinical study here described was designed to afford information 
not found in marihuana literature but necessary for any comprehensive view 
of marihuana action. For obtaining this information there were these requisites: 
an adequate number of subjects for the study, a clear understanding of 
the mental and physical make-up of each subject, a uniformity of environmental 
factors, accurately graded dosage of marihuana, and standardized methods 
of obtaining and recording marihuana effects. In addition to defining the 
usual and unusual effects of marihuana, as shown by subjective and objective 
symptoms and alterations in behavior and in physical reaction, the study 
was expected to answer questions which must arise in consideration of the 
problem as a whole. Of special importance are these: Do marihuana users 
show fundamental traits differentiating them from non-users? Do users present 
evidence of psychological or physical damage directly attributable to the 
drug? What are the! pleasurable effects which account for the widespread 
usage of marihuana? To what extent does it lead to antisocial or dangerous 
behavior?</P>

<P> The clinical studies were carried out at the Welfare Hospital (1) a 
New York City hospital for chronic diseases on Welfare Island. The quarters 
assigned to the study consisted of a ward of eight beds for the group to 
be studied at any one period, an adjoining ward of two beds for the study 
of individuals of the group, three additional rooms with equipment for 
special examinations, and a diet kitchen for the preparation of the subjects' 
meals.</P> 
 
<P> Four female nurses were employed and the subjects in the larger ward 
were under constant supervision. In addition to routine records, each nurse 
reported the behavior of the subjects while she was on duty. Guards were 
assigned from the Department of Correction and the New York City Police 
Force for the subjects drawn from the Riker's and Hart Island penitentiaries 
and the House of Detention for Women.</P> 
 
<P> The facilities of the Third Medical Division laboratory were used for 
general clinical laboratory examinations and for more detailed study of 
organ functioning. For measurement of psychological reactions, special 
apparatus was provided. A description of equipment used for each division 
of the study is given under its proper section. (1) Now named the Goldwater 
Memorial Hospital.</P> 
 
<P><A NAME="sub"></A><B>Subjects Selected for the Study<BR> 
</B><I><A HREF="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</A></I></P> 
 
<P> For the purpose of establishing a uniform plan of procedure to be followed 
throughout the study, a test group of 5 individuals who had had no previous 
experience with marihuana was selected. These were volunteers who were 
paid for their services. They were of a low socio- economic level, but 
classified as of better than average intelligence. Only one of the group 
came within the range of what is considered normal personality. They represented 
the type of person who would readily take to marihuana were the opportunity 
offered.</P> 
 
<P> The main group, 72 subjects, was drawn from the inmates of the penitentiaries 
at Riker's and Hart Islands and the House of Detention for Women, all of 
which are under the supervision of the Department of Correction of New 
York City. There were two advantages in selecting subjects from this particular 
group; first, they could be kept under continuous observation throughout 
the period desired, and second, they constituted an excellent sample of 
the class in New York City from which the marihuana user comes. The subjects 
all volunteered for the study after having its purpose and the part they 
were to take in it fully explained to them.</P> 
 
<P><A NAME="race"></A><B>Race, Sex and Age.<BR> 
</B><I><A HREF="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</A></I></P> 
 
<P> Of the group, 65 were males and 7 were females; 35 were white, 26 were 
Negroes, and 11 were Puerto Ricans. The ages ranged from 21 to 37 years 
except for one who was 45 and another who was 43. Of the women, 6 had been 
opium addicts for a number of years.</P> 
 
<P><A NAME="prev"></A><B>Previous Experience with Marihuana.<BR> 
</B><I><A HREF="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</A></I></P> 
 
<P> Forty-eight of the group, including 6 of the women, gave a history 
of marihuana smoking. The extent of the usage was variable- for some it 
was occasional, while others had indulged in the habit fairly steadily 
over a period of years. Of the 48 users, those who were sellers of marihuana 
were probably the most consistent smokers, as in carrying on the traffic 
they would endeavor to keep a stock on hand. But in any instance, the number 
of cigarettes smoked during any stated period would vary according to circumstance. 
Thus one user stated that he smoked from 2 to 6 marihuana cigarettes a 
day, another from 10 to 15 a day, another 3 or 4 a week, and another 5 
or 6 a month. Those who smoked daily are here classified as steady users, 
those who smoked when opportunity was offered but not daily, as occasional 
users.</P>

<P>The users had all been deprived of marihuana from the time of their 
arrest, the shortest period being two weeks, the longest, one year and 
ten months. They all stated that the habit had often been interrupted voluntarily 
and the enforced discontinuation of it had caused no discomfort.</P>

<P> The subjects were individually selected by Dr. Allentuck as suitable 
for the study. A physical and neurological examination at the hospital 
showed no evidence of disease. However, the Wassermann and Kline tests 
gave positive results for 6 subjects and the Kline test alone was positive 
for 2 and doubtful for 2. These figures are consistent with those of the 
population from which the group was selected. Of the 12,000 inmates of 
the Riker's Island Penitentiary in 1940 and the 8,000 in 1941, 10 per cent 
reacted positively to serological tests.</P> 
 
<P><A NAME="intel"></A><B>Intelligence Record.<BR> 
</B><I><A HREF="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</A></I></P> 
 
<P> Sixty subjects (40 users and 20 nonusers ) to whom the Bellevue Adult 
Intelligence Test was given had an average I.Q. of 99.3, range 70 to 124. 
The average I.Q. of the user group was 96.7, range 70 to 124, while that 
for the non-user group was 104.5, range 93 to f 14. When analyzed according 
to racial distribution, the two groups were even better equated intellectually 
than the total results indicate. Of the 28 white subjects examined, the 
average I.Q. of the 13 users was 106.1, range 77 to 124, and that of the 
15 non-users was 106.3, range 96 to 114. The 19 Negro users had an average 
I.Q. of 92.6, range 70 to 112, and the 5 Negro non-users averaged 98.8, 
range 93 to 101. Although in the colored group the non-users averaged 6.2 
points higher than the users, it must be taken into account that the number 
of Negro non-users tested was small. The average I.Q. of the 8 Puerto Rican 
users was 91.0, range 72 to 100; that is, they were very similar in mental 
ability to the Negro users! . From the results obtained from the Bellevue 
Adult Intelligence Test, one may conclude that neither the users nor the 
nonusers were inferior in intelligence to the general population.</P> 
 
<P><A NAME="mar"></A><B>Marihuana Used.<BR> 
</B><I><A HREF="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</A></I></P> 
 
<P> The marihuana that was used for oral administration was supplied by 
Dr. H. J. Wollner, Consulting Chemist of the United States Treasury Department. 
It was in the form of an alcohol fluid concentrate, the alcohol content 
ranging from 55 to 67.3 per cent and the content of solids from 22.9 to 
33.6 Sm. per 100 cc. According to the bio-assay made by Dr. S. Loewe of 
the Department of Pharmacology of the Cornell University Medical School, 
the strength of the fluid concentrate was found to be from 71 to 90 per 
cent of that of the U.S.P. fluid extract for cannabis marketed by Parke, 
Davis and Company. The fluid extract was not miscible with water and had 
a characteristic, disagreeable taste which made it easily recognized. For 
these reasons the concentrate was evaporated to a viscid consistency and 
made into pill form, with glycyrrhiza as the excipient. Each pill was equivalent 
to 1 cc. of the concentrate. For controls, glycyrrhiza pills without marihuana 
were used.</P> 
 
<P> Several products prepared by Dr. Roger Adams in his investigation of 
the chemistry of marihuana were used. A comparison of their action with 
that of the concentrate will be found below.</P> 
 
<P> In addition to the concentrate, marihuana cigarettes were used. These 
were obtained from supplies confiscated by the New York City Police. Each 
contained approximately from .4 to .8 Gm. of marihuana. As the quality 
of the mariSuana varied and the amount of active principles taken in with 
the smoke was unknown, there was no exactness in dosage. In general, however, 
it appeared that smoking 2 cigarettes was equivalent to taking 1 pill.</P> 
 
<P> The minimal dose of the concentrate which produced clearcut effects 
was 2 cc. During the repeated observations on each member of the group 
larger doses were given, commonly up to around 8 cc. and in one instance 
up to 22 cc. For smoking, from one to as many as eleven cigarettes were 
used.</P> 
 
<P><A NAME="active"></A><B>The Active Principles.<BR> 
</B><I><A HREF="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</A></I></P> 
 
<P> Determination of relative potencies of drugs having similar action 
can be made on human beings to a limited extent only. The comparison is 
based on easily measurable effects on some organ or system on which the 
drug has a highly selective action, but the existing state of the system 
influences greatly the ensuing result. Marihuana effects come mainly from 
action on the central nervous system. The type and degree of response of 
this system to stimuli of various origins vary in different individuals 
and in the same individual at different times. When marihuana is given 
the pre-existing state cannot be classified but it has influence in determining 
the response, and the same dose of marihuana does not produce identical 
effects in different subjects or in one subject at different times. In 
general, however, when the dose given is definitely effective the responses 
are of a fairly uniform character.</P> 
 
<P> For this reason the relative potency of the active principles supplied 
by Dr. Roger Adams could be determined only ap proximately. The principles 
used were the natural tetrahydrocannabinol, the synthetic isomer, and the 
synthetic hexylhydrocannabinol. These all brought on effects similar to 
those of the marihuana concentrate. The estimate of their relative potency 
is as follows: 1 cc. of the concentrate, representing the extraction from 
1 Gm, of marihuana, had as its equivalent 15 mg. of the natural tetrahydrocannabinol, 
60 mg. of the synthetic hexylhydrocannabinol, and 120 mg. of the synthetic 
tetra compound. In explaining the differences in the estimated potencies, 
the rates of absorption must be taken into account since the action of 
marihuana depends on the amount of active principle absorbed and its concentration 
in the brain at a certain time.</P> 
 
<P> The main conclusion is that the action of the marihuana concentrate 
is dependent on its tetrahydrocannabinol content and that the synthetic 
compounds retain the action of the natural principle.</P> 
 
<P><A NAME="proc"></A><B>Procedure<BR> 
</B><I><A HREF="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</A></I></P> 
 
<P> The procedure for examining the main group of subjects was adopted 
in the light of the experience gained from the preliminary study.</P> 
 
<P> The subjects were brought to the hospital in groups of from six to 
ten, and they stayed there from four to six weeks.</P> 
 
<P> Each subject had his history taken and was given a physical neurological, 
and psychiatric examination on the day of admission. Since it has been 
shown that pulse variation is the most constant index of marihuana action, 
the pulse rate was recorded every half hour during the day with the subjects 
at rest for five minutes before each reading.</P> 
 
<P> During the following days, through careful observation by the Director, 
the general make-up of the subject, his personality, the character of his 
responsiveness, and his behavior in new surroundings were determined both 
before and while he was under the influence of marihuana. Additional information 
came through the nurses' reports.</P> 
 
<P> In addition, each subject was given a series of tests before and after 
the administration of marihuana in order that the changes brought about 
by the drug might be measured. Included among these tests were psychological 
tests for mental functioning and emotional reactions, psychomotor tests 
for both simple and complex psychophysical functions, tests to determine 
such abilities as musical aptitude and the perception of time and space, 
and laboratory examinations to test the functioning of the various organs 
and systems of the body.</P>

<P> The preliminary study of the 5 volunteer subjects had for its purpose 
the establishment of methods of procedures to be followed for the main 
group, and the obtaining of a general picture of the physical and mental 
effects induced by the drug. Having no knowledge of the safe limits of 
marihuana dosage, the dosage given to this group was restricted to from 
1 to 4 cc. of the concentrate, and for smoking from 1 to 3 cigarettes.</P> 
 
<P>When ingested, 1 cc. of marihuana was slightly effective, the multiples 
of this more so. There was noted in all subjects some increase in pulse 
rate and in blood pressure, dilated and sluggish pupils, dryness of the 
mouth and throat, ataxia, and some clumsiness and incoordination of movement. 
Symptoms distinctly disagreeable were dizziness in 3 subjects, a sense 
of heaviness of the extremities in 2, nausea in 2 and faintness in 2. Three 
showed motor restlessness. A state classed as euphoria, characterized by 
laughter, witticisms, loquaciousness, and lowering of inhibitions occurred 
in 3 subjects. This was not sustained but alternated with periods during 
which disagreeable symptoms were dominant. In one of the subjects (V.C.) 
there was no euphoric state, but a feeling of discomfort and depression 
throughout. Finally in one of the 5 (A.V.) with 2 cc. there was a state 
of depression with anxiety and with 4 cc. a psychotic episode with fear 
of death.</P> 
 
<P>With the exception of the one individual during his psychotic episode, 
the subjects gave no evidence of abnormal mental content at any stage of 
the drug action, the only change noted being a delay in focusing attention 
on questions asked and difficulty in sustaining mental concentration. While 
there was objection at times to carrying out repetitious tests, there was 
no definite refusal. There was no sexual stimulation giving rise to overt 
expression.</P> 
 
<P>With the cigarette smoking, ataxia and charges in the pulse rate, blood 
pressure, and pupils corresponded to those following oral administration. 
In only one of the subjects, however, was there definite euphoria. The 
common symptoms were dizziness and drowsiness. Two of the subjects found 
it difficult to concentrate.</P> 
 
<P>The duration of the effects of marihuana was variable. When it was ingested, 
the effects usually passed off in from two to four hours, but in one instance 
persisted for seven hours and in another for fourteen hours. After smoking, 
the duration of effects was from one to three hours.</P>

</B><I><A HREF="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</A></I></P> 
 
<P> The evidence of the effects of marihuana was obtained by the subject's 
statement of symptoms and sensations, by the nurses' reports and by the 
examiner's observations and interpretation of changes in the subject's 
mental state and behavior.</P> 
 
<P>The dosage of the marihuana concentrate ranged from 2 to 22 cc. and 
in each subject the effects of more than one dose were studied. Dosage 
ranging from 2 to 5 cc. was used for the largest number of subjects, and 
that from 14 to 21 cc. on only seven occasions. It is known that marihuana 
intoxication may bring about a comatose state, but no attempt was made 
to determine the dosage required for this. The number receiving each of 
the selected doses is shown in Table 2.</P>

<P>While the duration of action and its intensity tended to increase with 
dosage, this was not always the case and equal doses did not bring about 
uniform effects in all those receiving them. Thus, 3 cc. produced a striking 
effect in one individual, much less in another- in still another, 10 cc. 
produced less effect than S cc. Such variations are to be explained by 
differences in the mental make-up of the subject, and the particular state 
of his responsiveness at the time when marihuana is taken.</P> 
 
<P>The number of cigarettes smoked ranged from one to eleven. The smoking 
of a single cigarette took about ten minutes and up to eight could be smoked 
in an hour. In smoking, increasing the number of cigarettes usually increased 
the sensation described as &quot;high,&quot; but here also there was no 
uniformity in individuals or groups.</P> 
 
<P>When marihuana was ingested, in dosages from 2 cc. up, its actions became 
evident in from one half to one hour. The maximum effects were seen in 
from two to three hours. These subsided gradually, but the time of disappearance 
was variable, usually three to five hours, in some instances twelve hours 
or more.</P> 
 
<P>When marihuana cigarettes were used the effects appeared almost immediately. 
After one cigarette, these had usually disappeared in an hour. After several 
cigarettes had been smoked the effects increased progressively in intensity 
and reached a maximum in about an hour. In most instances they disappeared 
in from three or four hours.</P> 
 
<P><A NAME="conc"></A><B>Behavior Symptoms. <I>- The Concentrate<BR> 
</I></B><I><A HREF="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of 
Contents</A></I></P> 
 
<P> The effects on the general behavior of the subjects taking the concentrate 
were variable. If left undisturbed some remained quietly sitting or lying, 
showing little interest in their surroundings. Others were restless and 
talkative. Under the heading &quot;Euphoria&quot; there are listed those 
marihuana effects which give rise to pleasurable sensations or experiences. 
These are a sense of well-being and contentment cheerfulness and gaiety, 
talkativeness, bursts of singing and dancing, daydreaming, a pleasant drowsiness, 
joking, and performing amusing antics. The drowsiness, daydreaming and 
unawareness of surroundings were present when the subject was left alone. 
Other euphoric expressions required an audience and there was much contagiousness 
of laughing and joking where several of the subjects under marihuana were 
congregated. The occurrence of a euphoric state, in one or another form, 
was noted in most of the subjects. But except for those who were allowed 
to pass the time undisturbed! , the pleasurable effects were interrupted 
from time to time by disagreeable sensations.</P> 
 
<P>Quite commonly seen, as with the preliminary group, was a difficulty 
in focusing and sustaining mental concentration. Thus, there would occur 
a delay in the subject's answers to questions and at times some confusion 
as to their meaning. There was, however, except in a few isolated instances, 
no abnormal mental content evident and the responses brought out by the 
examiner were not different from those in the pre-marihuana state.</P> 
 
<P>Altered mental behavior which would give rise to more concern was seen 
in a relatively small number of subjects. In some this took the form of 
irritation at questioning, refusal to comply with simple requests and antagonism 
to certain of the examiners. There was, however, only verbal and no active 
opposition in any of these behaviors, caused by the subject's desire to 
be left undisturbed and his disinclination to carry out certain tests which 
in his pre-marihuana period he had considered tiresome and meaningless. 
With this came antipathy to those conducting the tests.</P> 
 
<P>The occurrence of the disagreeable physical symptoms accompanying marihuana 
action would naturally lead to a feeling of disquietude and some alarm 
as to significance and consequences. This, however, was a prominent feature 
in relatively few instances. A pronounced state of anxiety reaching a panic 
stage, associated usually with fear of death or of insanity, was observed 
only in those subjects experiencing psychotic episodes and here the anxiety 
state led to pleas for escape and not to acts of aggression. Even in the 
psychotic states there were no uncontrollable outbursts of rage or acts 
of violence.</P> 
 
<P>Some evidence of eroticism was reported in about 10 per cent of the 
150 instances in which marihuana was administered to the group. The presence 
of nurses, attendants and other women associated with the study gave opportunity 
for frank expression of sexual stimulation, had this been marked. There 
was no such expression even during the psychotic episodes.</P> 
 
<P>In some isolated instances there was evidence of marked lowering of 
inhibitions such as loud discharge of flatus, urinating on the floor instead 
of in the vessels supplied, and in one instance frank exhibitionism. In 
the last instance the subject, who was not a regular marihuana user, had 
been arrested on three occasions for indecent exposure.</P> 
 
<P>The frequency with which significant changes in behavior occurred is 
indicated in Table 3</P>

<P>As used in Table 3, anxiety means the subject's expressed worry concerning 
what might happen to him. Excitement, shown by physical restlessness, mucular 
twitchings and jerky movements, and loud talking, and some degree of antagonism 
are known to be expressions of an &quot;alarm&quot; or &quot;fear&quot; 
state.</P> 
 
<P>It is seen from this table that, except for euphoria, the effect of 
marihuana was definitely more pronounced on the nonusers. This might be 
taken as evidence of a persisting tolerance to the drug in the user group, 
but, on the other hand, it may have as its basis a feeling of greater apprehension 
in the nonusers. Such a feeling would undoubtedly arise among those who 
have had no previous experience with marihuana and are in a state of uncertainty 
as to its possible harmful effects.</P> 
 
<P><B>Physical Symptoms. <I>- The Concentrate<BR> 
</I></B><I><A HREF="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of 
Contents</A></I></P> 
 
<P> Of the subjective symptoms, a feeling described as lightness, heaviness, 
or pressure in the head, often with dizziness, was one of the earliest 
and occurred in practically all subjects, irrespective of dose. Dryness 
of the mouth and throat were reported by over half of the subjects as was 
also a floating sensation. Unsteadiness in movement and a feeling of heaviness 
in the extremities were commonly experienced as was a feeling of hunger 
and a desire for sweets especially. Less commonly noted were nausea, vomiting, 
sensations of warmth of the head or body, burning of the eyes and blurring 
of vision, tightness of the chest, cardiac palpitation, ringing or pressure 
in the ears, and an urge to urinate or defecate.</P> 
 
<P>From observation by the examiner, tremor and ataxia were present in 
varying degrees in practically all instances and in all dosages used, as 
were also dilatation of the pupils and sluggish response to light. These 
effects were often present on the day following marihuana administration.</P> 
 
<P>The frequency of the more common subjective symptoms and their relation 
to dosage is shown in Table 4. The figures are taken from the subject's 
reports.</P> 
 
<P>There is a tendency for the symptoms to be more frequent in the non-users 
than in the users but the differences are variable and in general not striking.</P>

</I></B><I><A HREF="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of

<P> Smoking. When marihuana is smoked, there is, as has been stated, no 
such accuracy in dosage as is the case when it is ingested. The marihuana 
user acquires a technique or art in smoking &quot;reefers.&quot; This involves 
special preparation of the cigarette and regulation of the frequency and 
depth of inhalations. In a group of smokers, a cigarette circulates from 
one to another, each in turn taking one or more puffs. The performance 
is a slow and deliberate one and the cigarette, held in a forked match 
stick, is smoked to its end.</P> 
 
<P>When the smoke comes in contact with the respiratory mucous membrane, 
the absorption of the active principle is rapid and the effects are recognized 
promptly by the subject. He soon learns to distinguish the amount of smoking 
which will give pleasant effects from the amount which will give unpleasant 
ones and so regulates his dosages. Providing there are no disturbing factors, 
as is the case in gatherings of small friendly groups or parties in &quot;tea-pads,&quot; 
the regulated smoking produces a euphoric state, which accounts for continued 
indulgence.</P>

</TABLE> 
 
<P>The effect from smoking marihuana cigarettes was studied in 32 subjects. 
Of these, 20 were classed as users, that is, prior to their arrest they 
had had more or less extensive experience in smoking. In the study the 
smoking was repeated by each subject several times, the number of cigarettes 
smoked within an hour ranging from one to eight.</P> 
 
<P>In all of the user group the smoking produced a euphoric state with 
its feeling of well- being, contentment, sociability, mental and physical 
relaxation, which usually ended in a feeling of drowsiness. Talkativeness 
and laughing and the sensation of floating in the air were common occurrences. 
These effects were of short duration, from one to three or four hours after 
the smoking was concluded. In none of these subjects was there an expression 
of antagonism or antisocial behavior.</P> 
 
<P>In the non-user group the effects were similar except that in one subject 
a state of mental confusion occurred and in another the main effect was 
a feeling of dizziness, unsteadiness, and muscular weakness. Finally one 
subject showed effects entirely different from the others. He smoked one 
cigarette and became restless, agitated, dizzy, fearful of his surroundings, 
afraid of death. He had three short attacks of unconsciousness. At one 
period he had visions of angels, and for a few minutes a euphoric state. 
The entire episode lasted a little over an hour, after which he went to 
sleep. This subject had a similar psychotic episode after taking 120 mg. 
of tetrahydrocannabinol. On seven other occasions he had been given the 
marihuana concentrate or tetrahydrocannabinol with no unusual effects.</P> 
 
<P>Of the physical symptoms occurring with smoking, dryness of the mouth 
and throat, dizziness, and a sensation of hunger were the most common. 
None of these or other symptoms seemed to lessen materially the pleasurable 
effects.</P> 
 
<P>The effect of smoking on the 7 females, 6 of whom were classed as users, 
corresponded to that on the male group. All showed euphoric effects. One 
of the subjects was nauseated and another was restless, irritable, and 
contrary. These effects were observed in both of the subjects when marihuana 
was taken by stomach. One of the users, euphoric after smoking 6 and 10 
cigarettes, had a psychotic episode after 8 cc. of marihuana concentrate.</P> 
 
<P>Tea-Pad Parties. (This section on &quot;Tea-Pad Parties&quot; was prepared 
by Mrs. Halpern.) In addition to the quantitative data regularly obtained 
from the subject during the course of the testing program, the examiner 
had opportunity to make diverse observations of the subject's global reactions, 
which threw interesting light on the general effect of the drug on the 
individual personality.</P> 
 
<P>When the subject became &quot;high,&quot; his inclination was to laugh, 
talk, sing, listen to music, or sleep, but the requirement that he solve 
problems, answer questions, or remember drawings created an artificial 
situation, tending to bring him &quot;down&quot; and spoil his pleasure. 
In order, therefore, that the influence of the drug might be observed in 
less formal circumstances and in a set-up more nearly like the customary 
&quot;tea-pad,&quot; two groups of men were given &quot;parties&quot; on 
the last night of their hospital sojourn. The men were consulted beforehand, 
and the stage was set according to their desires. They requested that nothing 
be done until it was really dark outside. They brought the radio into the 
room where the smoking took place and turned it to soft dance music. Only 
one shaded light burned, leaving the greater part of the room shadowy. 
The suggestion was made that easy chairs or floor cushions be procured 
but the party progressed without these.</P> 
 
<P>The men were allowed as many cigarettes as they wanted. When the &quot;reefers&quot; 
were passed out they crowded around with their hands outstretched like 
little children begging for candy. The number of cigarettes the men smoked 
varied, the range being from two to twelve or thirteen. There were both 
users and non-users in these two groups. The users of course were highly 
elated at the prospect of getting much free &quot;tea,&quot; and some of 
the non-users also smoked with genuine enjoyment.</P> 
 
<P>In the beginning the men broke up into little groups of twos and threes 
to do their smoking, or in some instances went off by themselves. Smoke 
soon filled the atmosphere and added to the general shadowy effect. After 
the initial smoking there was some moving about- some men laughed and joked, 
some became argumentative, while some just stared out of the window. The 
arguments never seemed to get anywhere, although they often dealt with 
important problems, and the illogical reasoning used was never recognized 
or refuted by the person to whom it was addressed. Gradually, as though 
attracted by some force, all restlessness and activity ceased, and the 
men sat in a circle about the radio. Occasionally they whispered to one 
another, laughed a little, or swayed to the music, but in general they 
relaxed quietly in their chairs. A feeling of contentment seemed to pervade, 
and when one man suddenly got a &quot;laughing jag&quot; they were annoyed 
at the interruption.</P> 
 
<P>In general, they gave the impression of adolescent boys doing something 
which was forbidden and thereby adding spice to the indulgence. Many of 
the adolescent personality patterns as they appear in group activities 
were clearly observable here. There was the eternal &quot;wisecracker,&quot; 
the domineering &quot;important&quot; individual who tried to tell everyone 
what to do, the silly, giggling adolescent and the shy, withdrawn introvert. 
One forgot that these were actually adults with all the usual adult responsibilities. 
One could not help drawing the conclusion that they too had forgotten this 
for the time being.</P> 
 
<P>Although urged to smoke more, no subject could be persuaded to take 
more than he knew or felt he could handle. After about an hour and half 
of smoking, the men were given coffee and bread and jam and the party broke 
up. They all went to bed and reported the next day that they had slept 
very well.</P> 
 
<P>Another attempt at evaluating the effect of marihuana in less formal 
situations was made in the following manner. The examiner, one of the police 
officers and the subjects listened to Jack Benny on the Jello Program at 
7 o'clock Sunday evening. The police officer noted the number of times 
the audience laughed, and the length of time the laughter lasted. The examiner 
checked these items for the subjects. The first time this was done without 
marihuana; the following week the subjects were given several &quot;reefers&quot; 
about fifteen minutes before the radio program started. The results were 
as follows: Without drug, the subjects laughed 42 times as against 72 laughs 
in the radio audience. The total time for all laughs was 63 seconds as 
compared with 139 seconds for the radio audience. With cigarettes the subjects 
laughed 43 times as compared with 47 laughs in the audience, the total 
laugh time being 129 seconds as compared with 173 seconds of laughter in 
the audience. Without dru! g, the subjects laughed, roughly speaking, only 
half as often and as long as the audience- while under the drug they laughed 
almost as often and the laugh time was about 75 per cent that of the audience.</P> 
 
<P>It is obvious that under marihuana the subject laughs more readily and 
for longer time intervals. This is probably due both to the fact that things 
seem funnier to him and because when under the influence of the drug he 
is less inhibited.</P>

<P> When marihuana was ingested, it was in the form of the concentrate, 
containing all the active principles which are soluble in the menstruum 
used. The relative proportions of the principles present are unknown, and 
the effects can be assumed to give a composite picture of different actions, 
the dominating one being that of tetrahydrocannabinol. There is no information 
available concerning the principles present in marihuana smoke, and it 
is possible that some of those found in the concentrate have been destroyed 
by the heat of combustion. The effects from smoking correspond to those 
induced by tetrahydrocannabinol taken by stomach, so it may be assumed 
that this principle is present in the smoke. The rapidity with which effects 
occur after smoking demonstrates the quick absorption of the cannabinol 
from the respiratory tract and the short duration of these effects indicates 
its prompt excretion or detoxification. When the concentrate is taken, 
the absorption from the intestinal! tract is slower and more prolonged. 
For these reasons it is not possible to make a precise comparison between 
the effects of the two forms of administration.</P> 
 
<P>In general the subject's consciousness of unpleasant symptoms is more 
marked when the concentrate is taken and this may interrupt or obscure 
the pleasant effects. The long duration of action and the inability of 
the subject to stop it serve to accentuate the physical symptoms and to 
cause apprehension concerning what may happen. The result gf all this readily 
accounts for the irritability, negativism and antagonism oc curring. The 
lessening of inhibitions is not peculiar to marihuana, for in a few subjects 
who were given alcohol in intoxicating doses the behavior corresponded 
to that induced by marihuana.</P> 
 
<P>After smoking the main effect was of a euphoric type. Some dizziness 
and dryness of the mouth were generally present but were not pronounced 
enough to distract from the pleasant sensations. The condition described 
as &quot;high&quot; came on promptly and increased with the number of cigarettes 
smoked, but it was not alarming or definitely disagreeable, and did not 
give rise to antisocial behavior. On the contrary it prompted sociability. 
The marihuana was under the subject's control, and once the euphoric state 
was present, which might come from only one cigarette, he had no inclination 
to increase it by more smoking. When a considerable number of cigarettes 
were smoked, the effect was usually one of drowsiness and fatigue.</P> 
 
<P>The description of the &quot;tea-pad parties&quot; brings out clearly 
the convivial effect on the groups and the absence of any rough or antagonistic 
behavior.</P> 
 
<P><A NAME="psy"></A><B>Psychotic Episodes<BR> 
</B><I><A HREF="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</A></I></P> 
 
<P> What has been referred to as psychotic episodes occurred in 9 subjects, 
7 men and 2 women. A description of the happenings in each instance is 
given. (2)</P> 
 
<P>(2) Throughout this section fictitious initials are used to avoid any 
disclosure of the subjects' identities.</P> 
 
<P>A.V. Male. Non-user. Given 4 cc. of marihuana concentrate. About three 
hours later he became restless, tremulous, agitated, fearful of harmful 
effects, suspicious of examiners. For short periods he was euphoric. At 
one time he had visual hallucinations of figures making gestures suggesting 
harm. He talked continuously, mainly expressing fear. His answers to questions 
were delayed but intelligent.</P> 
 
<P>W.P. Male. Occasional user. Given 3 cc., repeated two hours later. At 
first there was a euphoric state; later he became resistant and negativistic. 
He showed antagonism to the examiner, demanding to be left alone. He vomited 
twice. Throughout he was highly excited and talked to himself. The effects 
in general resembled those seen in a maniacal state. He returned to his 
normal state in about three hours after the second dose.</P> 
 
<P>F.D. Male. Occasional user. Given 4 cc. Five hours later he became confused, 
disoriented and slow in answering questions. There were periods of elation 
and depression with laughter and weeping. The effects passed off in six 
hours.</P> 
 
<P>R.W. Male. Non-user. Given 5 cc. Three hours later he became disoriented 
with continued talkativeness and rapid shifting of thought. He had fits 
of laughter and weeping, grandiose ideas, some paranoid trends. He answered 
questions clearly but without perseveration. He returned to normal after 
six hours.</P> 
 
<P>I.N. Female. Occasional user. Also heroin addict for many years. Given 
8 cc. Three hours later she became confused and anxious with periods of 
laughing and weeping. There were several short episodes resembling hysterical 
attacks and dyspnea, pallor and rapid pulse during which she felt that 
she was dying and screamed for the doctor and for a priest. Throughout, 
her response to questioning was intelligent but delayed. There was a return 
to her normal state in three hours.</P> 
 
<P>E.C. Male. Non-user. Given 6 cc. Two hours later he developed a marked 
state of anxiety accompanied by a sensation of difficulty in breathing. 
This began during a basal metabolism test. In the Sanborn equipment used 
there is a nose clip occluding nasal breathing and a rubber mouthpiece 
through which the air is inspired and expired. During the test the subject 
became confused, panicky and disoriented as to time. The anxiety over breathing 
continued for four hours but could be interrupted by distraction. He was 
then given 4 cc. more. The breathing difficulty lasted five hours more.</P> 
 
<P>The condition here had features seen in claustrophobia. Before the episode, 
the subject had taken marihuana on five occasions in 2, 4, 5, 5, and 2 
cc. dosage, without any symptoms of respiratory distress. However, after 
the episode he took marihuana on three occasions in 2, 5, and 6 cc. dosage 
and each time the respiratory symptoms occurred. A certain degree of nervousness 
was present but there was no mental confusion. The subject realized that 
there was no physical obstruction to his breathing and had learned that 
by concentrating his thought on other lines he could keep his respiratory 
difficulties in abeyance and would not suffer from real anxiety. Smoking 
up to as many as thirteen marihuana cigarettes did not bring about the 
respiratory effect. It appeared then that the respiratory symptoms were 
precipitated by the wearing of the apparatus while under the influence 
of marihuana, and through suggestibility there resulted a conditioning 
to the marihuana concentrate whi! ch was given subsequently.</P> 
 
<P>The description of these six psychotic episodes fits in with many others 
found in marihuana literature. They are examples of acute marihuana intoxication 
in susceptible individuals which comes on shortly after the drug has been 
taken and persists for several hours. The main features of the poisoning 
are the restlessness and mental excitement of a delirious nature with intermittent 
periods of euphoric and an overhanging state of anxiety and dread.</P> 
 
<P><A NAME="psy"></A><B>Three other subjects presented the features of 
marihuana psychosis.<BR> 
</B><I><A HREF="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</A></I></P> 
 
<P> R.H. Male. White. Age 23. Non-user. In prison for the offense of living 
on prostitution. The family history was bad. His father never supported 
his wife or family and there was continual discord at home. When the subject 
was 9 years old the father deserted the family. Three brothers received 
court sentences, one for stealing a taxi, one for rape, and one for striking 
a teacher. R.H. was a problem child at school and on account of truancy 
and waywardness he was sent to the Flushing Parental School. He ran away 
from this school several times and was transferred to the House of Refuge 
on Randall's Island. At the age of 16 he was discharged. Since that time 
he had had two jobs, one for three months in a factory, the other for four 
and one-half months in the W.P.A. When he was 16 he was run over by a truck 
and was unconscious for a time. After his return to the Riker's Island 
Penitentiary from Welfare Hospital further questioning concerning his past 
revealed that he was subject! to &quot;fits&quot; occurring once or twice 
every two months. During the attacks his body became rigid and his mouth 
felt stiff.</P> 
 
<P>The subject was admitted to Welfare Hospital for the marihuana study 
on February 20th. After the usual program of examinations he was given 
2 cc. of the concentrate on February 27th and February 28th. These doses 
brought on the symptoms of dizziness and tremor and heaviness of the head 
and the state called &quot;high&quot; which is characterized by periods 
of laughter and talkativeness. These effects passed off in a few hours 
and were followed by drowsiness and a sense of fatigue. On March 1st at 
1 p.m. he smoked one marihuana cigarette. Immediately afterwards he became 
agitated and restless and suddenly lost consciousness. He recovered quickly 
and stated that he had had visions of angels and had heard choirs singing. 
Later he had a second short period of unconsciousness. During the afternoon 
he continued to be agitated and restless and had periods of laugEung and 
weeping. After he was given phenobarbital he went to sleep. On the next 
day his only complaint was that he felt dizzy.! Following this episode 
he was given 4 cc. of marihuana concentrate on March 3rd and 2 cc. on March 
10th and 2 cc. of tetrahydrocannabinol on March 5th and 4 cc. on March 
8th. The effects corresponded to those seen after the earlier administrations 
of 2 cc. doses of the concentrate.</P> 
 
<P>On March 11th R.H. was given 5 cc. (75 mg.) of the tetrahydrocannabinol 
at 11 a.m. and 3 cc. at 2 p.m. No unusual effects were noted during the 
afternoon and he ate his supper with appetite at 4:30 p.m. At 6 p.m. he 
became restless, apprehensive and somewhat belligerent. He felt that something 
had happened to his mother, that everybody was acting queerly and picking 
on him. He continued to be agitated and fearful, refused medication and 
slept poorly. This condition persisted and on March 1 3th he was returned 
to Riker's Island. After four days there he became quiet and composed. 
The psychotic state cleared up completely. The resident psychiatrist's 
report was: Impression 1. Psychosis due to drugs. (Marihuana experimentally 
administered.) Acute delirium, recovered. 2. Convulsive disorder, idiopathic 
epilepsy. Petit mal on history.</P> 
 
<P>H.W. Female. White. Age 28. Non-user. Drug peddler, serving three years' 
indefinite sentence for unlawfully possessing a drug. Her parents died 
when she was about 10 years old and she was raised in an orphanage. At 
the age of 19 she entered a training school for nurses, but gave this up 
after four months and supported herself by prostitution. Her sister and 
her sister's husband were drug addicts and through them she began taking 
morphine and heroin, being, according to her account, depressed and dissatisfied 
at the time. She continued using these drugs up to the time of her arrest, 
a period of eight years. In 1938 she married a man who was also a drug 
addict, and engaged in the drug traffic.</P> 
 
<P>On May 7th she was given 2 cc. of marihuana. Aside from a headache and 
a feeling of muscular weakness and incoordination, the effect was to make 
the subject feel gay and very good-natured On May 8th she was given 3 cc. 
of the concentrate and became somewhat confused and unsteady, irritated 
and upset at carrying out tests, and greatly worried about the physical 
symptoms. Five hours after she had taken the drug the effects had largely 
passed off. Six hours later, however, she became restless and agitated, 
moving about constantly, and worried about past conduct. This state continued 
for a few hours. On other occasions the subject was given marihuana in 
doses of 2, 3, and 4 cc. Twice after the administration of 3 cc. the general 
effect was of a euphoric type, and after 4 cc. had been given a state of 
sadness set in on two occasions and one of euphoria on a third. Toward 
the end of her stay the subject became depressed and moody, constantly 
dwelling on the belief that she had! committed unpardonable sins.</P> 
 
<P>She was returned to the House of Detention on June 2nd, transferred 
to the Psychiatric Division of Bellevue Hospital on June 9th, and from 
there was sent to Matteawan State Hospital on July 10th. On admission to 
the State Hospital she appeared confused, retarded, apprehensive, and depressed. 
She had a marked feeling of guilt. She began to improve in September and 
was discharged, cured, in January. Since her return to New York she reports 
at frequent intervals to the parole officer. She has secured employment 
in a food shop and is to be promoted to the position of manager of the 
shop.</P> 
 
<P>The diagnosis made at the State Hospital was: Psychosis, due to drugs 
and other exogenous poisons (morphine and heroin).</P> 
 
<P>D.P. Male. Colored. Age 23. Occasional user. Sentenced for unlawful 
possession of drugs. Since graduation from high school at the age of 16 
he had had no occupation. His criminal record dated from his graduation. 
He was arrested in 1934 for disorderly conduct and in the same year sentenced 
to Elmira Reformatory for five years for second-degree assault. He was 
paroled in 1936, but during the same and the following year was arrested 
three times for assault or robbery. He was returned to Elmira where he 
remained until his discharge in 1940. In August 1940 he was arrested for 
the possession of drugs and sentenced to a three-year indefinite term. 
He had served eight months of this sentence when he was admitted to Welfare 
Hospital as a subject for the marihuana study.</P> 
 
<P>During his stay at Welfare Hospital, D.P. was given marihuana in the 
form of a concentrate and as cigarettes on numerous occasions. His symptoms 
and behavior corresponded to those usually seen, lasting a few hours with 
no after-effects. When the time came for his return to Riker's Island he 
urged that he be allowed to stay at the hospital and assist in the study. 
Two weeks after his return to the penitentiary he developed a psychosis 
characteristic of schizophrenia. He was transferred to Matteawan where 
the diagnosis made was: Psychosis with psychopathic personality.</P> 
 
<P>These three cases are of special interest from the standpoint of the 
relationship of marihuana to the psychosis. The first subject, R.H., had 
a definite history of epileptic attacks. After smoking one marihuana cigarette 
he experienced an acute confusional state which lasted a few hours. In 
the second episode which lasted six days there was a more prolonged confusional 
state. Epileptics are subject to such attacks, epileptic or epileptic equivalents, 
which may be brought on by any number of upsetting circumstances. In this 
case marihuana is the only known factor which precipitated the attack.</P> 
 
<P>The second subject, H.W., was a heroin addict of long standing. During 
her stay in the hospital, in her retrospective reports on her marihuana 
experiences there were usually included expressions of worry and remorse 
at her failure to answer questions or perform tests honestly, informing 
on the other women in her group, and denials concerning a syphilitic infection 
she thought she had had. Prior to this incarceration she had had no prison 
experience. The mental picture developed from the study at the hospital 
and at Matteawan and the subject's subsequent history represent a fairly 
typical example of what is termed a prison psychosis.</P> 
 
<P>The third subject, D.P., did not develop his psychosis until two weeks 
after he had been returned to the Riker's Island Penitentiary. He had shown 
no unexpected effects from marihuana and had hoped to be allowed to stay 
on at the hospital instead of going back to prison to complete more than 
two years of an unexpired sentence. At Matteawan this subject was considered 
to have an underlying psychopathic personality. His case also may be taken 
as an example of prison psychosis. With both the second and third subjects, 
the exact role of marihuana in relation to the psychosis cannot be stated.</P> 
 
<P>Dr. Peter F. Amoroso, Commissioner of Correction of the city of New 
York, has given us information concerning the prisoners sentenced to the 
penitentiary at Riker's Island from whom our subjects were drawn. During 
the year beginning July 1, 1941, and ending June 30, 1942, there were 1,756 
inmates in this institution. They had received an indeterminate sentence, 
that is, from a minimum of a few months to a maximum of three years. Of 
this group, 175 were subjected to intensive study by the psychiatrist because 
they were considered possible psychotic cases, 117 were sex offenders, 
and 200 were miscellaneous cases referred for mental observation, making 
a total of 492. Twenty-seven of these cases were committed to state institutions 
for the criminal insane, namely, 25 to Matteawan and 2 to Dannemora.</P> 
 
<P>Commissioner Amoroso, after reviewing these cases, writes as follows: 
&quot;The prison atmosphere may place a most severe strain on those who 
are physically or mentally abnormal upon commitment . . . Emotionally unstable 
persons find themselves during incarceration denied the assertion and enjoyment 
of the basic human urges and impulses and it is natural to expect, therefore, 
that prison life may result in various types of explosions, such as psychoses, 
neuroses, sex perversion, and even physical and moral deterioration.</P> 
 
<P>&quot;I am indeed surprised that we had so little trouble with our volunteers 
upon completion of their study and sojourn at Welfare Hospital, and the 
few psychotic episodes that occurred are exactly what we would expect in 
the whole group without considering the administration and effects of excessive 
doses of marihuana.&quot;</P> 
 
<P><A NAME="sum"></A><B>Summary<BR> 
</B><I><A HREF="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</A></I></P> 
 
<P> In the study of the actions of marihuana in respect to subjective and 
objective symptoms and behavior, the marihuana was given a number of times 
to each of the subjects in the form of the concentrate taken by stomach. 
The amount given ranged from 2 to 22 cc., in most cases from 2 to 5 cc. 
After marihuana was taken, the systematic action became evident in from 
one- half to one hour and the maximum effects were seen in from two to 
three hours. They passed off gradually, usually in from three to five hours, 
although in some instances they did not completely disappear until twelve 
or more hours.</P> 
 
<P>Of the symptoms occurring, a feeling of lightness in the head with some 
dizziness, a sensation of floating in the air, dryness of the throat, hunger 
and thirst, unsteadiness and heaviness in the extremities were the most 
frequent. Tremor and ataxia, dilation of the pupils and sluggishness in 
responsiveness to light were observed in all subjects.</P> 
 
<P>From observations on the behavior and responses of the subjects, it 
was found that a mixture of euphoria and apprehension was generally present. 
If the subjects were undisturbed there was a state of quiet and drowsiness, 
and unawareness of surroundings, with some difficulty in focusing and sustaining 
mental concentration. If they were in company, restlessness, talkativeness, 
laughter and joking were commonly seen. A feeling of apprehension, based 
on uncertainty regarding the possible effects of the drug and strengthened 
by any disagreeable sensations present, alternated with the euphoria. If 
the apprehension developed into a state of real anxiety, a spirit of antagonism 
was shown. However, any resistance to requests made to the subjects was 
passive and not physical and there was no aggressiveness or violent behavior 
observed. Erotic ideas or sensations when present took no active expression.</P> 
 
<P>Six of the subjects developed toxic episodes characteristic of acute 
marihuana intoxication. The dosage varied from 4 to 8 cc. of the concentrate, 
and the episodes lasted from three to six hours, in one instance ten hours. 
The effects were mixtures of euphoric and anxiety states, laughter, elation, 
excitement, disorientation and mental confusion.</P> 
 
<P>The doses given were toxic to the individuals in question but not to 
others taking the same or larger ones. Once the drug had been taken the 
effects were beyond the subject's control. The actions described took unusual 
expression because for the particular subject at a particular time the 
dose was unusually effective. A corresponding toxicity did not occur from 
cigarettes for here the effects came on promptly and on the appearance 
of any untoward effects, the smoking was stopped.</P> 
 
<P>In three of the subjects a definite psychotic state occurred, in two 
shortly after marihuana ingestion, in one after a twoweek interval. Of 
the first two, one was an epileptic and the other had a history of heroin 
addiction and a prepsychotic personality. The third was considered a case 
of prison psychosis. The conclusion seems warranted that given the potential 
personality make-up and the right time and environment, marihuana may bring 
on a true psychotic state.</P>

<P> The functions of the body organs and systems were studied in the manner 
common to hospital practice according to the methods and with the equipment 
in use at Welfare Hospital. The study was designed to show not only the 
effects of varying doses of marihuana but also whether subjects who had 
long been users of the drug gave evidence of organic damage. The tests 
were made before the drug was administered, during its action, and often 
in the after period. The heart and circulation, blood composition, kidney, 
liver and gastro-intestinal function, and basal metabolism received special 
consideration.</P> 
 
<P><A NAME="sum2"></A><B>SUMMARY<BR> 
</B><I><A HREF="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</A></I></P> 
 
<P> The most consistent effect of marihuana observed in this division of 
the study was an increase in pulse rate which began shortly after the taking 
of the drug, reached a peak in about two hours, and gradually disappeared. 
In-a few instances a temporary sinus tachycardia or sinus bradycardia was 
noted, but except for these there were no abnormalities in rhythm. The 
increase in pulse rate was usually accompanied by a rise in blood pressure.</P> 
 
<P>There was in general an increase in the blood sugar level and in the 
basal metabolic rate, quite marked in some subjects, but in the majority 
the levels reached did not exceed the high normal limits.</P> 
 
<P>An increase in the frequency of urination was often observed. There 
was, however, no appreciable increase in the total amount of urine passed 
during the drug action.</P> 
 
<P>Hunger and an increase in appetite, particularly for sweets, was noted 
in the majority of the subjects, and the taking of candy or sweetened drinks 
brought down a &quot;too high&quot; effect of the drug. Nausea and vomiting 
occurred in a number of instances, diarrhea only during psychotic episodes.</P> 
 
<P>On the other hand, the blood showed no changes in cell count, hemoglobin 
per cent, or the urea nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus figures. The figures 
for the circulation rate and vital capacity and the results of the phenolsulfonphthalein 
test for kidney infection and the bromsulfalein test for liver function 
were not different from those of the control period. The electrocardiograms 
showed no abnormalties which could be attributed to a direct action on 
the heart. In the few observations on gastric motility and secretion no 
evidence of marihuana action on these functions was obtained.</P> 
 
<P>The positive results observed, increase in pulse rate and blood pressure, 
increase in blood sugar and metabolic rate, urge to urinate, increased 
appetite, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea, were not intensified by an 
increase in dosage, for they could occur in an equal degree after the administration 
of any of the effective doses within the range used. All the effects described 
are known to be expressions of forms of cerebral excitation, the impulses 
from this being transmitted through the autonomic system. The alterations 
in the functions of the organs studied come from the effects of the drug 
on the central nervous system and are proportional to these effects. A 
direct action on the organs themselves was not seen.</P>

<strong>PSYCHOPHYSICAL AND OTHER FUNCTIONS</strong> 
<br>Robert S. Morrow, PH.D. 
<p> 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 
In this phase of the study an effort was made to determine the effect of marihuana on various psychomotor 
and some special mental abilities. Appraisal of these effects was made wherever possible through the use of 
standardized tests. A number of different tests were originally tried under varying experimental conditions 
on the group of 5 volunteer subjects who had never before taken marihuana. Only those tests were retained 
which, in the course of this preliminary investigation demonstrated the greatest potentialities. With the tests 
finally selected it was hoped to measure the effect of marihuana on the following functions. 
<p> 
<a name="func"><strong>FUNCTIONS AND CAPACITIES TESTED</strong></a> 
<p> 
<strong>Static Equilibrium</strong><br> 
This was measured by means of the Miles Ataxiameter, which is an instrument for recording body sway. 
The subject remains stationary in the ataxiameter with his hands at his sides and his feet together while a 
system of pulleys attached to a helmet on his head records the direction and degree of movement. The 
subject's score is the cumulative sway in all directions measured in millimeters. This test was applied to 
each subject for two minutes with his eyes open and two minutes with his eyes closed. Each trial was 
followed by a rest period of five minutes. 
<p> 
<strong>Hand Steadiness 
</strong><br>Hand steadiness was measured by means of the Whipple Steadiness Tester which consists of 
a metal disk with a hole 3/16 of an inch in diameter, connected in series with dry cells, an electric counter, 
and a stylus. The subject was instructed to hold the stylus in the hole for two minutes without touching the 
metal sides. Each contact with the side of the hole was recorded and the total number of contacts gave an 
index of unsteadiness of hand. 
<p> 
<strong>Speed of Tapping 
</strong><br>Speed of tapping was measured in somewhat the same manner as was hand steadiness. The 
Whipple Apparatus was used, the tapping board replacing the steadiness disk and a thicker and heavier 
stylus replacing the steadiness stylus. The subject tapped repeatedly on the metal plate for two minutes and 
the total number of taps was recorded on the counter, thereby giving a measure of motor speed. 
<p> 
<strong>Strength of Grip 
</strong><br>The Collins Dynamometer was used to measure the subject's strength of grip. Three trials 
were made for each hand and the scores averaged. 
<p> 
<strong>Simple and Complex Hand and Foot Reaction Time 
</strong><br>Special apparatus was constructed to measure simple and complex hand and foot reaction 
time. To measure simple hand reaction time, the subject was instructed to press down on a telegraph key 
and remove his hand as quickly as possible when a red light appeared on the board which stood directly 
before him. A Cenco counter recorded the reaction time, that is, the time which elapsed between the 
presentation of the stimulus and the response. 
<p> For the measurement of simple foot reaction time, the subject pressed down on a pedal with his foot, 
removing it as quickly as possible when the red light appeared. 
<p> For the measurement of complex (choice or discrimination) hand and foot reaction time either a red 
or a blue light served as a stimulus. The subject had no advance knowledge as to which color light would 
appear. For measuring the response with the hand, the subject pressed down on the telegraph key with the 
right hand and, at the sight of the red light, moved the peg from the red compartment into the center 
(neutral) compartment with the left hand, then removed the right hand from the key; at the appearance of 
the blue light, he moved the peg from the blue to the neutral compartment. For measuring complex foot 
reaction time, the procedure was similar to that for estimating the hand reaction time except that the right 
foot and the pedal were substituted for the right hand and the telegraph key. 
<p> Each subject made fifteen trials for each of the four variations. 
<p> 
<strong>Musical Aptitude 
</strong><br>Musical aptitude was determined by means of the Kwalwasser-Dykema Music Tests. The 
eight tests administered were the tonal memory test, the quality discrimination test, the intensity 
discrimination test, the tonal movement test, the time discrimination test, the rhythm discrimination test, 
the pitch discrimination test, and the melodic taste test. The sum of the scores for these separate tests was 
used to give a total score for musical aptitude. 
<p> 
<strong>Auditory Acuity 
</strong><br>By means of the Galton Whistle, the subjects' limits of auditory acuity were gauged for both 
ascending and descending frequencies. The final score was the average of the results of three trials in each 
direction. 
<p> 
<strong>Perception of Time 
</strong><br>An attempt was made to appraise the subject's facility in estimating time by asking him to 
state when, after a given signal, he thought the following intervals had elapsed-fifteen seconds, one minute, 
and five minutes. Several trials were given for each time interval and the average of the results of the trials 
was taken as the final score. 
<p> 
<strong>Perception of Length 
</strong><br>Subjects were asked to estimate the length of lines which were 3 inches, 5 inches, and 8 
inches in length and to draw lines of 3 inches and 7 inches. 
<p> 
<a name="sub"><strong>THE SUBJECTS 
</strong></a> 
<br>Fifty-four subjects were used in this part of the experiment, 36 marihuana users and 18 non-users. The 
two groups were equated approximately for the following factors: age, height, weight, years of formal 
education, and number of arrests. The age range for the user group was from 21 to 45 years with 27.9 years 
as an average, the age range for the non-user group was from 22 to 43 years with 29.8 years as an average. 
The range in height for the users was from 54 to 75 inches with a mean of 67.5 inches- for the non-users 
the range was from 60 to 71 inches with a mean of 66.8 inches. Range in weight for the users was from 123 
to 178 pounds with 151.3 pounds as the mean, for the non-users from 115 to 180 pounds with 149.5 
pounds as the mean. The schooling of the user group ranged from no education at all to 10 years with a 
mean of 7.1 years, that of the non-users varied from 6 to 12 years with a mean of 8.3 years. As regards the 
number of arrests, the range for users was from 1! 
! 
 to 20 with a mean of 5.1 and for the non-users from 1 to 15 with a mean of 5.3. 
<p> The two groups differed radically with respect to race. Of the 36 marihuana users, 11 (31 per cent) 
were white, 18 (50 per cent) were Negroes, and 7 (19 percent) were Puerto Ricans. Of the 18 non-users, 12 
(67 per cent) were white, 6 (33 per cent) were Negroes, and none were Puerto Rican. 
<p> In addition, the user group was analyzed with respect to the age when the marihuana habit was 
begun, the duration of the habit, the number of marihuana cigarettes generally smoked per day, and the 
period of deprivation. The variation of the habit as already described for the entire group of users applies to 
the 36 subjects studied here. 
<p> 
<a name="proc"><strong>PROCEDURE </strong></a><br> 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 
The tests were first administered to the subjects before they had taken marihuana, then about a week later 
when they were under the influence of 2 cc. of marihuana, and finally another week later after 5 cc.(1) of 
marihuana had been administered. On each occasion the psychomotor tests for static equilibrium, hand 
steadiness, tapping, strength of grip, and reaction time were repeated at hourly intervals for eight 
successive hours in order that the time-effects of marihuana might be determined.(2) The other tests, that 
is, those measuring musical ability, auditory acuity, visual ) memory, and perception of time and length 
were given to the subjects while in the undrugged condition and from three to four hours after the drug had 
been administered. The music tests were given under normal conditions and after 5 cc. of marihuana had 
been administered, but not under 2 cc. dosage. 
<p> In almost all instances the marihuana was given in the morning shortly after breakfast and generally 
after a day when no drug had been taken in order that "hangover" effects might be avoided. For the most 
part the subjects rested and did little or nothing except the prescribed tests on days when marihuana was 
taken. 
<p> The equilibrium, steadiness, tapping and strength of grip tests were given together on one day and the 
different forms of the reaction-time test on another day. Ordinarily four or five days elapsed between 
retests. 
<p> In addition to being tested after standard doses of the marihuana concentrate had been ingested, 11 
users and 9 non-users were tested after smoking marihuana cigarettes.(3) The cigarettes weighed from 4 to 
8 grains each. Most of the subjects smoked five cigarettes, two non-users smoked only three, and one 
nonuser smoked four. The tests with cigarettes were given at quarter-hour, half-hour and hour intervals. 
<p> 
(1) A dose of 5 cc. of marihuana proved "too much" for many non-user subjects in the sense that ingestion 
of this amount was often followed by nausea and general symptoms of malaise which interfered with 
further testing. For this reason the higher dose for non-users was sometimes reduced to 3 cc. or 4 cc. In all, 
only 6 of the non-user subjects took the S cc. dose. Accordingly, although the higher dosage is referred to 
as S cc. it should be noted that the actual amount used varied from 3 cc. to 5 cc. 
<p>(2) The scores for the first 25 users and 6 non-users were obtained every half hour, but since there was 
little difference between the half-hourly and hourly results it was decided to record hourly scores only, 
except for the first half hour. 
<p>(3) A short experiment in which placebos were employed was also tried on these subjects. An attempt 
was made to have the placebos simulate the marihuana as much as possible but unfortunately the placebo 
pills had a distinctive taste which rendered them easily identifiable. The subjects referred to them as the 
"licorice" pills or the "blanks." While the experiment was completed and resulted in some interesting 
findings, the factors which might have invalidated the results were so serious that these experiments are not 
reported at this time. 
<p> 
<a name="sum"><strong>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</strong></a><br> 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
<ol> 
<li>The effect of marihuana on the psychomotor functions depends primarily on the complexity of the 
function tested. Simpler functions like speed of tapping and simple reaction time are affected only slightly 
by large doses (5 cc.) and negligibly, if at all, by smaller doses (2 cc.). On the other hand, the more 
complex functions like static equilibrium, hand steadiness, and complex reaction time may be affected 
adversely to a considerable degree by the administration of both large and small doses of marihuana. 
<li>The function most severely affected is body steadiness and hand steadiness. The ataxia is general in all 
directions rather than predominant in any particular axis. 
<li>The effects produced by larger doses (5 cc.) are systematically, though not necessarily proportionately, 
greater than those brought about by small doses. 
<li>The time required by the drug to exert its maximum effect varies somewhat with the function and size 
of dose, but, on the whole, time curves for both functions and dosages have similarity of form The effect of 
the drug begins from one to two hours after ingestion and reaches its peak at the fourth hour, after which it 
declines so that by the eighth hour most of it is dissipated. 
<li>When marihuana is taken in cigarette form the psychomotor effects are similar in character and trend 
to those observed after the ingestion of the drug but they occur much sooner and taper off more quickly. 
<li>The effects seem to be essentially the same for women as for men, except that women are sometimes 
affected maximally at the second or third hour after the drug is administered. In women the return to the 
normal condition is in some instances quicker and more abrupt than it is in the men. 
<li>Non-users generally seem to be more affected by the drug when it is ingested than are users. 
<li>Auditory acuity is not affected by marihuana. 
<li>There is no evidence that musical ability, of non-musicians at least, is improved by marihuana. 
<li>The ability to estimate short periods of time and short linear distances is not measurably affected by the 
ingestion of marihuana.

Florence Halpern, MA<p> 
 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 
 In this phase of the study investigation was directed primarily toward establishing the effect of marihuana 
on the subject's intellectual functioning. An attempt was made to determine what changes in mental ability 
occur under different amounts of the drug, what direction these changes take, when they are first 
measurable, and how long they persist. 
<p> 
<a name="test"><strong>TESTS</strong></a> 
<p> 
<strong>Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test 
</strong><br>This test was used to measure the general mental level of all the subjects. It was chosen in 
preference to other available scales because it is the only individual test of intelligence which has been 
standardized on an adult population, takes into account both verbal and performance abilities, and 
compares the individual with standards established for his particular age group. It consists of ten tests, five 
verbal and five performance. The verbal tests cover the fields of general information and general 
comprehension, draw on the individual's capacity for abstract reasoning and test his arithmetical ability and 
his rote memory. The performance tests also evaluate the subject's comprehension of social situations, but 
here the results are independent of language. There are also tests of the individual's ability to carry out a 
routine task, to organize parts into a meaningful whole, to distinguish between essential and unessential 
details, and to analyze and synthesi!

<p> 
<strong>Army Alpha (Bregman Revision, Forms A, B. 5, 7 and Bellevue Revision) 
</strong><br>This is a group test first used in the United States Army in 1917 and 1918 when it was given 
to more than a million recruits. It consists of eight tests: test 1, a direction test which was not used in this 
study since the item does not appear on all forms; test 2, a test of arithmetical reasoning; test 3, a test of 
common sense in which the subject indicates which he considers the best of three possible responses to a 
given question; test 4, a.modified vocabulary test; test S. in which the subject must mentally reorganize 
disarranged sentences and then indicate whether the resultant statement is true or false; test 6, a test of 
numerical relations in which the subject must supply the last two numbers in a numerical series on the basis 
of the relationship between the first six numbers; test 7, a test of analogies in which the subject determines 
the relationship between two given words and then underlines one of four words which is related to a third 
word in the sam! 
! 
e way; and test 8, which on Forms A and B and on the Bellevue Revision is a test of general information in 
which the subject is given a choice of five answers to a question. On Forms 5 and 7, this test is a test of 
directions. 
<p> Because this test has five alternate forms which are roughly of equivalent difficulty it could be 
repeated many times within a short time interval. It was therefore used to establish a curve showing at what 
time following ingestion the marihuana has an effect on general intelligence and on individual higher 
mental processes. 
<p> 
<strong>Pyle's Digit Symbol Test 
</strong><br>In this test each number from 1 through 9 is associated with a specific symbol, as, for 
example, number 1 is associated with a square and number 2 with an asterisk. The numbers and their 
associated symbols appear at the top of the sheet of paper. Below the sample are rows of symbols, five 
symbols to a row, followed by five blank squares. The subject is expected to fill in each square with the 
number associated with the respective symbol. With practice the association bond between the number and 
the symbol becomes stronger and the subject depends less and less on the model at the top of the sheet. He 
is therefore able to work faster and his learning rate is reflected in the increased number of squares filled. 
<p> 
<strong>Cancellation Test 
</strong><br>The subject is required to cross out a specific geometric form wherever it appears on a sheet 
which is covered with rows of geometric figures. This measures the individual's capacity for carrying out a 
routine task. 
<p> 
<strong>Form Board Test 
</strong><br>The measurement of the ability to manipulate concrete material in contrast to the verbal or 
abstract ability determined by the Army Alpha test required the introduction of certain form board tests. 
These were the Seguin Form Board, the Two Figure Board, the Casuist Board, - the Five Figure Board, 
Healy A, Triangle Test, Diagonal Test, all administered and scored according to the Pintner-Patterson 
Performance Series. The Seguin Form Board has ten blocks of various goemetric forms, to be put in their 
appropriate places as rapidly as possible. Three trials are given. The Two Figure Board has nine pieces 
which, when placed correctly, form a large cross and a large square. Time and the number of moves are 
recorded. The Casuist Board has twelve pieces which, when correctly placed, form three circles and an 
oval. Time and errors are recorded. The Five Figure Board has five geometrical figures which are formed 
by the correct placement of two or three pieces for each figur! 
! 
e. Time and errors are recorded. Healy A has five small rectangular pieces which, when placed correctly, 
form a large rectangle. Time and the number of moves are recorded. The Triangle Test consists of four 
triangular pieces which are fitted together in a board. Time and errors are recorded. The Diagonal Test has 
five pieces of various shapes which must be fitted together in a rectangular frame. Time and moves are 
recorded. 
<p> 
<strong>Kohs Block Design Test 
</strong><br>This is a performance test which is less a test of manual dexterity and more dependent on 
abstract intelligence than are the form board tests. It correlates more highly with intelligence than do most 
performance items and yet it is entirely independent of language. Therefore, the individual who cannot 
express himself well or who suffers from a language handicap is not penalized as he is on verbal scales. 
<p> The test consists of sixteen cubes each with a red, a white, a blue, a yellow, a red-and- white, and a 
blue-and-yellow side. A colored design which can be reproduced with the cubes is placed before the 
subject and he is expected to make it. Results are rated numerically, depending upon the time consumed in 
execution. In this experiment two sets of designs of equivalent difficulty were required- Designs IV, VI, 
and XIV were selected for one series and V, VII, and XII for the other. 
<p> 
<strong>Memory Tests 
</strong><br>Although memory in itself cannot be considered a measure of intelligence, it is essential to 
any intelligent functioning and must therefore be included in any estimate of intelligence. Three aspects of 
memory, namely rote memory, the ability tof recall presented objects, and visual memory were tested. The 
rote memory test requires the repetition of digits in forward and reverse order as given on the Bellevue 
Intelligence Test. Object memory was tested by exposing ten small objects for three seconds and recording 
the number of articles the subject was able to recall. Visual memory or the ability to reproduce designs 
after a ten-second exposure was estimated by using the designs and scoring technique from the Army 
Performance Test. 
<p> 
<a name="proc2"><strong>PROCEDURE</strong></a><br> 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 
<p> 
<strong>The Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test 
</strong><br> 
Each subject was given the Bellevue Adult Intelligence test within two or three days after his admission to 
the hospital and before any marihuana had been administered. 
<p> 
<strong>The Army Alpha, Pyle's Digit Symbol, and Cancellation Tests 
</strong><br> 
These tests were given as group tests to a total of 20 subjects. The Army Alpha and Pyle's Digit Symbol 
tests were given every half-hour, beginning a half-hour after drug ingestion. The Army Alpha was 
continued for seven hours and Digit Symbol for five hours. The Cancellation test was given every hour for 
six hours, beginning one hour after drug administration. Eleven users and 9 non-users took the Army 
Alpha and the Digit Symbol tests, while 9 users and 11 non-users took the Cancellation test. 
<p> Tests 2 through 8 of the Army Alpha require twenty and a half minutes for actual performance while 
such preparations as the distribution of papers and the reading of directions consume almost ten minutes 
more, so that had the entire Alpha been given at each half-hourly session, the subjects would have gone 
from test to test with no intermittent rest period. For this reason the tests were divided and the following 
schedule arranged:

 Each subject took three test series, one without the drug, one with 2 cc. and one with 3, 4, 5, or 6 cc., 
depending on individual tolerance. A test series consisted of fourteen half-hour sessions for the Alpha, ten 
half- hour sessions for the Digit Symbol and seven hourly sessions for the Cancellation tests. Because of 
the time factor, a series required two days for its completion. 
<p> The halves of a series were given on successive days, and the different series a week apart. Thus for 
example, a subject might take his first test series with 2 cc. on Monday and Tuesday of one week; the 
following Monday and Tuesday the series would be repeated with the subject in a different drug state (no 
drug or S cc.); and a final series would be given the third week with the subject in still another drug 
condition. 
<p> An effort was made to obviate practice effect by giving the first test series to one third of the subjects 
without drug, to one third with 2 cc., and to one third with 3, 4, or 5 cc. However because of the necessity 
of increasing dosage gradually this ideal presentation was not actually obtained. The following gives the 
amount of drug administered to users and non-users at each test series.

 Since the various forms of the Army Alpha are not absolutely equivalent in difficulty, their order of 
presentation for any one group had to be identical in each of the three drug states. However, for each of the 
three groups tested the order of presentation was different so that all the difficult forms did not come at the 
same interval, as is shown on the following page. 
<p> 
<strong>Kohs Block Design, Form Board, and Memory Tests 
</strong><br>Administration of these tests differed markedly from those discussed above in that no 
attempt was made to give them at regular successive time intervals. Rather, they formed part of a battery of 
individual tests given to various subjects under specific drug conditions. For example, 5 cc. of marihuana 
would be ordered for a patient for 8:00 A.M., and testing began as soon thereafter as the patient appeared 
"high," the state of "highness" being judged by the subject's own statement, his pulse rate, the condition of 
his pupils and other physiological signs.

<p> Kohs Block Design was given to each subject twice, once without the drug and once with 5 cc. The 
test was taken by a total of 21 subjects, 10 users and 11 non-users. Five users tools the test first without the 
drug, S had their first trial with 5 cc. Of the non-user group 8 had their first trial without marihuana, 3 with 
4 cc. The average time at which the test was given to the user group was three and a half hours after drug 
administration, with range from two to five and a half hours. For the nonuser group, the average time of 
administration of the test was also three and a half hours after the drug was given, range two and a half to 
five and a half hours. 
<p> The two series of designs (one series being Designs IV, VI and XIV, the other V, VII and XII) were 
presented in such manner that half of the subjects were tested on one series and half on the other series 
while they were under the influence of marihuana. Thus any difference in degree of difficulty between the 
two sets of designs was cancelled out. The weighted scores given on the Arthur Point scale were used in 
evaluating the results. 
<p> Form Board Tests were divided into three batteries, each battery consisting of the Seguin Form 
Board, one of the three larger boards (Two Figure, Five Figure, or Casuist) and one of the three smaller 
boards. Various combinations of boards were used under various drug conditions in order to make the 
results as comparable as possible. The following indicates the number of times the various boards were 
used with different dosages of marihuana. 
<p> From the results it appears that Gwyn Triangle was used too often with 5 cc. and Healy A was not 
used often enough.

Aside from the Triangle and the Healy A, the distribution of boards in different drug stages was such as to 
obviate any differences in degree of difficulty. Nineteen subjects, 10 users and 9 non- users, took this test. 
The results were scored for time and errors according to the Pintner-Patterson Performance series. 
<p> Memory tests. The first digit span test was always given before marihuana had been administered, 
since the Bellewe Scale was given each patient during the first two or three days of the study. The trials 
under 2 cc. and 5 cc. were alternated. In all, 28 subjects, 17 users and 11 non-users, took this test before 
and after the ingestion of marihuana. The final score equaled the number of digits recalled. 
<p> To test Object Memory, ten small articles such as a key, a ring, a pill box, and a crayon were placed 
on a flat, neutral surface and exposed for three seconds. An attempt was made to vary some of the articles 
at each presentation so that six or seven were the same and three or four were different. Twenty-six 
subjects, 11 users and 15 non-users, took this test. They were so divided that 10 of them took the test the 
first time without drug, 10 with 2 cc., and 6 with 5 cc. 
<p> To test Visual Memory, Army designs were given each subject three times, once prior to the 
administration of marihuana, once under 2 cc., and once under 5 cc. The test was riven to a total of 28 
subiects. 16 users and 12 non-users. Because there is no alternative form for this test, results were 
definitely influenced by practice. Here, therefore, more than with any other test, it became important to 
arrange the order of administration. The following indicates the dosage of marihuana at the first test.

 It is obvious that the initial examination was given slightly more often when the subjects were not under 
the influence of the drug. Improvement derived from practice is therefore more of a factor in the tests 
which were performed under marihuana.

<em>Mental Deterioration. </em><br> 
Studies of mental deterioration due to toxic, organic or psychotic factors, as given in the literature, reveal 
that in such cases the subtest scores on the Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test show marked irregularity, 
depending upon the functions involved in the deteriorative process. As a group, the marihuana users tested 
show very even functioning, and what little irregularity occurred can be explained on the basis of language 
and racial factors.(4) From this we may conclude that the marihuana users had suffered no mental 
deterioration as a result of their use of the drug. 
<p> (4) The age factor does not affect the result since the groups were well equated in this respect. 
<p> 
<strong>Army Alpha Test 
</strong><br>Total Mental Functioning. The total scores obtained from this test at the successive testing 
periods are shown in Table 6. Those recorded before the administration of the drug give a picture like that 
seen in any learning curve, that is, there is a gradual increment in test scores at each testing interval, 
interspersed with plateau periods. Thus, without drug the test score for the second testing interval showed a 
2 per cent gain over the initial score, the score for the third testing interval showed a 4 per cent gain over 
the initial score, and so on up to the last testing period when there was a 13 per cent gain over the initial 
test score. 
<p> Between two and a half and three hours after ingestion of 2 cc. of the drug there appeared to be a 
possible very slight falling off in mental ability. Otherwise the results paralleled the findings obtained in 
the undrugged condition except that toward the end of the day the increments were larger than those which 
occurred when the subjects were undrugged. This may be due to complications in the experimental 
procedure or may be an indication of accelerated mental functioning resulting from drug ingestion. This 
point is discussed more fully when the effect on different mental functions is considered. 
<p> Deleterious effects were apparent an hour after the ingestion of 5 cc. of marihuana. There was a 3 per 
cent drop from the initial score at this one-hour period and this first attainment is not surpassed until four 
and a half hours after drug ingestion. From the four-and-a- half-hour period on to the end of the testing 
there were gradual increments in score. 
<p> Different Mental Functions. A very elaborate study was made of the scores made on the subtest 
(Table 7). Some irregularities occurred even in the undrugged state, and these may be attributed primarily 
to chance factors, as, for example, the difference in difficulty of the various test forms. On the whole, the 
findings were in line with those which one would expect in any situation where constant repetition 
increases efficiency. 
<p> The effects of 2 cc. of marihuana on the different mental functions were variable. Tests involving 
number concepts gave clear-cut, consistent findings and revealed that impairment occurred an hour after 
the drug was taken and continued for from two and a half to three hours after ingestion. Results of other 
tests showed that there was little if any loss in ability, and some of them, especially those done toward the 
end of the day, showed gains which exceeded the ones made in the undrugged state. It is not possible on 
the basis of the present data to ascertain whether these large increments indicate that small amounts of the 
drug serve as stimulants in situations dependent primarily upon verbal facility or whether they are due to 
certain complications in the test technique. The former theory coincides with the increased verbosity noted 
on other tests as well as with the clinical impression, but the latter also cannot be overlooked. Further 
investigation of this point is d! 
! 
efinitely indicated. 
<p> The effect of the 5 cc. dosage on each function was in line with that reported for total scores, that is, 
there was a falling off in efficiency one hour after the drug was taken and this impairment continued for 
anywhere from three and a half to six and a half hours after ingestion. Here too the scores on tests 
involving number concepts were most severely affected, recovery for them taking place from six to six and 
a half hours after drug administration. 
<p> 
<strong>Degree and Duration of Drug Effect.</strong><br> 
In general it may be stated that marihuana has a deleterious effect on mental functioning, the extent, time 
of onset, and duration of the impairment being related to the amount of drug taken. 
<p> The adverse effect of the 2 cc. dosage on global intelligence was slight (about 3 per cent to 4 per cent 
impairment in efficiency) and of sort duration, occurring at about two and a half hours after ingestion and 
lasting little longer than a half-hour or an hour. Certain mental functions, especially those dealing with 
number concepts, appear to have been affected much earlier than others, the effect on the number test 
scores being measurable as early as one hour after ingestion and continuing until two and a half hours after 
ingestion. For other functions, in particular those involving verbal facility, the results were variable, in 
some instances showing no adverse effect and even a slight acceleration. 
<p> The effect of 5 cc. of marihuana on global intellectual functioning was apparent within an hour from 
the time the drug was taken and was operative until four and a half hours after ingestion. All mental 
functions showed this early impairment but for some of them recovery from the adverse effect was earlier 
than for others. Those most severely impaired from point of view of duration were the ones dealing with 
number concepts.

<p> 
 The testing program was continued for only seven hours after the drug was taken and, therefore, any 
estimate of the effect of marihuana after this time is purely a subjective one. However, both the subject and 
the examiner felt that the drug produced a "hang-over" which in most cases continued into the following 
day. The subject complained of being headachy, sleepy, and unable to work at his usual level, and the 
examiner also noted that the subject did not work as well or as quickly when called upon to do something 
on a day following marihuana ingestion. 
<p> The impairment reported here is not entirely representative of the maximum impairment which 
occurs under the influence of marihuana. Two opposing variables account for the results obtained in the 
drugged condition. One variable is practice effect which tends to increase test scores with each succeeding 
trial. The other variable, the drug, tends to lower test scores. In the earlier sessions there was evidence that 
the marihuana, especially when given in large doses, is the more potent force, as seen by the continuing 
downward trend of the curve during the first few hours. In these earlier phases, in spite of repetition, results 
were lower with each succeeding trial, or if there was no actual loss, the increments made were never 
comparable to those made in the undrugged state. Three or four hours after drug administration there was a 
general trend toward rising scores. Some of this gain must be attributed to increased practice effect which 
was counteracting, in part at lea! 
! 
st, the deleterious effect of the marihuana. For this reason it is not certain that the drug was less effective at 
later points in the curve than it was at the moment of seemingly greatest impairment. This seems 
particularly plausible because, beginning with the third hour, the subject was no longer working on new 
tasks but was actually repeating identical tasks that he performed earlier in the day. Thus, at the third hour 
the test form used was the same as the one given at the initial session; at the end of the three-and-a-half-
hour period the form was the same as the one-hour examination, and so on. What is shown in the curves is 
the effect of marihuana on intellectual tasks with which the subject has become very familiar. For practical 
purposes the test situation has the advantage of being comparable with daily living since the tasks 
performed in daily routine are usually relatively familiar ones.

<strong>Speed Versus Power.</strong><br> 
Intellectual impairment under the influence of marihuana resulted from a loss in both speed and efficiency. 
There was a slowing up in output indicated by the difference in the number of items done before and after 
the administration of the drug. On the whole the number of test items attempted tended to increase at each 
succeeding examination period even when the subject was under the influence of marihuana, but the 
percentage of increase in the drugged state practically never equaled that attained for the corresponding 
time interval when the subject had not ingested the drug. The findings for the number of items done in the 
drugged and undrugged condition follow very closely the findings in respect to the number of items 
correctly done. From this it may be concluded that under the influence of marihuana an individual 
functions less rapidly and also less efficiently than when he has had no drug. 
<p> Careful analysis of what causes the loss in efficiency reveals that certain factors not necessarily 
related to mental ability per se were accountable for the reduced scores in the drugged state. For example, 
under the influence of the drug the subject felt dizzy, had blurred vision, or exhibited other handicapping 
physiological disturbances. These impeded his efficiency in putting his answer on the correct line, or 
marking a cross in the right box. Men were observed running their fingers across the page in an effort to 
keep their place. On the other hand, much of the intellectual loss can be ascribed to an impairment in the 
thinking processes, and there seemed to be a general confusion of ideas and inability to maintain a fixed 
goal. Some subjects reported that the reason they accomplished so little was that, by the time they had 
finished reading a question, they no longer remembered what their purpose in reading it had been. 
Occasionally perseveration of a form of respo! 
! 
nse specific to one test was found in a subsequent test. For example, some forms of the Same-Opposite test 
require the subject to mark the answer S or O. In a later test requiring a plus or minus response occasional 
irrelevant S's or O's appeared.

<a name="non"><strong>Comparison of the Effect of Marihuana on User and Non-
User.</strong></a><br> 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 
 When the group is divided into marihuana users and nonusers certain interesting and suggestive 
differences are revealed (Table 8). Although the general findings for total intelligence scores for the two 
groups follow similar curves, the deleterious effects were not as great on the user as on the non-user. Thus 
under 2 cc. of marihuana the user showed no real intellectual impairment except for a very short interval 
beginning about two and a half hours after ingestion and lasting for an hour or an hour and a half. In 
contrast to this he made gains both at the beginning of the testing and toward the end of the day which 
exceeded those made in the undrugged state. The non-user who had ingested 2 cc. of marihuana showed a 
definite drop in score beginning about two and a half hours after ingestion, and for a period from one and a 
half to two and a half hours after this time he did not make increments comparable to those which he made 
in the undrugged state. Following this, during t! 
! 
he last two hours of testing he, like the user, obtained scores which showed an acceleration not paralleled in 
the undrugged state.

<p> 
 Under 5 cc. of marihuana both the user and the non-user showed a 3 per cent loss in efficiency within an 
hour of the time that the drug was taken. Although recovery was slow for both groups, the user was less 
severely affected, as is indicated by the fact that at the next testing interval his score was only 1 per cent 
below his initial score as compared with a 7 per cent loss on the part of the non-user. The disparity in the 
degree of impairment for the two groups continued for several hours. The more marked drug effect in the 
case of the non-user was further evidenced by the fact that the user showed recovery four or four and a half 
hours after ingestion (as measured by the time when his scores approach those made when in the 
undrugged state) while the non-user, even at the end of seven hours of testing, did not approximate his 
undrugged performances. 
<p> 
No simple explanation of this difference is available. The most probable reason seems to be that previous 
use of the drug in some way serves to ameliorate that anxiety and inevitable disorganization which the use 
of any drug may have on an individual who has never taken it before. Another explanation may lie in 
possible physiological adaptation to the drug which, though not identical with tolerance in the ordinary 
pharmacological sense, seems to act in the same direction.<p> 
<strong>Variability.</strong><br> 
The results reported here are all in terms of averages. A study of individual scores indicates that there was 
marked variability in the effect of the drug on different subjects. In one case the drug action came early and 
soon disappeared. Another subject experienced no reaction until after he had eaten his lunch, at which time 
a very definite effect was apparent. A third subject showed impairment late in the day when the drug effect 
on almost all the other subjects had worn off. There were some hardy souls who did not appear to be 
affected by even large quantities of marihuana, while a few (mainly non-users) became so ill that they 
could not continue with the examinations. 
<p> 
<strong>Pyle's Digit Symbol Test 
</strong><br> 
Comparison of the results obtained on this test when the subject was in the undrugged condition and when 
he had had 2 cc. of marihuana reveals that small amounts of the drug did not interfere with his ability to 
carry out the appointed task (Table 9). In fact, as was noted above for certain other tests, the improvement 
in score at the end of two and a half or three hours was greater after the ingestion of 2 cc. of marihuana 
than it was when no drug had been administered, and at the end of the five-hour testing period there was a 
32 per cent increase in score as against a 22 per cent increase in the undrugged condition. 
<p> Under the influence of 5 cc. of marihuana, however, there was a decrease in ability occuring within 
an hour after the time the drug was administered. Although the scores show no actual loss as compared 
with the initial score, the increments did not equal those made in the undrugged condition until from four 
to four and a half hours after ingestion. 
<p> It may therefore be concluded that certain types of learning ability are not affected by small amounts 
(2 cc.) of marihuana, but are impaired when larger amounts (5 cc.) are ingested.

<strong>Cancelling a Geometric Form 
</strong><br> 
The results of this test are shown in Table 10.<br> 
With 2 cc. of marihuana, there was a slight falling off in the subject's efficiency occurring about three 
hours after drug ingestion. At that time he was 3 per cent less efficient than he had been an hour previous. 
With S cc. of marihuana there was a slowing up in the subject's ability to carry out the appointed task, 
which was apparent two hours after drug ingestion (and possibly earlier). At that time there was only a 4 
per cent increment over his initial score as compared with a 10 per cent increment in the undrugged state 
and a 12 per cent increment when the 2 cc. dosage had been administered. He improved only slightly at the 
three- and four-hour testing interval, and only at the five-hour interval did he show an appreciable 
improvement. 
<p> Apparently, the carrying out of a simple routine task is adversely affected to a slight degree and for a 
short period of time as the result of the ingestion of 2 cc. of marihuana while the ingestion of S cc. of the 
drug produces adverse effects which are more severe and more lasting. 
<p> 
<strong>PERFORMANCE TESTS 
</strong><br> 
<strong><em>Seguin Form Board.</em></strong><br> For adults of average intelligence this test is 
primarily one involving speed of reaction time. The average time taken by the subjects when they were not 
under the influence of marihuana was 12.8 seconds. This was increased to 14.0 and 14.1 seconds under 
doses of 2 cc. and 5 cc. respectively. Thus, ingestion of marihuana in 2 cc. and 5 cc. doses caused a 9 per 
cent delay in performance time. 
<p> 
<strong><em>Form Boards.</em></strong><br> 
The time scores for this test remained practically the same whether no drug, 2 cc. or 5 cc. of marihuana had 
been administered, the average scores in terms of mental age being respectively 11.7, 11.7 and 11.9 years. 
The error scores also showed little change as a result of drug ingestion, the averages in terms of mental age 
being 9.7 years (no marihuana), 9.9 years (2 cc.) and 10.2 years (5 cc.), and what change occurred was in a 
positive direction, that is, there was a very slight improvement in the subject's performance when he was 
under the influence of marihuana. 
<p> 
<strong><em>Kohs Block Design.</em></strong><br> 
This test correlates more highly with abstract intelligence than do any of the other performance tests. Here 
the drug had a definitely deleterious effect when it was administered in large amounts. The average score 
was 17.6 when the subjects were not under the influence of marihuana and 14.8 after they had ingested the 
drug; that is, under S cc. of marihuana there was a 16 per cent loss in score as compared with undrugged 
results. 
<p> In general it appears that those functions most closely as sociated with higher intellectual processes 
are more impaired by the drug than are the simpler functions. 
<p> 
<strong>MEMORY TESTS 
</strong><br> 
<strong><em>Rote Memory. </em></strong><br> 
 As measured by the ability to repeat digits forward there were no changes in rote memory as a result of 
drug ingestion, the average scores under no drug, 2 cc. of marihuana, and 5 cc. of marihuana being in each 
case 7.1. 
<p> 
<strong><em>Digits Reversed. </em></strong><br> 
 Although the giving of digits in reverse order is always grouped with memory tests this task actually 
requires something over and above mere recall. It demands a mental control not necessary in tests 
dependent purely upon rote memory. Although simple rote memory, as measured by the ability to repeat 
digits forward, was not affected by the ingestion of marihuana, the repetition of digits reversed was 
affected adversely. In the undrugged state the average for the group was 5.4, with 2 cc. the average was 
5.0, and with S cc. it was 4.8. The impairment was comparatively small but it seems to have been related to 
the amount of drug taken. 
<p> 
<strong><em>Object Memory. </em></strong><br> 
 The average scores under no drug, 2 cc. of marihuana, and 5 cc. of marihuana were respectively 6.2, 5.6, 
and 5.9- that is, there was a loss of about 9 per cent in the subject's ability to recall objects which had been 
exposed to his vision for three seconds when he took the test under the influence of 2 cc. of marihuana, 
while after the ingestion of 5 cc. the impairment was less, being only about 5 per cent. This seemingly 
contradictory result is probably due to the fact that by the time the subjects took the test under the influence 
of 5 cc. most of them had already had it two times previously. The loss in terms of absolute number of 
remembered articles was slight. 
<p> 
<strong><em>Visual Memory. </em></strong><br> 
 In this test as in the case of digits reversed something over and above simple memory function is involved. 
A capacity for analysis and synthesis which correlates well with intelligence is required for the successful 
execution of this task, and it is this function which is adversely affected by the ingestion of marihuana. The 
average scores were 10.3 (no drug), 9.7 (2 cc.) and 7.8 (5 cc.); that is, after the ingestion of 2 cc. of 
marihuana there was a 6 per cent drop in score, while under 5 cc. there was a 24 per cent drop. 
<p> In general one may conclude that simple memory functions are not affected by the administration of 
marihuana while the more complex memory functions are affected adversely, the extent of the impairment 
being related to the amount of drug taken. 
<p> Throughout the examination of subjects on individual tests, the same difference was observed in 
intensity of the effect upon user and non-user as was noted in group tests. 
<p> 
<a name="find2"><strong>EXPERIMENTS WITH MARIJUANA CIGARETTES</strong></a><br> 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 
<p> In addition to the tests made to determine the effect of the ingestion of marihuana on various 
intellectual functions, several experiments were tried with marihuana cigarettes. The tests used in this part 
of the study were the Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test; the Woody McCall Mixed Fundamentals Test, 
Form I, which consists of thirty-five examples requiring addition, subtraction, multiplication or division; a 
cancellation test in which the subject is required to cross out a specific number (in this instance the number 
8) wherever it appears on a sheet covered with rows of numbers; the Kohs Block Design Test; and the test 
for rote, object, and visual memory. 
<p> The subjects took the test series and individual tests twice, once without the drug and once after 
having smoked marihuana cigarettes. They were not given a specific number of cigarettes but were told to 
smoke until they felt "high." The number of cigarettes smoked to produce this effect ranged from two to 
seven. 
<p> The Mixed Fundamentals and cancellation tests were given as group tests and were repeated at half-
hour intervals for two and a half hours. In the series given when the subjects were "high," the first test was 
taken as soon as the cigarettes had been smoked. Time limit on each test was one and a half minutes. 
<p> The Bellevue Adult, Kohs, and memory tests were given as individual tests and were administered 
only twice, once before the subject had smoked marihuana cigarettes and once after he had become "high" 
from smoking them. If during the course of the examination he wanted another cigarette or the examiner 
had reason to suspect that he was no longer under the influence of the drug, more cigarettes were smoked. 
The number of cigarettes used during a three-hour testing period ranged from six to twelve. 
<p> In the cancellation, Kohs, and memory tests the subjects were so divided that half took the tests for 
the first time before they had smoked and half after they had smoked. In the Woody McCall Mixed 
Fundamentals Test more non-users had their first tests before they had smoked. The Bellevue Adult 
Intelligence Test was always given first without the drug during the two or three days immediately 
following the subject's admission. Four weeks later the test was repeated on 10 subjects while they were 
under the influence of marihuana cigarettes. 
<p> 
<strong>Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test 
</strong><br> 
Ten subjects, 5 users and 5 non-users, repeated this test under the influence of marihuana. The results are 
shown in Table 11.

<p> 
 Since the test taken when the subject was "high" was always his second experience with it, some 
allowance must be made for practice effect. Without drug the average I.Q. of these subjects was 101.6, 
while after they had smoked cigarettes it was 104.4. This increase of only 2.8 points is smaller than one 
would probably get with repetition occurring after such a short time interval. It may be concluded, 
therefore, that smoking marihuana cigarettes has some negative effect on intellectual functioning, in that 
the subject benefits less from previous experiences than he would if he had not smoked. 
<p> 
<strong>Woody McCall Mixed Fundamentals Test, Form 1 
</strong><br> 
This test was given to 24 subjects, 10 users and 14 non-users. From the results which are shown in Table 
12 it may be concluded that when the subject was "high" after smoking marihuana cigarettes there was a 
slowing up in his ability to do simple arithmetic calculations. This lag occurred within the first half-hour 
after smoking and continued for at least an hour. The deleterious effect was not such as to cause an actual 
loss in ability but the increments resulting from repeated practice were never as great in the drugged as in 
the undrugged state. Thus, the initial increment was 10 per cent in the test given before smoking and only 4 
per cent in the one administered after the subject had become "high." The final increment at the end of two 
and a half hours was 20 per cent without drug, 13 per cent with drug. 
<p> This test measures the subject's ability to use acquired knowledge. Under the influence of marihuana 
cigarettes the capacity for using such an acquired skill is not lost but is slowed down. The adverse effect of 
smoking marihuana in cigarette form occurs almost immediately in contrast to the delayed action of the 
pills.

<strong>Cancelling 8's 
</strong><br> 
Sixteen subjects, 8 users and 8 non-users, took this test, the results of which are shown in Table 13. As a 
result of smoking marihuana cigarettes the subject worked a little slower in his execution of a routine task 
than he did when he had not smoked. The increment over the initial score in the test score made a half-hour 
after he became "high" was only 7 per cent as against an increment of 9 per cent when the cigarettes had 
not been smoked. His performance was slowed up for one hour after smoking and possibly longer.

<strong>Kohs Block Design Test 
</strong><br> 
This test, which measures performance ability, was given to a total of 9 subjects, 6 users and 3 non-users. 
The average score without the drug was 18.5, and after cigarettes had been smoked 14.7. This difference in 
score of 3.8 points indicates a loss in efficiency of 21 per cent. 
<p> 
<strong>MEMORY TESTS 
</strong><br> 
<strong><em>Rote Memory.</em></strong><br> 
 Thirteen users and 9 non-users took this test. Neither in repeating digits forward nor in giving them in 
reverse did the subjects show any disadvantageous effects from the use of marihuana cigarettes, the 
average scores before and after smoking being 6.9 and 7.1 respectively for the digits forward test and 5.2 
and 5.1 for the digits reversed test. The only explanation for this deviation from the results obtained when 
marihuana was taken in pill form is the inability to control the dosage when marihuana is given in cigarette 
form. 
<p> 
<strong><em>Object Memory.</em></strong><br> 
Thirteen subjects took this test. Object memory was not impaired by the smoking of marihuana, the 
average scores being 6.8 before the cigarettes were smoked and 7.1 when the subjects were "high." 
<p> 
<strong><em>Visual Memory.</em></strong><br> 
There was an .8 point loss (from 10-5 to 9.7) in the average score of the 20 subjects, 11 users and 9 non-
users, who took this test. This represents an impairment of about 8 per cent. 
<p> 
<strong>EFFECT OF MARIJUANA CIGARETTES ON USERS AND NON-USERS 
</strong><br> 
The difference in intensity of effect of marihuana cigarettes on the user and on the non- user was not the 
same as the difference in the effect of the marihuana concentrate on these two groups. The user was usually 
more affected by smoking marihuana than was the non-user, probably because the nonuser did not smoke 
as much or as intensely as the user and was not as much under the influence of the drug. 
<p> 
<a name="women"><strong>EFFECTS ON WOMEN</strong></a><br> 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 
 
 Five women were used in this experiment, 1 marihuana user and 4 non-users. The group as a whole was 
of average in telligence, with an I.Q. of 101.3, range 85 to 115, on Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test. Verbal 
I.Q. was 101.0, range 89 to 116; performance I.Q. 101.5, range 83 to 117. Average age for the group was 
30.3 years, range 28 to 34. 
<p> The tests used and the procedure employed were the same for the women as for the meri with the 
following exceptions: (1) the Army Alpha test was given every hour instead of every half-hour; (2) no 
form board tests were given; (3) no group tests with cigarettes were given. 
<p> Test results for the female subjects were not entirely like those obtained for the men. In the case of 
the women, intellectual impairment, as measured by Army Alpha total scores, was more severe and lasting 
under 2 cc. of marihuana than it was under 3 to 5 cc. This was also true of learning ability as measured by 
Pyle's Digit Symbol test. The ability to carry out a routine task showed impairment only when tested under 
the influence of 3 to 5 cc. of the drug. The ingestion of the drug in either dosage brought about an 
improvement in rote memory (digits forward), while in the digits reversed test there was an impairment 
under 2 cc. and no change under 5 cc. Object memory remained unchanged when the subject had had 2 cc. 
of marihuana, and was slightly impaired with 3 to 5 cc. and cigarettes. There was a drop in score for visual 
memory (Army Designs Test) under both 2 cc. and 5 cc. of the drug. Kohs Block Design Test (a 
performance test which requires integrative functioning! 
! 
 at higher intellectual levels) was given only twice, once without the drug and once with 5 cc. There was a 
loss in efficiency on this test when taken under marihuana which was comparable to that reported for the 
men. 
<p> It should be noted that the performance of the female subjects showed great variability. The 
variability may have been due either to the small number of subjects employed, or to their special selection, 
or both, and the findings can only be considered suggestive of possible trends. The fact that in some tests 
the subjects were more adversely affected by 2 cc. of marihuana than by larger doses is probably due to the 
fact that the 2 cc. dose was always administered before the larger dosage, and possibly also to the 
seemingly greater suggestibility of this particular group of women. 
<p> 
<a name="con"><strong>CONCLUSIONS 
</strong></a><br> 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 
<ol> 
<li>Marihuana taken either in pill or in cigarette form has a transitory adverse effect on mental 
functioning. 
<li>The extent of intellectual impairment, the time of its onset, and its duration are all related to the 
amount of drug taken. Small doses cause only slight falling off in mental ability while larger doses result in 
greater impairment. The deleterious effect is measurable earlier with large doses than with small ones, and 
the impairment continues for a greater length of time with large doses than with small ones. 
<li>The degree of intellectual impairment resulting from the presence of marihuana in the system varies 
with the function tested. The more complex functions are more severely affected than the simpler ones. 
<li>In general, non-users experience greater intellectual impairment for longer periods of time than the 
users do. This suggests the possibility of an habituation factor. 
<li>The falling off in ability which occurs when an individual has taken marihuana is due to a loss in both 
speed and accuracy. 
<li>Indulgence in marihuana does not appear to result in mental deterioration.

<a name="emot"><strong>EMOTIONAL REACTIONS AND GENERAL PERSONALITY 
STRUCTURE</strong></a> 
<br>Florence Halpern, MA 
<p><em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 
 The purpose of this part of the study was twofold: to discover (1) what effect marihuana has on the 
emotional reactivity of the person taking it, and (2) what differences in emotional reaction and general 
personality structure exist between the marihuana user and non-user. 
<p> 
<a name="test2"><strong>TESTS</strong></a><p> 
Two types of tests are available for studying personality. These are the paper-pencil tests and the projective 
tests. Projective techniques which reveal the subjects personality through his treatment of the test material 
are generally more valid and more revealing than the paper-pencil tests which require the underlining of 
words or the answering of "Yes" or "No" to a list of questions. This is true of all subjects but seemed to 
apply more particularly to those used in this study. Such tests as the Psychosomatic Inventory and the Bell 
Adjustment Test were tried out in the initial stages of the investigation but were soon discontinued as the 
subjects gave continued evidence of a desire to ingratiate themselves with, or to make a showing for, the 
examiner. Questions whose intent was obvious were almost invariably answered as the subject thought the 
examiner wanted them to be or as he thought would look best on his record. For this reason most of the 
tests employed were those who! 
! 
se purposes were less easily interpreted by the subjects. 
<p> 
<strong>Rorschach Test 
</strong><br>One of the primary tests employed for examining the personality of the subjects was the 
Rorschach Test. It consists of ten standardized ink blots printed on 7- by 9 1/2-inch white cards. Some of 
the blots are black, some red and black, and some multicolored. The cards are presented to the subject one 
at a time and he states what they look like to him, what he sees. The manner in which the subject interprets 
the plates gives an indication of his formal approach to various types of situations. The extent and 
directions of the subject's affective reactions, his drive, his ability to make good social adjustment, and his 
emotional stability are some of the personality traits which can be determined on the basis of this test. 
<p> 
<strong>Goodenough Test (Drawing of a Man) 
</strong><br>This test was standardized originally as an intelligence test for children, but clinical use has 
demonstrated its value as an instrument for personality diagnosis. The subject is given a sheet of paper 8Y2 
by 11 inches and asked to draw the figure of a man. In his drawing he unconsciously portrays his own body 
image so that the picture by its emphasis and omissions betrays which body parts are important or 
unimportant to him -how he sees himself. Although results from this type of interpretation have not, to our 
knowledge, been standardized, they may nevertheless be used for comparing the marihuana user and non-
user in terms of their attitudes toward their body images and for noting the differences in these concepts 
before and after the administration of marihuana. 
<p> 
<strong>Level of Aspiration Test 
</strong><br>The purpose of a Level of Aspiration Test is to ascertain the relationship between the goal a 
person sets for himself and the level of his performance. Roughly, there are three possible reactions: (1) the 
individual, in an attempt to protect his ego, sets himself so low a goal that he must inevitably reach or 
surpass it; (2) he exposes his ego to failure for overevaluating his ability and sets a goal which he cannot 
possibly reach or surpass; or (3) he sets a goal commensurate with his ability. 
<p> The test devised for this experiment is a very simple one. The subject is required to place sixteen 
colored cubes in a box, red side up. Before beginning he is asked to estimate how long it will take to 
complete the task. He is then given the signal to proceed and at the end of the trial is told how much time 
was actually consumed. On the basis of this result, the subject is again asked to state how much time he 
thinks he will need to fulfill the task and again at its completion is told how long it actually took him. The 
subject's estimate given before he had any actual experience with the test is disregarded. From the nine 
subsequent trials, averages of the subject's estimate (the goal he set for himself) and of his actual 
performance times are calculated. The difference between these two averages gives a measure of his level 
of aspiration. 
<p> 
<strong>Frustration Test 
</strong><br>When a person is prevented from finishing a task correctly,thus being left with an 
incomplete gestalt, he has definite feelings of frustration. His reactions to such feelings will vary depending 
upon his general manner of emotional response. In this investigation, the method used to frustrate the 
subjects was to present them with a series of relatively simple mazes (Wechsler Self-Administering 
Mazes), the third or fourth one being so blocked off that no exit is possible. The subject is highly praised 
for his performance on the first two or three and, when he becomes involved in the closed one, is 
aggravated by the comments of the examiner concerning the success of some of the other men with this 
identical maze. After fifteen seconds of futile attempts to get out the subject is told that his time is up. 
Immediately after this he is given the Level of Aspiration Test, the assumption being that frustration might 
affect this level in some way. 
<p> 
<strong>Binet Lines 
</strong><br>Suggestibility is a specific rather than a general trait and can therefore be interpreted only 
with reference to the situation in which it is tested. For example, a man may be very responsive to the 
suggestions of his attractive secretary but negativistic to those of his business rival. 
<p> 
<strong>Binet's Suggestibility Test</strong><br> 
Binet's Suggestibility Test, which consists of twelve rectangular pieces of cardboard on which are drawn 
lines of varying length, was used in this investigation. The length of the first five lines increases by specific 
amounts, the sixth line does not increase but is identical with the fifth, the seventh line again is longer; the 
eighth is its equivalent; and so on. The assumption is that the progressive increase of the first five lines will 
influence the suggestible person and he will continue to increase the lines for some time before he becomes 
aware of the fact that they are no longer consistently lengthening. 
<p> The following directions are given: "I want to see how well you can estimate length. I am going to 
show you some cards each with a line drawn on it. Some of the lines are long and some are short. I'll show 
you each card for just two seconds and when I take it away you must draw the line. Try to make it exactly 
the length of the line on the card." The subject is given a sheet of paper which has a vertical line drawn 
about half an inch in from the left-hand edge of the paper. Numbers, placed about half an inch apart, 
appear inside this margin, beginning at the top with number 1 and going through number 12. The subject is 
told to begin his line opposite the number and right up against the vertical-line margin. As soon as he has 
drawn his line it is covered with the card and the next card is presented. 
<p> Results are scored in accordance with Binet's method. The average amount of increase (measured in 
sixteenths of an inch) for the even lines which actually should not increase is divided by the average 
increase in the odd lines which should increase, and the quotient is multiplied by 100. 
<p> 
<strong>Wechsler Vocational Interest Blank 
</strong><br>The Wechsler Vocational Interest Blank consists of a list of forty jobs or vocations, each 
followed by the letter "L" or "D." These vocations may be classed as professional, artistic, industrial, or 
manual. The subject is told that for the moment he is to assume that each job pays the same amount and 
that he has the training and ability to do any of them. The only thing to influence his choice of a job is his 
own inclination, that is, whether or not that type of work appeals to him. If it does he is told to encircle the 
"L," but if it does not he is to encircle the "D." The choice of certain constellations of jobs, such as 
painting, teaching, and working in a florist shop, indicates a general feminine trend, while preference for 
others gives evidence of strongly masculine inclinations. Again, the selection of many positions may be 
taken to indicate an active, outgoing nature, while a small number of likes reflects a less active, more 
critical attitude. 
<p> 
<strong>Loofbourrow Personal Index: Test 1 
</strong><br>This test is given to adolescent boys to measure their proneness to delinquency. In this study 
it was employed as a measure of self-confidence. It consists of one hundred words of which thirty are 
nonexistent, that is, words which look like unusual but real words but which are actually not part of the 
English language. If at any time, drugged or undrugged, a subject indicates familiarity with a significantly 
larger number of words than on another occasion, the assumption is that the increase in vocabulary 
corresponds to a rise in the subject's estimate of his own ability and mental capacity. 
<p> 
<strong>Wechsler Free Association Test 
</strong><br>This test consists of a list of forty-five words chosen for their obvious value in personality 
study. The examiner reads the words one at a time to the subject and records his responses and his reaction 
time in fifths of a second. Reaction times and average deviation are computed for each subject, and those 
words for which the reaction time is delayed, that is, words which fall beyond the limits of the average 
deviation, are considered disturbing stimuli. 
<p> 
<strong>Pressey X-O Test 
</strong><br>There are four parts to this test, each one consisting of twenty-five lines of five words each. 
In Test I the subject is asked to cross out every word whose meaning is unpleasant to him and to encircle 
the one word in each row whose meaning is the most unpleasant. In Test II each row of words is preceded 
by a word in large print and the subject is instructed to cross out every word in the row which is connected 
in his mind with the word in large letters at the beginning of the row. At the end of this test the subject 
encircles the one word in each row which he most closely associates with the word in large letters. Test III 
requires the subject to cross out every word he thinks has a bad meaning and then to encircle the one thing 
in each row he thinks is worst. Test IV follows the same procedure, only here the subject crosses out 
everything he has ever worried about and encircles the one thing in each row he has worried about most. 
Norms have been established on c! 
! 
ollege students, giving the average number of words crossed out and the modal word to be encircled. 
<p> 
<strong>Downey Will-Temperament Test: Test I 
</strong><br>This test consists of a series of paired personality traits such as sociable or unsociable, 
clumsy or graceful. The subject is asked to underscore the trait of each pair which he thinks de scribes him 
more accurately. The test is not intended as a self-rating personality index, and therefore there are no norms 
for responses of this nature. It was used in this study solely to determine if the ingestion of marihuana 
produces changes in the individual's self-evaluation as indicated by a comparison of the traits he thinks 
apply to him when he is in his normal condition and when he is under the influence of the drug. 
<p> 
<strong>Thematic Apperception Test 
</strong><br>This test employs a series of pictures which are handed to the subject one at a time with the 
following directions: "This is a test of creative imagination. I am going to show you some pictures. Around 
each picture I want you to compose a story. Outline the incidents which have led up to the situation shown 
in the picture, describe what is occurring at the moment-the feelings and thoughts of the characters; and tell 
what the outcome will be. Speak your thoughts aloud as they come to your mind. I want you to use your 
imagination to the limit." Productions are recorded verbatim. Scoring takes into account the needs of the 
subject as revealed in his stories and the environmental forces acting upon him. 
<p> 
 
<a name="proc3"><strong>PROCEDURE</strong></a><br> 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 
<p> All the tests dealing with emotional reactions were given as individual tests. Although they are not as 
subject to practice effect as the Intelligence tests, practice does alter the results somewhat. For this reason 
every possible effort was made to give examinations during drugged and undrugged periods as far apart in 
time as possible and to divide the groups so that half the subjects took the initial examination while under 
the influence of marihuana and the other half before the administration of the drug. 
<p> 
<strong>Rorschach Test 
</strong><br>This test was given once without marihuana and once under maximum dosage (3 cc. to 6 
cc.) or with cigarettes, the number of cigarettes smoked being optional with the subject. Four subjects took 
the test three times, once without the drug, once with the drug in pill form, and once with cigarettes, but it 
was found impracticable to give the test more than twice in four weeks both because of the time it 
consumed and because of the subjects' growing boredom with it. In all, 45 subjects, 27 users and 18 non-
users, took this test. 
<p> 
<strong>Goodenough, Level of Aspiration, Binet Lines, Vocational Interest Tests and Downey Test 1 
</strong><br> 
These tests were given to all subjects at least twice and some subjects took them as often as four times, that 
is, without the drug, under 2 cc., under 5 cc., and after smoking marihuana cigarettes. The number of times 
a subject was tested was determined primarily by the amount of time available. Twenty-seven users and 18 
non-users took the Goodenough, Level of Aspiration and Vocational Interest Tests; 25 users and 17 non-

<strong>Frustration, Free Association, and Pressey X-O Tests, and Loofbourrow Test I 
</strong><br> 
These tests were added later in the testing program and were therefore given to a limited number of 
subjects. They were administered twice once without marihuana and once either with cigarettes or with 
large oral doses (3 cc. to 5 cc.). 
<p> 
<strong>Thematic Apperception Test 
</strong><br> 
In an effort to conserve time, the administration of this test was not in accordance with the directions. 
Instead of relating the story to the examiner, the subject sat in a room by himself and recited his tale into 
the dictaphone. In addition to the time saved, this had the advantage of sparing the subject considerable 
embarrassment, since most of the men were very selfconscious about telling these stories when anyone was 
present. The disadvantage of this procedure lay in the examiner's inability to persuade the subject to give a 
fuller story. The test was given to each subject twice, once with and once without cigarettes. Only the 
following pictures were used: 3, 4, S. M-11, M-12, M-13, M-1S, M-18, M-19, M-20, F-14, and F-19. 
Although the results showed promise of interesting findings, the administration of the test was limited to 
only 9 subjects because so many mechanical difficulties were involved.

<strong>Rorschach Test 
</strong><br> 
Table 14 gives the Rorschach findings for 45 subjects both in the undrugged and drugged states. The 
measurable changes on the test which occurred during the period of drug intoxication were few and not far-
reaching. They may be considered indications of tendencies rather than of significant alterations of the 
personality.

<p> 
 When the subjects were under the influence of marihuana (either 3-6 cc. or cigarettes, the number of 
cigarettes being at the discretion of the smoker) there was a slightly freer flow of associations than there 
was when they were in the undrugged state, an increased productivity which coincided with the 
impressions obtained from general observation of the subjects when they were "high." Without drug the 
average number of interpretations made was 20.0, with drug 23.3. This increased number of responses was 
due primarily to the subject's greater awareness of small, extraneous details which in his undrugged state he 
overlooked. Thus, while 17 per cent of the subjects' answers were small or rare detail responses when no 
marihuana had been administered, with marihuana this increased to 21 per cent. Coincidental with his 
increased absorption in the irrelevant there was a slight decrease in the subject's drive to organize and 
synthesize. Whereas without drug 40 per cent of the resp! 
! 
onses involved the entire blot, with drug this was true of only 36 per cent of the interpretations. Under the 
influence of marihuana there was a mild tendency for the subject to become preoccupied with minutiae 
rather than to concern himself with the larger, more important aspects of a situation, and this implies some 
falling off in meaningful constructive behavior. 
<p> When the subject had taken marihuana there was some decrease in the objectivity with which he 
sized up situations. This was indicated by the fact that without drug 92 per cent of his interpretations were 
good form, that is, they corresponded to the form of the blot, while with drug this percentage fell to 86 per 
cent. The drug had an adverse effect on the individual's critical faculty and he was more prone to jump to 
erroneous conclusions than he was when he was in the undrugged state. 
<p> The only other change that occurred on the Rorschach test after the ingestion of marihuana was the 
decrease in the subject's ability to think in line with the group. This showed itself in the decreased number 
of popular interpretations made, the drop being from 27 per cent without drug to 20 per cent with drug. In 
other words, during the period of drug intoxication an individual is somewhat less likely to see the obvious 
and the commonplace than he is in his normal state. 
<p> As important, or possibly even more important, than the changes which occurred on the Rorschach 
after ingestion or smoking of marihuana, is the fact that some of the most basic personality attributes 
remained unchanged. Thus it appeared that 33 per cent of the subjects in the undrugged state were what is 
described as introversive, that is, they were individuals who tend to withdraw somewhat from the world 
about them and depend primarily on their own inner resources for emotional stimulation; 20 per cent were 
extraversive, depending mainly on their environment for affective satisfaction; 20 per cent were ambivert, 
showing equal potentialities in both directions; and 27 per cent were emotionally constricted to the point 
where they gave little or no evidence of emotional response of any type. With drug 36 per cent were 
introversive, 22 per cent were extraversive, 20 per cent were ambivert, and 22 per cent were constricted. 
Marihuana ingestion or smoking served to dilate the! 
! 
 emotional life of only 2 of the subjects and shifted the type of 1. In all 3 cases the change was actually a 
very slight one. The fact that the emotional trends remain essentially unchanged under the influence of 
marihuana was further revealed by the fact that the ratio for evaluating the individual's emo tional type, that 
is, the ratio of movement to color, remained roughly the same before and after he had taken the drug, being 
2.3:1.6 when he was in the undrugged state and 2.9:2.1 when he was in the drugged phase. 
<p> Although the quantitative changes occurring with marihuana ingestion or smoking were not large, 
there was a qualitative difference in the protocols obtained from the subjects in the undrugged and drugged 
stages. Not only was there a slight increase in the actual number of interpretations made, but the amount of 
talking and extraneous comment increased. The subject played around with answers and often repeated 
them. He seemed anxious to get his every thought clearly across to his audience. More than this, he was 
much freer in the type of interpretation he allowed himself. For example, one interpretation on Card II 
read: "Two dogs. Now wait a minute. I don't want to jump to conclusions but it looks as if the dogs were 
having intercourse and there was a rupture." This response was not repeated when the subject was retested 
in the undrugged state. Nor was this individual unique in showing this qualitative difference. The 
disinhibition and lessening of restraint which was a d! 
! 
efinitely observable effect of the drug was also reflected in the assured explanations and lengthy tirades 
which the subject offered on topics which in his undrugged state he would undoubtedly feel were beyond 
him. Thus one subject interpreted Card X as "old bark of trees, roots dried up. It's thousands of years old; it 
takes thousands of years to do that. I got to tell you that. I got to cover for you. You wouldn't know about a 
thousand years ago. I'm smart now." In some instances the "cockiness" induced by his drugged condition 
produced an entirely new attitude in the subject. Instead of the customary deferential, almost ingratiating 
approach there was now a confident "know-it-all" manner. 
<p> The effects of marihuana ingestion on user and non-user were essentially the same, as indicated by 
the findings in Table 14, except that on the whole the alterations which did occur were more marked for the 
non-user than for the user. Thus, for example, while the average number of responses given by the user 
increased only 11 per cent, those of the non-user rose 26 per cent. Again, the user when drugged gave only 
6 per cent fewer whole answers as against a decrease of 15 per cent in the whole responses of the non-user 
in the drugged state. The user showed a 29 per cent increase in small detail interpretations, the non-user 31 
per cent. There was only a 2 per cent drop in good form interpretation by the user as against a 12 per cent 
drop for the non-user. Only in the loss of popular interpretations did the user exceed the non-user, his 
falling off being as great as 31 per cent as compared with 24 per cent for the non-user. While the number of 
subjects in both groups was t! 
! 
oo small to allow of definite statements, the trend seemed to indicate that the ingestion or smoking of 
marihuana has a greater adverse or disorganizing effect on the neophyte than on the experienced smoker, 
again, as was the case in the study of mental functioning, suggesting the possibility of psychological 
habituation. 
<p> When the protocols obtained from these marihuana users in their undrugged state are compared with 
those of the nonusers or with the norms postulated for average adults of this age level, certain deviating 
personality traits in these users may be noted. The most striking deviation is the small percentage of users 
who showed an extraversive personality. Only 15 per cent of the marihuana users used in this study 
responded primarily to emotional stimuli in the world about them as compared with 28 per cent of the non-
users. While no definite figures are given in the literature for the degree of extraversion in the general 
population, it seems definitely more than 15 per cent. Altogether the personality types among the non-users 
show a much more even distribution than those among the users as seen in Table 15. Judging by the 
personality types the majority of marihuana users lack social ease and adroitness and are likely to find it 
difficult to make good outgoing social contact!

<p> 
 Sixty-two per cent of the marihuana users' interpretations were determined by the form or outline of the 
blot. Such responses require an objective critical attitude unmodified by emotional factors. However, when 
this attitude is maintained to the point where more than 50 per cent of the answers are of this nature the 
individual has a constricted affective life the degree of constriction being in proportion to the increase in 
form interpretations Thus, as was previously noted, there was more than average emotional inhibition 
evident among the marihuana users studied in this experiment. Since emotional inhibition frequently 
causes intellectual constriction it is not surprising to find that the stereotypy in these records was slightly 
above expectancy, as indicated by the fact that 59 per cent of the responses were animal or animal detail 
interpretations as compared with a norm of from 25 to 50 per cent. 
<p> Finally the marihuana users (as well as the non-users in this experiment) showed a depressive 
outlook in that more of their responses were determined by the gray and black colors than by the vivid 
colors. In interpreting this fact it must be borne in mind that the subjects were all prisoners and their 
depressive attitude may have been a reflection of their present situation rather than of a basic trait. 
<p> 
<strong>Goodenough Test (Drawing of a Man) 
</strong><br> 
This test is helpful in studying each individual both in the drugged and undrugged state, but group results 
are not meaningful (except for one finding given below) because of a lack of similarity both in the 
drawings obtained in the undrugged state and in the direction of change which occurred after drug 
ingestion or smoking. However, certain qualitative findings proved interesting and are therefore reported 
here. In a number of cases the identical drawing was produced in the undrugged, 2 cc., 5 cc., and cigarette 
state, but the size of the figure increased consistently with the amount of marihuana taken. This increase in 
size may have been a reflection of a physical sensation induced by the drug, rnay have been due to a 
tendency to macrographia which was noted in the writing of some subjects, or may have been the 
psychological representation of increased feelings of confidence and security. 
<p> With marihuana there was an increase in the percentage of subjects who remembered to give their 
man ears. This again may have been due to a heightened awareness of ears because of physical or auditory 
sensations or might denote a greater receptivity to what others have to say. 
<p> In some cases the amount of time consumed in execution of the drawings was considerably greater 
when the subject was "high." This additional time was rarely used for elaborating the picture but was 
caused by the subject's altered mood. In many instances the laughter and joking in which he indulged kept 
him from completing the job with dispatch. In other cases depression or nausea slowed him up. Although 
aware of the details which should be included, the subject was often satisfied to indicate such items by a 
single line or dash rather than discipline himself to the point where he could make a careful picture. In 
some of these cases the drawing had attributes which resemble the findings sometimes seen in productions 
of individuals in a manic mood. 
<p> When a person is given a sheet of paper and is asked to draw a man on it, the paper and the figure he 
draws become the situation he must manipulate. If the figure is well centered so that the finished product 
gives a balanced composition, the subject has handled the circumstance in adequate fashion. The one 
consistent finding for this test was the fact that the subject's ability to handle situations was not improved 
by drug ingestion or smoking. In the case of both user and non-user the percentage of balanced 
compositions produced in the various drug states did not change from the results obtained in the undrugged 
condition. It is, however, interesting to note that 59 per cent of the marihuana users made "unbalanced" 
drawings in the undrugged state as compared with only 29 per cent of the non-users. It may be inferred 
from this that fewer users than non-users are inclined to come out into the center of the scene. This carries 
with it implications of poor adjustment and i! 
! 
nsecurity. 
<p> 
<strong>Level of Aspiration Test 
</strong><br> 
In the undrugged state the majority of the subjects manifested reactions which are usual in the experience 
of other experiments, namely, the tendency to place their estimate just a little above their actual 
performance. This was demonstrated by the fact that while the average performance time needed for 
carrying out a set task (putting sixteen blocks in a box, red side up) was 23.6 seconds, the subjects' average 
estimate for accomplishing this was 21.9 seconds. As their performance improved with practice, the 
subjects tended to allow themselves less time for the job. Such statements as, "I should do better this time," 
or "I'll take a chance," were not infrequent. Some subjects wanted to know the best score ever made, and 
worked energetically to attain it. 
<p> With 2 cc. of marihuana there was a slight increase in the average estimated time for the entire group 
although there was no concomitant increase in performance time. Under this dosage the estimated time was 
23.1 seconds, performance time 23.4 seconds. Although the subject actually took no longer to do the job he 
thought he would work more slowly and in predicting his achievement gave himself more time. His 
attitude during the test was a much easier, more happy go-lucky one. He occasionally stopped in the middle 
of the experiment to discuss something with the examiner or call out to someone passing in the hall. There 
thus appeared to be a small loss in drive which, though not revealed by significant statistical differences, 
was indicated by the numerical trend and by the subject's attitude toward the test. 
<p> After the ingestion of 5 cc. of marihuana the average estimated time was 23.2 seconds and the 
performance time 24.4 seconds. Here the relationship between estimated and performance time was similar 
to that found in the undrugged phase, that is, there was a 1.2 second gap between them. During this drug 
phase the subjects seemed less relaxed than they were under 2 cc., and their main interest seemed to be to 
get back to bed and be left undisturbed. 
<p> Under the influence of marihuana cigarettes the trend was similar to that found with 2 cc., the 
difference between the estimated time and the performance time being only 0.3 second. As with 2 cc., 
subjecfs behavior was generally happy and relaxed. 
<p> When the group was divided into users and non-users the trend was the same for both.

<p> 
 On the whole it appears that small doses of marihuana and of marihuana cigarettes tend to lower the 
individual level of aspiration, that is, there is a slight lessening in the subject's drive and his will to achieve. 
Larger doses (5 cc.) do not produce this effect. 
<p> 
<strong>Frustration Test 
</strong><br> 
The results of the frustration experiment indicated no statistically significant differences between the 
subject's reactions before and after he had taken marihuana. Again, after the ingestion of marihuana there 
was a slight trend toward lowering the level of aspiration (Table 17), but the over-all change was not 
startling when compared with results on the Level of Aspiration Test when no frustrating experience was 
introduced.

<strong>Binet Lines 
</strong><br> 
Binet's interpretation of this test was based upon the principle that suggestible individuals, once embarked 
on a particular form of activity (in this instance, drawing lines of increasing length), ale more prone to 
continue this activity when the stimulus is altered than are less suggestible people. Judging by the results as 
given in Table 18, small doses of marihuana (2 cc. and cigarettes) induced thus type of perseverative 
behavior in the users but not in the non- users. In other words, the marihuana user when under the 
influence of the drug tended to continue an activity he had started without being too discriminatory or 
controlled about it. The non-user, on the other hand, showed a curtailment in activity and responsiveness. 
One possible explanation of this difference in effect on user and non-user appears to lie in the fact that the 
drug made the user more relaxed and easy-going and less controlled in motor activity than he was in his 
undrugged state, while the non-user ! 
! 
was often more tense and disturbed. As was so often the case in the personality tests, the effect on the user 
of large doses of the drug (S cc.) was contrary to that of the small ones, probably because in many cases he 
was made physically uncomfortable and intellectually disorganized.

<p> 
 The lack of consistency in the findings seems to suggest that the individual's psychological and 
physiological "set" toward the drug affects his reaction and behavior. Thus small doses, which the 
marihuana user anticipates with pleasure make him more easy-going and therefore probably more 
suggestible than he would be in his undrugged state, while large doses have a contrary effect. The non-
user, on the other hand, appears to be less suggestible as a result of drug ingestion than he ordinarily is. 
<p> 
<strong>Wechsler Vocational Interest Blank 
</strong><br> 
The average number of positions chosen by the subjects when they were in the undrugged state was 13.2. 
With 2 cc. of marihuana the average was 12.9; with 5 cc., 12.7; and with cigarettes, 11.8. There was a very 
slight but not statistically significant trend toward a decrease in job interest. However, the absence of any 
appreciable change in the number of positions liked after the ingestion or smoking of marihuana indicates 
that no real withdrawal is implied. 
<p> Analysis of the type of position chosen shows that under the influence of marihuana there was no 
swing to the more feminine occupations, but in the case of some subjects, especially marihuana users, there 
was a falling off in the popularity of some jobs which require considerable activity. For example, under the 
influence of 2 cc. of marihuana or of marihuana cigarettes the jobs of detective, policeman and taxi driver 
were found among his least desired occupations though they were not in this place when he was in the 
undrugged state. 
<p> The trend was the same for the user and the non-user in both the drugged and undrugged phase. For 
the user the jobs of aviator, gymnasium teacher, newspaper reporter, sailor and soldier were most 
frequently chosen; for the non-user aviator, doctor, explorer, forest ranger, newspaper reporter and prize 
fighter were most popular. 
<p> 
<strong>Loofbourrow Personal Index: Test I 
</strong><br> 
Before taking marihuana, the user and non-user on an average indicated familiarity with an identical 
number of words, 65.2. After he had smoked marihuana cigarettes, the user's vocabulary showed a gain of 
6 words, the non-user's 5 words. In both cases the subject's confidence in his verbal capacity was enhanced 
by the use of marihuana. 
<p> 
<strong>Wechsler Free Association Test 
</strong><br> 
In the undrugged state the user and non-user were disturbed by the same stimulus words, namely "lonely," 
"passionate," "insult," and "sin." The only differences were the disturbance the user showed in response to 
the words "wish" and "murder" and the delayed reaction of the non-user to the word "pity." 
<p> Under the influence of 5 cc. of marihuana or of marihuana cigarettes the user was less disturbed by 
all these words with the possible exception of "insult," but there was a sharp increase in the agitation 
aroused by the words "suicide" and "death." It appears that the feeling of well-being produced by the drug 
tended to alleviate the loneliness, guilt, and frustration which the subject felt, but it was also accompanied 
by a fear of death. This may be tied up with the anxiety the marihuana user always experiences in regard to 
the amount of drug he is taking, the always present fear of his "blowing his top," or it may be a reflection 
of the problems which were most disturbing to him. 
<p> The non-user, after taking marihuana, was also less disturbed by the words "lonely," "passionate," 
and "sin." His reaction to "pity" was also diminished but he, too, was still upset by the word "insult." The 
new disturbing stimulus words were not those which upset the user but those which were more closely 
related to his own immediate problems namely "honest," "money," and "sex." Since the non-user in our 
group was generally an individual who had been sent to prison because of stealing or a sex offense, it 
seems it was these problems which the disinhibiting action of the drug brought to the fore. 
<p> 
<strong>Pressey X-O Test 
</strong><br> 
This test was taken by only 10 subjects, 5 users and 5 nonusers. In general, the smoking of marihuana 
brought about some increase in the number of words which had an unpleasant meaning to the subject and 
in the number of things about which he had worried. There was some decrease in the number of things for 
which the drugged subject thought a person should be blamed. The number of his associations with any 
one word remained roughly the same in the drugged and undrugged state. 
<p> Although less inclined to censure when under the influence of marihuana, the subject was 
nevertheless more readily disturbed and worried. This undercurrent of irritability and anxiety seemed to be 
a concomitant of the more obvious feeling of general well-being which is the predominant effect of the 
drug. Two possible explanations can be given here for this finding: the physiological changes occurring 
with the smoking -of the drug gave the subject a feeling of anxiety, and the disinhibition which occurred at 
this time released the restraints which had been imposed not only on the happier reactions but on all the 
repressed unpleasantness as well, and things which the subject had repressed because he wished to forget 
them now came to the fore. This was noted when at least two of the subjects had "crying jags" when 
drugged, reproaching themselves for what they had done to their mothers and wives. 
<p> 
<strong>Downey Will-Temperament Test: Test I 
</strong><br> 
The changes in the subjects' responses on this test showed a shift in their attitude toward themselves as a 
result of marihuana ingestion. On the whole, more subjects appeared to think better of themselves when 
they were "high" than they did in their undrugged state. This is indicated by the fact that there was an 
increase in the number of individuals who under the influence of 5 cc. of marihuana or of marihuana 
cigarettes believed themselves to be careful, cautious, ambitious, accurate, industrious, impulsive, 
enthusiastic, and possessing superior characters. There was also a decrease in the number who considered 
themselves suggestible or extravagant. The only negative traits which the subject admitted to more 
frequently when he was "high" than he did in his normal state were suggestibility, poor memory and 
aggression. The change in attitude in regard to aggression was most striking among the marihuana users, 
88 per cent of whom considered themselves aggressive after they had! 
! 
 had the drug as compared with only 42 per cent in the undrugged state. This increase in the feeling of 
aggression was not paralleled by the findings of the other tests nor by the behavior of the subjects when 
they had taken the drug. Like the increased vocabulary noted on the Loofbourrow it can best be interpreted 
as an indication of the subject's increased feelings of confidence and self-assurance.

<p> 
 In general the changes which occurred on this test after the subject had had marihuana were not 
consistent for the user and the non-user or for different amounts of the drug. They merely served to 
indicate that when the subject was under the influence of marihuana there were shifts in his feelings about 
himself which reflected a prevailing mood of confidence and self- satisfaction. 
<p> 
<strong>Thematic Apperception Test 
</strong><br> 
Without cigarettes the needs most frequently expressed in the subjects' stories were "affiliation," 
"aggression," "sex," "dominance," "succorance," "self-abasement," and "play." These terms may be defined 
as follows:(1) Affiliation: to be sociable, to make friends, to love. Aggression: to fight, to criticize, to 
blame, to accuse or ridicule maliciously, to injure or kill, sadism. Sex: to seek sex objects, to court, to enjoy 
intercourse. Dominance: to influence or control others, leadership. Succorance: to seek aid, protection or 
sympathy. Selfabasement: to comply, to surrender, to accept punishment, to apologize, to condone, to 
atone, to depreciate ego, masochism. Play: to relax tension and alleviate stress by pleasurable and 
humorously irresponsible activity, motor, verbal or mental. 
<p> In general the frequency with which all needs were expressed fell off after the subjects had smoked 
marihuana cigarettes. The most striking drops were in the need for self-abasement and aggression where 
the frequency of occurrence changed from 2.4 to 1.1 for the former, and from 2.7 to 1.7 for the latter. 
Contrary to the general trend there was an increase in the need for dominance. 
<p> When the subjects were not "high" the environmental influences most frequently mentioned in their 
stories were illness and death and accepting parents. After smoking marihuana the general trend was 
similar to that noted for the "needs," that is there was a falling off in the frequency with which the subjects 
used most of the concepts. There was, however, no diminution in the number of times that illness and death 
played a part in their tales, the average number being 2.1 before smoking and 2.2 after smoking. Likewise 
the awareness of restraint and imprisonment remained constant, occurring 1.1 times before smoking and 
1.2 after. Contrary to the general trend there was an increased awareness of an accepting love object. This 
concept appeared in the stories on an average of .8 time before smoking and 1.2 after. 
<p> The decrease in the number of times both needs and environmental pressures were expressed in the 
stories given after the subjects had had cigarettes was not due to a curtailment in the length of the story. 
The tales were often more wordy in the drugged than in the undrugged state, but their length was 
frequently due to embellishment and repetition, and there was likely to be less meaningful material. In 
general the stories obtained from the subjects after smoking indicated that they had less capacity for 
expressing themselves directly and clearly, and also less concern with self-abasement and aggression. As 
defined on this test these needs represent a conflict between aggression against the self and against others 
and appear to stem from insecurity and feelings of guilt and inadequacy. In the drugged state the subjects 
appeared less disturbed by this conflict and had less need to harry themselves and others. They had a 
greater need for dominance, a desire for leadership.! 
! 
 This ties in with the greater self-assurance demonstrated by other tests and with the increased awareness of 
acceptance by a love object found on this test. 
<p> It is interesting to note that these subjects showed no falling off in their awareness of illness and 
death or of restraint and imprisonment after smoking. The frequency of the latter concept was undoubtedly 
related to their status as prisoners, while the former ties in with the findings on the Free Association Test 
where the word "death" remained a disturbing factor even after marihuana had been smoked or ingested.

<a name="women2"><strong>FINDINGS ON WOMEN SUBJECTS</strong></a><br> 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 
 As in the case with the men, when the female subject was under the influence of marihuana her basic 
personality structure did not change and only some relatively superficial emotional reactions were 
different. As a group, the women used in this study showed a somewhat constricted personality, and this 
constriction was not lessened when the subject was "high." The emotional reactions revealed in the 
Rorschach Test showed that the subjects in this particular group were primarily extraversive, and this 
remained unchanged after the administration of marihuana. Again, like the men, when under the influence 
of the drug the women lowered the achievement levels they set for themselves. However, they did not 
show any increased self-confidence as did the men, either by an increase in the number of words they 
claimed to know in the Loofbourrow Test or in their appraisal of themselves as indicated in the Downey 
Will-Temperament Test. In general, the women exhibited a loss of drive for ! 
! 
participation in anything requiring effort. This is inferred from their performance in the Level of Aspiration 
Test, the Vocational Interest Blank, and the Binet Lines Test, as well as from their behavior. 
<p> 
<a name="behav"><strong>BEHAVIOR DURING THE TEST PERIOD OF SUBJECTS UNDER THE 
INFLUENCE OF MARIHUANA</strong></a><br> 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 
<p> The findings reported here have all been in terms of objective, quantitative measures. Some effects of 
the drug, observable during examinations, cannot be quantified but are nevertheless important to the 
understanding of the drug action. These effects were reflected in those reactions of the subjects which were 
not directly related to the test situation 
<p> Behavior was somewhat different when the subject had ingested marihuana concentrate than it was 
when he had taken the drug in cigarette form. With pills gastrointestinal disturbances were more 
pronounced and drowsiness and fatigue seemed greater and more enduring. Some individuals were so 
overcome by fatigue that they worked for a few seconds only, and then sat with their heads on the table. If 
spoken to, they made a great effort to do the work but rarely continued for very long. When summoned to 
take the test, especially toward the end of the day when they were almost invariably lying on their beds, the 
subjects were overcome with fatigue and were aroused only with the greatest difficulty. In some instances 
there was definite resentment of this disturbance and the impression was that only the presence of the 
police officer and all the implications in the prison set-up prevented a definite refusal to continue 
cooperatively. With both pills and cigarettes many of the men ! 
! 
had difficulty in concentrating and maintaining a fixed goal. Subjects often stared vacantly for long periods 
and when addressed came back to the test with a start. Many burst into uncontrollable laughter over a test 
which in their undrugged state had evoked no merriment. The laughter frequently affected the entire group 
and most markedly those who had been given marihuana. 
<p> The behavior of the user and non-user with marihuana cigarettes was somewhat different. The user 
was pleasantly excited at the thought of smoking, selected his cigarettes with the manner of a connoisseur, 
and criticized or praised the product offered him. His smoking took on something of a ritualistic ceremony 
and was done in a careful and prearranged fashion which varied slightly from individual to individual. In 
general the men first opened the end of the cigarette to examine the marihuana, then wet the "stick" by 
inserting it in their mouths to prevent the paper from burning too rapidly. When the cigarette was ignited 
the men took several short puffs, at the same time inhaling as much air as possible. This caused the tip of 
the "stick" to glow and resulted in a succession of low gasping sounds from the subject The smoke was 
retained as long as possible, occasionally causing severe paroxysms of coughing. Although eager to be 
"high" the user was consistent in his fear o! 
! 
f "blowing his top," and there was always a point beyond which no amount of talking or cajoling could 
make them continue smoking. As a rule, the user liked to smoke in company. He was generally satisfied if 
one friend, a "kick partner," could be with him. To this friend he would explain his thoughts and feelings 
which to the objective observer were very superficial. In trying to make a point, and usually a minor one at 
that, the user, when smoking, would talk on endlessly and soon lose his goa'.. He cracked many "jokes" 
which were uproariously funny to him. In some instances "leaping" or involuntary jerking of the arms, 
head, shoulders or legs occurred The subject described his sensations as floating, leaping, rocking or most 
often as being "in the groove." He was obviously enjoying pleasant physical sensations and wanted to be 
left to himself to lie on his bed, listen to soft music and dream or carry on "deep" conversations. The test 
questions were frequently called a "bring ! 
! 
down" in that they forced the subject to face reality and abandon 
 
 his pleasurable feelings. Several subjects con curred in describing part of their drug experience as 
comparable to the twilight state between sleeping and waking in which the individual floats pleasantly and 
does not allow outside stimuli to impinge. Just as strong extraneous sensations will bring the sleeper face to 
face with reality, so the insistence of the examiner that the subject perform certain tasks served to destroy 
his general feeling of well-being. Aside from the test situation any unpleasant circumstances can serve as a 
"bring down." This "bring down" apparently only results in destroying the subject's pleasure but cannot do 
away with the disadvantageous effect on intellectual functioning. 
<p> When testing was completed the subject generally lay on his bed and dozed or listened to the radio. 
His drowsiness persisted for many hours. 
<p> Most non-users approached the smoking with apprehension. They were instructed by the users in the 
art of lighting and inhaling, but they rarely cooperated to the fullest extent? though this was undoubtedly 
unconscious on their part. 
<p> The effects of marihuana on the non-users were variable. A few of them enjoyed the results so much 
that they claimed they would continue to smoke whenever they had a chance. They described such 
sensations as "lying in fur," and "floating in space." Some became acutely nauseous and could not continue 
with their work, while others experienced little or no change in feeling, undoubtedly because they never 
smoked correctly. 
<p> When the subjects were "high," particularly in the case of the non-user, there was a general loss of 
inhibition and lessening of many social restraints which had previously been exercised. Thus, all the men 
talked much more freely, confronted each other more directly, and manifested a state of well-being at times 
amounting to euphoria. They were much more confiding? talked spontaneously about love and sexual 
affairs, and in two instances exposed themselves and masturbated. 
<p> Although there was an undeniable increase in overt sex interest following the ingestion of marihuana, 
it seems probable that this interest was not the result of direct sexual stimulation but rather a manifestation 
of a falling off in inhibiting factors. This sex interest seems to have been due primarily to the fact that these 
men had been imprisoned for varying periods and had not had access to women. It is not at all certain that 
under free conditions or with different subjects this behavior would have been manifested. In any case, the 
behavior of these prisoners was more like that which any man deprived of sexual activity for a long period 
of time would display under a releasing stimulus and not at all like the behavior shown at marihuana "tea-
pads." 
<p> 
<a name="sum2"><strong>SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION</strong></a><br> 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 
 Under the influence of marihuana changes in personality as shown by alterations in test performance are 
slight. They are not statistically significant and indicate only tendencies or trends. Moreover, the drug 
effect is not always in proportion to the amount taken, nor are the changes consistently in one direction. In 
many instances the effect of small doses (2 cc.) or of marihuana cigarettes is the opposite of the effect of 
larger doses (5 cc.) (2) 
<p> 
(2) While sufficient experimentation has not been made to validate the finding, it should be noted that the 
personality changes produced by 2 cc. or marihuana cigarettes are almost always in agreement in contrast 
to the changes resulting from the ingestion of 5 cc. The 2 cc. dosage apparently more nearly approximates 
the amount a person would take if left to his own devices. 
<p> 
 The personality changes observed when the subject is under the influence of 2 cc. of marihuana or 
marihuana cigarettes demonstrate that the subject experiences some reduction in drive, less objectivity in 
evaluating situations, less aggression, more self-confidence and a generally more favorable attitude toward 
himself. These reactions can be ascribed to two main causes, namely, an increased feeling of relaxation and 
disinhibition and increased self-confidence. As the drug relaxes the subject, the restraints which he 
normally imposes on himself are loosened and he talks more freely than he does in his undrugged state. 
Things which under ordinary circumstances he would not speak about are now given expression. 
Metaphysical problems which in the undrugged state he would be unwilling to discuss, sexual ideas he 
would ordinarily hesitate to mention, jokes without point, are all part of the oral stream released by the 
marihuana. 
<p> At the same time that he verbalizes more freely, there is a reduction in the individual's critical 
faculty. This is probably due both to the intellectual confusion produced by the drug and to the less 
exacting attitude his feeling of relaxation induces. He holds himself less rigidly to the standards of his 
undrugged phase and does not drive himself to achieve. He is satisfied with himself and willing to accept 
himself as he is. This self-satisfaction undoubtedly helps produce the feeling of self-confidence which 
allows the subject to come out more freely in fields which he formerly avoided. This increased confidence 
expresses itself primarily through oral rather than physical channels. Physically the subject reports 
pleasant sensations of "drifting" and "floating" and he allows himself to become enveloped in a pleasant 
lassitude. 
<p> After the administration of larger doses of marihuana (5 cc.) the pleasurable sensations appear to be 
outweighed by concomitant feelings of anxiety'and, in some cases, of physical distress, such as nausea. 
Under these circumstances, for many subjects there is little increase in confidence but rather heightened 
insecurity which precludes outgoing reactions and tends to evoke generally negativistic attitudes to most 
stimuli. 
<p> It is important to note that neither the ingestion of marihuana nor the smoking of marihuana 
cigarettes affects the basic outlook of the individual except in a very few instances and to a very slight 
degree. In general the subjects who are withdrawn and introversive stay that way, those who are outgoing 
remain so, and so on. Where changes occur the shift is so slight as to be negligible. In other words 
reactions which are natively alien to the individual cannot be induced by the ingestion or smoking of the 
drug. 
<p> Although in most instances the effects of the drug are the same for the user and the non-user, there 
are some differences both in kind and extent. Where the effects for the two groups are in the same direction 
they generally are more marked in the case of the non-user. This is not unexpected in view of the non-
user's lack of habituation to the drug action. For the nonuser his present experience is a strange, even 
hazardous one, and the uncertainty and anxiety attendant upon this impairs the sense of well-being which 
the drug produces in the user. Thus the non-user frequently feels-less secure when he is "high" than he does 
normally and is less well adjusted than he is in ordinary circumstances. 
<p> When the productions of the undrugged marihuana user are studied, certain personality traits which 
serve to differentiate him from the non-user and from the "average" individual can be discerned. As a 
group the marihuana users studied here were either inhibited emotionally or turned in on themselves, 
making little response to stimuli in the world about them. People with this type of personality generally 
have difficulty adjusting to others and are not at ease in social situations. This withdrawal from social 
contacts apparently finds little compensatory or sublimating activity elsewhere. These subjects did not have 
a desire or urge to occupy themselves creatively in a manner which might prove socially useful. They 
showed a tendency to drift along in passive fashion and gave a good portion of their attention to relatively 
unimportant matters. These men were poorly adjusted, lonely and insecure. As India cated by their history 
they seldom achieved good heterosexual adjustm!

<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
<ol> 
<li>Under the influence of marihuana the basic personality structure of the individual does not change but 
some of the more superficial aspects of his behavior show alteration. 
<li>. With the use of marihuana the individual experiences increased feelings of relaxation, disinhibition 
and self-confidence. 
<li>The new feeling of self-confidence induced by the drug expresses itself primarily through oral rather 
than through physical activity. There is some indication of a diminution in physical activity. 
<li>The disinhibition which results from the use of marihuana releases what is latent in the individual's 
thoughts and emotions but does not evoke responses which would be totally alien to him in his undrugged 
state. 
<li>Marihuana not only releases pleasant reactions but also feelings of anxiety. 
<li>Individuals with a limited capacity for effective experience and who have difficulty in making social 
contacts are more likely to resort to marihuana than those more capable of outgoing responses.

Adolph G. Woltrnann, MA<BR> 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 
 At the outset of the study it seemed worth while to supplement the quantitative data by some qualitative 
procedures of the projective type which might throw light on the social reactions of the individuals who 
were being studied. One of the methods that has shown its possibilities, particularly in its use with children, 
is the play technique in which the individual is permitted to give free expression to some of his 
unconscious motivations in a way that is not immediately apparent to him. The limitation of this technique 
is the fact that it is highly interpretive, but it has the advantage of permitting observations of the subject's 
personality reactions in problem situations. 
<p> Such a study was accordingly carried out on 18 subjects in the early part of the investigation. 
<p> 
<a name="meth"><strong>METHOD</strong><br> 
 
<p> Two situations were studied: one, subsequently to be referred to as the family set-up, in which toys 
were used to build an apartment or home, and another, subsequently to be known as the community set-up, 
in which a second variety of toys were used to construct a town setting. 
<p> 
<a name="set"><strong>The Family Set-up 
</strong></a><br> 
The equipment used in this part of the study consisted of a box of household toys of the type available in 
the ten-cent store, including beds, dressers, chairs, tables, sinks, a stove, a bathtub, a wash basin, a piano, 
lamps, flower boxes, a telephone, doll sets of a man, woman, boy, girl, and maid, and, in addition, several 
small wooden slats which were intended to be used as room partitions. 
<p> The box of toys and materials was presented to the subject with the following directions: "Here are a 
number of toys which can be placed in such a manner that a house can be built from them. You are 
supposed to be this doll (man). Go ahead and build yourself a house or apartment. You may use as few or 
as many toys as you wish. You may also make believe you are a bachelor or a married man with or without 
a family." 
<p> 
<a name="com"><strong>The Community Set-up 
</strong></a><br> 
In studying the community set-up the following items were employed: eighteen wooden houses, trees, cars, 
trucks, fire engines, an ambulance, a radio police car, a railroad train, airplanes, and numerous figures 
representing men, women, and children from different walks of life. All these toys were handed to the 
subject at the same time with the instruction to build a town or city. As in the family set-up, no further help 
or suggestions were given. 
<p> The actual method of handling these materials allows for two approaches. In the free method the 
subject is encouraged to play with any toy and to create and act out any situation that the nature of the toy 
suggests to him. No help, clues, or hints are given. In the controlled methods either the subject is told to 
create a specific pattern or his responses and reactions to a predetermined particular situation are elicited. 
Both methods were used in this study. 
<p> After the subject had completed either his family or his community set-up and answered questions 
regarding certain situations about which the examiner had questioned him the following points were 
investigated: ( 1 ) subject's marital status, both real and assumed; (2) type of home he built for himself 
(number of rooms, type of furnishing); (3) subject's assumed occupation; (4) monthly income and rent 
which he posited; (S) his reaction to attempted burglary; (6) his reaction to his wife's and his own 
infidelity; and (7) the attitude he would take toward civic problems if given a position of responsibility 
such as mayor. In addition, the examiner appraised the subject's neatness and orderliness in his home and 
community setup. The experiment was given first when the subject was undrugged and then when he was 
under the influence of marihuana. 
<p> 
<a name="find4"><strong>FINDINGS</strong></a><br> 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 
Results were collated in terms of the type and frequency of responses to different situations both before and 
after taking marihuana and in terms of number of items (toys) employed in the set- up, as, for example, in 
the case of the home situation, the number of rooms the subject thought necessary for his apartment and the 
amount of rent he thought he ought to pay and its relation to the income he posited for himself; in the case 
of the community set-up, the number of times the subject provided for ambulances, firemen, and 
policemen; in the case of the subject's reaction to burglary, whether he took a passive or a resistant attitude 
toward the burglary and whether he assumed the burglar had absconded with most of the property and so 
on; in the case of his attitude toward his wife's adultery, whether he thought he ought to divorce her or try 
for reconciliation; and, when the subject was unfaithful, whether he thought his wife ought to forgive his 
delinquency. 
<p> In most cases comparisons between responses or reactions showed little difference in attitude before 
and after the ingestion of marihuana and therefore it would not be too profitable in this short summary of 
the work to present all the data obtained. However, by way of illustrating the type of material procured, the

 The majority of the patients, though unmarried in real life, assumed families and responsibilities in the 
play situation, and in a free situation acted out family activities and ideologies. 
<p> These figures reveal that, on the average, the subjects when under the influence of the drug tended to 
build apartments with somewhat fewer rooms. The impression of the examiner was that this was due 
primarily to the subject's desire to get through with the task as quickly as possible in order to return to his 
room to rest and sleep.

 A "make-believe" sickness or accident necessitating the use of an ambulance was the most frequently 
observed play pattern. When the subjects were under the influence of the drug the incidence of the 
ambulance and the police was considerably less than it was when they were in the undrugged state.

 The most frequent form of passive reaction to his wife's infidelity was that the subject would pack up and 
leave home. The aggressive reactions consisted of ordering the wife out of the home in three instances, 
jailing the wife and lover in one instance, throwing the wife out in one instance, killing the lover but 
leaving the wife unmolested in one instance, and beating up the lover and leaving the wife unharmed in 
one instance. 
<p> The following are examples of subjects' responses to the adultery situation. When he was facing the 
pretended situation before taking marihuana, one subject immediately left his house, borrowed money from 
his employer, and traveled to the West Coast. After he arrived there he proceeded to drink and in due time 
became a derelict on the Barbary Coast. When asked about his children he said, "That's closed with the rest 
of the chapter. Let her ardent lover support the children. I take on an assumed name. Others might get a 
divorce and custody of the children but in my case my home life would be a closed chapter." After the 
administration of marihuana he still showed a passive attitude, but, having assumed the role of a 
psychologist, he felt obliged to act accordingly. At first he considered divorce action, but since that would 
deprive the children of a home, he finally forgave his wife. Then he stopped in his contemplations, looked 
at the examiner and said, "Why do I become ! 
! 
altruistic? . . . That's beyond me . . . Maybe I become a martyr . . . I commit an act of martyrdom." Another 
subject, when in the undrugged condition, ordered his wife out of the house and later divorced her. In the 
drugged state customary procedures were reversed. The subject went to his parents and remained passively 
at home while his mother unsuccessfully tried to bring about a reconciliation. 
<p> The subject's attitude toward adultery did not change in the drugged state. The data in Table 24 
illustrate the fact that ingestion of marihuana generally does not alter the subject's basic attitude.

 Practically all the subjects approved of saloons. Gambling was rejected because it deprives wives and 
children of money and leads to trouble. A heavy loser may try to recoup his losses through holdups, and 
fights and homicide may develop from quarrels. Prostitution was condoned by about 5O per cent of the 
subjects both before and after the ingestion of the drug, but the use of marihuana was frowned upon more 
often when the subject was undrugged than when he was in the drugged state.

<a name="con3"><strong>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</strong></a><br> 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 
 
Eighteen subjects who participated in the marihuana study were subjected to the play situation with the 
idea of seeing whether the pattern of play or the ideas investigated were materially altered in consequence 
of the ingestion of the marihuana. Among the ideologies which were appraised were: (1) attitude toward 
family set-up; (2) attitude toward different occupations; (3) attitude toward income; (4) attitude toward 
situations ordinarily calling for aggression, namely an attempted burglary of his home and sexual infidelity 
on the part of his wife; (5) attitude toward authority. 
<p> In general the subject's attitude toward family and community ideologies as manifested in play did 
not change markedly as a result of the ingestion of marihuana. The subjects (in play) were not intolerant of 
infidelity or aggressive toward lawbreakers either before or after the ingestion of marihuana. On the whole 
the initial passive reactions already observed in other parts of the study were likewise observed in the play 
situation experiment. The only very definite change as a result of the ingestion of marihuana was in their 
attitude toward the drug itself. Without marihuana only 4 out of 14 subjects said they would tolerate the 
sale of marihuana while after ingestion 8 of them were in favor of this. 
<p> Another significant manifestation in the play situation pertains to the construction of the community 
set-up. In general the community was less orderly and well organized when the subjects had had 
marihuana. It is probable that this poor organization may be ascribed to the generally indifferent attitude 
and lack of motor coordination already observed in the more controlled studies. 
<p> On the whole, the experiment with play technique gave less information as to the effect of marihuana 
on subjects than had been hoped for. This may have been due to the incompleteness of the method 
employed or possibly to the fact that this technique is designed to give data about the basic personality of 
the individual rather than such alterations in it as might be caused by pharmacological agents. 
<p> 
<a name="com2"><STRONG>COMPARISON BETWEEN USERS AND NON-USERS FROM THE 
STANDPOINT OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL DETERIORATION</strong></a><br> 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 
 A careful testing of the motor and sensory functions of the nervous system was included in the general 
physical examination of each subject. Of motor functions, reflex activity and muscular response and 
coordination were determined; of sensory functions, perception of touch, pain and temperature stimuli; of 
specialized functions, taste, hearing and vision. In the eye, the corneal and light reflexes were tested and a 
retinal examination was made. In this neurological examination no pathological conditions were found in 
any of the subjects. 
<p> In the psychiatric examination attention was paid to general intelligence and knowledge in relation to 
the subject's background, to relevancy of talk in conversation, to orientation as to time, place and situation, 
to memory of past and recent events, to ability in simple arithmetic, to judgment in reaching decisions, and 
to the presence of abnormal mental content shown by delusions, hallucinations, obsessions, and ideas of 
persecution. There was no evidence of disordered cerebral functioning in any of the group. 
<p> As would be expected, differences in grades of intelligence and in orderliness in thinking and 
reasoning were noticeable. The Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test was administered to a total of 60 male 
subjects, 40 marihuana users and 20 nonusers. The average I.Q. for the user group was 96.7, range 70 to 
124, and for the non-user group the average I.Q. was 104.5, range 93 to 114. Both groups may therefore be 
classified as of average intelligence. 
<p> When analyzed according to racial distribution the two groups were even better equated intellectually 
than the total results indicate. For the 28 white subjects examined (13 users and 15 non-users) the average 
I.Q. for the users was 106.1 range 77 to 124, and for the non-users the average I.Q. was 106.3, range 96 to 
114. There were 24 Negro subjects, 19 users and 5 non-users. The average I.Q. for the users was 92.6, 
range 70 to 112, while for the non-users the average I.Q. was 98.8, range 93 to 101. Although the non-
users averaged 6.2 points higher than the users, it must be taken into account that the number of Negro 
non-users tested was small. In any event, the disparity in results would not be considered significant.. The 
average I.Q. of the 2 Puerto Rican users was 91.0, range 72 to 100. 
<p> Reports on mental deterioration due to toxic, organic or psychotic factors as given in the literature 
reveal that in such cases the individual scores on the Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test show marked 
irregularity, depending upon the functions involved in the deteriorative process. As a group, the marihuana 
users tested in this study showed very even functioning, and what little irregularity occurred can be 
explained on the basis of language and racial factors. 
<p> The physical and psychiatric examinations were of a qualitative rather than a quantitative nature. In 
the special examinations and tests of organ and system function, quantitative measurements were obtained 
for 17 marihuana users. These subjects were selected for the reason that they had smoked marihuana for 
the longest period of time. The figures for years of usage and number of cigarettes smoked daily were 
taken from each subject's statement. 
<p> Marihuana users accustomed to daily smoking for a period of from two and a half to sixteen years 
showed no abnormal system functioning which would differentiate them from the non-users. 
<p> There is definite evidence in this study that the marihuana users were not inferior in intelligence to 
the general population and that they had suffered no mental or physical deterioration as a result of their use 
of the drug. 
<p> 
<a name="addict"><strong>ADDICTION AND TOLERANCE</strong></a><br> 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 
 A drug addiction is characterized by a compelling urge to use the drug for the prevention or relief of 
distressing mental and physical disturbances which occur when the necessary dose is delayed or omitted. A 
drug habit is also characterized by an urge to use the drug, but this is not compelling. The abstinence 
symptoms, which are expressions of nervous states, are not particularly distressing and do not occur as 
long as the person's attention is placed on other matters. 
<p> Drug tolerance in the narrower sense used here means that larger doses than those originally used are 
required to bring about the effects desired by the subject. In the case of morphine, tolerance develops 
because of addiction, but in other instances tolerance may be present without addiction and addiction 
without tolerance. When both are present the matter takes on greater importance because of the extremes to 
which the addict goes to obtain the drug constantly and in increasing quantities. 
<p> As our group of subjects included 48 users of marihuana, opportunity was afforded for some 
conclusions concerning marihuana addiction and tolerance. Practically all of our group of users stated that 
they could and often did voluntarily stop the smoking for a time without any undue disturbance from the 
deprivation. In the sociologic study reported by Dr. Schoenfeld it was found that smokers had no 
compelling urge for marihuana. If "reefers" were not readily available there was no special effort made to 
obtain them from known sources of supply. Dr. Walter Bromberg, Psychiatrist-in-Charge, Psychiatric 
Clinic, Court of General Sessions in New York, states: "The fact that offenders brought up on marihuana 
charges do not request medical treatment on their incarceration (with its cessation of drug supply) argues 
for the absence of with drawal symptoms.''<a name="back6"><a 
href="laguard7.html#note6">[6]</a>From interviews with several hundred marihuana users he concludes 
that tr! 
! 
ue addiction was absent. 
<p> 
<p> 
 The evidence submitted here warrants the conclusion that as far as New York City is concerned true 
addiction to marihuana does not occur. 
<p> The evidence concerning acquired tolerance is less clear-cut. Tolerance develops during the periods 
when the drug is being taken and accounts for the necessity of increasing the dosage to bring about the 
desired effects. How long the tolerance persists after the drug administration is stopped has not been 
definitely established in any instance. 
<p> The statements of marihuana usage and time since stoppage given by eight of our subjects are 
summarized in Table 26.

<p> 
 On one or more of the numerous occasions on which marihuana was administered each of these subjects 
received what was considered a minimal effective dose. One (J.B.) was given 1 cc., another (A.B.) 3 cc., 
the others 2 cc. In all instances the customary physical effects, conjunctival injection, dilated and 
sluggishly reacting pupils, tremors and ataxia, were observed. With these doses the subjects also 
experienced the sensation described as "high." The only conclusion warranted here is that if acquired 
tolerance does occur it persists for a limited period only. 
<p> Further evidence, though indirect, was brought out by Dr. Shoenfeld's investigation and by personal 
interviews with our 48 users. There is agreement in the statements that among users the smoking of one or 
two cigarettes is sufficient to bring on the effect known as "high." When this state is reached the user will 
not continue smoking for fear of becoming "too high." When the desired effects have passed off and the 
smoker has "come down," smoking one cigarette brings the "high" effect on again. This could not be the 
case had a steadily increasing tolerance developed. 
<p> The evidence available then--the absence of any compelling urge to use the drug, the absence of any 
distressing abstinence symptoms, the statements that no increase in dosage is required to repeat the desired 
effect in users--justifies the conclusion that neither true addiction nor tolerance is found in marihuana 
users. The continuation and the frequency of usage of marihuana, as in the case of many other habit-
forming substances, depend on the easily controlled desires for its pleasurable effects. 
<p> 
<a name="therapy"><strong>POSSIBLE THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS</strong></a><br> 
<em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 
 If a drug has well-marked pharmacological actions and low toxicity, as appears to be the case with 
marihuana, a consideration of special interest is its possible therapeutic application. In the older clinical 
literature marihuana was recommended for use in a wide variety of disorders, but in recent years it has 
almost disappeared from the materia medica and it was dropped from the United States Pharmacopeia 
twenty years ago. 
<p> In view of the laboratory and clinical findings obtained in this study the question of the therapeutic 
possibilities of the drug was considered. Marihuana possesses two qualities which suggest that it might 
have useful actions in man. The first is the typical euphoria-producing action which might be applicable in 
the treatment of various types of mental depression- the second is the rather unique property which results 
in the stimulation of appetite. In the light of this evidence and in view of the fact that there is a lack of any 
substantial indication of dependence on the drug, it was reasoned that marihuana might be useful in 
alleviating the withdrawal symptoms in drug addicts. 
<p> At the Riker's Island Penitentiary observations were made on 56 inmates who were addicted to 
morphine or heroin. Two groups were selected, the addicts in each being matched with those in the other 
group as to age, physical condition, duration and intensity of habit, and number of previous attempts at 
cure. The subjects in one group received no treatment or were given Magendie's solution according to the 
usual hospital regimen while those in the other group were treated with 15 mg. of tetrahydrocannabinol 
three times daily with or without placebo (subcutaneous water injection). An attempt was made to evaluate 
the severity of the withdrawal signs and symptoms. The impression was gained that those who received 
tetrahydrocannabinol had less severe withdrawal symptoms and left the hospital at the end of the treatment 
period in better condition than those who received no treatment or who were treated with Magendie's 
solution. The ones in the former group maintained their appet! 
! 
ite and in some cases actually gained weight during the withdrawal period. 
<p> Since psychological factors play a large part in the withdrawal symptoms of at least a certain 
proportion of morphine addicts, there are grounds for the assumption that a drug having the properties of 
marihuana might be of aid in alleviating mental distress during the withdrawal period. However, the studies 
here described were not sufficiently complete to establish the value of such treatment, and before 
conclusions can be drawn the problem must be investigated under completely controlled conditions.

<strong>SUMMARY</strong> 
<ol> 
<li>This review of the pharmacology of marihuana is centered around the chemical and pharmacological 
identification of the active principles of hemp. Coordination of chemical and pharmacological 
investigations as a prerequisite to success in the search for unknown principles and of the analysis of the 
structure-activity relationship of these compounds is discussed. 
<li>In a survey of the sources of preparations with marihuana activity, hemp seeds are disclosed as a 
heretofore unknown source of active substances. 
<li>Varieties of hemp can be distinguished according to genotypic differences of the content of active 
principles which persist over generations independently of soil and climate. 
<li>The pharmacological actions of marihuana are analyzed with regard to their specificity and their 
usefulness as indicators of specific components. 
<li>Sixty-five substances from the new class of cannabinols and related classes are reviewed, among which 
are the essential components of the marihuana-active hemp oils. The discovery of this class, the synthesis 
of these representatives, and their structural elucidation led the way to the discovery of the active 
substances. 
<li>Quantitative assay procedures are described for the most important marihuana effects that are observed 
in the animal experiment. The assay of the ataxia effect in the dog and of the synergistic hypnotic effect in 
the mouse with refined procedures are shown to be reliable expedients for measuring these two marihuana 
actions, whereas the areflexia effect in rabbits failed to show the reproducibility required for quantitative 
purposes. 
<li>With the aid of these methods the natural tetrahydrocannabinols are shown to be active principles 
responsible for ataxia in dogs and psychic action in man. They are intermediate products between the two 
ineffective substances which compose the bulk of hemp oil: a labile excretion product of the plant, 
cannabidiol, and a stable end-product, cannabinol. The conversion of cannabidol into active 
tetrahydrocannabinol by a natural environmental influence has been paralleled by ultraviolet irradiation in 
vitro. 
<li>Numerous isomers, homologs and analogs of tetra- and hexahydrocannabinol are shown to possess the 
specific marihuana action. The potency varies enormously and is highest in natural, optically active-
laevogyrous-tetrahydrocannabinols. 
<li>The significance of many of the structural details of the tetrahydrocannabinol molecule for marihuana 
activity is elucidated by quantitative determinations of relative potency. Special attention was devoted to a 
study of the importance of variations in the length of the 3- alkyl side chain of tetrahydrocannabinols. In 
studying methyl to nonyl homologs of the original amyl derivative occurring in nature, it was found that 
the maximum potency is not at the amyl, but at the hexyl homolog, and in two out of four homologous 
series at the representatives with still longer side chains. 
<li>In addition to the ataxia and the psychic action, other pharmacological attributes of the 
tetrahydrocannabinols are a decrease in the respiratory and an increase in the pulse rates in the non-
narcotized dog. 
<li>The synergistic hypnotic action of marihuana in the mouse is to be attributed to the otherwise inert 
cannabidiol. 
<li>The corneal areflexia action in the rabbit was much stronger in impure distillate oils than in pure 
tetrahydrocan nabinols, which leads to the conclusion that this action is either poorly reproducible or must 
be attributed to a different, as yet unknown, principle. 
<li>Only one among the numerous cannabinol derivatives, 7- methyltetrahydrocannabinol, was found to 
produce a motor stimulant--convulsant--action concomitant with ataxia action. A cannabidiol derivative, 
tetrahydrocannabidiol, was found to have specific convulsant action in the dog. 
<li>A central stimulant (benzedrine) considerably increased the ataxia action of marihuana, whereas a 
hypnotic (amytal) had no influence.

George B. Wallace, MD, Chairman 
<p><em><a href="laguard1.html">Return to LaGuardia Report: Table of Contents</a></em><p> 
 
 The widespread publicity describing the dangerous effects of marihuana usage in New Orleans and other 
Southern cities, especially among school children, had its repercussion in the city of New York, and some 
anxiety was experienced as to the possibility that similar conditions were present or might develop here. 
Because of this, Mayor LaGuardia asked The New York Academy of Medicine for an opinion as to the 
advisability of studying the whole marihuana problem. The Academy recommended that such a study be 
made and outlined its scope in general terms. Following this, the Mayor appointed a committee empowered 
to make the study. This committee consisted of two internists, three psychiatrists, two pharmacologists, and 
one public health expert, and the Commissioners of Correction, of Health, and of Hospitals, and the 
Director of the Division of Psychiatry of the Department of Hospitals, ex officio. 
<p> The Committee formulated a plan for the study, and the expenses were arranged for through grants 
by the New York Foundation, the Friedsam Foundation and the Commonwealth Fund. The study was 
begun in April 1940. 
<p> The first phase of the study concerned the extent of marihuana smoking in New York City, its 
incidence among school children, its relation to crime, and its effects on individuals using it. For obtaining 
this information, the Commissioner of Police assigned to the Committee six police officers, four men and 
two women, who served as "plain clothes" investigators. These investigators circulated in the districts in 
which marihuana appeared to be most widely used, particularly Harlem, associated with marihuana users, 
and found out as much as possible about sources of supply, means of distribution, and effects of marihuana 
on users. Included in this survey were a careful watch on school children in both grade and high schools 
and interviews with school principals. 
<p> As a result of this investigation the Committee came to the conclusion that marihuana distribution 
and usage is found mainly in Harlem, the population of which is predominantly Negro and Latin-
American, and to a less extent in the Broadway area extending from 42nd to 59th Streets. The local supply 
comes from individual peddlers and from "tea-pads," which are establishments for marihuana smoking. 
There are no figures available as to the number of marihuana users in New York City, but a conservative 
estimate is that there are some 500 peddlers and 500 "tea-pads" in Harlem. 
<p> The marihuana users with whom contact was made in this study were persons without steady 
employment. The majority fall in the age group of 20 to 30 years. Idle and lacking initiative, they suffer 
boredom and seek distraction. Smoking is indulged in for the sake of conviviality and sociability and 
because it affords a temporary feeling of adequacy in meeting disturbing situations. 
<p> The confirmed user smokes from 6 to 10 cigarettes a day. The effects are easily recognized by the 
smoker, the desirable stage being what is known as "high." When this is reached, the smoking is stopped. If 
a "too high" state is reached, the taking of beverages such as beer or sweet soda pop, or a cold bath are 
considered effective countermeasures. 
<p> In most instances, the behavior of the smoker is of a friendly, sociable character. Aggressiveness and 
belligerency are not commonly seen, and those showing such traits are not allowed to remain in "tea-pads." 
<p> The marihuana user does not come from the hardened criminal class and there was found no direct 
relationship between the commission of crimes of violence and marihuana. "Tea- pads" have no direct 
association with houses of prostitution, and marihuana itself has no specific stimulant effect in regard to 
sexual desires. 
<p> There is no organized traffic in marihuana among New York City school children, and any smoking 
that occurs in this group is limited to isolated instances. Smoking marihuana can be stopped abruptly with 
no resulting mental or physical distress comparable to that of morphine withdrawal in morphine addicts. 
<p> The second division of the study was the clinical one, the purpose of which was to ascertain the 
effects of marihuana on the individual user. There were two phases of this work, the general medical study 
and the psychological study. Wards in the municipal hospital on Welfare Island (now known as Goldwater 
Memorial Hospital) were made available by the Commissioner of Hospitals. The subjects for the study 
were drawn from the prison population at the Penitentiary on Riker's Island, as arranged by the 
Commissioner of Correction. They were under sentence for terms varying from three months to three 
years, most of them for what would be called minor criminal offenses. They volunteered for the study, the 
purpose and procedure of which had been fully explained to them. They were kept in the hospital in groups 
of 6 to 10, for a period of study of approximately a month. The subjects afforded the sample especially 
desired, for over half of them were marihuana smokers and the others! 
 of 
the class from which marihuana smokers come. The personnel conducting the study consisted of a 
physician in charge, with an assistant physician, three psychologists, and a secretary. The subjects were 
under the constant supervision of the medical staff, nurses and attendants. 
<p> In studying the effects of marihuana on the 77 subjects selected for the study, the drug was given 
either in the form of an extract taken by mouth, or was smoked in cigarettes. The dose given to produce 
definite systemic reactions ranged from a minimal one to 1 cc. to a maximum of 22 cc. of the extract, and 
from 1 to 10 cigarettes. The effects of smoking appeared immediately and usually passed off in from one to 
three or four hours. Those from the extract came on more gradually and persisted for a longer time, in 
some instances for twenty-four hours or more. As the dose for any individual was increased, the effects 
usually were more marked and of longer duration, but the effect of any given dose varied with the 
individual subjects. 
<p> Although some of the subjects became restless and talkative under marihuana influence, a mental 
state characterized by a sense of well-being, relaxation and unawareness of surroundings, followed by 
drowiness, was present in most instances when the subject was left undisturbed. Generally, there was 
observed a difficulty in focusing and sustaining mental attention. In company, the subjects were lively and 
given to talkativeness, fits of laughter and good-natured joking. The plea surable effects, classed as 
euphoric, were frequently interrupted or replaced by a state of apprehension of varying degree. 
<p> In a limited number of the subjects there were alterations in behavior giving rise to antisocial 
expression. This was shown by unconventional acts not permitted in public, anxiety reactions, opposition 
and antagonism, and eroticism. Effects such as these would be considered conducive to acts of violence. 
However, any tendency toward violence was expressed verbally and not by physical actions, and in no case 
was restraint by force needed. 
<p> In addition to its effect on mental states, physical symptoms resulting from the administration of 
marihuana were recorded. Of these, tremor, ataxia, dizziness, a sensation of floating in space, dilation of 
the pupils, dryness of the throat, nausea and vomiting, an urge to urinate, hunger, and a desire for sweets 
were the most striking. Tremor and ataxia and dizziness were of the greatest frequency. These symptoms 
may be disturbing to the subject, and if marked enough, cause anxiety and interrupt the euphoric state. 
<p> On some occasions, instead of the marihuana concentrate, preparations supplied by Dr. Roger Adams 
were given. These were tetrahydrocannabinol, made from cannabidiol, corresponding to a principle found 
in the plant, a synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol, an isomer of the natural one, and a synthetic hexyl-
hydrocannabinol. They all produced effects similar in character to those from the concentrate. Their 
relative potency could be determined only approximately. The rough estimate was that 1 cc. of the 
concentrate had as its equivalent 15 mg. of the natural tetrahydrocannabinol, 60 mg. of the 
hexylhydrocannabinol, and 120 mg. of the synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol. 
<p> In the total group studied, what are known as psychotic episodes occurred in 9 of the subjects. In 6 
instances, they were of short duration, persisting for from three to ten hours, and were characterized by 
mental confusion and excitement of a delirious nature with periods of laughter and of anxiety. These 
effects correspond to those often reported in marihuana literature and are examples of acute marihuana 
intoxication, which in many ways is similar to acute alcoholic intoxication. In the other 3 cases, one subject 
had a mild psychotic reaction after smoking one cigarette. Later, a typical psychotic state came on four 
hours after the subject had taken tetrahydrocannabinol and persisted for six days. This subject subsequently 
was found to have a history of epileptic attacks so that the psychotic episode was probably related to 
epilepsy. The second subject had previously been a drug addict. She was given marihuana on several 
occasions, at times showing only euphoric effec! 
ts and other times confusion and worriment. She left the hospital depressed and moody, and a week later 
was committed to a state hospital with the diagnosis of psychosis. After six months, she was discharged as 
cured. The third subject showed no unusual effects of marihuana which was given on several occasions 
during his stay at the hospital. Some days after his return to the penitentiary he developed a psychotic state 
diagnosed "Psychosis with psychopathic personality." This was considered an example of what is known as 
"prison psychosis," a condition which has been noted in persons emotionally unstable subjected to the 
depressing atmosphere of prison incarceration. The precise role of marihuana in the psychotic states in the 
three unstable subjects is not clear. In the case of the second and third subject, the fact that they were sent 
back to prison to complete their sentences must be considered an important if not the main factor in 
bringing on the psychosis. 
<p> In the clinical study of the effect of marihuana on functions of various organs of the body, there were 
found an increase in pulse rate and blood pressure and an increase in blood sugar and metabolic rate. No 
changes were found in the circulation rate and vital capacity. Tests on renal and liver function were 
negative. No changes were found in blood counts and hemoglobin, or blood nitrogen, calcium and 
phosphorus concentrations. The electrocardiogram showed no abnormalties which could be attributed to 
direct action on the heart, and from a few observations made, marihuana appeared to be without effect on 
gastric motility and secretion. The positive results found, as well as the occurrence of nausea and vomiting, 
an increase in the frequency of urination, and the sensation of hunger and an increase in appetite, may be 
considered results of central nervous excitation, producing peripheral effects through the autonomic 
nervous system. 
<p> The psychological study, planned and carried out by experienced psychologists, was concomitant 
with the general medical one and was devoted to determining the effects of marihuana on psychomotor 
responses and certain special abilities, on intellectual functioning, and on emotional reactions and 
personality structure. 
<p> For psychomotor effects, procedures were followed which gave records affording quantitative 
measurement. Static equilibrium and hand steadiness were the functions most strongly affected by 
marihuana. The body swaying was general in direction and not greater in one axis than in others. These 
effects came on during the first hour after the extract was given, reached a peak in about four hours, and 
persisted for some eight hours. After smoking, the effects came on much sooner-within a few minutes-and 
were of shorter duration, about three hours. Complex hand and foot reactions showed impairment, but 
simple reaction time, the strength of grip, speed of tapping, auditory acuity and musical ability, and 
estimation of short time intervals and small linear distances were unchanged. The findings in the women 
correspond to those in the male subjects. In both groups there was marked individual variability, 
irrespective of dosage. 
<p> It was found that marihuana in an effective dose impairs intellectual functioning in general. Included 
under this heading are adverse effects on speed and accuracy in performance, on the application of 
acquired knowledge, on carrying out routine tasks, on memory, and on capacity for learning. 
<p> Marihuana does not change the basic personality structure of the individual. It lessens inhibition and 
this brings out what is latent in his thoughts and emotions but it does not evoke responses which would 
otherwise be totally alien to him. It induces a feeling of self-confidence, but this expressed in thought 
rather than in performance. There is, in fact, evidence of a diminution in physical activity. While 
suggestibility may be increased by small doses, larger ones tend to induce a negativistic attitude. 
<p> From the study as a whole, it is concluded that marihuana is not a drug of addiction, comparable to 
morphine, and that if tolerance is acquired, this is of a very limited degree. Furthermore, those who have 
been smoking marihuana for a period of years showed no mental or physical deterioration which may be 
attributed to the drug. 
<p> The lessening of inhibitions and repression, the euphoric state, the feeling of adequacy, the freer 
expression of thoughts and ideas, and the increase in appetite for food brought about by marihuana suggest 
therapeutic possibilities. From limited observations on addicts undergoing morphine withdrawal and on 
certain types of psychopathic disturbances, the impression was gained that marihuana had beneficial 
effects, but much more extensive and controlled study is required for definite conclusions to be drawn 
concerning therapeutic usage. It should be borne in mind that the effects of marihuana, more than in the 
case of other drugs, are quite variable in different individuals and in the same one at different times. 
<p> The chapter on the pharmacology of marihuana, prepared by Dr. Loewe, reviews the results of 
collaborative work of three laboratories (The Pharmacological Laboratory at the Cornell Medical College, 
the William Albert Noyes Laboratory at the University of Illinois, and the Laboratory of the Bureau of 
Narcotics at Washington, D. C.) which led to the discovery of the active principles, the elucidation of their 
origin, and the assembling of data on the relationship between chemical structure and biological activity. 
The chapter is introduced by a survey of the geographical distribution and botanical relationships of plants 
with marihuana activity. 
<p> The principles involved in bioassay are discussed and a method for marihuana assay described. The 
synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol of Adams was taken as the standard of reference and the characteristic 
reaction of ataxia in dogs measured quantitatively for the degree of activity. By this method the potency of 
samples and preparations of marihuana and of natural and synthetic principles has been determined and 
relationships between chemical structure and pharmacological activity elucidated. 
<p> The main components which have been isolated from marihuana oil containing the active principles 
are cannabidiol, cannabinol and isomeric tetrahydrocannabinols. The first two, but not the last, have been 
obtained as crystalline substances. The chemical structure and synthesis of these compounds have been 
described by Adams. 
<p> The typical effects of marihuana on man are ascribed to actions on the central nervous system. In 
dogs, the characteristic effect is ataxia. A delayed increase in pulse rate, a decrease in respiratory rate and 
blood pressure, and retching and vomiting were also observed. These effects are produced by 
tetrahydrocannabinol but not by cannabinol or cannabidiol. A derivative of the latter, 
tetrahydrocannabidiol, after a latent period of from thirty to seventy minutes following intravenous 
injection, had a specific convulsant action on the dog. 
<p> In rabbits a characteristic effect of marihuana extracts is corneal areflexia. This is also not produced 
by cannabidiol or cannabinol but does occur after tetrahydrocannabinol. However, impure oil mixtures 
have this action to a greater extent, from which it is suggested that a third unknown principle is present in 
the plant. 
<p> Cannabidiol has a synergistic hypnotic action with pernoston in mice. Neither cannabinol nor the 
synthetic tetrahydrocannabidiols had this effect. 
<p> The ataxia action of marihuana was considerably increased by a central stimulant, benzedrine. 
<p> No evidence was found of an acquired tolerance for the drug. 
<p> In examination of the data presented in the detailed clinical study it is seen that the effects reported 
were in the main those produced by the extract of marihuana taken by mouth. With the extract, the 
absorption is gradual and the action persists as long as the active principles are circulating throughout the 
body. The doses given were fixed ones and once taken the effects were beyond the subjects' control. 
Giving the extract thus afforded a longer period for study and insured greater accuracy in dosage. In New 
York, as far as is known, marihuana is rarely if ever taken in this form but is smoked in cigarettes. 
However, it is shown in the study that the effects from smoking correspond in kind to those from the 
extract. The difference is that, in smoking, the effects come on promptly and are of much shorter duration. 
How marked the reaction becomes depends on the number of cigarettes smoked and this is entirely under 
the subjects' control. The sensations desired are ple! 
asurable ones-a feeling of contentment, inner satisfaction, free play of imagination. Once this stage is 
reached, the experienced user realizes that with further smoking the pleasurable sensations will be changed 
to unpleasant ones and so takes care to avoid this.

In this important and provocative book, two eminent researchers describe the medical benefits of marihuana, 
explain why its use has been forbidden, and argue for its full legalization to make it available to all patients 
who need it. In support of that argument, individuals with various ailments--including cancer, epilepsy, 
AIDS, dysmenorrhea, and depression--provide poignant descriptions of their suffering before they began to 
use marihuana, the changes it has effected, and their difficulties in attempting to procure it legally.</font>

<H4>Review of University of California Report on Needle Exchange and  
Recommendations on Needle Exchange</H4><p>  
  
<A NAME="section1">  
<h3>1. ISSUE</h3>  
  
On October 15, 1993, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health  
requested that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) review  
the University of California (UC) research report on needle exchange  
(executive summary at Tab A) and provide recommendations and opinions on  
Federal action in response to needle exchange to the Principal Deputy  
Assistant Secretary for Health and the Surgeon General.<p>  
  
The UC report and recommendations were reviewed by CDC staff. The CDC also  
requested and received comments on the UC report and recommendations and  
opinions on Federal action in response to needle exchange from the National  
Institutes of Health (NIH) (Tab B), the Substance Abuse Mental Health  
Services Administration (SAMHSA) (Tab C), the Health Services and Resources  
Administration (HSRA) (Tab D), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  
(Tab E). Comments on this report to you were also requested from these  
agencies. The agencies were not asked for final concurrence on the CDC  
response. The attached comments (Tabs B-E) were provided by the Principal  
AIDS Coordinators of the four agencies.<p>  
<p>  
  
<A NAME="section2">  
<H3>2. SUMMARY</H3>  
  
<P>  
The UC research team has done a careful and scientifically sound  
compilation and review of all the available data on needle exchange  
and the availability of needles and syringes to injection drug  
users (IDUs). The UC team also gathered new data through surveys  
of needle exchange programs (NEPs), key informant interviews,  
and focus groups of IDUs.  
<P>  
NEPs are intended to decrease human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)  
transmission associated with injection drug use by replacing used,  
potentially HIV-infected syringes with sterile ones. They also  
can help IDUs obtain drug treatment and other public health services.  
The emergence of more than three dozen NEPs in the United States  
suggests an increasing acceptance of these programs as part of  
a community response to the dual epidemics of injection drug use  
and HIV infection. However, in some communities, NEPs have been  
very controversial. Some law enforcement, drug treatment, and  
community leaders are concerned that these programs give &quot;the  
wrong message&quot; about drug use and may reduce law enforcement  
agencies' ability to combat drug use and associated violence.  
Other concerns are that NEPs have not been shown to be effective  
in eliminating HIV transmission and may draw scarce resources  
away from other, possibly more effective, programs such as drug  
treatment.  
<P>  
The CDC concurs with the UC findings that (1) NEPs are effective  
in removing used, sometimes HIV-contaminated needles and syringes  
from circulation and replacing them with sterile ones, (2) IDUs  
using NEPs decrease HIV drug-risk behaviors (e.g., decreased sharing  
of injection equipment, decreased frequency of injection), (3)  
NEPs are effective in recruiting IDUs to enter drug treatment,  
(4) HIV prevalence in syringes returned to NEPs decreases, and  
(5) mathematical models of NEPs estimate substantial decreases  
in HIV transmission among NEP clients. Taken together, these observations  
indicate that NEPs are likely to reduce HIV transmission, even  
though the epidemiologic studies of NEPs do not definitively demonstrate  
decreases or increases in HIV transmission. The existing epidemiologic  
studies are limited in their ability to detect such changes. No  
data exists indicating increases related to NEPs in either drug  
use or in the number of discarded syringes. W8 endorse the UC  
report recommendation that additional research and evaluation  
on NEPs is a high priority to further assess the impact of these  
programs-s and the relative effectiveness of various models of  
delivery of NEP services.  
<P>  
Two other issues have prompted reconsideration of Federal policy  
on needle exchange: (1) the magnitude of the HIV epidemic among  
IDUs and the related epidemics among their sex partners and newborns  
in many areas of this country and (2) the limitations of alternative  
intervention options to prevent drug-related HIV transmission  
(e.g., limited capacity of drug treatment available to IDUs and  
limitations of bleach disinfection of injection equipment). Based  
on these observations and the weight of data presented in the  
UC report, we believe that the benefits of NEPs as a component  
of a comprehensive HIV prevention program for drug users exceed  
the theoretical risks of such programs. We conclude that the ban  
on Federal funding of NEPs should be lifted to allow communities  
and States to use Federal funds to support NEPs as components  
of comprehensive HIV prevention programs. We recommend that NEPs  
receiving Federal funds be linked to substance abuse treatment  
programs and other HIV prevention services. We also recommend  
that such programs be required to include evaluation components  
to validate their effectiveness.  
<P>  
Increasing the ability of IDUs to obtain and possess sterile needles  
and syringes should decrease HIV transmission for those who will  
not or cannot stop injecting drugs. Therefore, we also recommend  
that States consider the repeal of laws requiring a physician's  
prescription to buy needles and syringes and the removal of criminal  
penalities[sic] for the possession of needles and syringes, while  
maintaining the criminal penalties on other drug use equipment.  
Additional evaluation of these interventions is crucial.  
<P>  
  
<A NAME="section3">  
<h3>3. BACKGROUND</h3>  
<h4>The substantial role of injection drug use in the HIV/AIDS epidemic</h4>  
  
One-third of reported U.S. AIDS cases are related directly or indirectly to  
injection drug use. <a href="#note1">[1]</a> A disproportionate  
number of AIDS cases among people of color in the United States is related  
to infection drug use. In 1992, almost half of all AIDS cases reported  
among African Americans (49 percent) and Hispanics (48 percent) were  
directly or indirectly related to injection drug use.<p>  
  
The majority of reported AIDS cases among women and children in the United  
States are related to injection drug use. Among adult and adolescent women  
reported with AIDS in this country, nearly three-quarters (71 percent) were  
directly or indirectly related to injection drug use; 50 percent of women  
with AIDS reported injecting drugs and an additional 21 percent reported  
sexual contact with a male who injected drugs. Two-thirds (66 percent) of  
children with perinatally acquired AIDS had mothers who reported injecting  
drugs themselves and/or having sex with an IDU.<p>  
  
<h4>Preventing HIV/AIDS associated with injection drug use</h4>  
  
Use of drug injection equipment (especially needles and syringes) by more  
than one person (often called "sharing" or "multiperson use") is the  
primary mechanism for the spread of HIV related to injection drug use.  
Sexual transmission among IDUs also occurs. Several cultural and social  
factors are associated with the multiperson use of needles and syringes and  
other injection equipment. However, legal restrictions on the purchasing  
and possession of needles and syringes by IDUs are central factors in the  
multiperson use of needles and syringes. IDUs' access to and legal ability  
to possess sterile needles and syringes are limited by a variety of State  
and Federal laws, including (1) prescription laws, <a  
href="#note2">[2]</a> (2) drug paraphernalia laws, <a  
href="#note3">[3]</a> and (3) the Federal Mail Order Drug  
Paraphernalia Control Act. <a href="#note4">[4]</a> In States  
without prescription laws, the selective refusal of some pharmacists to  
sell needles and syringes to persons who might be IDUs is an additional  
barrier.<p>  
  
In its July 1991 report on "The Twin Epidemics of Substance Use and HIV, n  
the National Commission on AIDS recommended: "Remove legal barriers to the  
purchase and possession of injection equipment. Such legal barriers...  
limit the availability of new/clean injection equipment and therefore  
encourage the sharing of injection equipment, and the increase in HIV  
transmission.<p>  
  
Prevention and treatment for drug dependency and addiction are important  
HIV prevention strategies. However, only 10 to 20 percent of all drug users  
are in drug treatment programs at any given time. Drug treatment capacity  
is not expected to increase substantially in the near future, and the  
capacity will remain smaller than that required to provide drug treatment  
for all who need it and are willing to start. In addition, a substantial  
proportion of IDUs are unable or unwilling to stop injecting drugs and  
start drug treatment.<p>  
  
Outreach programs are another component of HIV prevention for IDUs. In  
addition to providing condoms and advising drug users to start drug  
treatment and to decrease drug use, since the mid-1980s, outreach workers  
have advocated the use of household bleach to disinfect drug-injection  
equipment (particularly needles and syringes). In April 1993, the CDC, the  
Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) of SAMHSA, and the National  
Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) of NIH issued an HIV Prevention Bulletin  
describing the limitations of bleach disinfection of needles and syringes  
and indicating that (1) sterile, never-used needles-and syringes are-safer  
than bleach-disinfected, previously used needles and syringes and (2)  
bleach disinfection is useful only when there is no other safer option. In  
this statement, Public Health Service (PHS) agencies clearly pointed out  
the limitations of one of the few HIV risk-reduction interventions for IDUs  
who share needles and syringes.<p>  
  
<A NAME="section4">  
<h3>4. LEGAL RESTRICTIONS OF FEDERAL FUNDING OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS IN  
THE UNITED STATES</h3>  
  
Congress has included provisions in at least six laws restricting the use  
of Federal funds for NEPs. For example, the FY 1994 Appropriations Act for  
the Department states that "no funds appropriated under this Act shall be  
used to carry out any program of distribution of sterile needles for  
hypodermic injection of any illegal drug, unless the Surgeon General of the  
United States determines that such programs are effective in preventing the  
spread of HIV and do not encourage the use of illegal drugs, except that  
such funds may be used for such purposes in furtherance of demonstrations  
or studies authorized in the ADAMHA Reorganization Act (Public Law  
102-321)."<p>  
  
<A NAME="section5">  
<h3>5. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REPORT ("THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT OF  
NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD")</h3>  
  
This project was carried out by a team of researchers at the School of  
Public Health of the University of California, Berkeley, and the Institute  
for Health Policy Studies at the University of-California, San Francisco.  
The study began in April 1992 and was supported by funds from the CDC  
through a cooperative agreement with the Association of Schools of Public  
Health.<p>  
  
The project staff gathered nearly 2,000 "data sources," including journal  
articles (475), conference abstracts (381), reports (236), and unpublished  
materials (159). Between May and September 1992, the team carried out site  
visits to 15 cities (10 in the United States, 3 in Canada, and 2 in  
Europe). During these site visits, structured observations of 33 needle  
exchange sessions were made. In addition, 110 key informants (including NEP  
staff, public health officials, and community leaders supporting and  
opposing the NEP) were interviewed, and 18 focus groups of clients and  
non-clients of the-NEPs (129 IDUs participated in the focus groups or  
individual interviews) were held by the UC project staff. UC project staff  
obtained extensive information on the budgets of the NEPs visited. To  
obtain a more complete picture of the NEPs in the United States, the  
project staff conducted a postal survey of 20 NEPs not visited.<p>  
  
The major findings of the UC study are presented in a Summary, Conclusion,  
and Recommendations document (43 pages). The detailed analysis and findings  
of the UC study are presented in Volume One (519 pages). Volume Two, a  
city-by-city description of NEP activities and related information from the  
site visits to nine U.S. and three Canadian cities, will be available in  
late December 1993.<p>  
  
Drafts of all chapters of the UC report were reviewed by a distinguished  
panel of expert reviewers representing a range of opinions on needle  
exchange (Dr. Mindy Fullilove, Dr. Don Des Jarlais, Dr. Ed Kaplan, Dr.  
Herbert Kleber, Dr. Douglas Owens, Dr. Beny Primm, and Ms. Beth  
Weinstein).<p>  
  
The UC team used stringent scientific standards in its analysis and  
interpretation of the collected published and unpublished studies on NEPs  
and needle and syringe availability. The UC report is the most extensive  
and comprehensive study of needle exchange ever published.<p>  
  
<A NAME="section6">  
<h3>6. NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA</h3>  
  
The information in this section on NEPs in the United States and Canada is  
derived from the UC report.<p>  
  
The first NEP to provide comprehensive services in the United States opened  
in 1988 in Tacoma, Washington. As of September 1, 1993, there were at least  
37 NEPs operating in 30 cities in 12 States. By June 1993, more than 5.4  
million syringes had been distributed (almost always in exchange for used  
syringes) by NEPs in the United States. In calendar year 1992, U.S. NEPs  
distributed more than 2.4 million syringes.<p>  
  
Needle exchange has provoked intense political debate at the national level  
and in some States (e.g., California, New York) and cities (e.g.,  
Baltimore, New York City, Boston, Berkeley). Nonetheless, in many cities  
(e.g., Seattle, Tacoma, San Francisco, Honolulu,- New Haven), large-scale  
NEPs have been established with substantial community support. In New York  
City, after years of intense political debate, five NEPs were legally  
opened in 1992 and now distribute about one million syringes a year. The UC  
team collected U.S. public opinion polls that-at- included questions  
regarding needle availability needle cleaning. These public opinion polls  
indicate that approximately half of the general public has supported harm  
reduction efforts, including needle cleaning, legalization of needles  
sales, needle exchange, and needle distribution. While this public support  
has tended to increase over time and has been somewhat higher for needle  
exchange than for needle distribution, needle exchange remains a  
controversial issue.<p>  
  
Substantial variations exist among U.S. NEPs in legal status,  
administrative structure, and sources of funding. Nineteen U.S. NEPs are  
"legal,"  <a href="#note5">[5]</a> eight are "illegal-tolerated,"  
<a href="#note6">[6]</a> and six are "illegal-underground."  
<a href="#note7">[7]</a> Six U.S. NEPs are administered by State or local  
governments, six by community-based organizations (CBOs with government  
sponsorship, eight by CBOs without government sponsorship, and thirteen by  
what the UC report called "activist" organizations. Private donations are a  
major source of funding at 19 U.S. NEPs, more than any other source of  
funding. Fourteen NEPs are financially supported by foundation grants, 12  
by funds from a CBO and/or activist organization administering the NEP, 12  
by city or county government, and 4 by State governments. Fifteen U.S. NEPs  
depend entirely on volunteer staff, and all but seven NEPs use volunteers.  
Twenty-seven of 33 U.S. NEPs surveyed or visited have "one-for-one rules"  
(one sterile syringe is given out for each syringe turned in). Seventeen  
NEPs provide "starter needles" (one or more [usually three] syringes  
provided to new NEP clients without requiring turn-in of used syringes).  
Ten NEPs have limits on the number of syringes that can be exchanged. Rules  
governing the exchange procedures are generally well enforced.<p>  
  
U.S. NEPs serve ethnically diverse IDU populations that generally reflect  
local ethnic and racial patterns. The mean age of U.S. NEP clients ranges  
from 33-41 years with a mean duration of drug injection ranging from 7-20  
years. NEPs successfully reach IDUs who are not enrolled in drug treatment,  
with studies in the United States reporting one-third to one-half of NEP  
clients having no prior exposure to drug treatment. NEP clients are at  
significant risk for drug-related HIV transmission with 10 to 60 percent  
reporting some needle sharing and about one-third reported sharing needles  
in the month preceding interview.<p>  
  
U.S. NEPs are reaching thousands of IDUs in the 30 cities in which they  
operate. In addition to needle exchange, a variety of public health  
services are provided on site or are available by referral, including drug  
treatment, HIV counseling and testing, primary medical care, tuberculosis  
and sexually transmitted disease screening and treatment, and social  
services. The UC team found that among NEPs visited with data on these  
activities, six NEPs had referred more than 2,000 drug users to drug  
treatment and that more than 800 drug users had started drug treatment  
after referral by four NEPs.<p>  
  
The median annual budget of U.S. and Canadian needle exchange programs  
visited is relatively low at 5169,000, with government run programs tending  
to have larger budgets. Some NEPs are more expensive because they also  
provide substantial additional services such as drug treatment  
referrals.<p>  
  
The UC team extensively reviewed the previously published mathematical  
models that estimated the impact of NEPs on HIV transmission, and developed  
additional models of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of NEPs in  
the United States. These efforts, in agreement with other independent  
reviews (e.g., the General Accounting Office [GAO] review), confirmed the  
theoretical and technical validity of the model used to estimate the impact  
of the New Haven NEP. Applied to other cities, a simplified version of this  
model predicted reductions ranging from 17 to 70 percent in new  
drug-related HIV infections among NEP clients. In one of the cities, the  
estimated cost-per-HIV-infection-averted by NEPs was between S3,700 and  
$12,000. These estimated costs of preventing an HIV infection compare very  
favorably with the costs of other lifesaving programs and are much less  
than the present value of the lifetime costs of medical care for a person  
with HIV infection ($119,000).<p>  
  
The UC report also reviews the development of NEPs in Canada, where the  
federal government provided leadership and initial funding (requiring  
provincial matching funds) for HIV prevention programs for drug users,  
including NEPs. In Canada all NEPs are legal, and there has been very  
limited community or professional opposition to the NEPs. Since the first  
Canadian NEPs were opened in 1989, the number of cities with active NEPs  
has steadily increased to a total of 28 cities in early 1993. More than 2.5  
million syringes were distributed through December 1992 by the five  
Canadian NEPs visited by the UC team.<p>  
  
<A NAME="section7">  
<h3>7. IMPACT OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS ON DRUG USE</h3>  
  
Accurate measurement of drug use patterns and numbers of drug users in  
communities is technically very challenging, in part because drug use is-an  
illegal activity. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to quantitatively  
assess the impact of NEPs on community drug use.<p>  
  
The UC report provides data on both the behavior of NEP clients and  
community measures of drug use. The UC report clearly documents that  
substantial numbers of IDUs (both clients and non-clients of the NEP) have  
been referred to drug treatment programs, a substantial step in reducing  
drug use by those individuals and in the community. The UC report presents  
the results of 26 evaluations in the United States and abroad that provide  
information on changes in drug-risk behavior among IDUs who were using  
NEPs; 16 of the 26 were judged to be of acceptable scientific quality.  
Although not definitive, the majority of these studies found that  
drug-related risk behaviors for HIV transmission were significantly reduced  
among NEP clients.<p>  
  
In addition, the UC team reviewed national drug use indicators and the  
findings of IDU focus groups. The limited data for U.S. cities with NEPs  
from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), Drug Use Forecasting (DUF)  
system, and Uniform Crime Reports do not show clear trends in patterns of  
drug use in those cities with NEPs. The IDU focus groups conducted in  
cities with NEPs consistently indicated that the participants believed that  
NEPs would have little effect on drug use in the community.<p>  
  
We agree with the UC team conclusion that available data are quite limited  
but provide no evidence of any NEP-related increases in community levels of  
drug use. However, the limitations of both available research methods and  
existing data addressing this issue underline the need for continuing  
evaluation and research on the impact of NEPs on drug use. Additional  
evaluation and research and the development of new research methods in this  
area should be a component of Federally supported NEPs.<p>  
  
A key concern of NEP opponents is that these programs will directly or  
indirectly increase drug use. Opponents view NEPs as directly increasing  
drug use by providing the means (needles and syringes) to inject drugs.  
They also see NEPs as indirectly promoting drug use by appearing to condone  
and facilitate drug use and thereby undermining the credibility of  
society's message that using drugs is illegal, unhealthy and morally wrong.  
However, no study in the United States or abroad was found that showed that  
NEPs increase community drug use.<p>  
  
<A NAME="section8">  
<h3>8. IMPACT OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS ON PREVENTING HIV INFECTION</h3>  
  
A major question in the policy debate over NEPs is their effectiveness in  
preventing-HIV infection among IDU-s-and-their contacts. Several findings  
strongly support the conclusion that NEPs reduce HIV transmission. First,  
the process of needle exchange removes used, often HIV-contaminated,  
needles and syringes from the hands of IDUs and replaces them with sterile  
needles and syringes. Second, NEPs are often effective in referring NEP  
client and non-client IDUs to drug treatment programs. Third, NEP clients  
report decreases in their HIV drug risk behaviors. Fourth, mathematical  
models of the impact of NEPs in New Haven and other cities consistently  
estimate substantial reductions (ranging from 17 to 70 percent) in HIV  
transmission for the IDUs using NEPs and their sex partners and children.  
Fifth, there is some evidence that hepatitis B infection is reduced by  
NEPs. On the other hand, epidemiologic studies which directly address HIV  
prevalence and incidence in relation to NEPs have been methodologically  
weak. One case-control study (in Amsterdam) found no protective effect of  
the NEP on HIV seroconversion among IDUs. However, the Amsterdam study was  
not primarily designed to test NEP effectiveness and included only a  
limited number (31) of new HIV infections. We concur with the UC conclusion  
that the relationship between NEPs and HIV infection may be very difficult  
to determine conclusively.<p>

<h3>9. REVIEW OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>  
  
In this section, the recommendations of the UC study are reviewed.<p>  
  
<STRONG>"Recommendations for the federal government</STRONG>  
<ul>  
<li>The federal government should repeal the ban on the use of federal  
funds for needle exchange services.  
  
<li>Substantial federal funds should be committed both to providing needle  
exchange services and to expanding research into these programs."  
</ul>  
<I>CDC comment:</I><p>  
  
Both recommendations are reasonable and appropriate with the minor  
modifications indicated in this section.<p>  
  
Given the significance of injection drug use in HIV transmission in the  
United States, it is important to implement NEPs as <EM>one possible component  
of comprehensive HIV prevention programs for drug users</EM>. Comprehensive  
programs should include increases in drug treatment, street and community  
outreach to drug users, and effective school and community-based programs  
to prevent initiation of drug use. The ban on Federal funding of NEPs  
should be removed to allow States and communities the option of including  
NEPs in comprehensive programs. NEPs will be more readily integrated into  
comprehensive programs when there is evidence of substantial local support  
for NEPs as indicated by any of the following: requests for an NEP from a  
State or local HIV community planning process; substantial funding for NEPs  
from local and/or State government or nongovernmental organizations; and  
efforts to reform the laws limiting the sale or possession of needles and  
syringes.<p>  
  
The PHS should fund additional evaluations of NEPs   
<A HREF="#note8">[8]</A> to gather more data  
on the impact of these programs and to assess the relative effectiveness of  
various models of delivery of NEP services. Additional research is needed  
on the initiation of drug use and drug injection and changes in community  
drug use, particularly in communities with high prevalence of drug use, as  
they relate to NEPs and other interventions that increase the availability  
of sterile needles and syringes. PHS agencies supporting research on NEPs  
should develop and promote the use of standardized data elements, methods  
of data collection, and protocols for evaluation and analysis.<p>  
  
<STRONG>"Recommendations for state governments</STRONG>  
  
<ul>  
<li>State governments in the ten states and the District of Columbia that  
have prescription laws should repeal these laws.  
  
<li>States should repeal the paraphernalia laws as they apply to syringes."  
</ul>  
  
<I>CDC comment:</I><p>  
  
Both recommendations are reasonable and appropriate with the modifications  
indicated in this section.<p>  
  
Although the major focus of the UC report was NEPs, there is ample evidence  
of the importance of allowing access to sterile needles and syringes for  
drug users who will not or cannot stop injecting drugs. In the United  
States and other countries, difficulty in obtaining and/or possessing  
needles and syringes contributes to multiperson use of needles and syringes  
and thereby to HIV transmission. NEPs can provide only a part of the  
increased access to needles and syringes that is needed to prevent HIV  
infection in IDUs, their sex partners and children. Changing the  
prescription and paraphernalia laws would increase IDU access to sterile  
needles and syringes with little or no expenditure of public funds.<p>  
  
An ongoing CDC and Connecticut evaluation of 1992 changes in the  
prescription and drug paraphernalia laws in Connecticut <a  
href="#note9">[9]</a> provides convincing evidence of the potential  
benefit of these recommendations. The evaluation found (1) steady increases  
of "non-prescription" purchases of needles and syringes from pharmacies,  
(2) that IDUs reported their primary source of needles and syringes shifted  
from street/black-market purchases to pharmacy purchases and (3) that  
sharing ("multiperson use") of needles and syringes decreased from 52  
percent prior to the new laws to 32 percent 8 to 12 months after the new  
laws were implemented. Similar increases in pharmacy purchases and  
decreases in sharing of needles and syringes were found in France after a  
prescription law was repealed in 1987.<p>  
  
The implementation of these recommendations is primarily the responsibility  
of State governments. We recommend that the Federal government and others  
support strong evaluation studies of the impact of changes in these laws on  
drug use patterns and HIV transmission risk behaviors. The use of  
standardized research methods yielding comparable results should be  
encouraged.<p>  
  
<STRONG>"Recommendations for local governments and communities</STRONG>  
  
<ul>  
<li>Local governments should enter into discussions with local community  
groups to develop a comprehensive approach to preventing HIV in injection  
drug users. their sex partners. and their offspring. This approach should  
include needle exchange programs and the expansion of drug treatment  
services.  
  
<li>Local communities should seek to further increase sterile syringe  
availability by encouraging the sale, distribution. or exchange of syringes  
by pharmacists."  
</ul>  
  
<i>CDC comment:</i><p>  
  
Both recommendations are reasonable and appropriate.<p>  
  
The experience with implementing NEPs in the United States and other  
countries indicates that NEPs are better accepted and operate more  
efficiently when there is extensive community involvement in planning how  
the NEP services will be provided. NEPs should be components of  
comprehensive, multifaceted HIV prevention programs for IDUs.<p>  
  
Pharmacy sale of sterile needles and syringes is an important component in  
increasing the availability of sterile injection equipment to IDUs. Retail  
pharmacies could provide widespread access to sterile needles and syringes,  
especially in areas where NEPs would be impractical (e.g., rural areas).  
Pharmacists are important "gate keepers" for the availability of sterile  
needles and syringes. Many pharmacists will need training to realize the  
importance of their public health role in helping ensure the availability  
of sterile needles and syringes to IDUs.<p>  
  
<A NAME="section10">  
<h3>10. INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF STERILE NEEDLES AND SYRINGES</h3>  
  
CDC believes that increasing the availability of sterile needles and  
syringes is appropriate Federal policy for the following reasons:<p>  
  
<ol>  
<li>HIV transmission associated with injection drug use is a major  
contributor to the growth of the current AIDS epidemic in the United  
States. Injection-related HIV transmission has caused increases in the  
number of AIDS cases among women and children, in heterosexually acquired  
HIV infections and in cases of tuberculosis.<p>  
  
<li>Restrictions on access to and the possession of needles and syringes  
increase the multiperson use ("sharing") of drug injection equipment that  
transmits HIV. <p>  
  
<li>A recent bulletin from the CDC, NIDA, and CSAT indicates that bleach  
disinfection of used drug injection equipment is not as safe as using  
sterile needles and syringes. Such disinfection is recommended only when  
sterile needles and syringes are not available. <p>  
  
<li>Evaluation of NEPs in the United States and other countries indicates  
that these programs can provide services to large numbers of IDUs, remove  
millions of used needles and syringes from circulation, and increase access  
to drug treatment and other high priority public health services. <p>  
  
<li>The preponderance of evidence indicates that NEPs diminish HIV  
transmission without increasing drug use. <p>  
  
<li>Evaluation of changes in the prescription and drug paraphernalia laws  
in Connecticut indicates that drug users change their usual source of  
needles and syringes from street and "black market" purchases to purchases  
-from pharmacies and substantially decrease sharing of injection equipment.  
<p>  
</ol>  
  
We recommend that the PHS adopt a policy goal of increasing the  
availability of sterile needles and syringes for IDUs. This specific HIV  
prevention strategy would be <EM>one component</EM> of comprehensive, multifaceted  
HIV prevention programs for IDUs. The following activities should be  
considered to implement this policy:  
  
<ul>  
<li>Allow Federal funding of NEPs, especially when these NEPs would also  
provide their clients with access to HIV counseling and other priority  
public health programs (e.g., drug treatment and tuberculosis screening and  
treatment). Programs that receive Federal funding should have substantial  
evaluation and/or research components either as part of the project or as a  
separately funded activity. <p>  
  
<li>Continue funding for research and evaluation studies of the impact of  
NEPs on HIV risk behaviors and HIV infection. <p>  
  
<li>(1) the repeal of State laws requiring a physician's prescription for  
the purchase of sterile needles and syringes, (2) the repeal of State and  
municipal laws and regulations making the possession of needles and  
syringes a crime, and 3) the removal of needles and syringes from the list  
of materials covered by the Federal Mail Order Drug Paraphernalia Control  
Act. Evaluations of the impact of these changes should be funded. <p>  
  
<li>Work with the professional associations of pharmacists and pharmacies  
to develop policies that increase the pharmacy-based availability of  
sterile needles and syringes. <p>

<H2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</H2>   
   
<H4>THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REPORT ("THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT OF NEEDLE   
EXCHANGE PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD")</H4>   
   
<h3>Conclusions</H3><p>   
   
<p>   
<em>How and Why did Needle Exchange Programs Develop?</em><p>   
   
Needle exchange programs have continued to increase in number in the U.S.   
and by September 1, 1993 at least 37 active programs exist. The evolution   
of needle exchange programs in the U.S. has been characterized by growing   
efforts to accommodate the concerns of local communities. increasing   
likelihood of being legal, growing institutionalization, and increasing   
federal funding of research, although a ban on federal funding for program   
services remains in effect.<p>   
   
<em>How do Needle Exchange Programs Operate?</em><p>   
   
About one-half of U.S. needle exchange programs are legal, but funding is   
often unstable and most programs rely on volunteer services to operate. All   
but six U.S. needle exchange programs require one-for-one exchanges and   
rules governing the) exchange of syringes are generally well enforced. In   
addition to having distributed over 5.4 million syringes, U.S. needle   
exchange programs provide a variety of services ranging from condom and   
bleach distribution to drug treatment referrals.<p>   
   
<em>Do Needle Exchange Programs Act as Bridges to Public Health   
Services?</em><p>   
   
Some needle exchange programs have made significant numbers of referrals to   
drug abuse treatment and other public health services, but referrals are   
limited by the paucity of drug treatment slots. Integrating needle exchange   
programs into the existing public health system is a likely future   
direction for these programs.<p>   
   
<em>How Much Does It Cost to Operate Needle Exchange Programs?</em><p>   
   
The median annual budget of U.S. and Canadian needle exchange programs   
visited is relatively low at $169,000, with government-run programs tending   
to be more expensive. Some needle exchange programs are more expensive   
because they also provide substantial non-exchange services such as drug   
treatment referrals. The annual cost of funding an average needle exchange   
program would support about 60 methadone maintenance slots for one year.<p>   
   
<em>Who Are the IDUs Who Use Needle Exchange Programs?</em><p>   
   
Although needle exchange program clients vary from location to location,   
the programs generally reach a group of injection drug users with long   
histories of drug injection who remain at significant risk for human   
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Needle exchange program clients in   
the U.S. have had less exposure to drug abuse treatment than IDUs not using   
the programs.<p>   
   
<em>What Proportion of All Injection Drug Users in a Community Uses the   
Needle Exchange Program?</em><p>   
   
Studies of adequately-funded needle exchange programs suggest that the   
programs do have the potential to serve significant proportions of the   
local injecting drug user population. While some needle exchange programs   
appear to have reached large proportions of local drug injectors at least   
once, others are reaching only a small fraction of them. Consequently other   
methods of increasing sterile needle availability must be explored.<p>   
   
<em>What Are the Community Responses to Needle Exchange Programs?</em><p>   
   
Unlike in many foreign countries, including Canada, proposals to establish   
needle exchange programs in the U.S. have often encountered strong   
opposition from a variety of different communities. Consultation with   
affected communities can address many of the concerns raised.<p>   
   
<em>Do Needle Exchange Programs Result in Changes in Community Levels of   
Drug Use?</em><p>   
   
Although quantitative data are difficult to-obtain, those available provide   
no evidence that--needle exchange programs increase the amount of drug use   
by needle exchange program clients or change overall community levels of   
non injection and injection drug use. This conclusion is supported by   
interviews with needle exchange program clients and by injecting drug users   
not using the programs who did not believe that increased needle   
availability would increase drug use.<p>   
   
<em>Do Needle Exchange Programs Affect the Number of Discarded Syringes?</em><p>   
   
Needle exchange programs in the U.S. have not been shown to increase the   
total number of discarded syringes and can be expected to result in fewer   
discarded syringes.<p>   
   
<em>Do Needle Exchange Programs Affect Rates of HIV drug and/or Sex Risk   
Behaviors?</em><p>   
   
The majority of studies of needle exchange program clients demonstrate   
decreased ratios of HIV drug risk behavior, but not decreased ratios of HIV   
sex risk behavior.<p>   
   
<em>What is the Role of Studies of Syringes in Injection Drug Use   
Research?</em><p>   
   
The limitations of using the testing of syringes-as a measure of injecting   
drug users' behavior or behavior change can be minimized by following   
syringe characteristics over time,. or by comparing characteristics of   
syringes returned by needle exchange program clients with those obtained   
from non-clients of the program.<p>   
   
<em>Do Needle Exchange Programs Affect Rates of Diseases Related to   
Injection Drug Use Other than HIV?</em><p>   
   
Studies of the effect of needle exchange programs on injection-related   
infectious diseases other than HIV provide limited evidence that needle   
exchange programs are associated with reductions in subcutaneous abscesses   
and hepatitis B among injecting drug users.<p>   
   
<em>Do Needle Exchange Programs Affect HIV Infection Rates?</em><p>   
   
Studies of the effect of needle exchange programs on HIV infection rates do   
not and, in part due to the need for large sample sizes and the multiple   
impediments to randomization, probably cannot provide clear evidence that   
needle exchange programs decrease HIV infection rates. However, needle   
exchange programs do not appear to be associated with increased rates of   
HIV infection.<p>   
   
<em>Are Needle Exchange Programs Cost-effective in Preventing HIV   
Infection?</em><p>   
   
Multiple mathematical models of needle exchange program impact support the   
findings of the New Haven Model. These models suggest that needle exchange   
programs can prevent significant numbers of infections among clients of the   
programs, their drug an sex partners, and their children. In almost ail   
cases, the cost per HIV infection averted is far below the $119,000   
lifetime cost of treating an HIV-infected person.<p>

<P> 
Interest in international comparisons on the use of incarceration 
has increased in recent years. From the Singapore caning of Michael 
Fay to changes in the use of prisons in eastern Europe to the 
use of prison labor in China, attention has focused on the ways 
in which nations utilize different sentencing policies. 
<P> 
In recent 
years, we have issued two prior reports comparing international 
rates of incarceration. <A NAME="back1"><A HREF="#note1">(1)</A> 
These reports documented that the United 
States had become the world leader in its rate of incarceration, 
having surpassed South Africa and the former Soviet Union, and 
that the black male rate of incarceration in the U.S. far exceeded 
that of black males in South Africa. 
<P> 
We now look again at these issues, in what is the most comprehensive 
survey to date on international rates of incarceration. The main 
findings of this report are the following: 
<UL> 
<LI>Russia has now surpassed the United States to become the world 
leader in its rate of incarceration, with 558 citizens per 100,000 
population in its prison system. The rise of organized crime, 
political instability, and the transition to an uncertain economic 
future have all played a factor in crime rates and the use of 
imprisonment. 
<LI>With 1.3 million Americans behind bars, the U.S. rate of incarceration 
is 519 per 100,000, second in the world among the 52 nations covered 
in this survey. <A NAME="back2"><A HREF="#note2">(2)</A> 
The U.S. rate has increased by 22 percent since 
1989, and is generally 5-8 times the rate of most industrialized 
nations. 
<LI>A racial breakdown of the U.S. inmate population shows that 
African-Americans are incarcerated at a rate that is more than 
six times that of whites -- 1,947 per 100,000, compared to 306 
per 100,000. 
<LI>Black males in the U.S. are incarcerated at more than four 
times the rate of black males in South Africa -- 3,822 per 100,000 
versus 851 per 100,000. 
<LI>The cost of incarceration nationally in the U.S. is estimated 
at $26.8 billion annually. Estimated costs of incarceration for 
African-American males are $11.6 billion annually. 
<LI>The number of African-American males in prisons and jails 
in the U.S. 583,000 is greater than the number of African-American 
males enrolled in higher education 537,000. 
<LI>Drug, property and public order offenders accounted for 84 
percent of the 155 percent increase in new court commitments to 
state prison from 1980 to 1992, while violent offenders accounted 
for only 16 percent of the increase. 
</UL> 
 
<P> 
As we have stated in past reports, a nation's rate of incarceration 
in itself only describes one aspect of its criminal justice or 
social policies. For example, a nation with a high rate of incarceration 
might have a high rate of crime, a harsh sentencing system, a 
politically repressive government, or some combination of these 
and other factors. Similarly, one cannot assume that nations with 
low incarceration rates necessarily have low crime rates or are 
respectful of civil liberties. For example, the cost of large 
scale incarceration is prohibitive for many Third World nations, 
so they maintain a low imprisonment rate. Other nations maintain 
a relatively low incarceration rate, yet have brutal conditions 
of confinement. In Zaire, for example, although the incarceration 
rate is a relatively modest 88 per 100,000, it has been reported 
that nearly 7.5 percent of the inmates in the prison system die 
each year due to malnutrition and poor health care. <A NAME="back3"> 
<A HREF="#note3">(3)</A> 
<P> 
With these cautions in mind, we look at the dramatically high 
rate of incarceration in the United States and attempt to assess 
the factors that have created the anomaly of one of the wealthiest 
nations in the world sharing the unenviable position of incarceration 
leader with its former Cold War rival Russia. Whatever the mix 
of crime rates, criminal justice policies, or social policies 
that have led to this situation, the rate of incarceration in 
the United States is so much higher than in comparable nations 
that it requires a close examination of the various causal factors. 
Given the renewed &quot;law and order&quot; climate in the country, 
we also examine the anticipated impact of newly adopted legislation 
and conclude with recommendations for what we believe would be 
a more rational criminal justice policy.

<H3>International Trends in the Use of Incarceration </H3> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
As can be seen in <A HREF="#figure1">Figure 1</A>, the Russian 
Republic has now replaced the United States as the world leader 
in its use of incarceration, with a rate of incarceration of 558 
per 100,000. 
 
<P> 
By all accounts, this has been the result of a greatly 
increased use of incarceration since the fall of the Soviet Union. 
For comparative purposes, estimates of the use of incarceration 
by the Soviet Union in 1989 ranged from 268 to 353 per 100,000. 
A variety of factors have led to the increased use of incarceration 
in Russia. <A NAME="back4"><A HREF="#note4">(4)</A> 
News accounts have discussed the rise of organized 
crime, coming at a time of much economic and political instability. 
As the country moves toward a market economy, the social disruption 
and loss of a limited social &quot;safety net&quot; for some may 
contribute to higher crime rates. It has been reported that during 
the first quarter of 1994, there was an average of 84 murders 
a day in Russia, a per capita rate that is about double that of 
the U.S. The use of the prison system for political prisoners, 
both in the past and at present, is an issue for which there are 
few precise figures. The State Department has also reported that 
because the court system does not have the resources to handle 
the increasing number of arrests, defendants are often held in 
pretrial detention for more than a year without judicial review. 
<A NAME="back5"><A HREF="#note5">(5)</A> 
<P> 
While comparative data are not readily available, some reports 
indicate that the high rate of incarceration in Russia may be 
in good part a result of harsher sentencing practices than other 
nations, and not primarily differences in crime rates. Comparing 
prison populations and sentencing practices in Russia to England 
and Wales, Roy D. King concluded that &quot;it would seem that 
many offenders are swept into the prison system for much more 
trivial offences, for much longer periods, and at much earlier 
points in their criminal careers [in Russia] than would be the 
case in Britain.&quot; <A NAME="back6"><A HREF="#note6">(6)</A> 
<P> 
The rate of incarceration in South Africa continues to remain 
far above that of most other nations as well, at 368 per 100,000 
population. <A NAME="back7"><A HREF="#note7">(7) </A> It should be 
noted that these figures are from the 
end of 1993, prior to the historic change of government in 1994. 
Therefore, it is too early to know what changes, if any, will 
be instituted by the new government. One early indication of a 
possible direction was a reduction of almost all prison sentences 
by six months following a nationwide series of prison disturbances 
in June, 1994. <A NAME="back8"><A HREF="#note8">(8)</A> 
<P> 
In a number of European countries, though not all, incarceration 
rates have been rising in recent years. In the Netherlands, long 
considered a leader in the limited use of incarceration, the rate 
of incarceration doubled during the 1980s. Even with this increase, 
however, the country's current rate of 49 per 100,000 still places 
it at one tenth the U.S. rate and far below most industrialized 
nations. 
<P> 
Comparing data for 1989 from our first report, we find 
that Italy's rate of incarceration increased by 33 percent in 
the period 1989-92, while Austria, Spain, and Switzerland registered 
gains in the 1416 percent range, and France and Denmark were virtually 
unchanged. 
<P> 
In the U.S., which was the world leader in 1989, incarceration 
rates have increased by 22 percent from 426 per 100,000 in 1989 
to 519 per 100,000 for 1992-1993. <A NAME="back9"> 
<A HREF="#note9">(9)</A> Thus, the rate of incarceration 
in the U.S. is approximately five to eight times the rate of Canada 
and most European nations. With a total of 1.3 million inmates 
in the U.S., at an estimated annual cost of incarceration of $20,000 
a year, the national cost of imprisonment in the U.S. is approximately 
$26.8 billion. Costs of incarceration for the 583,000 incarcerated 
African-American males are estimated at $11.6 billion annually. 
<P> 
As has been seen in previous reports, the rate of incarceration 
for African-American males is a major component of the high U.S. 
rates. Tables <A HREF="#table2">2</A> and <A HREF="#table3">3</A> 
below compare racial differences in incarceration in the U.S. 
and South Africa while still under apartheid.

<H3>Why Does the United States Have Such a High Rate of Incarceration? 
</H3> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
It would appear logical in many respects to assume that a high 
rate of incarceration is a direct response to high crime rates. 
In recent years, though, many criminologists and policymakers 
have concluded that imprisonment rates are to a great degree a 
function of criminal justice and social policies that either encourage 
or discourage the use of incarceration. The current wave of &quot;Three 
Strikes and You're Out&quot; proposals illustrates this well. 
States that have passed such legislation will soon experience 
an increase in their prison populations of varying degrees depending 
on the scope of the legislation. While one can debate whether 
or not these policies are appropriate or will have an impact on 
crime, it is clear that conscious policy choices are creating 
a higher rate of imprisonment. 
 
<P>We can see this as well by comparing 
incarceration rates among the states, where we find that a state's 
use of imprisonment is not necessarily directly related to its 
crime rate. For example, while Louisiana had the nation's highest 
rate of incarceration in 1992 and also had a high crime rate (fifth 
in the nation), Oklahoma was third in its imprisonment rate despite 
being just 21st in its crime rate. 
 
<P>At the other end of the spectrum, 
North Dakota was lowest in the nation in both crime and incarceration 
rates, but Mississippi was 40th nationally in its rate of incarceration 
despite having the 16th highest crime rate. Decisions made by 
legislators and criminal justice officials, including sentencing 
legislation, parole policies, and the availability of sentencing 
options and community resources, all play a role in determining 
incarceration rates. 
<P> 
In the following sections, we examine several factors that might 
be thought to contribute to the high rate of incarceration in 
the United States. These include: 
<UL> 
<LI>overall crime rates 
<LI>violent crime rates 
<LI>severity of sentencing policies 
<LI>cultural attitudes toward punishment 
</UL> 
 
<HR> 
 
<A NAME="item21"> 
<H4>Does the United States Have a High Rate of Incarceration Because 
of Higher Crime Rates than Other Nations?</H4> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
As we have seen, high incarceration rates can be a function of 
high crime rates, criminal justice policies, or social policies 
in other areas that influence crime. Some persons contend that 
the United States has a high rate of incarceration due to its 
high rate of crime or violent crime rate, compared to other nations. 
<P> 
Although there are a number of methodological problems involved 
in comparing crime and incarceration rates among nations, criminologists 
have attempted to study this issue in a variety of ways. A recent 
survey of this issue looked at whether incarceration rates in 
six industrialized nations (England and Wales, West Germany, France, 
New Zealand, Netherlands, and Sweden) could be explained by national 
crime rates. <A NAME="back10"><A HREF="#note10">(10)</A> The 
conclusion was that &quot;only a small measure 
of the differences in prison population between one jurisdiction 
and another or the changes in prison populations within particular 
jurisdictions seem to be related to crime rates.&quot; <A NAME="back11"> 
<A HREF="#note11"> (11)</A> 
 
<P>Further, 
the assumption that crime rates are substantially higher in the 
U.S. than in other industrialized nations is not true for most 
offenses. A comprehensive survey of victimization rates in the 
industrialized world conducted by the Dutch Ministry of Justice 
documented that rates of property crime and some assaultive crimes 
in the U.S. are not significantly different than in many comparable 
nations. <A NAME="back12"><A HREF="#note12">(12)</A> The twenty 
nation survey found that four nations (New 
Zealand, Netherlands, Canada, and Australia) exceeded the U.S. 
rate of victimization for the eleven crimes surveyed, including 
robbery, burglary, and car theft. Among individual offenses, the 
survey found that burglary rates in the U.S. were exceeded by 
New Zealand, Czechoslovakia, Australia, and Canada; that England, 
Australia, and New Zealand had higher rates of car theft; and 
that five nations (Czechoslovakia, Poland, Australia, Canada, 
and West Germany) had higher rates of sexual assault against women. 
<P> 
The victimization survey also confirms that the commission of 
a crime is to a certain extent a result of opportunity. For example, 
car theft rates are highest in countries where automobile ownership 
is high (such as the U.S., Australia, and England), while bicycle 
thefts also correlate with high ownership rates (as in the Netherlands 
and Sweden). Similarly, burglary rates are highest in countries 
with a significant proportion of semidetached or detached homes 
(including the U.S., Poland, England, and Australia). These findings 
have implications for crime prevention, such as making greater 
use of mass transit. 
<P> 
The data on crime victimization overall, therefore, does not provide 
an explanation for the high incarceration rate in the U.S. While 
it remains possible that crime rates account for part of the difference 
in rates of incarceration, the magnitude of the difference between 
the U.S. and other nations is so great that overall crime rates 
cannot account for the disparity. 
 
<HR> 
 
<A NAME="item22"> 
<H4>Do Rates of Violent Crime Explain the High Rate of Incarceration 
in the U.S.?</H4> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
Looking at rates of violent crime, we see sharper distinctions 
between the U.S. and most industrialized nations, in large part 
due to the role of firearms in U.S. crime rates. Rates of assault 
and murder with firearms are far higher in the U.S. than in comparable 
nations, with murder rates in the U.S. generally five to ten times 
the rate of most European nations. Since a violent offender is 
generally more likely to be incarcerated upon conviction than 
a nonviolent offender, a higher violent crime rate would be expected 
to result in a higher imprisonment rate. 
<P> 
We do not have sufficient 
data to analyze the relative proportions of violent and nonviolent 
offenders in other prison systems, or to assess how they compare 
to the U.S. in this regard. What is available, though, is information 
regarding the increase in the American prison population in recent 
years. Examining these data demonstrates that the substantial 
rise in the inmate population since 1980 was not primarily due 
to incarceration of violent offenders. 
<P> 
As seen in <A HREF="#table4">Table 4</A> 
below, data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics show that new 
court commitments to state prison increased by 155 percent from 
1980 to 1992. A breakdown of this increase, though, shows that 
violent offenders accounted for only 16 percent of this increase, 
with the remaining 84 percent being due to increased incarceration 
of drug and property offenders and persons convicted of public 
order offenses. Thus, while it may be true that part of the explanation 
for high incarceration rates in the U.S. is due to higher rates 
of violent crime, this is clearly not the primary factor behind 
the unprecedented increase in the prison population that we have 
seen in recent years.

<H4>Are Sentencing Policies in the U.S. Harsher than in Other Nations?</H4> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
Another way to explore this issue is to examine relative sentences 
in different nations for convicted offenders. Those who contend 
that the high rate of incarceration in the U.S. is primarily a 
product of high crime rates suggest that a comparison of sentencing 
policies is necessary in order to ascertain whether the U.S. is 
more punitive than other nations on a per crime basis. The evidence 
on this issue is somewhat mixed, but does not necessarily support 
the contention that high crime rates are the sole explanation 
for the high rate of incarceration in the U.S. 
<P> 
A 1987 study conducted by the Justice Department examined imprisonment 
decisions for the crimes of burglary, robbery, and theft in the 
U.S. compared with Canada, England, and the former West Germany. 
<A NAME="back13"><A HREF="#note13">(13)</A> 
The study found that the chances of receiving a prison term for 
an arrest on these offenses was roughly comparable in the U.S., 
Canada, and England, but lower, particularly for theft, in West 
Germany. A key issue that was not addressed in the study, though, 
was comparative length of sentence. It is possible, for example, 
that while convicted offenders in the U.S. are <U>sentenced to 
prison</U> at comparable rates to these two other nations, <U>sentence 
lengths</U> in the U.S. may be longer or shorter than in other 
countries. 
<P> 
In fact, European comparisons by Young and Brown found that sentence 
length was in fact a more critical variable than prison admissions 
in determining prison populations. In looking at the Netherlands 
and Sweden, both of which have low rates of incarceration, they 
concluded that the rate of sentencing to prisons was comparable 
to other nations, but that shorter average sentences accounted 
for the difference in incarceration rates. <A NAME="back14"> 
<A HREF="#note14">(14)</A> 
<P> 
One of the few studies that have attempted to compare the U.S. 
with other nations, although with some methodological limitations, 
came to the conclusion that U.S. sentencing practices were in 
fact more severe. In an examination of sentencing practices in 
the U.S. and France, Richard Frase looked at whether crime rates, 
and particularly violent crime, could explain the substantial 
difference in incarceration rates between the two nations. 
<A NAME="back15"><A HREF="#note15">(15)</A> His 
conclusion was that even controlling for differences in crime 
rates, American sentencing severity the use of prison as a sentence 
and the length of prison sentences was almost twice as high as 
in France. (By a somewhat more conservative estimation technique, 
Frase still estimated that American sentencing severity was about 
50 percent greater than in France.) 
<P> 
One limitation of the U.S. studies is that they analyze data from 
the early 1980s. Sentencing patterns in the U.S. have changed 
substantially since that time, with there now being a greater 
likelihood of incarceration for many offenses. Bureau of Justice 
Statistics data show that for every 1,000 arrests, the commitment 
rate to state prison has increased by 6 percent for robbery, 29 
percent for aggravated assault, 49 percent for burglary, and fully 
447 percent for drugs from 1980 to 1992. <A NAME="back16"> 
<A HREF="#note16">(16)</A> For drug offenses in 
particular, the length of imprisonment is also increasing in many 
jurisdictions due to the impact of mandatory sentencing laws. 
While we do not have data describing sentencing trends in other 
nations during this period, the changes in U.S. drug policy in 
particular suggest that the incarceration differential with other 
nations may continue to increase for some period of time. 
<HR> 
 
<A NAME="item31"> 
<H4>A Cross-National Look at Sentence Length</H4> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
If in fact sentence length is a key variable in understanding 
relative rates of incarceration, then the question is why different 
nations impose varying degrees of sentence length on offenders. 
Recent research in this area, analyzed by Warren Young and Mark 
Brown, provides some provocative conclusions. <A NAME="back17"> 
<A HREF="#note17">(17)</A> After reviewing 
explanations for harsher sentencing policies that look at issues 
such as unemployment rates and public policy decisions, they conclude 
that these do not provide sufficient correlations for cross national 
distinctions. They find instead that the most substantial explanation 
lies in the cultural attitudes of a society; that is, what most 
people would consider the &quot;right&quot; punishment. 
<P> 
Attitudes toward punishment tend to be shared within a society 
and affect decision making regarding the harshness of sentencing. 
But why are some nations more punitive than others? Research by 
Wilkins and Pease suggests that &quot;a society's penal climate 
or its relative punitiveness is linked to its relative egalitarianism: 
the greater a society's tolerance of inequality, the more extreme 
the scale of punishment utilized.&quot; <A NAME="back18"> 
<A HREF="#note18">(18)</A> Thus, sentencing severity 
is a type of negative reward for those at one end of the spectrum, 
compared to the positive rewards of income and status. A society 
like the United States, therefore, premised on a strong degree 
of individualism and with greater disparity of wealth than most 
industrialized nations, will be more likely to display harsher 
cultural attitudes toward sentencing policy than a nation with 
a broader social welfare system. 
<P> 
The implications of this analysis are quite profound, for it suggests 
that changes in criminal justice policy alone will not eliminate 
the differential in international rates of incarceration. This 
is not to deny the importance of changes in criminal justice policy, 
which can have a significant impact for sentencing of many offenders. 
The analysis tells us, though, that if a society is committed 
to lowering its rate of incarceration, either on fiscal or moral 
grounds, an overall reevaluation of cultural attitudes and values 
that determine sentencing policy needs to be initiated.

<H4>Summary: Toward an Understanding of Crime and Incarceration</H4> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
What can we conclude from this assessment of crime rates and incarceration? 
Several key themes emerge: 
<OL> 
<LI>Crime rates for most property crimes and some assaultive offenses 
in the U.S. are not significantly greater than for other industrialized 
nations, and therefore are not a major explanation for the high 
rate of incarceration in the U.S. 
<LI>Higher rates of violent crime in the U.S. are responsible 
for at least part of the nation's high incarceration rate compared 
to other nations. The dramatic increase in the prison population 
since 1980, though, was not primarily a result of sentencing greater 
numbers of violent offenders, since violent offenders represented 
only 16 percent of the increase in court commitments from 1980 
to 1992. 
<LI>The impact of the &quot;war on drugs&quot; has been responsible 
for much of the increase in the prison population, with 46 percent 
of new court commitments since 1980 being due to drug offenses. 
<LI>Cross national comparisons of rates of incarceration suggest 
that the length of prison sentences, rather than the number of 
persons sentenced to prison is the main determinant of differing 
rates of incarceration. Thus, alternatives to incarceration may 
have some impact on lowering a jurisdiction's incarceration rate, 
but this will generally be of less magnitude than altering sentence 
lengths. 
<LI>Once prisons are built, they are in many respects a self perpetuating 
entity. Prisons are constructed to last for 50-100 years and their 
continued use over time contributes to a culture that makes their 
use seem logical and rational. While few persons would argue with 
the necessity for a certain level of imprisonment in society, 
it is far from clear that incarceration is the only, or best, 
means of either preventing or controlling crime. A broad range 
of policies both within and outside the criminal justice system 
exist to accomplish these objectives, and different nations make 
use of these resources to varying degrees. Unless incarceration 
is examined in this context, policymakers will be confronted with 
a set of crime control options that is much more restrictive than 
necessary. 
</OL>

<H3>What Has Been the Impact of Increased Incarceration on Crime? 
</H3> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
While there are a variety of reasons why judges sentence offenders 
to prison, the underlying goal is to reduce crime, whether accomplished 
through incapacitation, deterrence, or rehabilitation in prison. 
Given the enormous increase in the use of imprisonment in the 
past two decades, along with heightened public concern about crime, 
it is critical to examine the effect these policies have had on 
public safety. 
<P> 
There is a small body of opinion, generally represented by the 
National Rifle Association and its allies, that contends that 
the prison buildup of the 1980s had a dramatic effect on crime 
rates and that &quot;Incarceration works.&quot; <A NAME="back19"> 
<A HREF="#note19">(19)</A> This assertion 
turns out to be based on serious distortions of criminal justice 
data. The NRA claims, for example, that the 150 percent increase 
in incarceration from 1980 to 1991 led to a 24 percent drop in 
&quot;serious victimization.&quot; Upon closer examination, however, 
the NRA definition of &quot;serious victimization&quot; includes 
violent crimes, but also the nonviolent crime of burglary, one 
of the FBI's seven Index offenses. While burglary rates did decline 
during the 1980s their inclusion with violent crimes distorts 
actual trends. Had the NRA included the Index offense of auto 
theft rather than burglary in its calculations, the results would 
have been very different, since auto theft victimization increased 
by 33 percent during this period. Looking only at violent crime, 
we find that the more than doubling of the prison population paralleled 
a 4 percent decline in violent crime during this period. 
<P> 
The &quot;relationship&quot; claimed by the NRA also turns out 
to be one that is not consistent over time. By breaking down crime 
and incarceration into two periods, 1980-86 and 1986-91, as seen 
below in Tables <A HREF="#table5">5</A> and <A HREF="#table6">6</A>, 
we find that incarceration rates rose by 65 percent and violent 
crime declined by 16 percent in the first period, but that from 
1986 to 1991, despite the fact that imprisonment rose 51 percent, 
violent crime also increased, by 15 percent. Clearly, no cause 
and effect relationship can be discerned here.

<P> 
What about crime rates overall, though, in addition 
to violent crime? Here, too, we see no consistent impact. Some 
crimes, such as burglary and larceny, have declined steadily since 
1980. Others, such as auto theft, have increased significantly. 
One measure of crime's impact on society is the financial harm 
suffered by victims. In this regard, the increase in auto theft 
has been far more costly, since the median loss to victims ($3,600) 
is substantially greater than for victims of burglary or larceny 
($50 and $55 respectively). <A NAME="back20"><A HREF="#note20">(20)</A> 
Again, any overall positive gains in crime control are difficult to discern.</A> 
<P> 
More sophisticated studies, such as those of Patrick A. Langan, 
have attempted to look at this issue as well, and have suggested 
that increased incarceration may have had some impact on crime 
rates. <A NAME="back21"><A HREF="#note21">(21)</A> Yet in a comparative study of the use of 
incarceration 
in England and the United States he concludes that &quot;Existing 
evidence does not suggest that crime can be dramatically reduced 
simply by putting more offenders behind bars,&quot; and that &quot;modest 
reductions in crime may be possible, but major and lasting reductions 
probably will require social intervention techniques, such as 
parent training or preschool intellectual enrichment programs.&quot; 
<A NAME="back22"><A HREF="#note22">(22)</A> 
<P> 
Two other issues bear on this relationship as well. First, as 
we have noted in previous reports, demographic issues play a significant 
role in crime rates, since young males produce disproportionately 
high rates of crime. As criminologists Darrell Steffensmeier and 
Miles Harer have noted, most of the change in crime rates in the 
period 1980-88 can be explained by changes in the proportion of 
the population in the age group 15-24. <A NAME=back23"><A 
HREF="#note23">(23)</A> 
<P> 
Second, the impact of drug 
crimes and arrests adds another dimension to this analysis, since 
drug offenses are not covered as part of the FBI's <U>Uniform 
Crime Reports</U>, or what is generally described as the &quot;crime 
rate.&quot; Since there are no data on the number of drug crimes 
that are committed, we can only look to statistics on drug arrests 
for general trends, where we find that drug arrests doubled during 
the 1980s. Some experts have speculated that the decline in some 
offenses such as burglary during this period may represent a shift 
in crime patterns from burglary to low level drug dealing, and 
not necessarily an overall reduction in criminal activity. 
<P> 
Finally, some advocates of increased incarceration contend that 
had the large buildup of the prison population not taken place, 
crime rates would have been even higher than they already are. 
This type of speculation can be neither proved nor disproved, 
but if one believes that crime would have increased, then there 
must have been some specific factors causing this. They may have 
included poverty, drug abuse, poor education, and family breakdown, 
among others. Addressing these problems should have more of an 
impact on crime than continuing to expand the prison population.

<H3>Why Hasn't Incarceration Had More Impact on Crime?</H3> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
Common sense would tell us that locking up offenders should have 
an impact on crime. Certainly, some offenders are incapacitated 
or deterred through incarceration. What seems surprising at first, 
though, is the relatively limited nature of this impact, particularly 
given the massive use of incarceration in the United States. An 
examination of three key issues in demographics and criminal justice 
processing, though, reveals why the prison system has such a modest 
impact on crime: 
<P> 
<STRONG>1. The &quot;Criminal Justice Funnel&quot; </STRONG> 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
First, the criminal justice system operates as a &quot;funnel.&quot; 
At the top of the funnel are all the crimes that are committed, 
and at the bottom, the number of offenders sentenced to prison. 
The slope of the funnel is quite steep since for many offenses, 
the crime is never reported to the police, an arrest is not made, 
a conviction is not obtained, or an offender is not sentenced 
to prison. Generally, fewer than 3 percent of all serious crimes 
result in a prison sentence. 
<P> 
One unknown variable is the fact 
that some convicted offenders have committed additional crimes 
which have gone undetected. Incarcerating these offenders therefore 
responds to more than just the single crime of conviction. Yet 
even if we multiply the 3 percent figure by a factor of five or 
ten, it is clear that the system is still only able to use incarceration 
for a relative handful of serious offenses. 
</BLOCKQUOTE> 
 
<P> 
<STRONG>2. The Impact of Demographics</STRONG> 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
The prison system is also limited by the impact of demographics; 
in particular the fact that a disproportionate number of crimes 
is committed by 15-18 yearold males. For the crimes of burglary, 
robbery, and assault, for example, the peak age of crime commission 
is 18. <A NAME="back24"><A HREF="#note24">(24)</A> Within six years, 
these rates are half their peak. This 
&quot;aging out&quot; of crime phenomenon has two implications 
for policy: 1) for each succeeding year that offenders are locked 
up in prison, fewer crimes are being prevented than the year before; 
and, 2) unless the factors leading to high crime rates in the 15-18 
year age range are addressed, incarceration will remain an &quot;after 
the fact&quot; response that fails to address the new annual cohort 
of potential offenders. 
</BLOCKQUOTE> 
 
<P> 
<STRONG>3. The &quot;Replacement&quot; Effect</STRONG> 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
Finally, the &quot;replacement&quot; effect of crime commission 
limits the utility of incarceration as a means of crime control. 
As we have seen most clearly for drug offenses, the massive increase 
in the use of imprisonment for drug offenders in the 1980s had 
little discernible impact on drug abuse or drug crimes. As long 
as a market exists for drugs, new potential sellers will emerge 
to take the place of those who are locked up.

In recent years, the plight of African-American males has been 
the subject of much discussion. A 1990 report of The Sentencing 
Project documenting that one in four young black men was under 
some form of criminal justice control received widespread national 
attention. A variety of activities have been undertaken to both 
study these issues and to address them programmatically. These 
have included Congressional hearings, the formation of task forces, 
community based programs, and others. Despite this level of activity, 
though, the number of incarcerated African-American males has 
increased from 499,000 in 1990 to 583,000 by 1992-93. 
<P> 
An analysis 
of the causes of this distressing situation is complex. An examination 
of recent trends, though, points to both social policy factors 
and criminal justice policies that relate directly to this problem. 
<P> 
One of the key issues facing the nation today is the problem of 
youth violence, an area in which African-American males are over-represented 
both as victims and perpetrators. Research in this area by criminologist 
Delbert Elliott indicates a number of directions in which social 
policy plays a significant role in producing differential outcomes 
by race. 
<P> 
Elliott's review of comparative rates of youth violence 
finds that rates of violence are high overall and that they cut 
across racial and class lines. <A NAME="back26"><A HREF="#note26">(26)</A> 
Youth self report studies show 
that for 16-17 year old males, 20-25 percent of the population 
report having engaged in &quot;serious violent offending,&quot; 
defined as aggravated assault, forcible rape, robbery, and homicide. 
Racial differences are relatively modest by age 18, the rate of 
reported violent offending among blacks is only 18 percent higher 
than for whites. 
<P> 
After the teen years, two trends emerge. First, 
the vast majority of violent youth cease their involvement within 
a few years of its onset. Of those youth who were engaged in violent 
behavior as teens, nearly 80 percent report discontinuing such 
behavior by their twenties. 
<P> 
For black youth, though, nearly twice 
as many persist in their violent offending after age 21. The one 
significant exception to this pattern, though, is among those 
males who are employed. Within this group, there are no discernible 
differences by race. 
<P> 
Elliott concludes that the key to reducing adolescent violent 
behavior lies in enabling these individuals to make a successful 
transition to the adult roles of work, marriage, and parenting. 
He finds that:

...race and class differences in serious violent offending are 
small during adolescence, but become substantial during the early 
adult years. This difference does not appear to be the result 
of differences in predispositions to violence, but in the continuity 
of violence once initiated. Race, in particular, is related to 
finding and holding a job, and to marriage and stable cohabiting 
rates. In essence, race and poverty are related to successfully 
making the transition out of adolescence and into adult roles. <A

<P> 
While incarceration may be necessary to respond to certain violent 
behaviors, its role in enabling young offenders to make the transition 
to work and family is virtually nonexistent. For middle class 
youth who have access to resources, this transition is far more 
likely to take place successfully with or without any intervention 
by the criminal justice system. 
<P> 
Compounding these problems in 
the larger community and economy are criminal justice policies 
of recent years which have further marginalized African-American 
young males. As we have noted previously, the &quot;war on drugs&quot; 
in particular has played a substantial role in exacerbating the 
continuously increasing rates of incarceration. The other major 
outcome of this &quot;war&quot; has been to increase the already 
substantial disparity in incarceration suffered by African-Americans.

<H3>The New &quot;Law and Order&quot; Climate</H3> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
A visitor from another planet might be forgiven for being utterly 
confused about the direction of American criminal justice policy. 
The observer would first note that two decades of steadily increasing 
rates of incarceration had not resulted in any Americans feeling 
safer from crime. He or she might understandably then believe 
that a reconsideration of incarceration policies would be in order. 
<P> 
Looking at activities in Congress and state legislatures, though, 
it is clear that little of this is taking place. Congress and 
at least a dozen states have passed &quot;Three Strikes and You're 
Out&quot; laws mandating life without parole for certain three-time 
offenders. <A NAME="back28"><A HREF="#note28">(28)</A> Despite rising 
costs of corrections, prison construction 
continues almost unabated in most parts of the country. And, public 
opinion polls show substantially heightened concern about crime 
along with support for various restrictive sentencing policies. 
<P> 
How does one explain this seeming inconsistency between reality 
and public policy? Many criminal justice observers have noted 
the fact that fear of crime appears to be increasing even as crime 
rates remain about the same as ten years ago. Several factors 
explain this: 
<P> 
<STRONG>1. Crime rates compared to what?</STRONG> 
While it is true that crime rates are about the same as ten years 
ago, they are significantly higher than thirty years ago. Therefore, 
most adults can remember a time in their early life when they 
felt, and were, significantly safer than they are today. So, whether 
crime is up a little or down a little from year to year, there 
is an understandably greater concern about its impact on daily 
life. 
<P> 
A second issue in this area regards the distinction between 
crime <U>rates</U> the proportion of crime for a given population 
and the actual <U>number</U> of crimes. When one reads news accounts 
of cities experiencing record <U>numbers</U> of murders, for example, 
it is often the case that the <U>rate</U> of murder is lower than 
in previous years. While the murder rate in the U.S. is clearly 
intolerably high, distortions such as this only contribute to 
misperceptions and a heightened climate of fear. 
 
<P> 
<STRONG>2. Media access and sensationalism</STRONG> 
Public policy in the area of crime control has for a long time 
been overly influenced by a relative handful of sensational events. 
The Willie Horton issue of the 1988 Presidential campaign was 
one of the most prominent examples, along with more recent events 
such as the 1993 tragic murder of 12 year old Polly Klaas in California 
and the killings on the Long Island Railroad commuter train. Atypical 
as these events may be, they create a distorted perception of 
the actual risks of violent crime. 
<P> 
Another factor in this area 
is the broader variety of media outlets that now exist and the 
more sensational forms of reporting engaged in by many of them. 
The police highway tracking of O.J. Simpson and his subsequent 
court appearances illustrate ways in which violent crime comes 
into the American home in a much more direct way than in the past. 
<P> 
<STRONG>3. Political grandstanding</STRONG> 
One of the more significant political developments on crime policy 
in recent years is that under the Clinton administration, the 
Democrats have tried to &quot;take the crime issue away&quot; 
from Republicans. Public opinion polls show this strategy to have 
been largely successful, with more respondents indicating confidence 
in the Democrats to control crime. 
<P> 
In large part, though, this 
has been little more than promoting the &quot;get tough&quot; 
approach that the Republican party has been perceived to offer 
for many years. The President's support for &quot;Three Strikes 
and You're Out&quot; in his State of the Union message, Congressional 
support for more prison construction, and the failure to make 
any significant inroads on the issue of mandatory sentencing indicate 
a willingness to pursue many of the major policy thrusts of the 
Reagan/Bush era. 
<P> 
The primary distinction made by the Democratic leadership in contrast 
with the past has been the call for a &quot;mix of punishment 
and prevention&quot; approach to crime. Few persons would argue 
with the need for such a mix in general terms. The flaw in this 
approach, though, is that it presupposes that an &quot;equal&quot; 
mix of punishment and prevention is what is called for today. 
As the history of the past twenty years has demonstrated, there 
has been absolutely no reluctance to engage in punishment, even 
to the point of becoming a world leader in the use of incarceration. 
At the same time, due to budgetary constraints and a changing 
political climate, resources devoted to prevention in a broad 
sense have declined in many respects. 
<P> 
Therefore, if a mix of punishment 
and prevention is what is actually needed, policymakers should 
begin to assess how to achieve that mix. Clearly, an emphasis 
on &quot;front-end&quot; preventive approaches and a decreased 
emphasis on &quot;back-end&quot; reactive approaches should be 
pursued if the nation is to reach a balance between punishment 
and prevention. 
<P> 
<STRONG>4. Intersection of race and crime.</STRONG> One of the 
defining issues of American criminal justice policy 
for many years has been the equation of crime with African-American 
males. The dynamics of this phenomenon are complex, but they center 
around the vicious cycle that has been created in the national 
consciousness. 
<P> 
For violent offenses in particular, African-American 
male rates of offending are considerably higher than for other 
groups. This fact is then portrayed in frequent media depictions 
of young black men as criminals, which lends support to policies 
designed to incarcerate ever larger numbers of them. Rarely in 
this process is any attempt made to understand how a 15 year old 
youth has become a school dropout who is selling drugs and carrying 
a gun, or what types of family and community responses might have 
prevented these developments. Few middle class families would 
willfully hand over their teenage children to the criminal justice 
system for punishment or rehabilitation, yet African-American 
males are processed into the system in historic numbers with little 
questioning by the larger community. 
<P> 
Lost in the process as well 
is the fact that for some offenses, African-Americans are disproportionately 
represented in the criminal justice system even though their rates 
of crime commission are not responsible for the disparities. The 
sentencing disparities between powder cocaine and crack cocaine 
have been well documented, showing that punishments for these 
two forms of the same drug are correlated with the race of the 
user in large part. 
<P> 
Finally, by looking only at prison populations for sources of 
disparity, we miss key aspects of the potential sources of disparity. 
For example, within the category of violent offenses, African-Americans 
arrest rates are approximately the same as the proportion of African-Americans 
in prison. If one were to look at white collar or corporate crimes, 
though, two issues would emerge. First, we would find that African-Americans 
are underrepresented as offenders, and second, that the system 
has historically put fewer resources into prosecuting these types 
of crimes. Thus, decisions regarding criminal justice priorities 
play a role in determining the composition of prison populations 
regardless of particular crime rates. 
 
<HR> 
 
<A NAME="item8"> 
<H4>The Impact of the New &quot;Law and Order&quot; Movement</H4> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
It is still too early to project the full impact of the various 
sentencing policies that have been adopted or are under consideration 
at the national and state level. Much of the impact will depend 
on how broadly the various proposals are crafted, and how they 
are implemented in practice. It is already clear, though, that 
the new &quot;get tough&quot; movement has been successful in 
producing a variety of harsh sentencing proposals, most notably, 
the &quot;Three Strikes and You're Out&quot; proposals. 
<P> 
The impact of these proposals will be felt in both fiscal terms 
and potential disruptions to components of the criminal justice 
system. Much of this can be seen most clearly in the California 
legislation, which is by far the broadest to date. In addition 
to providing life without parole for &quot;three-time losers,&quot; 
the California statutes also increase sentences for a broad range 
of offenses. The Department of Corrections has estimated that 
the legislation will lead to an increase of 275,000 in the prison 
population over the next thirty years, with an additional operating 
cost of $5.7 billion annually. Further, the legislation will necessitate 
an additional $21 billion in prison construction costs. 
<P> 
The impact of &quot;3 Strikes&quot; laws has already been observed 
at trials and sentencing in a number of states: 
<UL> 
<LI>One of the first offenders sentenced under the Washington 
state law was 35year old Larry Fisher, whose third strike involved 
robbing a sandwich shop of $151 by pretending that the finger 
in his pocket was a gun. His previous two strikes involved pushing 
his grandfather down and taking $390 from him, and a $100 pizza 
parlor robbery that also did not involve a weapon. 
<LI>In the case of the first defendant to be tried in San Francisco 
under the state's new law, the 71-year old victim whose car had 
been burglarized refused to testify in court because she viewed 
the penalty as far too severe. 
<LI>In the first case to be tried in Los Angeles, jurors deadlocked 
on a routine burglary charge, reportedly because three jurors 
believed life in prison was an overly harsh penalty for a nonviolent 
crime. 
</UL> 
 
<P> 
The new generation of harsh sentencing policies will also have 
several lasting impacts: 1) prison construction required as a result 
of their implementation will represent a commitment to use of these 
institutions for at least fifty years; 2) funds diverted to increased 
costs of corrections will not be available to address a variety of 
crime prevention measures; 3) the already tragic levels of 
incarceration for African-Americans males will be increased; and, 
4) political debate on crime will be further stifled and more 
focused on a narrow range of sentencing policies. 
<P> 
The ultimate measure of these proposals, of course, is their impact 
on crime. In this area, too, there is no reason to believe that 
these proposals will be effective. The demographics of crime commission 
show us that incarcerating a 50 or 60 year old offender is an 
extremely expensive means for preventing very few crimes. Rather 
than providing more resources to prevention and a more effective 
juvenile justice system, funding will be diverted to the creation 
of geriatric prisons that will hurt taxpayers financially but 
not provide them with any increased public safety. 
<HR> 
 
<A NAME="item9"> 
<H3>Recommendations for a More Rational Crime Policy </H3> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
The analysis of crime and incarceration described in this report 
tells us that the high rate of incarceration in the United States 
is not solely a product of higher rates of crime than other nations, 
nor has it achieved a substantial impact on reducing crime. Despite 
a quadrupling of the inmate population since 1973, Americans do 
not feel safer from crime and are still victimized by high rates 
of crime and violence. 
<P> 
We have no illusions that the current tough 
climate on crime control policies will recede in the near future. 
Too many senseless crimes combined with too much media sensationalism 
and political grandstanding have created an emotional and politicized 
atmosphere that makes rational discussion of crime control policies 
exceedingly difficult. 
<P> 
Nevertheless, there remain many professionals 
and others who care about the crime problem and are genuinely 
searching for constructive responses. In addition, numerous public 
opinion surveys have documented that the public is far more responsive 
to a broad range of solutions to crime than is commonly assumed. 
The problem is that the range of choices generally presented in 
public policy discussions is exceedingly narrow. 
<P> 
In previous reports, we have suggested policy changes that could 
have an impact on rates of incarceration while providing more 
appropriate sanctions and services to offenders. These include: 
<UL> 
<LI>Repealing mandatory sentencing laws in order to restore appropriate 
judicial discretion; 
<LI>Treating the drug problem primarily as a public health problem 
rather than as a criminal justice problem; 
<LI>Supporting the expansion of a broader range of alternatives 
to incarceration to provide judges and communities with viable 
community based sentencing options; 
<LI>Establishing a national commission to examine the high rate 
of incarceration in the U.S., and of African American males in 
particular. 
</UL> 
 
<P> 
These and other policy changes would begin to control the spiraling 
rate of incarceration and associated costs. Implementing these 
policies, though, is a political problem, one in which there has 
been relatively little constructive leadership. It is far from 
certain that the political climate on crime can be altered significantly 
in the short run. If it is to change in the long run, though, 
a framework such as the following needs to be presented: 
<OL> 
<LI>No &quot;anticrime&quot; proposals enacted today whether prison 
construction or prevention programs will have much impact on crime 
in the next several years. It is far more important to look toward 
the generation of youth being born today and to develop policies 
that will reduce their chances of becoming offenders as they reach 
their teen years. 
<LI>The criminal justice system, as a reactive system, can only 
have a limited impact on crime. While a system of justice and 
sanctions is necessary, we should not look to the courts and prisons 
as the primary means of controlling or preventing crime. 
<LI>Crime is a product of many factors, including individual, 
family, and community issues. Only an understanding of the complexity 
of these factors will enable us to develop a comprehensive strategy 
for responding to the problem. 
</OL> 
 
<P> 
For too long, public debate on crime has been polarized and stifling. 
As a result, we are faced with the problems of continuing high 
rates of crime, increasing rates of incarceration, and continuing 
public dissatisfaction. After twenty years of &quot;getting tough,&quot; 
it is hard to imagine how new &quot;tough&quot; proposals will 
succeed any better than their predecessors. It is time to publicly 
acknowledge this crisis and to initiate a more honest and open 
debate about the pressing problem of crime. 
<HR> 
<A NAME="item10"> 
<H3>Methodology for Prisoner Data</H3> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
<U>United States</U> Data are for the years 1992-93 (the most 
recent available), and were derived from Bureau of Justice Statistics 
(BJS) reports detailing the number of prison inmates on December 
31, 1993 and the number of jail inmates on June 30, 1992. From 
the total inmate figure, we excluded 2,804 juveniles being held 
in local jails as well as 50,966 inmates under federal or state 
jurisdiction who were being held in local jails, so as to avoid 
duplication with the jail count. 
<P> 
To calculate the racial composition 
of the state and federal inmate population, we used the figures 
of 47.9 percent black and 46.8 percent white from <U>Correctional 
Populations in the United States</U>, 1991 (BJS). The racial composition 
of jail inmates was derived in two steps. We first used the figures 
of 44.1 percent black and 40.1 percent white non-Hispanic from 
the 1992 jail report. We then estimated the portion of the Hispanic 
population (14.5 percent of jail inmates) by race, using Census 
Bureau estimates that the Hispanic population nationally is 95 
percent white, 2 percent black, and 2 percent other. Male inmate 
populations were calculated by race by using the 1991 proportions 
for state and federal inmates and the 1992 overall data for jails. 
All racial data represent a small undercount, since data on race 
are not available for approximately 4 percent of state and federal 
inmates. Overall population data were taken from Census Bureau 
estimates for 1993. 
<P> 
A small margin of error is inevitable in these 
calculations. It is possible, for example, that the racial composition 
of the Hispanic inmate population is different than for the population 
as a whole. There is no reason to believe, though, that the overall 
inmate population estimates are off by a substantial margin. 
<P> 
<U>Other Nations</U> Sources for prisoner data include Human Rights 
Watch, Penal Reform International, Australian Institute of Criminology, 
<U>Corrections Compendium</U>, and Professor Nils Christie. Data 
for Asian counties are all for 1993; for Europe and other continents, 
data are for either 1992 or 1993. 
<P> 
Data for Russia are taken from 
three sources. The most current is from a report of a lecture 
given by the General Director of the Russian Prison System, as 
described by Nils Christie of the University of Oslo in the 1994 
edition of <U>Crime Control as Industry</U>, documenting a total 
of 848,000 inmates. An April 1993 article by Gary Hill appearing 
in <U>Corrections Compendium</U> cites almost identical figures 
(845,000), and the State Department's <U>County Reports on Human 
Rights Practices for 1993</U> lists the prison population as 827,000. 
We have used Christie's figure as the most current, and from it 
have deducted the 19,000 juveniles reported by Hill, so as to 
be comparable to the U.S. calculations. 
<P> 
The South African figures are taken from the 1993 report of the 
South African Prisons Service. The South African categories of 
&quot;black&quot; and &quot;colored&quot; are combined to produce 
the black male rate of incarceration. In previous reports, we 
have attempted to estimate the incarceration rate for the four 
&quot;independent&quot; homelands that were not recognized by 
any nation outside South Africa. This estimate was then incorporated 
into the overall figures for South Africa to derive a rate of 
incarceration. Since there are no current reliable figures for 
these homelands for 1993, we have not included them in either 
the prison data or the overall population data for South Africa. 
Therefore, the incarceration rates reported here are not entirely 
comparable to those of past reports. Since the homelands are now 
officially part of South Africa, we hope that in future reports 
data will be available for the entire population. 
<P> 
Although previous reports included data for China, there are no 
current data that are considered reliable by most observers.

<P> 
For close to two decades, the criminal justice system in the United 
States has been undergoing a tremendous expansion. Beginning in 
1973, the number of prisoners, criminal justice personnel, and 
taxpayer dollars spent has increased dramatically, with new record 
highs now being reached each year. Between 1973 and 1988, the 
number of felons in state and federal prisons almost tripled from 
204,000 to 603,000. <A NAME="BM1top"></A><A href="#BM1">(1)</A> 
By 1989, the total inmate population in our nation's prisons and 
jails had passed the one million mark. <A NAME="BM2top"></A><A href="#BM2">(2)</A> 
<P> 
Record numbers of persons are also being placed under probation 
or parole supervision. <A NAME="BM3top"></A><A href="#BM3">(3)</A> 
These aspects of the criminal justice system are sometimes overlooked 
when the problems of prison and jail populations and overcrowding 
are explored. 
<P> 
The extended reach of the criminal justice system has been far 
from uniform in its effects upon different segments of the population. 
Although the number of women prisoners has increased in recent 
years at a more rapid pace than men, the criminal justice system 
as a whole still remains overwhelmingly male -- approximately 
87 percent. And, as has been true historically, but even more 
so now, the criminal justice system disproportionately engages 
minorities and the poor. <A NAME="BM4top"></A><A href="#BM4">(4)</A>

<P> 
This report looks at the impact of the criminal justice system 
as a whole on the new generation of adults -- those people in 
the 20-29 age group. In particular, it examines the devastating 
impact that the criminal justice system has had on the lives of 
young Black men and Black communities. 
<P> 
This report does not attempt to explain whether or why Blacks 
are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system. 
Other studies have attempted to document whether Black males commit 
more crimes or different types of crimes than other groups, or 
whether they are merely treated more harshly for their crimes 
by the criminal justice system. <A NAME="BM5top"></A><A href="#BM5">(5)</A> 
Instead, this report looks at the end result of that large-scale 
involvement in the criminal justice system, and highlights the 
implications this raises for crime control policies. 
<P> 
Using data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the Bureau 
of the Census, we have calculated the rates at which different 
segments of the 20-29 age group come under the control of the 
criminal justice system. The analysis looks at the total number 
of persons in state and federal prisons, jails, probation, and 
parole, and compares rates of criminal justice control by race, 
sex, and ethnicity. <A NAME="BM6top"></A><A href="#BM6">(6)</A> 
Because of the unavailability of complete data in some categories 
of the analysis, the total rates of control should not be considered 
exact calculations, but rather, close approximations of the numbers 
of persons in the system. As described in &quot;Methodology,&quot; 
in all cases where data were lacking, conservative assumptions 
were used in making calculations. (Sufficient data were not available 
to analyze criminal justice control rates for Native Americans 
or Asian Americans.) 
<P> 
Our findings, as displayed in Tables 1 and 2, are as follows: 
<UL> 
<LI>Almost one in four (23 percent) Black men in the age group 
20-29 is either in prison, jail, on probation, or parole on any 
given day. 
<LI>For white men in the age group 20-29, one in 16 (6.2 percent) 
is under the control of the criminal justice system. 
<LI>Hispanic male rates fall between these two groups, with one 
in 10 (10.4 percent within the criminal justice system on any 
given day). 
<LI>Although the number of women in the criminal justice system 
is much lower than for men, the racial disproportions are parallel. 
For women in their twenties, relative rates of criminal justice 
control are: 
<UL> 
<LI>Black women - one in 37 (2.7 percent) 
<LI>White women - one in 100 (1 percent) 
<LI>Hispanic women - one in 56 (1.8 percent) 
</UL> 
 
<LI>The number of young Black men under the control of the criminal 
justice system -- 609,690 -- is greater than the total number 
of Black men of all ages enrolled in college -- 436,000 as of 
1986. For white males, the comparable figures are 4,600,000 total 
in higher education and 1,054,508 ages 20-29 in the criminal justice 
system. 
<LI>Direct criminal justice control costs for these 609,690 Black 
men are $2.5 billion a year. 
<LI>Although crime rates increased by only 2 percent in the period 
1979-88, the number of prison inmates doubled during that time. 
 
</UL> 
 
<P> 
These findings actually understate the impact of present policies 
upon Black males ages 20-29. This is because the analysis presented 
here covers criminal justice control rates for a single day in 
mid-1989. Since all components of the criminal justice system 
admit and release persons each day, though, the total number of 
persons processed through the system in a given year is substantially 
higher than the single day counts. For this reason, the proportion 
of young Black men processed by the criminal justice system over 
the course of a year would be even higher than one in four.

<H2><A NAME="implications">Implications for Social Policy</A> 
</H2> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
The findings of this study, particularly those pertaining to young 
Black men, should be disturbing to all Americans. Whatever the 
causes of crime -- be they individual or societal -- we now have 
a situation where one in four Black men of the new adult generation 
is under the control of the criminal justice system. 
<P> 
The implications of this analysis for social policy both within 
and outside the criminal justice system are far-reaching: 
<OL> 
<LI><STRONG>Impact on the life prospects for Black males<BR> 
</STRONG>The repercussions of these high rates of criminal justice 
control upon young Black men are greater than their immediate 
loss of freedom. Few would claim that today's overcrowded corrections 
systems do much to assist offenders in becoming productive citizens 
after release. Despite the ideal that offenders can &quot;pay 
their debt to society,&quot; the fact is that most carry the stigma 
of being ex-offenders for some time to come. Thus, given these 
escalating rates of control, we risk the possibility of writing 
off an entire generation of Black men from having the opportunity 
to lead productive lives in our society.<BR> 
 
<LI><STRONG>Impact on the Black community<BR> 
</STRONG>For the Black community in general, nearly one-fourth 
of its young men are under the control of the criminal justice 
system at a time when their peers are beginning families, learning 
constructive life skills, and starting careers. The consequences 
of this situation for family and community stability will be increasingly 
debilitating. Unless the criminal justice system can be used to 
assist more young Black males in pursuing these objectives, any 
potential positive contributions they can make to the community 
will be delayed, or lost forever.<BR> 
A particularly ominous trend further emphasizes this point. At 
the same time that an increasing proportion of Black males ages 
20-29 have come under the control of the criminal justice system, 
Black male college enrollment fell by 7 percent in the decade 
from 1976-86. <A NAME="BM7top"></A><A href="#BM7">(7)</A> The 
cumulative effect of these separate measures is that fewer Black 
males are being prepared to assume leadership roles in their community. 
<BR> 
 
<LI><STRONG>Failure of the &quot;get tough&quot; approach to crime 
control<BR> 
</STRONG>In many respects, the past decade can be viewed as an 
&quot;experiment&quot; in the &quot;get tough&quot; approach to 
crime. Proponents of this policy contend that cracking down on 
crime through increased arrests, prosecutions, and lengthy sentences 
will have a deterrent effect on potential lawbreakers. Yet even 
with a tripling of the prison population since 1973, at tremendous 
financial cost, victimization rates since that time have declined 
less than 5 percent.<BR> 
 
<LI><STRONG>Implications for the &quot;war on drugs&quot;<BR> 
</STRONG>National drug policy director William Bennett's drug 
strategy similarly emphasizes a law enforcement approach to a 
social problem. This approach is likely to result in even higher 
rates of incarceration for Blacks and Hispanics since drug law 
enforcement is largely targeted against &quot;crack,&quot; more 
often used by low-income Blacks and Hispanics. As drug offenders 
make up an increasing share of the prison population, the non-white 
prison population will become disproportionately larger. In Florida, 
for example, Blacks inmates now make up 73.3 percent of all drug 
offenders, compared to 53.6 percent of prison admissions for other 
offenses. <A NAME="BM8top"></A><A href="#BM8">(8)</A><BR> 
The Bennett proposal to lock up more offenders is hardly a novel 
one. For more than twenty years, politicians have campaigned on 
this basic platform. A continued emphasis on law enforcement at 
the expense of prevention and treatment has little hope of achieving 
long-term results.<BR> 
 
<LI><STRONG>Strategies for more effective criminal justice policies 
and programs<BR> 
</STRONG>While the reasons why Black men enter into the criminal 
justice system are complex and need to be addressed with long-term 
vision, there are immediate opportunities for change through the 
criminal justice system. The goals of such changes should be to 
reduce the harm caused by the system and to reduce the likelihood 
of offenders returning to the system. The outlines of such a strategy 
are as follows: 
<UL> 
<LI>Divert as many youthful, minor and first-time offenders as 
possible from the criminal justice system entirely. Diversion 
programs, dispute resolution processes, counseling and other more 
satisfactory means for modifying offensive behavior could be used 
more frequently than they are now. 
<LI>Reverse the trend to &quot;criminalize&quot; socially undesirable 
acts and to increase criminal penalties as a means of controlling 
public behavior. Mandatory and lengthy prison terms add to correctional 
populations, but do little to reduce crime. 
<LI>Jail and prison should be sanctions of last resort for offenders 
who cannot be diverted from the system. A range of community-based 
sentencing options exist which are less costly and more effective 
than incarceration. More could be made available through legislative 
appropriations. These include: 
<UL> 
<LI>restitution to victims 
<LI>community service 
<LI>intensive probation supervision 
<LI>treatment programs 
<LI>employment and education 
<LI>community corrections programs 
</UL> 
 
<LI>Utilize the sentencing process -- the one point in the system 
when there is the opportunity to craft a meaningful response to 
the needs of victims, offenders, and the community -- to counteract 
the trend toward increasing criminal justice control over Black 
males. This can be accomplished by individual judges adopting 
constructive alternatives and by developing true rehabilitative 
programs designed to reverse current correctional priorities. 
 
</UL> 
 
<LI><STRONG>The need for a broad approach to crime and crime control 
<BR> 
</STRONG>The problem of crime is one that can not be solved entirely 
by the criminal justice system. Even with the most resourceful 
police, prosecutors, judges, and corrections officials, the criminal 
justice system is designed to be only a reactive system, not one 
of prevention.<BR> 
At the same time that the nation has engaged in a criminal justice 
control strategy over the past decade, funding to address the 
conditions that contribute to crime has declined. While the criminal 
justice system has processed young Black men in great numbers, 
the official unemployment rate for Black men ages 16-24 remains 
at 24 percent. (Adding the numbers of persons discouraged from 
or not &quot;officially&quot; in the labor market would result 
in a significantly higher figure.) It is time now to &quot;experiment&quot; 
in crime control by attacking those social factors that many believe 
provide a more direct link to crime, such as unemployment, poverty, 
and substance abuse.

<P> 
<A HREF="#contents"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
The problem of crime is a complex one and will not be resolved 
overnight. Rather than viewing the solution as hopeless or too 
long-term, though, there are real and immediate actions which 
can be taken to prevent the next generation of Black males from 
further swelling the ranks of correctional populations. 
<P> 
Some of these steps involve a change in priorities and emphasis 
within the criminal justice system. Programs and policies exist 
in jurisdictions around the country which offer models of more 
constructive resolution of criminal justice problems. 
<P> 
Addressing the conditions which lead to crime in the first place 
is a broad agenda which requires serious thought, attention, and 
action. The decisions made today, though, in the areas of policy, 
programs, and funding, will determine whether the criminal justice 
system exerts as much control over the next generation of Black 
males as it does for the current generation.

<P> 
The data on which these calculations are made are taken from reports 
of the Bureau of Justice Statistics of the Department of Justice, 
the Bureau of the Census, and the Department of Education. A breakdown 
of the incarcerated population by age, sex, and race was available 
for state prison inmates (1986) and jail inmates (1983). Data 
on sex and race, but not age, were available for federal prisoners, 
probationers, and parolees (all 1986). Data for the age distribution 
for state prisoners and jail inmates were used to develop a ratio 
of the proportion of each group of prisoners (i.e. male and female 
whites, Blacks, and Hispanics) in the 20-29 age group. These proportions 
were as follows: White Males - 49.6%; Black Males - 52.4%; Hispanic 
Males - 51.6%; White Females - 52.7%; Black Females - 52.8%; Hispanic 
Females - 60.0%. 
<P> 
This ratio was then used to develop estimates by age for federal 
prisoners, probationers, and parolees. While parolees and federal 
prisoners are probably older on average than the state prison 
population, probationers are probably younger. The greater number 
of probationers would therefore make the overall estimate of the 
20-29 age group a conservative one. While some margin of error 
is inevitable in these estimates, it seems reasonable to assume 
that it is not of a substantial nature. 
<P> 
Rates of criminal justice control were then developed for all 
parts of the system for 1986 (except for 1983 figures for jail). 
These figures were then extrapolated to June 1989, based on the 
percentage increase for each component of the system. The most 
recent overall population figures available were: state and federal 
prisons - June 1989; jails - June 1987; probation and parole - 
December 1988. Annual growth estimates of 5 percent for probation, 
10 percent for parole, and 6 percent for jails, based on trends 
for the past two years, were used to derive June 1989 population 
estimates based on the 1987 and 1988 data. 
<P> 
The use of overall population increases results in some additional 
margin of error in the total population figures. For example, 
available data appear to indicate that the rate of increase for 
prisoners for the period 1986-89 has been greater for Blacks, 
Hispanics, and women than for the population as a whole. Reports 
also indicate that Blacks make up an increasing share of the total 
number of drug arrests, a major source of the increasing criminal 
justice populations. Therefore, the total criminal justice control 
rate for Black males is probably understated in the calculations. 
<P> 
Cost figures for various components of the criminal justice system 
are those cited by the Department of Justice in Report to the 
Nation on Crime and Justice: Second Edition, 1988. Many observers 
believe that current cost figures are substantially higher than 
those presented here. For example, we have used the figure of 
$11,302 per year for state prisoners in 1984 from the Report. 
Many current estimates for costs of incarceration are in the range 
of $15,000-25,000 per year. 
<P> 
Population figures within each category are based on Census Bureau 
estimates of the U.S. resident population. 
<P> 
As the available data for Hispanics are fairly limited in most 
instances, these results should be interpreted with caution.

Organization.  The Donor Organization will be billed for any costs in 
excess of the prepayment amount.<BR>
c.  <B>Wire Transfers:</B>  Please notify Ms. Rabinovich in writing (Fax: 
212-576-8418, rabin@phri.nyu.edu) before making a wire transfer.  Be sure 
to refer to your grant number in all communications.  Wire transfers can

<I><B>General information:</B></I> ISF's voucher system delivers tax-free 
US dollars directly into the hands of individual recipients.  Bank 
accounts are not required to recieve ISF funds, so Project Managers can 
change their staff quickly and nominate new individuals for subsequent 
payments.  Please make additional copies of this form as necessary.<P>

<I><B>Distribution:</B></I> ISF accounting staff in New York will print 
vouchers on the basis of a completed recipient list at top, enter the sum

     FLOUR ENTITLEMENTS DOWN IN TURKMENISTAN. The amount of wheat flour <br>
     available to Turkmenistan's citizens at subsidized rates has been <br>
     decreased by presidential decree, according to a 7 January Interfax <br>
     report monitored by the BBC. As of 1 February 1997, citizens whose <br>
     average monthly income does not exceed 200,000 manats (about $40) are <br>
     entitled to six kilos of flour at 25 manats per kilo. In rural areas <br>
     the eight kilo ration will remain in effect. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     TURKMENBASI TO CONTINUE ECONOMIC REFORMS IN 1997. In his New Year's <br>
     Day address, Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov said he his pleased <br>
     with the accomplishments of 1996, RFE/RL reported on 1 January. He <br>
     argued that Turkmenistan's ties with neighboring countries have been <br>
     consolidated. While acknowledging that Turkmenistan's agricultural <br>
     output was below the desired level (the cotton and grain harvests were <br>
     disastrous in 1996), he said living standards were starting to <br>
     improve. Niyazov vowed to press on with economic reform and pledged to <br>
     invest more than 2 trillion manats (about $400 million) in social <br>
     programs.<br>

     TURKMENISTAN CUTS GAS DEALS WITH TURKEY, IRAN. The oil ministers of <br>
     Turkmenistan, Turkey, and Iran met in the Iranian capital, Tehran, on <br>
     29 December and agreed to a deal to bring Turkmen and Iranian gas to <br>
     Europe via Turkey, IRNA and Reuters reported. The new deal revives a <br>
     1995 plan on a pipeline project that was scrapped due to financial <br>
     problems and U.S. pressure on Turkey aimed at dissuading it from <br>
     dealing with Iran. The first gas between Iran and Turkey is expected <br>
     to flow in 1998. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     TURKMENISTAN SUSPENDS GAS SUPPLIES TO ARMENIA. Turkmenistan has <br>
     suspended natural gas supplies to Armenia because of the latter's $15 <br>
     million debt for 1996, Noyan Tapan and AFP reported on 19 December. <br>
     Armenian Energy Minister Gagik Martirosyan said that Armenia's energy <br>
     sector now has debts of $75 million as a result of nonpayments by <br>
     enterprises, government agencies, and individuals. He added that <br>
     Armenian officials are currently negotiating with the Turkmen side and <br>
     suggested that gas supplies may soon resume. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     NIYAZOV ON NATUAL GAS EXPORTS. Speaking on state television, Turkmen <br>
     President Saparmurat Niyazov said on 18 December he is pinning his <br>
     hopes for an economic revivial on renewed exports of natural gas to <br>
     Western Europe, Reuters reported. He said that gas exports in 1997 <br>
     will almost double to 40 billion cubic meters and that half the gas <br>
     will be shipped to Western Europe via Russia, in accordance with an <br>
     agreement with Russia's Gazprom. Last year, Turkmenistan exported 24 <br>
     billion cubic meters of natural gas. In the late 1980s, Turkmenistan <br>
     produced more than 80 billion cubic meters of gas a year. In 1993, <br>
     Russia stopped delivering Turkmen natural gas to Europe, leaving the <br>
     country to supply cash-strapped CIS countries. * Lowell Bezanis<br>

     RUSSIA, TURKMENISTAN, IRAN DISCUSS COOPERATION FOR CASPIAN OIL<br>
     <br>
                    MOSCOW, Dec 18 (Interfax) - Russia, Iran and Turkmenistan<br>
               will create  a committee  to organize  the setup  of  a  joint<br>
               venture between  the three  countries that  will  conduct  oil<br>
               exploration and  drilling over  the Caspian  Sea, the  Russian<br>
               Foreign Ministry said in a press release received by Interfax.<br>
                    The three  countries'  representatives  reached  such  an<br>
               agreement during their working session in Moscow Wednesday.<br>
                    The session  was convened  in line with the Memorandum on<br>
               the  three   countries'  intention   of  cooperating   in  the<br>
               exploration and  development of offshore oil and gas fields in<br>
               the Caspian  Sea. In  line with  the Memorandum  signed in the<br>
               Turkmen capital  of Ashgabat  on November  13, 1996, the three<br>
               countries agreed to create a joint venture for this purpose.<br>
                    "The purpose  of the session was to consider drafting the<br>
               charter of  the joint  venture, which  is open to all littoral<br>
               countries, and  to discuss  other organizational matters," the<br>
               Russian Foreign Ministry said.<br>
                    "The Iranian side introduced a draft charter of the joint<br>
               venture. A  brief exchange  of opinions  was held,"  the press<br>
               release reads.<br>
                    "The sides  exchanged opinions  on possible  sources  for<br>
               financing the  joint venture  and on  further activity for its<br>
               creation," the Russian Foreign Ministry said.<br>
                    The Russian  delegation at  the session  was led by First<br>
               Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov.<br>

     FREEDOM HOUSE REPORT NOTES LACK OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN CENTRAL ASIA. In <br>
     its annual survey of freedom and democracy worldwide, the U.S.-based <br>
     Freedom House identified Tajikistan and Turkmenistan as among the 17 <br>
     most repressive regimes in the world, RFE-RL reported on 18 December. <br>
     Uzbekistan, which last year also appeared in the worst category, <br>
     improved its record in 1996. Among the CIS countries, Armenia, <br>
     Georgia, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine are rated "partly free;" and <br>
     Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, <br>
     and Uzbekistan are listed as "not free." Freedom House ratings are <br>
     based on a check- list of political rights and civil liberties, <br>
     including the degree of autonomy for minorities, the status of the <br>
     opposition, the nature of electoral laws, and the degree of freedom of <br>
     assembly and freedom of the media. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     TURKMENISTAN CELEBRATES NEUTRALITY. An article in the 11 December <br>
     edition of Nezavisimaya gazeta noted that Turkmenistan will celebrate <br>
     the first anniversary of its recognition as a "neutral country" on 12 <br>
     December. On that day in 1995, the UN passed a resolution recognizing <br>
     Turkmenistan's status as a neutral country. To mark the occasion the <br>
     former Karl Marx Square is being renamed "Neutrality Square." The <br>
     article notes that "during the last year more than 60 international <br>
     conferences, symposiums, and summits" took place in Ashgabat, and that <br>
     three rounds of negotiations between the Tajik government and <br>
     opposition were also held there, going so far as to claim that "only <br>
     thanks to Turkmenistan" were the Tajik negotiations kept "alive." -- <br>

     MINISTRY ABOLISHED IN TURKMENISTAN. Turkmenistan's Ministry of <br>
     Construction and Architecture was abolished by presidential decree on <br>
     3 December, ITAR-TASS reported the same day. In an address to ministry <br>
     personnel, President Saparmurat Niyazov charged that the ministry's <br>
     enterprises have been unprofitable, operate at 50% of their capacity <br>
     and construct facilities which are substandard. The industry is to be <br>
     de- centralized with existing enterprises shared out between regional <br>
     administrations, the republic's ministries of building materials, <br>
     power- engineering, and Turkmenneftgaz. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     RED CROSS CALLS FOR MORE AID TO CENTRAL ASIA. The International Red <br>
     Cross representative in Central Asia, Bob McKerrow, said $21 million <br>
     will be needed in 1997 to provide adequate aid to the Central Asian <br>
     states, according to a 2 December Reuters report. Speaking at a news <br>
     conference in Almaty, McKerrow noted that Kazakstan already has cases <br>
     of malnutrition, particularly in the western regions where drought <br>
     ruined almost the entire harvest. The aggravated situations in <br>
     Afghanistan and Tajikistan are also expected to increase the number of <br>
     refugees in Central Asia. In Kyrgyzstan there are presently 30,000 <br>
     refugees, and people fleeing from the fighting in Afghanistan have <br>
     appeared in Turkmenistan. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     AFGHAN REFUGEES SHOW UP IN TURKMENISTAN. The Red Cross announced that <br>
     800 people fleeing the fighting in western Afghanistan have crossed <br>
     into Turkmenistan, RFE/RL reported on 21 November. Red Cross spokesman <br>
     Thorir Gudmundsson said the number could climb to as high as 18,000 if <br>
     fighting continues near Herat. At least 50,000 people are estimated to <br>
     have been displaced by the fighting in the Badghis province of <br>
     Afghanistan. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     TURKMENISTAN, TURKEY SIGN AGREEMENTS. Turkmen President Saparmurat <br>
     Niyazov met his Turkish counterpart, Suleyman Demirel, on 18 November <br>
     in Ankara and the two signed agreements covering environmental, <br>
     educational, and economic cooperation, according to ITAR-TASS and <br>
     RFE/RL. Demirel said the two countries enjoy "perfect relations" and <br>
     Niyazov mentioned that Turkish investors had already sunk $1.5 billion <br>
     into Turkmen projects. Niyazov arrived in Turkey on 14 November for <br>
     medical check-ups, but none of the reports carried any detailed <br>
     information on the results. TRT TV in Ankara, monitored by the BBC, <br>
     reported that Niyazov's examination had a "cardiac emphasis." Niyazov <br>
     suffers from respiratory problems and had an operation on his leg to <br>
     remove a blood clot in 1994. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     NIYAZOV IN TURKEY FOR MEDICAL CHECK-UP. Turkmen President Saparmurat <br>
     Niyazov arrived in Turkey on 14 November for a medical check-up, <br>
     according to Reuters and RFE/RL. Although he is also there to meet <br>
     with Turkish officials, Niyazov said he will be in the Istanbul branch <br>
     of the Houston clinic for four days of post-operative treatment. In <br>
     1994, Niyazov had a blood clot removed from his leg at a hospital in <br>
     Houston, Texas. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     TURKMENISTAN, RUSSIA, IRAN SIGN AGREEMENT. Russia, Turkmenistan, and <br>
     Iran signed a memorandum on 13 November on cooperation in developing <br>
     the Caspian Sea oil resources, Russian TV (RTR) and Reuters reported. <br>
     Signed by Russian Foreign Minister Yevgenii Primakov, his Iranian <br>
     counterpart Ali Akbar Velayati, and Turkmen President Saparmurad <br>
     Niyazov, the memorandum establishes a joint company to further explore <br>
     the Caspian's resources. The other two Caspian states, Azerbaijan and <br>
     Kazakstan, are invited to join, but according to the RTR report, <br>
     Azerbaijan is "unsatisfied" with this agreement. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     CASPIAN SEA AGREEMENT SIGNED. Representatives from four of the five <br>
     coastal states of the Caspian Sea signed an agreement in Ashgabat on <br>
     12 November on the status of the sea, ITAR-TASS and Izvestiya <br>
     reported. The agreement, granting each state an exclusive economic <br>
     zone 45 miles (75 km) off-shore, was recognized by all parties except <br>
     Azerbaijan. Every country came into the meeting with their own <br>
     proposal for the zone: Iran favored a 10-mile zone; Russia, 20 miles, <br>
     Turkmenistan, 60 miles; Kazakstan, 80 miles; and Azerbaijan wanted the <br>
     entire sea divided into sectors. The signatories regard the resources <br>
     beyond the 45-mile zone as subject to "joint ownership." Azerbaijan's <br>
     oil riches lie beyond the 45- mile zone and that country's <br>
     representative did not sign the agreement. Representatives of the <br>
     other states promised to review "pinpoint jurisdiction" in <br>
     Azerbaijan's case. Izvestiya noted that all of the countries had <br>
     already begun developing areas in the Caspian without any clear ruling <br>
     on its status. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

 TURKMENISTAN CELEBRATES FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF INDEPENDENCE. A military parade <br>
 highlighted the 27 October ceremonies commemorating the fifth anniversary of <br>
 Turkmenistan's independence, Russian and Turkmen sources reported. According to <br>
 ITAR-TASS, Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov met with Russian and Iranian <br>
 officials in the days leading up to the celebration, concluding a series of <br>
 bilateral accords with both states that underscore the country's "permanent <br>
 neutrality." The Turkmen Press Agency reported on 23 October that in the week <br>
 before the anniversary a monument to Gurbansoltan-edzhe, Niyazov's mother, was <br>
 unveiled in Chardjui. -- Roger Kangas<br>

 JAPAN TO LOAN TURKMENISTAN $120 MILLION. The Export-Import Bank of Japan, after <br>
 consulting with Japanese commercial banks, announced that a loan of $120 <br>
 million would be extended to Turkmenistan, according to Reuters and RFE/RL. The <br>
 money is slated to be used in upgrading the oil refining industry with the hope <br>
 of diversifying the economy and reducing pollutants. The Export-Import Bank <br>
 will put up 60% of the loan (about $73 million) and the remainder will be <br>
 co-financed by three Japanese banks. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     LEADERS OF TURKIC-SPEAKING COUNTRIES MEET. The presidents of six <br>
     Turkic- speaking countries assembled in Tashkent on 21 October, AFP <br>
     reported. It was the fourth meeting between the presidents of <br>
     Azerbaijan, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and <br>
     Turkey. Discussion centered on trade relations: although the subject <br>
     of Afghanistan was touched on, Uzbek President Islam Karimov said the <br>
     heads of state "would not be dragged into settling political matters." <br>
     However, some time was devoted to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. <br>
     Azerbaijani President Heidar Aliev again said that he was prepared to <br>
     give maximum autonomy to the region but that "Nagorno-Karabakh will <br>
     never be independent." The presidents signed a declareiterating "their <br>
     firm and unchanging commitment to the principles of<br>
     democracy, respect for human rights and a market economy," said <br>
     Karimov. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     TURKMEN PRESIDENT MEETS YELTSIN. Saparmurat Niyazov on 15 October <br>
     visited President Yeltsin at the Barvikha sanitarium, international <br>
     media reported. The conversation focused on economic issues, <br>
     particularly supplies of Turkmen gas to Russia and the development of <br>
     the Caspian Sea area. In a later meeting with Russian Foreign Minister <br>
     Yevgenii Primakov, Niyazov once again emphasized that Turkmenistan <br>
     would coordinate any action on the situation in Afghanistan with <br>
     Russia but would not stray from its policy of neutrality. -- Bruce <br>

     NIYAZOV IN MOSCOW. Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov arrived in <br>
     Moscow on 14 October for two days of talks with Prime Minister Viktor <br>
     Chernomyrdin and President Yeltsin on economic relations, Afghanistan, <br>
     and resource exploitation in the Caspian Sea, Russian and Western <br>
     agencies reported the same day. Niyazov and Chernomyrdin failed to <br>
     come to an agreement on Russia's estimated $500 million debt to <br>
     Turkmenistan for natural gas. The situation is complicated by the fact <br>
     that Russia controls 45% of the Turkmen-Russian joint venture <br>
     Turkmenrosgaz which enjoys sole rights to export Turkmen natural gas <br>
     within the CIS. Ashgabat hopes to export 5 billion cubic meters of gas <br>
     to Russia in 1997--half the amount planned last year--and secure <br>
     payment in a mixture of hard currency (20%) and industrial goods <br>
     (80%). Niyazov said views on Afghanistan vary among CIS member-states <br>
     but added that Ashgabat would coordinate its policy with Moscow. -- <br>

     mark the start of construction work on the 200 km-long <br>
     Korpedzhe-Kordkuy gas pipeline, IRNA and Russian media reported the <br>
     next day. The pipeline deal, announced last year, has an estimated <br>
     value of $190 million and will be capable of moving 11 billion cubic <br>
     meters of natural gas annually. It is being built by Iran's state gas <br>

     PAKISTANI ENVOY IN TURKMENISTAN. Following talks between a special <br>
     envoy from Pakistan, Ijlal Haider Zaidi, and Turkmen President <br>
     Saparmurad Niyazov on 7 October both sides agreed on the preservation <br>
     of Afghanistan's territorial integrity and noninterference in its <br>
     internal affairs, Turkmen and Russian media reported. Zaidi's visit to <br>
     Ashgabat was presumably intended to reassure Turkmenistan about <br>
     Pakistan's intentions and to suggest that Taliban does not pose a <br>
     security threat to Afghanistan's neighbors. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     TALIBAN EXTENDING OLIVE BRANCH? A spokesman for the Taliban movement <br>
     claims that Central Asia has nothing to fear from the group that now <br>
     controls most of Afghanistan, Rusian Public TV (ORT) reported on 7 <br>
     October. The acting foreign minister of the Taliban, Muhammed Ghous, <br>
     called upon the UN "to convince Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakstan, and <br>
     Kyrgyzstan not to meddle in Afghanistan's internal affairs and the <br>
     Taliban for their part will not interfere in the affairs of other <br>
     countries." A radio broadcast originating in Pakistan on 6 October <br>
     announced that the Taliban would soon send representatives to the <br>
     Central Asian states as a demonstration of the group's "brotherly <br>
     love" for the region, Radio Rossii reported on 6 October. However, <br>
     Ghous reportedly said "we do not want Russia to forget the lesson they <br>
     were taught here," referring to the Soviet military campaign in <br>
     Afghanistan in the 1980s. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     PAKISTANI ENVOY IN TURKMENISTAN. Following talks between a special <br>
     envoy from Pakistan, Ijlal Haider Zaidi, and Turkmen President <br>
     Saparmurad Niyazov on 7 October both sides agreed on the preservation <br>
     of Afghanistan's territorial integrity and noninterference in its <br>
     internal affairs, Turkmen and Russian media reported. Zaidi's visit to <br>
     Ashgabat was presumably intended to reassure Turkmenistan about <br>
     Pakistan's intentions and to suggest that Taliban does not pose a <br>
     security threat to Afghanistan's neighbors. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     ALMATY PREPARES FOR CIS SUMMIT. On 4 October Russian and Central Asian <br>
     leaders will gather in Almaty to discuss the implications of the <br>
     Taliban victories in Afghanistan, along with other issues. <br>
     Turkmenistan announced that it would not attend the Almaty summit due <br>
     to its policy of "positive neutrality," Russian and Western media <br>
     reported on 3 October. Kazakstani Security Council chief Baltash <br>
     Tursumbayev said Russian Security Council Secretary Aleksandr Lebed <br>
     has exaggerated the threat posed to Central Asia by Taliban successes <br>
     in Afghanistan, Nezavisimaya gazeta and RTR reported on 3 October. <br>
     Tursumbayev termed Lebed's 1 October assertion that the Taliban <br>
     coveted territory in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, including Bukhara, as <br>
     "rash and lacking foundation." -- Lowell Bezanis and Bruce Pannier<br>

     . . . AND TURKMENISTAN'S MILITARY DOCTRINE. Turkmenistan's Peoples' <br>
     Council [Khalk Maslakhati] made public a document which elaborates on <br>
     the country's military doctrine to insure that it conforms with the <br>
     "permanent neutrality" envisaged in its constitution, ITAR-TASS <br>
     reported on 1 October. According to the text published by the agency, <br>
     Turkmenistan regards no country as its enemy, it eschews participation <br>
     in any military blocs, alliances or "inter-state coalitions with rigid <br>
     obligations or contemplating collective responsibility." This language <br>
     would appear to preclude participation not only in CIS, but nascent <br>
     inter-Central Asian, security arrangements as well. The text <br>
     specifically states that Turkmenistan will not host foreign military <br>
     bases. While there are no Russian bases in Turkmenistan, the Turkmen <br>
     border is currently patrolled by Russian troops under contract. -- <br>

     MORE ON NIYAZOV IN BAYRAM-ALI . . . During his 27 September speech to <br>
     senior legislators in Bayram-Ali, Turkmenistan's President Saparmurad <br>
     Niyazov said he expected the country's economy to grow 50-60% in the <br>
     next five years, according to a BBC-monitored 28 September Turkmen <br>
     Press report. He predicted that 110 billion cubic meters of natural <br>
     gas and 10 million metric tons of oil will be extracted yearly during <br>
     this period, most large and medium-sized firms will be privatized next <br>
     year, and that both the metallurgical plant in Mari and the <br>
     Iranian-Turkmen gas pipeline would be finished the following year. <br>
     Niyazov also noted that annual inflation is to remain within a 10-15% <br>
     band and up to 60% of the state budget will go to social spending. -- <br>

     CENTRAL ASIA VOICES CONCERN OVER KABUL'S FALL. The Tajik government on <br>
     30 September expressed its concern that the recent events in Kabul <br>
     will have a negative impact on efforts to secure the Tajik-Afghan <br>
     border, Russian media reported. Also on 30 September, the Kazakstani <br>
     Foreign Ministry called on the UN to take urgent measures to end the <br>
     bloodshed in Afghanistan, warning that economic collapse and political <br>
     instability there could threaten the stability of Central Asia, <br>
     ITAR-TASS reported. -- Lowell Bezanis and Bruce Pannier<br>

     NIYAZOV TURNS DOWN LIFE-LONG PRESIDENCY. Turkmenistan's socio-economic <br>
     development through the year 2001 was the main subject at a joint <br>
     session of the Turkmen Peoples' Council, the Council of Elders, and <br>
     the Movement for National Revival in Bayram-Ali, RFE/RL reported on 27 <br>
     September. At the session, Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov said <br>
     he would not accept the title "president for life" as had been <br>
     suggested late last year, saying such a move would violate the <br>
     country's constitution. He was quoted by Russian news agencies as <br>
     saying "we will decide together" who should be Turkmenistan's next <br>
     president when his term expires in 2002. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     PRIMAKOV: ISLAM IS NOT "THE ENEMY OF WORLD CIVILIZATION." In an <br>
     article in Nezavisimaya Gazeta of 18 September, Foreign Minister <br>
     Yevgenii Primakov distinguished between "Islamic extremism" and <br>
     "Islamic fundamentalism." Primakov argues that fundamentalism is a <br>
     natural response to historical developments, such as the former <br>
     persecution of Islam. "Islamic extremism," which he defines as the use <br>
     of force to change state borders, he regards as unacceptable. <br>
     Primakov, formerly a scholar of the Middle East, is thus trying to <br>
     justify Moscow's role in Tajikistan and Chechnya, while signaling that <br>
     it wants friendly relations with the Islamic world and with the 17 <br>
     million Muslims who live inside Russia. -- Peter Rutland<br>

     NIYAZOV AND THE TURKMEN MEDIA. Turkmen authorities have circulated an <br>
     official statement declaring that President Saparmurad Niyazov is the <br>
     founder of all local newspapers published in the country, according to <br>
     a 17 September Pravda-5 report. Noting that Niyazov was earlier <br>
     officially declared the founder of all the republic's central press, <br>
     the report suggested the mass media in Turkmenistan have been <br>
     "essentially monopolized." In other news, Turkmenistan's first Islamic <br>
     theological school, established by Turkey's Religious Affairs <br>
     Directorate, has opened in Ashgabat, Zaman reported on 18 September. <br>

     HEROIN SEIZED IN TURKMENISTAN. Russian border guards killed two <br>
     suspected drug smugglers in the process of seizing a large amount of <br>
     drugs, including 24 kg of heroin, RFE/RL reported. It is the first <br>
     reported seizure of refined heroin on the Turkmen-Afghan border. The <br>
     first seizure of heroin in Central Asia occurred in Kyrgyzstan in <br>
     October 1995. In other news, Kazakstani authorities reported that <br>
     about 70% of the 4.5 metric tons of drugs that they have confiscated <br>
     since the beginning of 1996 had been prepared from domestic cannabis <br>
     grown in the Chu Valley, which straddles the Kazak-Kyrgyz border, <br>
     ITAR-TASS reported on 5 September. According to local law enforcement <br>
     officials, cannabis is grown on 140 hectares of land in the Chu Valley <br>
     and about 5-6 metric tons of marijuana and hashish can be produced <br>
     there every year. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     Minister Abdurahim Ghafurzai held talks with Turkmen President <br>
     Saparmurad Niyazov in Ashgabat on the construction of a natural gas <br>
     pipeline from Turkmenistan through Afghanistan to Pakistan, ITAR-TASS <br>
     reported on 3 September. Ghafurzai was quoted as saying that officials <br>
     from his country, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, and major <br>
     European and Russian companies would meet in the near future to set a <br>
     date for the construction to begin. He also noted that Turkmenistan <br>
     plans to open an embassy in Kabul and establish regular flights <br>
     between Ashgabat and the Afghan capital. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     MORE SACKINGS IN TURKMENISTAN. Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov <br>
     has sacked Supreme Court Chairman Amanmurad Kakabayev and Deputy <br>
     Interior Minister Amangeldy Geldykurbanov, Reuters reported on 29 <br>
     August. The two were dismissed for "failing in his responsibilities" <br>
     and "serious shortcomings," repectively, according to the agency. A 28 <br>
     August Turkmen Radio report monitored by the BBC reported that <br>
     Geldykurbanov, who was also the head of Turkmenistan's Higher Militia <br>
     School, was demoted and expelled from all Interior Ministry bodies. He <br>
     was replaced at the school by Gurbanmukhammet Kasymov. No replacement <br>
     for Kakabayev has been announced. Niyazov deplored "an epidemic of <br>
     corruption which has touched all levels in the justice authorities," <br>
     Reuters reported, citing Neitralny Turkmenistan. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     CABINET RESHUFFLE IN TURKMENISTAN. President Saparmurat Niyazov <br>
     relieved Valery Otchertsov, Minister of Economy and Finance as well as <br>
     deputy chairman of Turkmenistan's cabinet, of his duties on 22 August, <br>
     RFE/RL reported the next day. He was appointed economic counselor to <br>
     Turkmenistan's embassy in Moscow and granted what were termed <br>
     emergency powers as an envoy to Russia. Otchertsov's replacement as <br>
     Minister of Economy is Matkarim Rajapov. Russian agencies noted that <br>
     Otchertsov was shifted "at his own request" due to matrimonial <br>
     problems. -- Lowell Bezanis, OMRI<br>

     FBI IN TRANSCAUCASUS AND CENTRAL ASIA. The U.S. Federal Bureau of <br>
     Investigation plans to double it overseas offices from 23 to 46 over a <br>
     four-year period, AFP reported on 20 August. Among other countries, <br>
     the agency plans to establish a presence in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, <br>
     and Georgia in 1998. This is part of the FBI's effort to create a <br>
     "first line of defense" or early warning system to cope with what it <br>
     considers to be the growing internationalization of crime and crime <br>
     threats to the U.S. The report detailing these plans stressed that the <br>
     agency, whose mission has been confined to domestic law enforcement <br>
     and counter-intelligence, would not be engaged in espionage but would <br>
     liaise with its foreign counterparts. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     VELAYATI IN ASHGABAT. Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati held <br>
     talks with his Turkmen counterpart Boris Shikhmuradov in Ashgabat on <br>
     19 August, IRNA reported the same day. The two discussed the <br>
     intensified conflict in Tajikistan and ways to boost bilateral and <br>
     regional cooperation. Velayati also announced Tehran's plans to host a <br>
     regional, foreign minister-level, peace conference on Afghanistan <br>
     tentatively scheduled for 28-29 October. Earlier this week the <br>
     beleaguered government in Kabul rejected a proposal submitted to the <br>
     UN Security Council by Pakistan and Uzbekistan to embargo the sale of <br>
     arms to any of the factions fighting in Afghanistan. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     NATURAL GAS CONSORTIUM FOUNDED. The U.S. firm Unocal, Saudi Arabia's <br>
     Delta, Russia's Gazprom, and the joint Turkmen-Russian Turkmenrusgaz <br>
     have signed a memorandum of understanding on the $2 billion project to <br>
     move natural gas from Turkmenistan's Dauletbad field to Pakistan via <br>
     Afghanistan, Western agencies reported on 13 August. The companies <br>
     will now negotiate a definitive agreement defining the rights and <br>
     obligations of each member of the consortium, according to AFP. Unocal <br>
     and Delta together will hold an 85% share in the deal, Gazprom 10%, <br>
     and Turkmenrusgaz 5%. Unocal's chairman said additional parties will <br>
     be invited to join the consortium. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     TURKMEN-RUSSIAN GAS PROJECT. Turkmen President <br>
     Saparmurad Niyazov met with the Russian Gazprom <br>
     company chairman Rem Vyakhirev on 8 August to sign <br>
     an agreement on forming the new corporation <br>
     Turkmenrosgaz, NTV reported. Turkmenistan will hold <br>
     51% of the shares in the venture, Gazprom-45% and <br>
     the transnational corporation Itera-4%. The first <br>
     project the new corporation plans to undertake is <br>
     a pipeline providing Turkmen gas to Pakistan via <br>
     Afghanistan. The disruption in supply lines for <br>
     Turkmen gas after the collapse of the Soviet Union <br>
     has cut export of Turkmen gas nearly in half. <br>
     According to RTR, Turkmenistan produced 90 billion <br>
     cubic meters of gas in 1990, compared to 48 billion <br>
     so far this year. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     GOVERNORS SACKED IN AKHAL, TASHAUZ. Turkmen President <br>
     Saparmurad Niyazov has dismissed the provincial governors <br>
     of Akhal and Tashauz Vilayet, according to a 3 August <br>
     Turkmen Press report monitored by the BBC. The republic's <br>
     harvest of 480,000 metric tons of grain for this year <br>
     rather than the anticipated 1,000,000 tons appears to be <br>
     the cause of their dismissal. During a 2 August cabinet <br>
     meeting where the "very serious shortcomings and errors" <br>
     associated with the harvest were discussed, Niyazov also <br>
     abolished the ex-officio status of deputy prime minister <br>
     granted to all regional heads. In other news, Turkmen and <br>
     Russian border guards in the republic have intercepted <br>
     500 "trespassers" and confiscated 900 kg of drugs so far <br>
     this year, Radio Rossii reported on 5 August. <br>

     PRISON RIOT IN TURKMENISTAN. Three prisoners were killed <br>
     and seven wounded on 4 August when Turkmen authorities put <br>
     down a prison riot in Mary Vilayet, Reuters reported on 6 <br>
     August. Details on the riots are sketchy, but the day after <br>
     the mutiny, Turkmen Deputy Interior Minister Altibai Charyez, <br>
     national prison head Amansakhat Chungaev, and other officials <br>
     were sacked. Turkmenistan's prison system is reportedly riddled <br>
     with corruption and conditions in overcrowded prisons are squalid. <br>
     In August 1995, 27 mutinous prisoners were reportedly killed in a <br>
     maximum security prison in Ashgabat. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

Run by Dr. Emilis Subata of the Foundation "SALPA", this is also one of the 
first methadone programs located in Lithuania, as methadone was officially approved only last 
year.  Currently, the program is run from a hospital-based clinic.  In the future it hopes to expand 
methadone provision through General Practitioners (GPs), and to organize a needle exchange, 
which will also be one of the first in the country.  As 95% of known drug users in Vilnius are 
injection drug users, this program will be influential in curbing the spread of HIV and other 
blood-borne disease.

<h3>Needle Exchange/Peer Outreach Programs</h3>

The Association "Society Against Drugs" run by Dr. Roumen Sedefov will 
organize Bulgaria's first needle exchange program.  He proposes a mobile needle 
exchange/outreach program to provide services to a wider range of injection drug users.  This

drug users.  The needle exchange could prevent the spread of HIV among IDUs; currently only 
three HIV positive individuals in the country are known to be drug users.

The ECHO Project & Windham Needle Exchange have been collaborating since
1993 providing a combination of street-based outreach services to injection drug users as well 
as a semi-mobile needle exchange.  The outreach project relies on active injection drug users to 
educate and recruit their peers to a storefront for indepth interviews, further harm reduction 
education, and HIV counseling and testing.  For their efforts, IDU-recruiters are paid nominal 
monetary rewards, and all IDUs have an equal opportunity to play an active role in helping 
educate and recruit other injectors.  The ECHO project staff of 3 Health Educators have 
interviewed and provided direct services to over 500 IDUs in eastern Connecticut.  The 
Windham needle exchange works with approximately 750 clients, and dispenses and/or 
exchanges approximately 4400 syringes.  Originally an underground exchange, the project is 
now state-funded with a staff of two.

in our earlier review of the report (included as Tab B in the CDC draft   
response), we provide the following comments that are specific to the draft   
CDC response letter:<p>   
   
<OL>   
<LI>Agency Position Issue<p>   
   
Page 1: The second paragraph implies that the NIH, along with SAMHSA, HRSA,   
and the FDA, has provided "recommendations for needle exchange." This is   
either inaccurate or misleading. We suggest that the wording "And   
recommendations for needle exchange" be dropped from the sentence.<p>   
   
<LI>Research<p>   
   
The CDC draft response appropriately includes an emphasis on the need for   
increasing research and evaluation of needle exchange programs (NEPs) and   
other related aspects of HIV and drug abuse.<p>   
   
However, in light of the reported gaps in information concerning the   
efficacy and impact of needle exchange programs, requiring evaluation to be   
an integral component of any federally funded NEP becomes critical if we   
are to take an iterative approach to this issue.<p>   
   
The following text changes are recommended:<p>   
   
Page 2: In the last sentence of the second paragraph the word "include"   
should be change (sic) to "require";<p>   
   
Page 11: The first sentence of the last paragraph should be "The PHS should   
require substantial evaluation be part of any federally funded NEP so as to   
continue to gather more data on the impact..."; and,<p>   
   
Page 15: The last sentence of the first paragraph should be changed to   
read, "Programs that receive Federal funding should be required to have   
substantial evaluation and/or research components, either as part of the   
project or as a separately funded activity."<p>   
   
<LI>Agency Designation<p>   
   
Page 4: The fourth paragraph lists the CDC, CSAT and NIDA as co-sponsors of   
a bleach use guidance. For parity, all agencies should be designated. This   
could be achieved by indicating CSAT/SAMHSA and NIDA/NIH, or by stating, "   
The National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of   
Health,..."   
</OL>   
   
<P>Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or need further   
information.<p>

<h4>SUBJECT: NIH comments on the University of California Report,   
"Public Health Impact of Needle Exchange Programs in the United States and   
Abroad."</h4>   
   
We have reviewed the report, "The Public Health Impact of Needle Exchange   
Programs in the United states and Abroad," from a research perspective. We   
have provided several points for your consideration in your response on   
needle exchange to the Assistant Secretary for Health:<p>   
   
1. This report is a good initial analysis of this issue and serves as a   
useful starting point for further examination;<p>   
   
2. Utilizing needle/syringe exchange (NSE) programs as an HIV prevention   
strategy is a complex issue. The current state of the science with respect   
to this issue is neither complete nor comprehensive, requiring further   
study on this, as well as, alternative behavioral interventions;<p>   
   
2. There are a number of significant issues and problems with respect to   
needle exchange program that the data available to the University of   
California have not addressed (see attached analysis);<p>   
   
3. The report appropriately suggests a substantial Federal commitment to   
research in this area. Such support should include, but should not be   
limited to, funding for: 1) building substantial evaluation and/or   
research components into existing NSEs; 2) researc/demonstration projects   
that address NSE program design issues; 3) research on other forms of   
needle/syringe distribution (e.g., pharmacy or vending machine strategies);   
and, 4) research on the relationships and impact of NSEs on other   
prevention strategies (e.g., bleach use) and other non-injecting at-risk   
populations (e.g., non-injecting drug users who trade sex or money for   
drugs).  In addition, until more is definitively known and has been time   
tested, any NSE service programs funded should have appropriate research   
and/or evaluation components built into them as a prerequisite for Federal   
funding.<p>   
   
For a more detailed analysis of the specific research issues and questions   
that remain unanswered by the report, we have attached comments on the   
report provided by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.<p>

<h4>Topic: Comments on University of California Report, "The Public Health   
Impact of Needle Exchange Programs in the United States and Abroad"</h4>   
   
In general, medical/public health interventions, like medications, may be   
evaluated within a framework that examines safety, efficacy, side effects,   
deleterious effects and both positive and negative interactions with other   
treatments or conditions. With respect to any of the effects, questions   
include what subpopulations are likely to experience the effect and how   
long it is likely to last, including recommendations with respect to the   
length of treatment. In fact, to the degree to which this Report provides   
the equivalent of a section of the Physician's Desk Reference(PDR) devoted   
to needle/syringe exchange (NSE) it will be helpful all who are concerned   
with the implications of NSEs.<p>   
   
Viewing this Report in the aforementioned framework it becomes clear that   
with respect to overall "effects" NSE is <U>associated</U> in the <U>aggregate</U> with   
reductions in <U>self reports</U> of needle-related HIV risk behavior.<p>   
   
However, a major problem with the existing data examined by the Report is   
the lack of sensitivity of the data to detection of adverse effects of NSE   
on individuals or subpopulations and interaction with, for example, the   
various modalities of drug abuse treatment. There is no equivalent of   
studies that search for individuals who purport to have experienced   
"adverse reactions" or negative consequences or interactions that may be   
attributable to participation in NSE. It is questionable whether in the   
context of medications development the Federal Government would approve   
and/or provide funds for a medication for which this type of data were not   
available.<p>   
   
In the spirit of seeking the information that would be needed for a   
complete PDR section on needle/syringe exchange, we will review some   
concerns about the potential adverse impact and interactions of NSE.<p>   
   
One major concern of critics of NSEs as an AIDS intervention effort is the   
degree to which the availability of sterile needles/syringes would server   
to promote drug use. While the needle exchange studies reported from around   
the world from the last two world AIDS conferences do not, and perhaps   
cannot, prove that the presence and/or use of a needle exchange does not   
increase drug use, there have been no reports that confirm such an   
increase. However, there are a number of direct and indirect ways in which   
drug use maybe promoted for individuals and subpopulations that have not   
been addressed by existing data. For example, one wonders what happens to   
the drug use of individuals who seek drug treatment through an NSE and are   
told that there is no slot available for them.<p>   
   
Analogous to that for needle/syringe exchange, the criticism of the   
potential for increasing injection drug use was raised for bleach   
distribution. This particular criticism (although not all criticisms) with   
respect to bleach was, in the aggregate and within limits, refuted by the   
results of the National AIDS Demonstration Research data which is   
consistent with the model that when contact is established with drug users,   
trust is build, information is imparted and risky behavior is reduced,   
despite the fact that safe needle use is also being assisted at the same   
time(XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX). Nonetheless, the demonstration of beneficial effects   
does not preclude the simultaneous existence of deleterious effects.<p>   
   
NSEs may not be uniformly effective in acting as a bridge to other public   
health services, depending on such factors as to what degree the services   
are "on-site" versus "remote" as well as "immediately available" versus   
"requiring waiting". Studies of the service linkage process suggest that   
higher rates of successful engagement with other services will be attained   
for those services that are on-site and immediately available. It would be   
useful to attempt to characterize users and non-users of additional   
services and to delineate those factors that affect these decisions.<p>   
   
Inconsistent of infrequent users of the NSEs may remain and be stabilized   
at high risk behavior levels. With respect to the inconsistent or   
infrequent users of the NSEs, it will be important to determine the factors   
influencing periods of use versus non-user. More over, looking at NSEs as   
an "innovation" with respect to injection drug user, the literature on   
models of [LINE LOST IN COPYING - Ed.] middle and late adopters of NSEs may   
be useful in terms of delineating populations with distinct patterns of   
motivations, risk factors and responses to the NSEs.<p>   
   
Change or lack of change in the micro-structure, i.e., details, of   
behaviors associated with drug use may negate beneficial effects of NSEs.   
In looking at drug risk behaviors, it is important to attempt to assess   
whether NSEs affect rate of sharing of cookers, cotton, water, etc. as well   
as such practices as frontloading, backloading and booting. With respect to   
drug risk behaviors it is thus important to examine NSE effects on   
behavioral norms of (1) non-NSE-users and (2) drug using non-injectors as   
well as (3) NSE users.<p>   
   
NSE users may sell paraphernalia or exchange it for drugs or sex. In fact,   
the possibility should be examined that non-injectors may use the NSEs as a   
source for paraphernalia that may used in transactions with injectors.<p>   
   
The rate at which NSE users (versus NSE non-users) initiate new injectors   
and influence other IDUs to utilize or not utilize the NSE should be   
examined. Moreover, questions of the influence of the NSE on injections   
frequency should be examined closely. For individuals, the availability of   
clean paraphernalia may remove one brake on increasing the frequency of   
injection.<p>   
   
Certainly, NSE effects on the number of IDUs entering drug treatment need   
to be examined. However, the fate of IDUs who have used the NSE prior to   
entry into drug treatment should also be examined. NSE participants or   
injections drug users whose network includes NSE participants may relapse   
to needle use and/or drop out of drug treatment at a higher rate than NSE   
non-users.<p>   
   
NSE effects on social network may lead to problems. Since NSEs imply a high   
rate of flow of IDUs through the neighborhood surrounding the site, there   
may be a tendency for dealers, operators of shooting galleries and/or crack   
houses and prostitutes to relocate to the same area. If possible, these   
effects and their implications should be assessed. The potential effects of   
NSEs on setting up bridges between networks of IDUs in high and low HIV   
seroprevalence neighborhoods should be examined. If NSEs serve to create   
such bridges they would, especially through inconsistent seropositive   
users, serve as conduits to facilitate viral spread. If data are generated   
on local changes in seroprevcalence and/or seroincidence over time in areas   
surrounding NSEs, (including baseline levels prior to the establishment of   
the NSE and changes during the growth of the NSE), then some of these   
questions may be able to be addressed. Data pertinent to the perceived   
effects of participation in the NSE on the sexual, social and drug-using   
networks of the individuals would also be helpful in beginning to address   
these hypotheses.<p>   
   
Additional network effects may occur or existing network effects may be   
potentiated if NSE sites are located close to drug treatment programs   
(methadone or drug free programs), hospitals, psychiatric facilities,   
homeless shelters or other facilities that attract concentrations of   
individuals who are vulnerable to initiating drug injections, relapsing to   
drug use or injections, having sex with injections users or becoming   
victims of crime associated with injections users.<p>   
   
As is addressed in the Report, the surveyed NSEs varied greatly in along   
many parameters including estimates of the proportions of injection drug   
users reached by the program, the amount of education offered, the degree   
to which injection equipment beyond needles/syringes were distributed,   
emphasis on drug treatment referrals, costs, the extent of ongoing   
evaluation, acceptance by the local community, legal acceptance/tolerance,   
etc. These are major program design and feasibility that could determine   
differences between highly effective programs and those with a substantial   
negative impact. Support for grams without consideration of these issues   
would be the equivalent of support for all treatment programs in any area   
in the absence of standards and quality assurance.<p>   
   
Finally, the interrelationships between NSEs and the use of bleach need to   
be examined. For example, we have evidence that even IDUs who use bleach   
tend to not use it effectively. Does the existence of needles from NSEs   
decrease the probability that IDUs will even attempt to use bleach if the   
share? Will they feel that the needles are at least relatively safer and   
thus real that bleach use is not necessary? Does the distribution of bleach   
increase the probability that IDUs will share NSE distributed needles? Are   
NSEs attempting to intervene in terms of education with respect to bleach   
use?<p>   
   
This, of course is not an exhaustive list of questions or issues, but is   
meant to represent a set of problems whose existence has not been addressed   
by the data available to the University of California study.<p>   
   
However, even in the absence of Federal Support, NSE is a growing part of   
HIV prevention efforts. This Report appropriately suggests a substantial   
Federal commitment to research in this area. With respect to the funding of   
services, it appears reasonable, as the Report suggests, that the ban on   
funding be lifted.<p>   
   
Nonetheless, it would appear prudent in light of the incomplete data and   
the aforementioned set of concerns that no services be funded that do not   
include a substantial evaluation component with appropriate   
instrumentation and methodologies to identify adverse as well as beneficial   
contribution of these programs to HIV and other infectious disease   
transmission and drug use patterns. Perhaps as a prelude to defining   
standards for Federal funding of NSE services, there should be funding for   
incorporating evaluation in existing NSEs and setting up   
research/demonstration projects that address NSE program design issues.<p>   
   
Beyond the issue of NSEs per se, the argument is made in this Report in   
favor of immediate implementation of the entire variety of interventions   
that increase the availability of sterile needles/syringes, including   
pharmacy sales and the abolition of prescription and paraphernalia laws.   
Given the stated priority of the objective, presumably this support would   
extend to other forms of needle/syringe distribution, e.g., vending   
machines like those used in Europe.<p>   
   
While the objective appears reasonable, it would be helpful if the Report   
addressed more of the complexities of this issue so that sterile   
needle/syringes are not viewed as a "magic bullet" that obviates the need   
to continue work on behavioral interventions. For example, there have been   
extensive observations of "secondary sharing" in which addicts in groups   
use frontloading and backloading to distribute "cooked" drugs to their   
syringes. In these situation if an addict brings his/her own syringe, but   
has previously used the syringe even once and engaged in "booting" (drawing   
blood back into the syringe and reinjecting after initial injection to make   
sure that any residual drug in the syringe is used), blood may be   
distributed to others' syringes. Moreover, contaminants of "cookers",   
"cotton" and "rinse water" may be similarly distributed.<p>   
   
Finally, all strategies for distributing needles/syringes may not be   
equivalent. For example, it is questionable whether pharmacies will provide   
other forms of injections equipment, HIV education, HIV testing and   
counseling, referral to drug treatment programs, on-site medical car, etc.   
Similarly, these service would presumable not be available through such   
distribution sources as vending machines.<p>

NOTE TO: George Lewis<p>  
  
<h3>RE: Comments on Needle Exchange Study</h3>  
  
As you may be aware, Beny asked me to review this report during the early  
stages of its preparation earlier this year. While the final summary report does  
reflect many of the changes we recommended, there are several noteworthy  
areas which warrant some attention.<p>  
  
<UL>  
<LI>Page 4, Paragraph 4. The report indicates that, "although NEPs may make  
referral to drug treatment an important part of their services, they  
acknowledge that many IDUs, including some in drug treatment programs,  
continue to inject drugs and share injection equipment. They therefore seek  
to reduce the harm associated with these practices...". While there may be  
some injecting drug users in certain treatment modalities who continue to  
inject drugs, the reference here implies that this practice has more  
significance than the evidence warrants. More importantly, the statement,  
in a somewhat convoluted fashion, implies that referral to treatment in  
contrast to NEP does not offer assurance that drug users will not inject  
drugs.<p>  
  
<LI>Page 11, Paragraph 5. The report notes that NEPs vary greatly with respect  
to the emphasis they place upon making referrals to drug treatment and  
other public health services. This stems in part from the desire to make  
the NEP "user friendly", the recognition that many active IDUs express no  
interest in entering drug treatment, and the related belief that an over  
emphasis on drug treatment could alienated potential NEP clients." This  
assertion for which two literature references are cited is a dangerously  
misleading generalization. First it is unclear what the authors mean by  
"user-friendly". This implies that drug treatment is somehow not user  
friendly which is clearly not the case. Secondly, the references to drug  
treatment are based published papers which were published before OTI/CSAT  
came into existence, a development which has had an enormous effect on the  
nature and quality of national drug treatment services. We must remember  
that many of staff of these NEPs are only casually familiar with the  
various treatment modalities, the behavioral characteristics of drug using  
populations and are generally not qualified to make determinations about  
who is interested in treatment or not. In point of fact many drug users are  
not interested in treatment, enter treatment for many other reasons, e.g.  
secure primary care or to take a respite from their addiction lifestyle,  
other than to address their addictions. It does not follow, even from the  
limited evidence provided in the cited studies, that emphasizing or  
overemphasizing treatment produces alienation. Finally, the determination  
of who should be referred or not should never be left to so-called  
perceptions of staff regarding "readiness for treatment".<p>  
  
<LI>Page 12, Conclusion. There are a number of reasons why referrals to drug  
treatment are limited other than the paucity of drug treatment slots. One  
important consideration which may be a limiting factor to referrals may in  
fact have more to do with how various NEPs have evolved in relation to drug  
treatment programs in the same area. It is abundantly clear that these  
programs have not been in philosophical agreement regarding how to address  
the needs of the addict.<p>  
  
<LI>Page 13, Conclusion. I don't think there is any serious disagreement that  
the cost of NEPs are substantially cheaper than any form of treatment  
including methadone. It is also true that NEP is cheaper than coronary  
angioplasty, renal dialysis and a range of other health care expenditure.  
The reference made to methadone seems to suggest that there is contrast, or  
perhaps imply that there is tacit substitution effect. The reference made  
to methadone should be deleted since its incorporation in the context of  
the conclusion is largely irrelevant.<p>  
  
<LI>Page 14, Paragraph 5. Our understanding of injecting drug use among women  
is not as well developed as for men. While there is evidence which suggest  
that men initiate women, this is by no means an absolute. the fact remains  
that there are IDU populations of women which operate independently from  
those of men. Our limited knowledge of injecting behaviors among women  
clearly indicates that there may be other factors involved with respect to  
injecting behavior which may make it problematic to apply NEP directed at  
male IDUs to female IDUs.<p>  
  
<LI>Page 16, Conclusion. The conclusion tragically fails to appreciate the full  
range of antipathy and fear which African Americans communities have for  
the "symbolic sanctioning" of drug abuse by endorsing NEP in their  
communities. After years of "Just Say No", the perception of many leaders  
in these communities is that NEP represents a step back and not forward.  
Irrespective of whether this perception is valid or not, the presence of  
these compelling beliefs cannot be dismissed lightly. It is insulting to  
these communities, also contrary to all of our Public Health platitudes  
around cultural sensitivity to dismiss these visceral community concerns by  
stating that "newer African American organizations established specifically  
to address HIV prevention generally support NEP as did several mayors..."  
This statement literally indicates that the view of traditional leaders  
from the African American communities and from church leaders can and  
should be ignored in favor of those who support NEP. This statement by it's  
intent, fosters divisiveness and is antithetical to efforts made by other  
segments of public health including those concerned with preventing HIV  
disease to engage and not alienate the African American community.<p>  
  
<LI>Page 18, Conclusion. The overall issue here is the question which frames  
this section, "Do NEPs result in changes in community levels of drug use?"  
Clearly this is very complex question which could not be answered within  
the scope of the study, but one which nonetheless warrants a poignant level  
of inquiry. However, the conclusion seems to go beyond the paucity of  
evidence to conclude that there is "no evidence that NEPs increase the  
amount of drug use by NEP clients or change overall community levels of  
non-injection and injection drug use." This convoluted logic would have us  
believe that if it cannot be established that NEP has an effect on drug  
use, then the absence of correlates, irrespective of methodological  
limitations, is tantamount to saying it has no effect. This conclusion is  
further supported by indicating that interview with NEP clients and by IDUs  
not using NEP, confirmed that they did not believe that increase needle  
availability would increase drug use. It is not clear how these two groups  
would qualify to speculate on new incidence, especially by younger members  
of the community. In general, this ipso facto logic is not only  
distressing, but raises very real questions overall scientific validity of  
this report.<p>  
  
<LI>Page 21, Conclusion. Though the majority of studies cited indicated a  
decreased rate of HIV drug risk behavior, the real issue here which is not  
addressed are whether these behavioral changes are sustainable overtime.  
While there are clearly compelling finding of short term behavioral change,  
these indications do not provide definitive conclusions regarding the  
effectiveness of NEP overtime. The proper statement of this conclusion  
should insert the caveat that the studies reviewed do not conclusive  
evidence at this time that these behaviors are sustained overtime.<p>

To: James Curran, M.D.<br>

We at HRSA have reviewed this very thorough report on needle exchange   
programs and concur with its major finding and recommendations. We believe   
that needle exchange programs definitely have a place in what must   
necessarily be a comprehensive approach to the prevention of HIV infection   
among drug users. In addition, we were pleased that the report went beyond   
needle exchange programs per se to discuss the need for changes in current   
prescription and paraphernalia laws at the State level.<p>   
   
Thank you for giving us the opportunity to review this excellent report.<p>

<H4>Subject: Draft Response on Needle Exchange</H4>   
   
To: James Curran, M.D., M.P.H.<BR>   
Associate Director for HIV/AIDS, CDC<p>   
   
In general we think the CDC's draft response to Jo Ivey Boufford, M.D.   
concerning the University of California report on needle exchange programs   
did an excellent job of covering the salient issues. We do have a number of   
specific comments, which follow:<p>   
   
<I>page 2, paragraph 2:</I><P>   
   
We suggest adding a sentence to the effect that : "Substance abuse   
treatment programs also require substantial funding increases in order to   
accommodate the needs of individuals who decide they want to enter   
treatment as a result of their involvement in needle exchange and other   
outreach efforts to IDUs.<p>   
   
<I>page 7, first paragraph:</I><p>   
   
We think it is important to mention the fact that needle exchange remains   
an issue of special concern issue among African-American and other minority   
politicians and community leaders. Whether or not we think this concern is   
justified, we need to acknowledge that it exists.<p>   
   
<I>page 8, last paragraph:</I><p>   
   
We think it should be acknowledged that the degree to which new HIV   
infections are reduced is strongly affected by (1) the "penetration" of   
needle exchange in a particular city and (2) the complexity of the   
drug-using populations and network in particular communities (i.e., the   
number of, and kinds of connections between, drug injection networks).<p>   
   
<I>page 9, "Impact of Needle Exchange Programs on Drug Use":</I><p>   
   
Again, we think it is crucial to acknowledge and discuss the fact that many   
African-American and other minority politicians and community leaders fear   
that needle exchange programs condone drug use and should be opposed on   
those grounds.<p>   
   
The last paragraph in this section should provide more specific data to   
address this concern.<p>   
   
<I>page 10, last paragraph:</I><p>   
   
The fifth sentence should read, "Third, NEP clients report decreases in   
their HIV drug-risk behaviors."<p>   
   
We disagree that the relationship between NEPs and HIV infection may be   
impossible to study conclusively, particularly since "conclusiveness"   
depends on the criteria being used. This issue could be studied with   
several replications (different cities or neighborhoods) to obtain better   
data than now exist on this point.<p>   
   
<I>page 11, last paragraph:</I><p>   
   
We suggest adding a sentence to the effect that, "The CDC should develop   
and foster the use of standardized data elements, methods of data   
collection, and protocols for evaluation/analysis."<p>   
   
<I>page 12 first paragraph:</I><p>   
   
In the last sentence, we suggest adding the phrase, "using standardized   
methodologies."<p>   
   
<I>page 15, first paragraph:</I><p>   
   
Again, we suggest adding to the last sentence's phrase about the use of   
standardized data collection and evaluation methodologies.<p>   
   
We appreciate the opportunity to review this response.<p>
