<P>In the first day of his three-day deposition, Brian "Kato" Kaelin talks about his relationship with O.J. and Nicole Brown Simpson, the couple's violent relationship, and events leading up to the murders. Simpson was angry with his former wife for "playing hardball" with him in granting access to their children, Kato recalls. In the days following the murders, one of Simpson's friends says to Kaelin, "It's O.J., man.  Get your story straight."</P>

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Object to the term "dart. " 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  You may answer.  Let me clarify. How many times did you see 
the dog Chachi run outside the gates when the gates opened? 
 
A:  I didn't see Chachi run out of the gate.  Kate, the dog, 
sometimes -- okay. I'm sorry. 
 
Q:  Talking about Chachi. 
 
A:  Chachi. no, I never saw Chachi run out of the gate. 
 
Q:  Never. Is that right? 
 
A:  Yes. I never saw Chachi run out of the gate 
 
Q:  When the gates opened, what would Chachi do if he were in 
the driveway? 
 
A:  Chachi usually was laying down. 
 
Q:  Okay. Now, Chachi was present on the premises on June 12, 
1994. Is that right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Now, you just mentioned in your answer another dog named 
Kato.  That dog was not present on June 12. Is that right? 
 
A:  Was not present. 
 
Q:  And no other dog was present on June 12, 1994. Is that right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Now, you had a car. I take it. in June of 1994? 
 
A:  I did. 
 
Q:  What kind of car was that? 
 
A:  It was a black 300 ZX. 
 
Q:  Where did you park that car? 
 
A:  I usually parked on Ashford, the street Ashford. 
 
Q:  Did you park inside the property at all? 
 
A:  No 
 
Q:  Mr. Simpson parked his Bronco on Ashford.  Is that right? 
 
A:  Normally it would be on Ashford. 
 
Q:  Right before the mailbox? 
 
A:  In the front.  You could be on that side closest to the gate. 
 
Q:  And you would park on the other side of the driveway? 
 
A:  I'd park--if the Bronco was there. I'd park in his spot -- you 
know. either in front of it, but that -- in front of it or whatever spot 
was actually open on Ashford. 
 
Q:  Okay. I am going to show you a document that I believe has 
previously been marked as a plaintiffs' exhibit, which depicts the 
Rockingham property. Why don't you rake a look at that first.  It's 
been previously marked as Exhibit 27 to this deposition. 
Pointing to Exhibit 27, does this appear to be a sketch of the 
Rockingham property? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And you see Ashford Street right here (Indicating)-- 
 
A:  Uh-huh 
 
Q:  --where I am pointing?  And then there is the gate. Correct? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  And then the rest of the street up above the gate. Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And .Mr. Simpson would normally park here (Indicating) 
where the mailbox is right before the Ashford gate. Right? 
 
A:  Well, he parked there, but the car could be also here 
(Indicating). It could be on Ashford-- 
 
Q:  I am not asking where it could be.  Normally. 
 
A:  Normally right there (Indicating). 
 
Q:  Where it would be parked normally is right where I am 
pointing, and I am going to have--I am going to put-- 
 
Right before the driveway starts on Ashford. Correct? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  There is a mailbox there. Right? 
 
A:  There was a mailbox. 
 
Q:  And you would park on the other side of that driveway or 
across the street. Right? 
 
A:  Yes, I would. 
 
Q:  Okay. We will probably refer to this. I  will just leave this out. 
Let me ask you a question: If--You see the entranceway to the 
property?   And again I am referring to Exhibit 27.  Do you see the 
entrance there? 
 
A:  Yes. I do. 
 
Q:  That's the front door. Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  There are some benches out there and there are some coach 
lights. Is that right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  If those coach lights are on they can be seen from the Ashford 
gate entrance. Correct? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Even if you're standing outside the gate. Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  That's a wrought iron gate you can see right through. Right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  And if those lights are on, you can see from Ashford. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: I will object as leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  You can see from Ashford if those lights are on. Right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  You spent some time on June 11 with Mr. Simpson.  I am 
referring to 1994, of course. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  What did you do that morning when you got up on June 11? 
 
A:  June 11th was Saturday? 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
A: I probably went running. I usually went running, and I probably 
after a run came home, and then I believe O.J. called me in, 
"Kato," and I heard him, and I went into the living room/den area 
where the TVs are. 
 
Q:  Now, what time was that? 
 
A:  I'm thinking it was--that's about 3:00 o'clock, 3:30. 
 
Q:  So we have a Little clarity here, referring to Exhibit 27, when 
you would enter the property, you would typically enter the 
Ashford Street gate? 
 
A:  Yes, I would. 
 
Q:  Then you would walk down the driveway to this path. Correct? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And then you would follow that path around to the side of the 
house and into the back area, and then you would go down this set 
of steps into your room? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Now, you did that on this occasion when you returned from 
basketball.  Right? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  On which day? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  June 11. 
 
Q:  Or running, I should say. 
 
A:  Running on June-- 
 
Q:  Running. Was it running, you said? 
 
A:  Well, are you talking about the Saturday? 
 
Q:  Yeah, I am only talking about Saturday now. 
 
A:  Saturday it was running. 
 
Q:  And you came back from running, and you went on this path to 
go to your room. Did you get into your room.? 
 
A:  I don't think so. I think it was right about here (Indicating) 
where he called, and there is a door here (Indicating), that I said 
"Hey" and I walked in that way (Indicating). 
 
Q:  You are referring to an area just opposite the pool-- 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  --right, on the east side of the house? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  And Mr. Simpson is sitting inside? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Where? 
 
A:  On the couch in the den with the TV. 
 
Q:  And he yells out "Kato"? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And you can hear him? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  And what do you then do? 
 
A:  "Hey," so I thought that was like come on in, so I went to the 
door-- 
 
Q:  And then you came in? 
 
A:  Came in. 
 
Q:  Let me ask you a couple of questions about your rules for 
conducting yourself on that property.  Did you without invitation 
enter the Rockingham residence? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  You never did. Correct? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Did you without invitation go and eat Mr. Simpson's food? 
 
A:  Unless it was given to me, I wouldn't eat it. 
 
Q:  Right. Without invitation. 
 
A:  Without invitation. 
 
Q:  Would you open the doors to his house? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Would you walk inside without invitation if you saw Mr. 
Simpson sitting in there? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Would you go inside to use his kitchen? 
 
A:  No 
 
Q:  Or his bathrooms? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Or his pool table? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  His bar? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Any of his possessions? 
 
A:  No, I would not. 
 
Q:  Had you ever even used his Jacuzzi as of June 11th? 
 
A:  I had swam in the pool-- 
 
Q:  No.  Jacuzzi. 
 
A:  But it's connected. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: You are cutting him off. 
 
THE WITNESS: It's connected, so I actually swam into it, but I 
never put it on. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  By the way, just so you understand why I interjected, just to 
make the deposition go in a more orderly fashion, I just want you 
to focus on answering my questions specifically as you can, but if 
you need to elaborate, please feel free to do so, but I thought it 
might speed things up -- 
 
A:  Okay. 
 
Q:  --if you stick with the questions at hand. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Well, let him answer the question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  That's exactly what I just said. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Let him answer the question. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Getting back to where I was, before June 12 had you ever used 
the jacuzzi? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  And would you have not done so without asking him for 
permission, "him" being Mr. Simpson? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you ever use his cars? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you have keys to his cars? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you have keys to any of his locks in the property? 
 
A:  Nothing, no . 
 
Q:  For you to enter the house, you would have to be invited. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And this time on June 11 you were invited. 
 
A:  Yes.  I was. 
 
Q:  Okay. And you came inside, and what did you do? 
 
A:  I said, "Hey, hi, O.J., how you doing?"  And so I sat down on 
the--by the TV set and we started talking. 
 
Q:  About what? 
 
A:  There's TV on, and he was mentioning things that were on the 
TV and people that he knew from other TV shows, and he was 
mentioning that he's going to an event, to some dinner event-- 
 
Q:  That evening? 
 
A:  An Israeli dinner or something of some sort that evening, on 
the Saturday. And also there was--one of the shows that had come 
on was THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP, and when that 
was on--it's a Robin Williams movie--he was watching it, and there 
was a part that came on where Robin Williams' character is coming 
home, and he does a thing where he'd go into the driveway and 
turn off the lights and would coast in with the kids, and he'd get it 
right before the garage.  And the part came up, though, the wife 
was in the car, in the other car that was in the driveway that 
shouldn't have been there, and going down on a guy in the film. 
 
Q:  Meaning giving the guy oral sex? 
 
A:  Oral sex. 
 
Q:  Okay. Continue. 
 
A:  So that part was coming up. It was on U.S.A. network, so 
there's commercials, and it was the edited-for-TV version, and O.J. 
had said. "Watch this part here,"  and the part had come up, and 
that segued into-- 
 
Q:  What was the part that O.J. said watch? 
 
A:  The part was going to come up when he coasts into the car, and 
the car hits the other car.  Williams' car, Robin Williams' car hits 
the car in front-- 
 
Q:  Right. 
 
A:  --and the woman doing oral  sex bites off the guy's penis. 
 
Q:  And that's-- 
 
A:  And that's the segue that when-- 
 
Q:  I am sorry. Continue. 
 
A:  That was the segue that went into an event that happened at the 
Gretna Green house. 
 
Q:  In other words. Mr. Simpson says, "Hey.  watch this part," and 
then you watch it, and then you see the part where the man's penis 
gets bitten by the  woman, and he then starts talking about a Gretna 
Green incident. 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  And what incident did he start to talk about? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  You can answer. What did he tell you then? 
 
A:  Oh, it was an incident that Nicole was performing that act on 
someone else in the house, in the Gretna Green house, and O.J. had 
saw it outside. 
 
Q:  That's what he told you? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Is that the first time O.J. Simpson had told you that he had seen 
Nicole perform oral  sex on another man from outside the house? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did he identify the other man? 
 
A:  At the time I think he just said [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q:  And did you know who he was referring to? 
 
A:  I don't think I did. I think it was--didn't know [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q:  You did not know at that time [Name Deleted]. Is that what 
you're saying? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  But you did have a sense who he was referring to? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And how did you have that sense? 
 
A:  Because I Lived at Gretna Green, and that guy [Deleted] had 
come by a few times. 
 
Q:  While you lived there? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And you had seen him? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Had you ever spoken to him? 
 
A: "Hi. How you doing?" 
 
Q:  Had you ever seen Nicole perform oral sex on him? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Had you ever seen Nicole engaged in sex with [Name 
Deleted]? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Or with any other man? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you ever stand outside the window and look inside and see 
Nicole sharing intimate moments? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Objection. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Did you ever see that? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  What did Mr. Simpson say--Withdrawn.   What did you say to 
Mr. Simpson after he told you what he had seen at Gretna Green 
from outside the window? 
 
A:  I--wow. I didn't--I never really had any comment. It was kind 
of Like "Oh"-- 
 
Q:  A little uneasy?  
 
A:  Yeah. I don't want to hear it. I mean, it was (sound). 
 
Q:  You were a little taken aback by it? 
 
A:  Yeah, I was. I guess I was--pictured a girlfriend or my wife 
would have done that, I wouldn't want to see that. 
 
Q:  Did you say anything to him about it? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  What did he then say to you? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Hearsay. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  You may answer.  Everything Mr. Simpson said is an 
admission, which is not hearsay. But continue. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  It is hearsay. The last time I checked, you 
don't have a black robe on, Dan. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It'll be a long time before I wear a black robe, 
Mr. Baker. 
 
Q:  Go ahead. 
 
A:  What was it? 
 
Q:  I am sorry.  You did a good job of interrupting my train of 
thought. What did Mr. Simpson say to you after you reacted in that 
kind of uneasy manner that you described? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Same. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember exactly.  I think that it was--I 
think that was the comment that was made about it, and it was--I 
don't think I brought up anything else with that. I was coming up 
with --I might have switched to what was going to go on, what 
time he had to go to the dinner.

Q:  You knew he was going out with someone that night? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  With whom? 
 
A:  Paula Barbieri. 
 
Q:  Did you and he talk about Paula Barbieri on that occasion? 
 
A:  That he was going to go to that dinner with Paula, and I don't 
know if he was looking forward to going to the dinner or not. He 
said he was tired, but he was gonna go to this--that dinner, 
whatever the cause was. 
 
Q:  For--fancy dinner? 
 
A:  Yeah, black tie dinner. 
 
Q:  Now, did he say anything to you about his relationship with 
Paula Barbieri, on that Saturday? 
 
A:  I don't know if it was on that Saturday or not. It was a comment 
about the relationship.  Could have been on Sunday, though. 
 
Q:  You mean on June 12? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  What was the--what did he say about Paula Barbieri on 
Saturday or Sunday? 
 
A:  It was not sure if Paula is exactly the one, you know. She 
wanted kids, and O.J. had said that he already had kids and he was-
-you know, he doesn't want more kids. So is it was kind of like 
Paula's probably not the one. 
 
Q:  Did he say anything about his sexual appetite for Paula? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Did he say anything about that subject? 
 
A: [Deleted] 
 
Q:  But not the one to marry? 
 
A:  Not the one to marry. 
 
Q:  And you think this conversation occurred what day, now? 
 
A:  Saturday. the-- 
 
Q:  The one about Paula 
 
A:  In bed, was Saturday. 
 
Q:  You sure it wasn't Sunday? 
 
A:  I'm pretty sure, yeah, it was Saturday.  The other one I believe 
was Sunday, about not being the one. Paula not being the one I 
thought was on Sunday. 
 
Q:  I see. So you had two conversations.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  [Deleted]. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And one on Sunday about Paula not being the one. 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Okay. And the one on Sunday was also about Paula wanting 
kids and Mr. Simpson not wanting to have more kids. 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Did he say anything to you on the Saturday conversation about 
Nicole? 
 
A:  I know there was a comment made about the taxes, and I can't 
recollect Saturday or Sunday. It was a thing with taxes that Nicole 
was using the address of the--the Rockingham address and that 
O.J. didn't want her to use it. He was going to see that she couldn't 
use that anymore. 
 
Q:  O.J. was going to take action to prevent Nicole from-- 
 
A:  From using that address for getting mail. I think it was because 
of a break in the school price or with the IRS, tax reasons. I'm not 
positive on how it worked, but it had something to do with IRS and 
moneys. 
 
Q:  And O.J. was upset at Nicole? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And do you think this conversation occurred on a Saturday or a 
Sunday, June 11 or June 12? 
 
A: I thought part of it was on Saturday and some of it on Sunday. 
 
Q:  Why don't you relate again the part that occurred on Saturday, 
if you can, and then we will talk about Sunday. 
 
A:  Okay. I thought that on--part of it was just--there's a phone that 
constantly rings at the house, so it could have been said about, 
"Nicole's not going to be using this address to get her mail, and I'm 
gonna see that she can't use that address."  I think it was on both 
Saturday and Sunday, brought up again on Sunday. 
 
Q:  And in that vein, did he also mention anything about the IRS? 
 
A:  I believe so. 
 
Q:  What did he say in that regard 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Hearsay. 
 
THE WITNESS: That --the exact words, I don't know.  It's like, 
"I'll see that there will be some kind of trouble with the IRS.  She'll 
get in trouble with the IRS." 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Did he tell you why he was upset at Nicole? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Object as leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  You said he was upset at Nicole. 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  And he expressed that to you.  Right? 
 
A:  Well, it was a thing--they were in fights off and on-- 
 
Q:  I- 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Let him answer the question. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  I just want you to stay with me now. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: You are cutting him off.  When you ask 
him a question, he has the opportunity to respond. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: But he is not answering the question. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: So you are going to cut him off every 
time? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am going to move to strike, and I want to 
reframe the question. I withdraw-- 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Mr. Kaelin has the opportunity to respond 
to your questions the way-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I withdraw the question. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: You can t withdraw it in the middle of his 
answer if you don't like the answer. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  Are you finished? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Let him answer. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  I am going to ask you another question.  I want you to stay 
with me now. We are talking about the conversations on Saturday 
or Sunday, June 11 or June 12, and you had told me in these 
conversations Mr. Simpson expressed the feeling to you that he 
was upset at Nicole. Correct? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  And I want--I am now asking you whether he said anything to 
you on Saturday or Sunday as to why he was upset at Nicole.  
Answer as fully as you want. 
 
A:  I'm trying in my--I believe that it was something with jewelry, 
and I believe Nicole got back some sort of -- gave back some kind 
of jewelry to O.J. 
 
Sometimes conversations--could I go on with this?  Sometimes 
conversations would take place with other people in the house that 
I could hear maybe  something in the background.  I would try to 
not listen in, and I would catch certain things. So I'd  try not to 
listen in on-- 
 
Q:  Why? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: You cut him off again. 
 
THE WITNESS: Because I didn't think it would be right for me. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Your sense of what's right and wrong? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And you don't want to listen to what people are talking about 
when you are in the same room? 
 
A:  Right. It would be like--call it an eavesdropper or something, 
so I didn't want to, but certain words I would hear, and 
conversations. 
 
Q:  Please continue. 
 
A:  Well, I believe it was on Saturday that--I don't know exact 
time, but I think Ron Fishman came over, who was a neighbor, and 
there was a conversation that did take place in the kitchen nook 
area-- 
 
Q:  Of the residence? 
 
A:  Of the residence. I think he just popped over. And part of the 
conversation was with Ron and O.J. where it was O.J. had raised 
his hands and said, "These women, I just don t understand them."   
 
And I think Ron might have been going through some trouble at 
that time, and so there was a conversation that I knew, when I had 
saw who was in the kitchen, that I shouldn't be there. 
 
Q:  And O.J. was talking in a loud, angry voice? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Describe his voice for us. 
 
A:  "These women. I just don't understand them."  That was the 
comment that I heard. 
 
Q:  Was he laughing? 
 
A:  No 
 
Q:  Was he upset? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And you --were you in the kitchen with Ron and O.J.? 
 
A:  I was--walked into the kitchen. 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
A:  They were in the breakfast area. So it would be where I am 
right now and maybe two chairs past you, past Mr. Brewer. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And when you heard O.J. say, you know,  "These 
women, what's wrong with them," what did you then do? 
 
A:  Well, I kind of got the feeling from the look that--from both of 
them that I shouldn't be -- it was a private conversation. 
 
Q:  Did you then leave? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Was it your sense that Mr. Simpson was referring to Nicole? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And on what do you base that? 
 
A:  Just a feeling I had. I imagined it had to be Nicole. 
 
Q:  Tell me about the bracelet. You said he was upset because 
Nicole had returned some jewelry or something. Why don't you 
describe that to me. 
 
A:  I don't know the exact--what kind of bracelet it was. I think it 
was some kind of tennis bracelet, and I believe Nicole gave it back 
to O.J., and I think O.J. gave it to Paula. 
 
Q:  How do you know all that? 
 
A:  Part of it I think from Cora Fishman, and that's it. And stuff 
that like I had heard. 
 
Q:  Did you hear any of that from O.J. Simpson? 
 
A:  I think I heard some of that yes. 
 
Q:  Tell me what O.J. Simpson told you. 
 
A:  I think O.J. said, "Nicole gave me back this bracelet, and I'm 
going to give it to Paula." 
 
(Fred Goldman enters the deposition.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Did he say this on that Saturday. 
 
A:  I believe so. 
 
Q:  This is your best recollection-- 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  --of when you believe you also saw Ron Fishman? 
 
A:  My best recollection, yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. Now, did you have any knowledge as of June 11, 1994, 
of whether O.J. and Nicole were split apart or were together? 
 
A:  On June 11th? 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
A:  They were apart. 
 
Q:  How did you know that? 
 
A:  I had heard conversations before that they were over with, from 
a few weeks before. "Oh, it's over, " that the relationship was over. 
 
Q:  Who told you, "Yes, it's over.  The relationship, it's over"? 
 
A:  O.J. had said that. 
 
Q:  To you? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  When is your best recollection as to when O.J. Simpson said 
that to you? 
 
A:  I believe it was towards the end of May. 
 
Q:  Was there any discussion on Saturday with O.J. Simpson about 
his children? 
 
A:  I believe Saturday and Sunday that--- 
 
Q:  Why don't you relate the decision that occurred on Saturday 
and Sunday about Mr. Simpson's children. 
 
A:  That O.J. liked, you know, with the  kids, hearing voices of the 
kids around. He just liked hearing the voices of the kids. He didn't 
have to be seeing them, but if he heard the voices, he liked that. He 
liked the idea of having a family there and white picket fence and 
to have the voice of the kids, Sydney and Justin, to hear them. 
 
Q:  What was the context in which that discussion came up? 
 
A:  That there was no one there, and he'd like to have someone 
there because there was--it was kinda empty there. 
 
Q:  Did O.J. Simpson to you appear lonely on June 11 and June 12, 
1994? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Object as vague. 
 
THE WITNESS:  Somewhat. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Yes? 
 
A:  Yes, somewhat. 
 
Q:  He appeared lonely to you? 
 
A:  Yes. I figured-- 
 
Q:  He was lamenting about not having his children around? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Objection.  You cut him off. Leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Was he lamenting about not having his children around? 
 
A:  Somewhat, yes 
 
Q:  And you base that on the things he said to you 
 
A:  Well, that and also inviting me in.  I thought that was part of it, 
too 
 
Q:  And how was that part of it? 
 
A:  Maybe that I was like a last resort or something. 
 
Q:  Wasn't very common for you to be invited in.  Right? 
 
A:  No. It was nice to be in, to say--you know, talk to. 
 
Q:  No.  My question was-- 
 
A:  But-- 
 
Q:  --it wasn't very common for you to be invited in by him. Right? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: You're cutting him off again. 
 
THE WITNESS: It wasn't common to be invited in. Sometimes, 
yes-- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: And you were invited in-- 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Wait. wait. 
Will you read back his answer so he can continue answering the 
question? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Were you finished with your answer? 
 
A:  There was a thing that it wasn't common, but sometimes when I 
was called in, it was kinda cool to be in, but-- 
 
Q:  You felt kind of cool? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  You cut him off again. 
 
THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I felt kinda cool that I was invited in, yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  For the record, Mr. Kaelin has  kind of a 
halting speech pattern, and he pauses and I think you're finished, 
and then you go on, and I  apologize if I am cutting you off, but in 
my defense that's one of the contributing factors. 
 
THE WITNESS:  That's true. I do.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Okay.  On the weekend of June 11 and June 12, you were 
invited in at least two times.  Is that right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  That was pretty unusual. Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  What did you say to O.J. Simpson when he was lamenting 
about his children? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Objection. Vague as to "lamenting." 
 
THE WITNESS: Part of it was, I said. "Oh, I don't know why you 
guys try to get back together sometimes.  You want to get back 
together and you don't.  You guys are always--you should be apart 
maybe for like six months and see where it goes from there, but 
you shouldn't be together." 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  And what did Mr. Simpson then say to you? 
 
A:  That it was over. 
 
Q:  The discussion that you just related, did it occur on both 
Saturday and Sunday, to the best of your recollection? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Had O.J. Simpson ever asked you whether Nicole had sex with 
any men? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Objection. Hearsay. 
 
THE WITNESS:  He asked me about one buddy of mine. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  What did O.J. Simpson ask you? 
 
A:  He said if I had a buddy named Grant.  I said yes.  And there 
was a relationship when they were divorced, in Aspen when I first 
met Nicole, and Grant Cramer had a relationship with Nicole, and 
that was in '92 when I met, and that conversation with O.J. 
happened in '94. 
 
Q:  When in '94? 
 
A:  I think around May. 
 
Q:  And what did O.J. Simpson say to you in 1994 on this subject? 
 
A:  That--he asked if I had a friend by that name and I said "Yeah," 
and did they have a relationship, and I believe I said, "Yeah.  I 
think they did back in Aspen." 
 
Q:  Did you ask him why he was asking you? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Why did you tell him? 
 
A:  Because I'm telling him the truth. 
 
Q:  You didn't feel you were breaking any confidences? 
 
A:  I don't know if I said they slept together.  I said there was a 
relationship. 
 
Q:  Do you know why he asked you? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  What did you do on Saturday after you saw Ron Fishman and 
left the house? Did you have any further interaction with Mr. 
Simpson on that day? 
 
A:  Well, I think still in the living room area. 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
A:  I have a friend; her name is [Name Deleted], and at certain 
times I would think of people that I think O.J. might get along 
with. Not that I need to set him up on dates or anything, but then I 
had a friend Tracy who was doing a movie, and I said, "This is a 
really cute girl. You should meet her," because I figured they 
weren't together, with Nicole anymore, and it was fine for him to 
date, and he already mentioned about Paula, how she wasn't the 
one, so I  figured here's a girl that might go out. 
So it was my friend.  It was a phone call that was made. I believe I 
made it first in my room but gave O.J.'s number, and she returned 
the call to O.J. or--at one point, and then we called there, to North 
Carolina, that Saturday to her. 
 
Q:  And [Name Deleted] was a friend of yours? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And O.J. had never met her before? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you ask--did O.J. ask you what she looked like? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  What did you say? 
 
A:  I said. "She's in Playboy right now. I can get an issue." 
So he said. "Get an issue."  I went down and got an issue, and he 
looked at the pictures and-- 
 
Q:  Where did you get the issue' 
 
A:  There's a market on San Vicente.  I don't know what it's called.  
It's an outdoor market where they sell magazines.  I believe that's 
where I got it. 
 
Q:  And then you came back to the house? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And when you got to the property, how did you get in the 
house? 
 
A:  By--I think I came in through the nook area. 
 
Q:  Did you know? 
 
A:  I think I did. 
 
Q:  And he let you in? 
 
A:  I don't know if I came through the front I and went back around 
again and said "Hey."  One of the two.  I'm not positive. 
 
Q:  Was there a housekeeper there that weekend on the 11th and 
the 12th of June? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Who was his housekeeper at that time? 
 
A:  Gigi. 
 
Q:  Now, when you got there, did you show Mr. Simpson the 
Playboy issue? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did you point out Tracy Adell? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And what did Mr. Simpson say? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Hearsay. 
 
THE WITNESS: It was--she's a great looking girl, but it wasn't his 
type.  He liked the blondes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  That's what he said? 
 
A:  Yes.  But she was good-looking. 
 
Q:  That's what he said? 
 
A:  Yeah.  It was the centerfold.  I mean, "It was a great body," that 
sort of thing, "but not my look.  She's not a blond.  I like blondes." 
 
Q:  What did you then say? 
 
A:  "I like her," or something.  I said, "I think she's beautiful," 
but... 
 
Q:  And what did you do with the Playboy issue? 
 
A:  I think I kept it there. 
 
Q:  Now, in your presence, at least, did you see Mr. Simpson make 
telephonic contact with Tracy Adell on that Saturday? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Are you sure about that? 
 
A:  I'm pretty sure we called there. I  thought we called there that 
day to that --I don't  know if it was a message machine or not, but I 
thought  there was a call that was made, because there was a call 
that came in on Sunday, but I thought it was because there was a 
message left.  That's what I recollect. 
 
Q:  In your presence on Saturday did you witness an extended 
conversation between Tracy and O.J.? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Were you there on Sunday when that occurred? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  So you do recall Mr. Simpson talking to Tracy Adell on 
Sunday on the telephone in your presence, but not on Saturday. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  After you--Let me back up for a second.  Do you know 
what led to this split-up, this final split-up between Nicole and 
O.J.? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Objection.  Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS:  I don't know what the final--think it might have 
been a few of the things:  The bracelet, the IRS.  I think it was a 
bunch of things. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  And who told you those things? 
 
A:  That I heard from O.J. and from Cora also, and I--it was one of 
the things where it was over, together, back, not back. It was a 
constant--of the time that I knew both of them, it was a constant-- 
 
Q:  What I am asking you is, on this  weekend-- 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  You cut him off again. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: -- of the 11th and 12th, Mr. Kaelin -- 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  --did you know what had led to the breakup of O.J. and Nicole?  
You mentioned the IRS letter.  You mentioned something about 
the bracelet, which O.J. Simpson told you about.  Correct? 
 
A:  Part of it, yes. 
 
Q:  And now I am asking you whether you knew anything else. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS:  Well, I believe part of it also was from the dance 
recital on Sunday. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Okay.  Which you didn't know on Saturday, of course. 
 
A:  I did not know. 
 
Q:  Okay.  So tell me what you learned on Sunday after the dance 
recital about the breakup of O.J. and Nicole. 
 
A:  Well, just that Sunday was--part of the day was when I was 
talking to O.J. about the recital.  He had come back, and I believe I 
was coming back from basketball and he --I asked how the recital 
was, how Sydney was, and he said "Oh, it was great," and all that 
and that Nicole wasn't giving O.J. time with the kids and all that, 
and she was playing hardball with him with the kids and she can't 
do that. 
 
Q:  And what did you say? 
 
A:  There was also a comment about --I don't know my exact 
dialogue, but a comment about--that was brought up about what 
they were wearing. 
 
Q:  Who made the comment? 
 
A:  O.J.   
 
Q:  What did he say? 
 
A:  It was a comment like, "I don't know what she's gonna do when 
she's gonna be a grandma, I mean, she can't wear those kind of 
outfits when she's a grandma." 
I said, "What kind?"  "It was a miniskirt."  Then it was a comment 
about --after that, it was about, "Those girls" -- 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Wait.  You are stopping him.  You just 
stopped him. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELI: 
Q:  Excuse me.  When you say there was a "comment."  I need to 
know who the speaker is. 
 
A:  O.J. made a comment. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  You can follow up with questions after he 
finishes his answer. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Please, Mr. Baker, I am conducting my 
examination.   
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  You are conducting your deposition by 
interrupting the answer -- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  The answer is not clear as to who the speaker 
is.  We want a clear record here. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Then ask him when he finishes his 
answer. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Please continue.  You said there was a comment about "those 
girls."  Now, tell me who made the comment and then continue 
with what the person said. 
 
A:  O.J. made a comment about the outfit Nicole was wearing and 
the person she was with.  So it was a comment about Nicole and 
that person saying, "How can they wear those outfits?" 
And "What outfits?" 
"They're wearing"--I said, "What outfits?" 
"Those miniskirts.  What are they gonna do when they're 
grandmothers? They're gonna have to learn how to dress."  It was--
exact words, I don't know, but it was a comment about their outfits 
being miniskirts, kind of a club-wear for a recital.  It was the 
wrong--it wasn't the appropriate thing to wear to a recital. 
 
Q:  And when he was telling you about Nicole playing hardball 
with the kids and he was telling you about Nicole wearing these 
tight miniskirts, what did you say to him? 
 
A:  I probably went, "Oh, yeah, those outfits."  It wasn't--I mean, 
there was nothing--it wasn't something for me to comment on.  It 
was kind of like me listening and, "Oh, okay." 
 
Q:  And when he made these comments to you about Nicole 
playing hardball with him with the kids and wearing tight 
miniskirts, what was his -- did he appear angry to you? 
 
A:  Well, not real angry, just-- 
 
Q:  Did he appear upset? 
 
A:  Well, it was like -- can I do it?  It was kind of like (sound) 
"What are they gonna do when they're wearing these outfits when 
they're grandmas?  I mean, it's a recital.  Look what they're 
wearing." 
 
Q:  Did he appear frustrated to you? 
 
A:  That's good.  Frustrated. 
 
Q:  Would you say he was upset? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Objection.  Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS:  I think more frustrated, actually. I think it was 
part of upset, but frustrated. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Did he appear to you to be upset about Nicole not letting him 
see the kids? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
MR. SIMPSON:  Kids? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  We need to have Mr. Simpson not make 
comments on the record that are audible.  That's very important, 
and it's not fair to the witness. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Continue with the deposition. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Excuse me? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Continue with the deposition. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I don't want any comments or any histrionics 
by any one at the table. It's not appropriate. 
 
THE WITNESS:  Could I have 30 seconds real quick? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Yes. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Sure. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Why don't you just take a short break rather 
than-- 
 
THE WITNESS:  It's just a second.  If you want to take a break--I 
don't need to-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Okay. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are going off the record now, and 
the time is approximately 10:31. 
 
(Recess.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 10:40. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Now, we were talking about a conversation that you had with 
Mr. Simpson on June 12 after Mr. Simpson came back from the 
recital, and in this conversation that you just related to us, was 
there any mention of this issue of the bracelet being returned as 
well? 
 
A:  I don't believe on that Sunday, there was not. 
 
Q:  What about on the IRS situation? 
 
A:  Yes, it came up with the IRS about --I believe it was during the 
dress conversation, that he was going to, I don't know, call the IRS, 
do something  with the IRS where she'd get in trouble.  What 
exactly, I don't know, but some kind of trouble. 
 
Q:  And that's what O.J. Simpson said to you? 
 
A:  That it was something with the IRS, yes. 
 
Q:  What you just related to us about the IRS is what O.J. Simpson 
said to you? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Just so you understand why I keep repeating that question at 
times, when you give your testimony, it's not clear who's doing the 
speaking, so I am trying to find out who the speaker is.  Okay? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Thanks. 
 
A:  Yes.   
 
Q:  Now, when O.J. Simpson was talking to you about these topics 
after the recital, you said he was--you got the feeling that he was 
frustrated and  upset insofar as the kids were concerned? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Objection.  Mischaracterizes his 
testimony. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Did you do anything to relieve yourself of being around him 
while he was upset? 
 
A:  Could you say the question again I'm not following. 
 
Q:  In other words, you were talking to him, and he's upset. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And did you do anything to get out of that situation, to leave 
the room or to stop the topic of conversation, to change the subject, 
to go someplace else?  Did you do anything? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: I probably picked up the sports page or 
something, started reading the paper.  I believe that Sunday also, 
that girl called back, [Name Deleted]. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  This is after the recital now? 
 
A:  Oh, this is after the recital? 
 
Q:  Right. 
 
A:  This was before the recital. After the recital I went to ask him if 
I could take a jacuzzi, because I had played basketball--I ran and I 
played basketball, and I said "God, I'm sore," and all that. 
"Is it okay if I use the jacuzzi?" 
 
Q:  Was one of your purposes asking to go to the jacuzzi because 
you didn't want to continue to be in an upsetting conversation with 
him? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Leading and mischaracterizes his 
testimony. 
 
THE WITNESS: I guess somewhat, and that I was sore and was 
going to use the jacuzzi and just go on. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Let me read something to you. These are from the tapes of our 
interviews with Eliot. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Are you going to mark those? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  No. 
 
Q:  "You know, when you're in one of those situations where you 
can feel this tension going on.  I had mentioned jacuzzi because I 
didn't want to hear, you know, how--the upset." 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  What page is that? 
 
Q:  Do you recall making statements to that effect? 
 
A:  Yes.  It would be where I've heard the arguments before about 
that, so I wanted to go out, get out of it. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  What page is that? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I don't have a page.  Just a statement that 
appeared on the tape. 
 
Q:  In any event, does that refresh your recollection? 
 
A:  Yes.  Yes, and I took off then. 
 
Q:  So you felt some tension? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And one of the reasons you wanted to go do a jacuzzi was to 
get rid of that tense situation? 
 
Q:  Yes.  You know the situation sometimes when someone tells 
you something and you've heard it before, and you just want to, 
"Okay," and then you want to get out of it.  So part of it was to 
release tension, to go in to take a jacuzzi. 
 
Q:  And that's what you did. 
 
A:  Yes, I did. 
 
Q:  Okay. And you asked for permission.  Correct? 
 
A:  I did, yes.  I also asked how to use the jets because I didn't 
know how to use the jacuzzi itself. 
 
Q:  You asked Mr. Simpson? 
 
A:  Yes. I said. "How do you actually make the jets come out?" So 
I asked him. and he said there were some buttons, some buttons on 
the side, because I never had actually taken a jacuzzi. 
 
Q:  Let's go back to June 11. We are going to come back to this 
conversation again.  When you were in the house with Mr. 
Simpson on June 11, you've described the incident involving 
getting the Playboy magazine for [Name Deleted].  Is that the last 
thing you can recall happening after he looked at the magazine:  
You had the discussion that you related and called Adell?  
Anything else that you can recall? 
 
A:  I knew it was getting late at that time and he had to get ready 
for the reception.  I think I took off.  I got the magazine, I believe a 
call was  made, and I think someone else had called.  It's one of the 
things where the phone rings all the time, and it's a lot--so your 
mind goes--you forget your last thought.  You go to the phone call.  
I believe a friend of his called, and I might have done something 
funny with the friend on the phone.  I may have been talking to 
him and disguising my voice in a manner where I do this joking 
voice, like a guy who worked in the hair salon, very effeminate and 
make the guy laugh, and the guy thinks it's really someone calling 
up.  I think I might have done that. 
 
Q:  And then what? 
 
A:  I think I took off.  I think I was out of the--I was done.  I took 
off, and he went out to the event, and that was it. 
 
Q:  You didn't see him the rest of that evening? 
 
A:  No, I don't believe so. I didn't see Paula come over or anything.  
I think that was it, and they were off.  He was off to the event. 
 
Q:  By the way, when you were relating Mr. Simpson's 
conversation to you about the events of the recital and he was 
telling you about the black miniskirts--do you recall that? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did you see Nicole dressed that evening at the recital? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you see her at all that day? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  So you never saw any dress that she wore on the evening of 
June 12.  Right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Or any clothing.  Correct? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  So the only knowledge that you have about what she wore that 
evening came from whom? 
 
A:  O.J. 
 
Q:  Because O.J. Simpson told you. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  When O.J. Simpson would arrive at his house at night and you 
were in your guesthouse, would you always hear him enter? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  So if he came back that evening with Paula Barbieri, the 
evening of Saturday, would you know? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did O.J. Simpson come to your room that day on the 11th? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he ask you for change? 
 
A:  On the 11th? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A:  Was it Saturday? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A:  No, he didn't. 
 
Q:  Did he ask you to set the alarm? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he ask you out to dinner? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he ask you to get a burger? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he ask you to take a ride with him? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he tell you he was going to dinner? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Now, the next day on the 12th.. . 
 
MR. PLOTKIN:  Can you do me favor? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Sure. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Speak up, Mr. Plotkin. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN:  Comments during the course of this are going to 
be difficult because they are going to interrupt everybody's train of 
thought. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Comments? 
 
MR. PLOTKIN:  Comments.  Your initial reaction is to react to 
some of the questions and answers, and I understand that, but 
audible comments are going to be... 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Now is the time you decide to speak, Mr. 
Plotkin? 
 
MR. PLOTKIN:  Yes, now is the time I decide to speak. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Both visible and audible reactions to 
testimony have to be avoided. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN:  And by the way to the extent you want to treat 
this as a battleground, I'm not on either side of this battle, but I'll 
be happy to play by any rules you want. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  I understand that, Mr. Plotkin, but I think 
you should defend your client's interests and allow him to answer 
questions. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: Let me address that for a minute.  That's fair 
enough.  The fact of the matter is that I've lived with the pattern of 
speech for a year, so perhaps I've grown more accustomed to it 
than you have.  I have a sense of when he starts and stops.  Neither 
you nor Mr. Petrocelli do.  He was right about half the time.  He 
was wrong about half the time and you were right.  I just have a 
sense that it's better to let that pattern take its--  
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  If that's the case then, if you believe he is 
being interrupted, if you are so knowledgeable about it, then put it 
on the record so we can get his full answer. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN:  I thought you were doing a wonderful job 
yourself. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  No.  He was only doing a wonderful job half 
the time. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  If I'm wrong half the time, please help. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  In any event, let's continue I think your 
initial comment was that we should avoid facial reactions to the 
testimony. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN:  It isn't facial reactions.  You can't help people's 
reactions. But audible reactions. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  You are not supposed to react facially in a 
visible way in a deposition. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Now we're Saturday evening, the 11th.  What did you 
do? 
 
A:  What did I do that night? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A:  I probably went out. 
 
Q:  Do you remember what you did? 
 
A:  On Saturday night, the 11th.  I don't recollect what I did. 
 
Q:  Okay. 
 
A:  I probably went out with buddies. 
 
Q:  What did you do the next morning, on June 12th? 
 
A:  Whenever I would get up, I'd probably get up, watch a little TV 
and start stretching and go on a run, and I would take a pretty long 
run. 
 
Q:  You're in good physical shape? 
 
A:  Pretty good. 
 
Q:  At the time? 
 
A:  Well, I'm still in good shape.  What are you saying? 
 
Q:  Were you in good physical shape-- 
 
A:  Yeah, I could run-- 
 
Q:  --on June 12? 
 
A:  I could run eight miles pretty easy. 
 
Q:  How many? 
 
A:  Eight, ten. 
 
Q:  When you got up that morning, what time was it? 
 
A:  It was about 11:30 or so, 11:00.  In the room.  Got up around 
10:00, probably just hung out there. 
 
Q:  When you hung out, you hung out in your room? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did anybody else live on the grounds besides you and Mr. 
Simpson? 
 
A:  The housekeeper, Gigi, would stay in the house, and also have 
a house in Hollywood.  Most of the time she'd stay there during the 
week.  And Arnelle. 
 
Q:  And Arnelle lived where? 
 
Q:  Arnelle was in the wall-adjoining guesthouse next to mine. 
 
Q:  Okay.  So the first--Did you see Mr. Simpson on the morning 
of June 12th? 
 
A:  I believe so.  Morning-afternoon.  Noonish. 
 
Q:  Morning before noon? 
 
A:  I don't think so. 
 
Q:  You went and did your run. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And when you came back, what did you do? 
 
A:  When I came back from my run, I believe I saw O.J. then, and I 
talked to him for a while. 
 
Q:  What time was it? 
 
A:  It was after noon, I'd say 1:30, 2:00 o'clockish. 
 
Q:  How did you encounter O.J. Simpson? 
 
A:  He shouted my name. 
 
Q:  Where were you when he shouted your name? 
 
A:  I believe I was coming in from the Ashford gate from my run, 
pushed the gate open and came in, and he called me in.  I think I 
went to the breakfast nook area, and the breakfast nook area is--I 
took a seat, and we talked. 
 
Q:  When you came in through the Ashford gate, Mr. Simpson was 
inside the residence? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  In the kitchen nook area? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And he could see you through the window? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And he called you. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And you then went to the door that's right outside that kitchen 
nook area? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And you went inside. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And what happened next? 
 
A:  We had a conversation that day, had a few conversations with 
O.J. and I don't know time-wise exactly because I also played 
basketball that day, and I'm trying to tell you in the exact order of 
everything I did. 
So I had different conversations in the breakfast area, and one of 
the conversations, I believe he had said something about the night 
of that ball, that he got in earlier or he didn't spend the night with 
Paula.  I think that was part of it. 
 
Q:  You mean the night before? 
 
A:  Of that--right.  So I'm pretty sure I would have said.  "Hey, 
how did that go?"  
And he said. "It's all right."  I think I was expecting maybe to see 
Paula there.  She wasn't there.  She didn't spend the night.  I don't 
know if he had spent the night there or not at her place. 
Another conversation was he had a golf--he golfed that morning, 
that I think I said, "How did you do in the golf," and all that.  I 
think he said he won, and he played cards.  There was a lot about 
the things about what he had done already in the morning of the 
golf game and the playing cards. 
 
Q:  Let me stop you right there. 
 
A:  Okay. 
 
Q:  When he was telling you--Withdrawn.  This conversation that 
you're now  relating with O.J. Simpson occurred before Mr. 
Simpson went to the dance recital for his daughter Sidney.  Is that 
right? 
 
A:  That is right. 
 
Q:  And when he discussed his having played golf, did he tell you 
that he was unable to play golf because of any physical condition? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  In fact he said he won.  Is that what you said? 
 
A:  I'm pretty sure. 
 
Q:  Did he say that he was unable to shuffle cards or play cards 
because of any physical condition? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he complain to you about arthritis on that occasion? 
 
A:  No. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  "On that occasion" meaning that 
conversation? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Yeah, the conversation in the afternoon of 
June 12 before the dance recital. 
 
THE WITNESS: He did not, no. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Did you see any cuts on his fingers? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  See any bleeding? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he indicate whether anything unusual had occurred playing 
golf? 
 
A:  I don't think so, no. 
 
Q:  Did he talk --tell you about a dispute he had with a golf 
partner? 
 
A:  I don't think he told me that. 
 
Q:  That he had a fight or an argument? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS:  I don't think so. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Did he tell you that? 
 
A:  I don't know if he told me that or if I heard that.  It's--I thought 
it was like in one of those news stories, that someone said he had 
an argument.  So I can't tie it into myself. 
So I might have, but I don't want to confuse it where it's one of 
those news items, where I know that there was an argument with a 
guy named Craig, but I can't-- 
 
Q:  You can't recall as you sit here now whether Mr. Simpson told 
you about an argument with Craig or whether you heard about it 
after the fact? 
 
A:  Yes. that's correct. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Asked and answered. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Is that correct? 
 
A:  That is correct. 
 
Q:  Now, about Paula, Paula was not there during this 
conversation.  Right? 
 
A:  Not there, no. 
 
Q:  And to your knowledge was not in the house.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes, to my knowledge. 
 
Q:  And what did he tell you about Paula? 
 
A:  There was a conversation about Paula that he thought that 
Paula wasn't the one, that she was a bit upset about not going to 
this recital that was coming up.  O.J. said it was kind of like this 
family thing and he didn't want her to go, and so he was talking 
about that.  She took it hard, and that's what I know of that. 
 
Q:  When he told you that Paula took it hard because O.J. would 
not let her go to the dance recital, what, if anything, did you say? 
 
A:  I think I probably said. "She's probably in love with you and"--
that's the impression I got, that Paula was in love with him and I 
think wanted to have kids with him. 
 
Q:  And what, if anything, did O.J. Simpson say? 
 
A:  That he already had his kids and all that; not sure if she was the 
one for that.  You know, he didn't want kids, and he didn't think he 
was going to marry her. 
 
Q:  Where were you and Mr. Simpson when you had this 
discussion? 
 
A:  In the breakfast nook area.  It's not the front door.  There's also 
a door to the side of the front door.  It would be here in this picture 
(Indicating). 
 
Q:  Can you tell me any other conversation that you had again in 
that afternoon before the dance recital? 
 
A:  I think there was talk about the playoff games.  There was the 
Knicks-Houston game.  I think something came up about the score 
of the game or who  won the game-- 
 
Q:  What about--I'm sorry. 
 
A:  That was prompting me I think to play basketball that day for 
myself. 
 
Q;  Do you like to play basketball? 
 
A:  Very much. 
 
Q:  Did Mr. Simpson and you discuss Tracy Adell? 
 
A:  Oh, yes.  That I believe that there was a message that she had 
called back and that--to give her a call.  So I think he called her 
back and that--that day, and there was a--talked for a while. 
I know that I was on for just like a second, saying "hi" and all that.  
So when they were on the phone, I didn't want to eavesdrop in, so I 
started reading the sports page and let them talk on the phone. 
 
Q:  Did you listen to their conversation? 
 
A:  I tried not to, so I think it was just about asking each other out 
or to see each other at some point when she came back.  I think it 
was film talk and what she was working on. 
 
Q:  Let me-- 
 
A:  And there was something also with that he had--he was saying 
that, "Trace, I've got pretty much everything.  I've got a huge 
house, and I would want the white picket fence and the family," 
and he was mentioning that sort of thing of--saying, "I'm a single 
guy, single successful guy" and all that. 
 
Q:  Who did he say that to? 
 
A:  Tracy. 
 
Q:  In your presence? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Let me go back to golf for a minute.  Let me read something 
from your interviews with Eliot. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Object.  Lack of foundation. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  "So I had seen O.J. back from the golf game and went into the 
main house.  He was sitting on the--he had a foursome.  I know 
one of the guys was a Craig  Baumgarten that he had mentioned 
they had got into a little verbal fight.  I think it was bad shooting or 
O.J. had a bad shot, or I don't know the exact reason for the  fight."  
Does that refresh your recollection as to whether Mr. Simpson told 
you about a fight with Craig on the golf course? 
 
A:  Like I--I don't know if that was from a news item or that he had 
said that, but something with that sticks out in my mind.  What I 
remember is   what I had said, if it's TV or if O.J. said it, but I 
knew there was some story about that. 
 
Q:  Did O.J. tell you when he was going to the dance recital? 
 
A:  Yes 
 
Q:  What did he say? 
 
A:  That he was going to see Sydney in some dance recital at some 
school and that it was, I believe,  at 5:30, and then I think took off 
for basketball. 
 
Q:  Did he tell you what his plans were later that evening? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he tell you that he was leaving town? 
 
A:  I think it came up that he had to do packing and was taking a 
red eye flight. 
 
Q:  He told you in this early afternoon conversation that he had to 
take a red eye flight? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  That evening? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And he had packing to do? 
 
A:  He had packing to do.  He was talking-- some Hertz thing was 
coming up. 
 
Q:  That's what he told you. 
 
A:  Yes. he did. 
 
Q:  Did he tell you what his plans were between the recital and the 
red eye? 
 
A:  No.   
 
Q:  Did you ask? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Was it your habit to ask Mr. Simpson what his plans were? 
 
A:  No 
 
Q:  What his activities were? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  What his whereabouts were? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  And you didn't do so on that occasion.  Right? 
 
A:  Did not. 
 
Q:  What was O.J. Simpson wearing when you had that 
conversation with him in the afternoon of June 12? 
 
A:  I believe it was white shorts and a sport top and tennis shoes.  
That's what I recollect in my mind. 
 
Q:  What did you do after you had this discussion with him about -
-that you just related to us?  What was the next thing you did? 
 
A:  That I was--I went to play basketball. 
 
Q:  You were going to go play basketball? 
 
A:  That I was going to go to the basketball courts. 
 
Q:  Did you go directly to the basketball courts? 
 
A:  From-- 
 
Q:  From this afternoon conversation. 
 
A:  Yes.  Before the recital I went to basketball. 
 
Q:  What time did you leave Simpson's house to go play 
basketball? 
 
A:  I imagine it was about 3:30. 
 
Q:  And had Mr. Simpson left for the recital? 
 
A:  I don't think so.  I think I was gone.  I didn't know his 
whereabouts.  Then I just took off. 
 
Q:  How long did you spend with him that day before you left to 
play basketball, in this conversation?  How long was it? 
 
A:  I guess about an hour. 
 
Q:  How long had spent with him the day before? 
 
A:  About an hour, hour and a half. 
 
Q:  All told? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  On Saturday? 
 
A:  Yeah.  Maybe a half hour either way. 
 
A:  But at least an hour. 
 
Q:  Now, where did you go play basketball? 
 
A:  I don't know the name of the place, but these courts are sort of 
like at a school on I think 14th Street in Santa Monica, and it's just-
-you've got to park and climb like a fence and you go, and I don't 
know the name of the school, but it's near a Vons store. 
 
Q:  A Vons? 
 
A:  A Vons. 
 
Q:  You drove there? 
 
A:  I drove to basketball. 
 
Q:  And you played with a group of guys? 
 
A:  Just pickup games, just pick up each other and... 
 
Q:  When you finished playing basketball, was it light out or dark 
out? 
 
A:  It was still light. 
 
Q:  Had you eaten yet? 
 
A:  No, not all day. 
 
Q:  You were hungry? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did you get any food after you left the basketball game? 
 
A:  I did. I drove to Vons and I picked up--they have those sushi 
dishes that are pre-made.  So I got a California roll, like six pieces, 
because I was starving. 
 
Q:  Where did you eat them? 
 
A:  In the car in the parking lot. 
 
Q:  Were you satisfied at that point? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Object. 
 
THE WITNESS:  Six pieces of sushi?  No. I mean, it's--it put a 
partial dent in my lung that's about it, but I was still hungry, but it 
put me over for--from basketball and running, I needed something. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  When you came back --when you left Vons, where did you go? 
 
A:  I went back home. 
 
Q:  And where did you park? 
 
A:  I parked at the--right on Ashford Street, right here (Indicating). 
 
Q:  Now, you are pointing east of the Ashford gate.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes.  I am. 
 
Q:  And you parked your Z there Is that right? 
 
A:  Yes.  I did. 
 
Q:  And that's the last time you used the car that evening.  Right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Now, when you went in, you went in the Ashford gate? 
 
A:  Yes, I did. 
 
Q:  And what did you do after that? 
 
A:  Okay.  So I went in the Ashford gate and saw O.J. was there in 
the nook area again, and he called, and I saw him again. 
 
Q:  He called you again.  Second time this day? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And you then went into the nook area through that kitchen 
door? 
 
Q:  Yes, I did. 
 
Q:  And what happened next? 
 
A:  So I--it was after, I know, he had said he was going to the 
recital and asked him how it was, and then that conversation came 
up about the dresses  that Nicole was wearing and that there was--
he wanted to see Sydney after the recital and Nicole didn't let him 
and he said, "Oh, she's playing hardball with me," and... 
 
Q:  That's what he said to you? 
 
A:  Yes.  And I know-- 
 
Q:  What else did he say to you? 
 
A:  I think it was on the lines of playing hardball, that she has no 
right, you know, to take his kids.  They're his kids, too, that he has 
the right to  see the kids, and she can't just run off with them, and 
he was upset that she did. 
 
Q:  That's what he told you? 
 
A:  Yeah. But it was that thing of playing hardball with him. 
 
Q:  Excuse me? 
 
A:  The term "hardball," "playing hardball with me," and, you 
know. "They're my children, too.  I wanted to see Sidney after the 
recital," and I believe from the conversation Nicole didn't let O.J. 
see Sydney. 
 
Q:  That's what he told you? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did he say anything about going to dinner with the family after 
the recital? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Object, leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: He may have said that, that they all went to 
dinner. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Did he say whether or not he went with them? 
 
A:  That he did not go. 
 
Q:  Did he say why? 
 
A:  I believe because he wasn't invited. 
 
Q:  Is it around this time that you then, sensing the tension and 
uneasiness, decided to take your jacuzzi? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS:  Yes. I did. I was --there was the tension and also 
very soreness.  It was both and-- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Tension-- 
 
A:  --I wanted to get out of the house . 
 
Q:  You wanted to get out of the house. 
 
A:  Get out and get into the jacuzzi. 
 
Q:  Well, let me be real clear on this.  Okay? 
You felt tension?  
 
A::  Yeah, there was some--I believe O.J. was frustrated from that 
event. 
 
Q:  And you wanted-- 
 
A:  I could sense it. 
 
Q:  --to leave? 
 
A:  Yeah, I wanted to get out and-- 
 
Q:  You also wanted to take a jacuzzi because you were sore? 
 
A:  Right.  So I asked permission, and I took a jacuzzi, and that 
was it 
 
Q:  Okay.  Did you console Mr. Simpson at all? 
 
A:  I don't know if it's consoling, but I think sometime--I don't 
know what part of the conversation--I said, "I don't know why 
you'd be upset.  You've got everything."  O.J.'s got a-- 
 
Q:  What did he say? 
 
A:  I don't think there was any answer. 
 
Q:  What was he wearing? 
 
A:  I remember it being a dark sweat outfit, kind of a sharp sweat--
you know, dress kinda sweats. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And-- 
 
A:  I think I remember a white zipper.  I think, in my head, it was a 
dark suit with a white zipper. 
 
Q:  And where were you and Mr. Simpson when you saw him in 
these dark sweats having this conversation? 
 
A:  It was in the nook area. 
 
Q:  In the kitchen? 
 
A:  Kitchen. 
 
Q:  When you went off to do the jacuzzi, was it light out or dark 
out? 
 
A:  When I went in the jacuzzi, I remember going into the jacuzzi 
that it was becoming dusk.  So I remember that feeling of watching 
it become dark while I was sitting there.  And it was June, so it was 
about 8:00 o'clock or so, 8:30, whenever it got dark, but I 
remember it going to darkness. 
 
Q:  And did you go change your clothes or just jump on in? 
 
A:  I had my basketball stuff on.  I took off my tennis shoes by the 
jacuzzi and my socks, and I hopped in.  I think I got a towel, too. 
 
Q:  Excuse me? 
 
A:  I think I got a towel out of my room, though.  I believe I took a 
towel 
in. 
 
Q:  Let 's look at Exhibit 27.  You see the area marked "Kaelin's 
room"? 
 
A:  Uh-huh. 
 
Q:  Is that your room. 
 
A:  Yes. it is. 
 
Q:  And where is the jacuzzi on Exhibit 27? 
 
A:  See the pool? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A:  The very end of that pool is a jacuzzi.  It would actually be like 
a little bridge here (Indicating).  It's not drawn in.  And it would be 
that part, would be the jacuzzi. 
 
Q:  You are referring to the north end of the pool? 
 
A:  Yes, the north end. 
 
Q:  While you were taking that jacuzzi, could you see Mr. 
Simpson? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you see what he was doing? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you know where he was? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Could you hear him talking to anyone? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Do you have any idea what he was doing while you were 
taking the jacuzzi? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  When you walked into the Ashford gate and to the kitchen 
nook after playing basketball when Mr. Simpson called you, you 
had to walk by the front entranceway.  Is that right? 
 
A:  After basketball? 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
A:  Walked through the front here (Indicating). yes. 
 
Q:  And then you had to walk past the front entranceway to get to 
the kitchen door.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes, I did. 
 
Q:  Now, when you walked past that front entranceway, did you 
see golf bags lying there? 
 
A:  Did not. 
 
Q:  Did you see anything lying there? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  How long were you in the jacuzzi? 
 
A:  I think I was in the jacuzzi 20 minutes or so. 
 
Q:  Then what did you do? 
 
A:  Okay.  After the jacuzzi I went back to my room, and I think I 
dried off.  I might have rinsed off in the shower.  I don't know.  But 
I had dried, and I changed out of my shorts, and I got on the phone. 
 
Q:  Now, when you took the walk from the jacuzzi to your room, 
did you see O.J. Simpson? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you hear him? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you know where he was? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you know what he was doing? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  So you went in your room? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And what did you do? 
 
A:  Well, I probably dried off and probably did rinse off in the 
shower from the jacuzzi, and then I got on the phone. 
 
Q:  Who did you call? 
 
A:  I think --on Sundays I call my house a lot, my family in [City 
Deleted], and I called I believe a Susan Wilkinsen and I called my 
buddy, Tom O'Brian, and I believe it was--I think it was during the 
Tom call that O.J. came by the door and told me that I forgot to 
turn the jacuzzi jets off and-- 
 
Q:  Hold on a second.  Tom O'Brian lived where at the time of this 
call? 
 
A:  San Diego. 
 
Q:  It's a long-distance call? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And Susan Wilkinsen lived where? 
 
A:  Susan lived in Brentwood. 
 
Q:  Local call. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And your parents lived where? 
 
A:  [Deleted].  My mom. 
 
Q:  Your mom, in [Deleted]. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  That's where you're from? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Call your mom a lot? 
 
A:  I call the family a lot, yeah. Everybody lives in [Deleted], but 
usually my mom, everybody goes there on Sundays. 
 
Q:  Why did you call Susan Wilkinsen? 
 
A:  It was a girl that--I wasn't dating Susan.  I spent a lot of time on 
the phone, and she would be just one of the--I joke with people a 
lot, so I call up and just have jokes during the phone and kind of 
the passing of time:  "What are you doing tonight," just--it was just 
casual conversation. 
 
Q:  You spend a lot of time on the phone in your room.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Not a lot else to do in your room.  Right? 
 
A:  No.  I watch TV or that, but I talk on the phone a lot. 
 
Q:  You have call waiting.  Right?  
 
A:  Yes. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  At that time? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  We are talking about June 12, 1994. 
 
A:  Yes.  I had call waiting at that time. 
 
Q:  Now, what did you and Susan Wilkinsen discuss? 
 
A:  I said, "Susan, what are you doing tonight?  What's happening?  
What's going on for you this week?"  You know, no real plan.  I 
think we were  possibly going to see each other that night or not.  I 
had already--Susan had played tennis with O.J. earlier in the week 
or a week before or just hit  tennis balls. 
 
Q:  When you walked into the Ashford gate, getting out of your car 
after basketball, and you walked through the kitchen door-- 
Are you with me? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  --did you run into the Bronco in the driveway? 
 
A:  I do not remember seeing the Bronco.  I do not remember 
seeing it. 
 
Q:  In the driveway. 
 
A:  In the driveway 
 
Q:  Okay.  So you are talking to Susan Wilkinsen, and what's the 
next thing that you can recall? 
 
A:  If I remember, I think I might have called my buddy Tom, and 
during that conversation with Tom, I think it was O.J. came by and 
said, "Kato?" 
I said, "Yeah."  He said, "You forgot to turn the jacuzzi off," and 
he was at the door of my front room. 
And I came to the door, I went, "Oh, God."  So I was almost 
getting ready to do it, and he had said he had shut them off already. 
 
Q:  Were you on the phone when Mr. Simpson came to your door? 
 
A:  I believe so.  I believe I was on the phone to Tom. 
 
Q:  And he came to your door, and he said what to you?  Mr. 
Simpson said what to you? 
 
A:  "Hey, Kato, you done taking a jacuzzi?"  And I said "Yeah."  
And he said, "Oh, you left the jets on," and so I-- 
 
Q:  Let me stop you there. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  You interrupted him again. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  I want to take this in pieces.  Okay? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Well, I think you've got to give him an 
opportunity to answer your questions the I way he wants to answer 
them.  You're taking the  deposition, but it's his deposition . 
 
THE WITNESS:  So he came to the door, and he had said, "Kato, 
you forgot to turn the jacuzzi jets off." 
So I was about to go out and go, "Oh, I'll turn them off." 
Then he goes. "No.  I did it already." 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Did you feel bad that you hadn't turned the jacuzzi jets off? 
 
A:  Well. I felt bad because I had asked permission to do it, and I 
screwed up --I felt like I screwed up because I left the jets on.  It 
was like a  privilege I screwed up on. 
 
Q:  Did he appear, in telling you this, to be a little annoyed? 
 
A:  Not annoyed. It was kind of tired. 
 
Q:  Tired. 
 
A:  He seemed tired at the time. "Hey, you left the jacuzzi jets on." 
 
Q:  How many times had Mr. Simpson ever come to your room 
before to tell you about the jacuzzi jets? 
 
A:  Never. 
 
Q:  How many times had he ever come to your room before at all? 
 
A:  I don't think ever. 
 
Q:  So this is the first time Mr. Simpson ever came to your room 
while you were in it:  On the evening of June 12.  Correct? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Just so I rephrase that, because it was a little awkward, June 12, 
1994 in the evening, after you took a jacuzzi and while you were in 
your room was the first time Mr. Simpson ever came to your room.  
Correct? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Let me show you-- 
 
A:  Can I ask a question, Dan? 
 
Q:  Sure. 
 
A:  There was a time when Sydney and Justin came by where they 
were in my room, and he had come through the office area to my 
room. 
 
Q:  That's an internal door? 
 
A:  Yeah.  But he was in my room that time.  I don't want to-- 
 
Q:  So the only other time he had ever been near your room is 
when he came through the interior office door to get the kids. 
 
A:  Yeah.  The kids were with--you know, hanging out with me, 
and he came by the room. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: We can't have any of these audible 
comments. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: You guys want to speak for a minute? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  No, they can't speak for a minute. Okay? 
 
MR. PLOTKIN:  We will take a break if they want to speak for a 
minute. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Okay, let's take a break. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I don't think it's appropriate.  We are in the 
middle of the examination of the witness. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  We just took a break. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Look, we have taken two breaks already 
now. It's only 11:15.  Is there a reason for this break? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  I thought he said. "Do you want to take a 
break?" 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  I don't think Mr.--I think he was-- 
 
MR. PLOTKIN:  I thought you guys-- 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Fine, let's keep going. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Thank you.  I just don't want comments that 
are audible that can distract the witness or anyone else here. 
 
Q:  Let me talk a little bit about this interior door.  Your room 
connects to the Simpson residence? 
 
A:  Yes, it does. 
 
Q:  And there is an interior door that connects your room to the 
Simpson residence.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Now, that door is typically locked or unlocked? 
 
A:  It normally is always locked. 
 
Q:  And it's locked from your side or the other side? 
 
A:  It's locked from the other side. 
 
Q:  So if you wanted to go from your room into the Simpson 
residence through that interior door, you can't do so.  Is that right? 
 
A:  Correct.  Unless it would be opened. 
 
Q:  And you had no key to it.  Right? 
 
A:  No key. 
 
Q:  Do you know whether that door was on an alarm? 
 
A:  I believe I knew it was on an alarm.  The house had an alarm.  
So it was part of the house, so. yes, it was on an alarm. 
 
Q:  Was there a key pad on your side of that door? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  As of this point in time, did you have any familiarity with the 
security system at the house? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  On June 12? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  As of the time Mr. Simpson came to see him 
in his room on June 12, 1994. 
 
THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I knew the house had an alarm.  I knew--I 
think it was protected--I believe I knew it was Westec. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Did you know anything about how it functioned? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  No one had ever given you any instructions.  Right? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Including Mr. Simpson.  Correct? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  And you've already testified you had no knowledge of the 
security code.   Correct? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  How many digits the code was.  Right? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS:  Did not know anything about the security code. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Zero. 
 
A:  Zero. 
 
Q:  When you had lived there the prior six months, was Mr. 
Simpson out of town from time to time? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And during the times that he was out of town while you lived 
there at Rockingham, he never once asked you to set the alarm.  Is 
that right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Asked and answered. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Tell me what you did when Mr. Simpson told you about the 
jacuzzi. 
 
A:  When he told me about the jacuzzi, I was going to--I was 
already up and I was almost attempting --I stayed in my room, but 
I was attempting to go out and turn it off, but he said he already 
had turned it off, the jacuzzi. 
 
Q:  So he came to tell you that you had not turned it off, but he had 
already turned it off. 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  What was he wearing? 
 
A:  In my mind, it was the same suit, that black sweat with the 
white zipper and--the sharp sweat suit. 
 
Q:  Black sweats? 
 
A:  Black, dark colored, yeah, black. 
 
Q:  After he told you about the jacuzzi jets, what did he do? 
 
A:  It looked like he was walking back into the house area. 
 
Q:  Did you follow him? 
 
A:  No.  I think I was still on the phone or I returned my call.  I 
think I was still on the phone. 
 
Q:  Did you go out to talk to him? 
 
A:  No.  He had already said he had turned that off and all that, so I 
thought --kind of being reprimanded, so I wasn't going to go out of 
my way to talk to him.  I think I just apologized, and that was it. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And what did you then do. 
 
A:  There was a thing--I think it was coming up at this part--where 
O.J. had mentioned on the walk going back to the house my friend 
Susan.  He said "Let's get them back together for like another 
cookout," for a cookout and--when he comes back. 
 
Q:  O.J. Simpson asked you to invite your friend Susan Wilkinsen 
over to the house? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  At a time when he would be there.  Right? 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  Now, when did he say this to you? 
 
A:  It was I think that jacuzzi trip when he came to the door, and it 
was kind of like when he was doing his walk back towards the 
house, and I had my head by the door and he said it.  I didn't go 
outside my room. 
 
Q:  So after he tells you about the jacuzzi,  Mr. Simpson then heads 
back towards his-- 
 
A:  It was during the walk.  It was during that walk.  He wasn't in 
the house, and he said "Oh, let's"-- 
 
Q:  Let me ask my question.  Okay?  Because-- 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  You're cutting him off again. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  I didn't finish my question. 
 
Q:  That time you cut me off, Mr. Kaelin. 
 
A:  Okay. 
 
Q:  Mr. Simpson came to the outside of the door to your room, 
made the comment about the jacuzzi, and then did he start to walk 
back towards the house when he made the comment about Susan 
Wilkinsen? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  With his back towards you? 
 
A:  Back towards me but turned.  Then he turned and said it. 
 
Q:  And you could see him walking back? 
 
A:  Well, I was out the door, looking out, so my door was kind of 
open and me looking in that direction.  I said.  "Okay, I'll call." 
 
Q:  Now, when he came to make this comment about the jacuzzi, 
he never stepped inside the house.  Is that right? 
 
A:  In my room? 
 
Q:  I'm sorry.  Inside your room.  Right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  So how did you see him? 
 
A:  It was through the door, the screen--my room has a door. 
 
Q:  Can you see through that door? 
 
A:  You can see through the door, but it's-- I think it was one of 
those things-- 
 
Q:  Slats? 
 
A:  No.  Slats in the wooden part, but it was a screen also that has 
wiring.  A screen door. 
 
Q:  So you clearly saw him. 
 
A:  Yeah . 
 
Q:  Okay.  And you saw him as he headed back to the house.  He 
turned his head. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Now, you then stayed on your telephone call.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And how long were you on that call? 
 
A:  I think it was still the same call to Tom.  It was a short one.  Or 
I might have just said "Oh, I'll be right back," call them--"I'll call 
you  back," but it was during the call that O.J. came back again.  It 
seemed like within a few minutes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  How long was it between the time that Mr. Simpson left 
your room, the outside of your room, when he made the comment 
about the jacuzzi and Susan Wilkinsen and then returned? 
 
A:  Say it again, the question.  I'm sorry. 
 
Q:  Yeah.  I'm trying to ask you, what was the interval of time --
Withdrawn. 
You were telling us that Mr. Simpson returned to your room area.  
Is that right?  
 
A:  After the first jacuzzi--when he came by the jacuzzi, he left, 
and then he did come back, yes. 
 
Q:  So he came back a second time to your room. 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Pretty unusual.  Right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And what was the interval of time between his two 
visits to your room.? 
 
A:  I think it was within 5 or 10 minutes.  It seemed-- 
 
Q:  When he came back the second time, where were you? 
 
A:  On the phone again. 
 
Q:  And you could see through your door again. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did he come in or stay out? 
 
A:  Stayed out. 
 
Q:  Could you see him? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  What was he wearing? 
 
A:  Same outfit:  The black sweats. 
 
Q:  What did he say to you? 
 
A:  That--he asked me if I had any money on him--on me.  He 
needed five bucks for the skycap. 
 
Q:  What did you say? 
 
A:  I said, "Yeah, let me check."  So I checked the drawer I keep 
my money in, and I said "Yeah," and I gave him 20. 
 
Q:  Now, did he say he wanted--that he needed money or he 
needed change?  
 
A:  I think he said he needed $5 for the skycap. 
 
Q:  Did you understand he had no money on him at all? 
 
A:  I think in the conversation he said he had hundreds. 
 
Q:  Okay.  So he had hundreds. 
 
A:  He had hundreds, and he needed a five for the skycap. 
 
Q:  What did you do? 
 
A:  I gave him a 20. 
 
Q:  Why? 
 
A:  I said that's all I had.  I didn't have a five. 
 
Q:  Handed him a 20? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Now, how many times before this occasion had Mr. 
Simpson come to your room and asked you for change? 
 
A:  Never. 
 
Q:  So this was the very first time.  Is that right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  You handed him the S20 bill.  Correct? 
 
A:  Yes, I did. 
 
Q:  How many times before had you handed him a S20 bill? 
 
A:  Never. 
 
Q:  This was the first time. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  This was also the first time that he came to your room two 
times in one night.  Right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  And so you gave him the 20, and then what happened? 
 
A:  Before I gave him the 20, I believe I was talking to Tom.  I said 
"Tom, I'll call you back." 
 
Q:  Tom O'Brian? 
 
A:  Tom O'Brian.  So I hung up the phone with Tom, I gave O.J. 
the money, and I believe that's when I invited myself.  He said he 
was going to get a hamburger, and I invited myself to go with him. 
 
Q:  Let me stop you right there. 
 
A:  Okay. 
 
Q:  When he asked for the change or the money for the skycap, at 
that point in time did he say anything about food or going to 
dinner? 
 
A:  He didn't. 
 
Q:  You then went inside--or you were already inside.  Right? 
 
A:  I was inside.  It was--where I gave  him--I think when he came 
to the door, I believe I said to Tom, "I'll call you back," then gave 
him the money- 
 
Q:  Stop.  You hung up the phone. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  I am going to object that you are stopping 
him in the middle of his answers. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Where did you go to get the money? 
 
A:  My drawer.  I had a dresser drawer that I kept the money in.  If 
I didn't have it in my pants, I had it in my dresser drawer. 
 
Q:  And then you took the money, and you went and handed it to 
Mr. Simpson? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Now, he is still standing outside? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And you opened the door? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did you then go outside? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Now the two of you are outside standing face to face? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  How much distance is between you? 
 
A:  Right here (Indicating).  The same as maybe--closer. 
 
Q:  Two or three feet? 
 
A:  Yes 
 
Q:  And he's got black sweats on. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  You handed him the 20.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And what did he then say to you? 
 
A:  That he was going to get a hamburger. 
 
Q:  Did he say he was going to get a hamburger, or did he say he 
was going to eat, or did he say he was going to dinner?  What's 
your best recollection? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS:  I believe it was to get a hamburger, I think it was 
that.  "I'm gonna get something to eat."  I'm going to get a ham"--I 
think it was a hamburger.  I can't remember the exact words. 
 
Q:  Now, as he said to you "I'm going to get a hamburger," did he 
sort of turn to walk away back to the house? 
 
A:  Yeah, somewhat. 
 
Q:  And did you then go back inside? 
 
A:  No.  I think when he said that, I asked if I could go. 
 
Q:  And how did you ask it? 
 
A:  "Hey, can I come along?" 
 
Q:  Had you ever done that before? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Why did you do it on this occasion? 
 
A:  You know, I just did.  I was--I had that sushi, and that was it, 
and I was hungry, and think I just said, "Hey, can I go?  Mind if I 
go along?" 
Then he kind of went, "Yeah, sure." 
 
Q:  That's what his reaction was? 
 
A:  (Nods head.)  And so I thought it was like I shouldn't go, and it 
was revolving maybe around the jacuzzi or whatever, but I sort of 
like invited myself. 
 
Q:  Could you do that again in terms of what his reaction was to 
your invitation to have yourself go to dinner with him? 
 
A:  When he said he was going to get the hamburger, I said, "Hey, 
do you mind if I come along," and in my head I thought it was like 
a pause and, "Sure."  
 
Q:  So there was a hesitation before he responded.  Right? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  And then he goes sort of in a shrugging manner? 
 
Q:  "Sure."  "Sure." It was sort of like-- 
 
Q:  In other words-- 
 
Q:  I felt I invited myself.  I shouldn't have. 
 
Q:  At that point you felt you shouldn't have.  Right? 
 
A:  Yeah.  I didn't know, maybe he wanted to be alone or 
something.  Because, you know, I thought maybe he was feeling 
lonely or something, and he wanted me not to be around. 
 
Q:  Now, at that point in time did he then walk toward the 
residence? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And did he wait for you? 
 
A:  He was in front, but I followed behind him. 
 
Q:  Did he say, "Kato, come with me now"?  Did he turn to you 
and say that? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he wait until you caught up with him? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  So he just walks towards the residence, and you're sort of 
behind him, following.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did he say where you guys were going to go to eat? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he say, "Where would you like to go, Kato?" 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he say, you know, "You should put something else on.  
We're going to go to Dray's"? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he say, "We're going to McDonald's.  You can dress the 
way you are"? 
 
Q:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he say a single thing to you about your arrangements for 
going to dinner now? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he say.  "You drive, Kato"? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Feeling awkward, feeling that you had invited yourself, why 
didn't you just change your mind at that point and say, "O.J. I'll just 
stay home"? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Objection.  Leading. 
Mischaracterizes his testimony. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  You may answer.  Why didn't you just change your mind at 
that point? 
 
A:  I almost thought about changing it.  No, but I didn't, because I 
was already invited and I was already walking and I thought that 
might make it even more uncomfortable, so I just went with it. 
 
Q:  In your dealings with Mr. Simpson, are you typically very 
conscious of your behavior with him? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Are you conscious about not overstepping your bounds with 
him? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  You're conscious about respecting his privacy? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Is that one of the reasons why these feelings stick out in your 
mind? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Now, when Mr. Simpson went ahead without you, where did 
he go? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Objection,  Mischaracterizes the 
testimony. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  When he walked ahead of you-- 
 
A:  It was the back door, the back door of the house.  It's a back 
door.  We went through the bar area, through the kitchen nook area 
to the car.  So I  walked in, got in the passenger side and he got in 
the car, the Bentley --Rolls-Royce-- 
 
Q:  Now, slow down. 
 
A:  Okay. 
 
Q:  I am trying to go step by step.  Mr. Kaelin. 
 
A:  Okay. 
 
Q:  When he went into the house, you then entered the back way?  
You followed behind him? 
 
A:  Yes, I did. 
 
Q:  Did he then come out of the other side of the house? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And which entrance did he come out?  Or exit, I should say. 
 
A:  The exit was the nook door, kitchen nook door. 
 
Q:  Then he went out onto the driveway.  Is that right? 
 
A:  Correct 
 
Q:  Did he set the alarm. 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he ask you to set the alarm? 
 
A:  No 
 
Q:  Now, did he tell you what car you were going to be driving in? 
 
A:  No 
 
Q:  Did you see a Bronco there? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  What cars were in the driveway, or car? 
 
A:  Just the Rolls-Royce, what I saw. 
 
Q:  And looking at Exhibit 27, can you tell me where the Rolls-
Royce was parked? 
 
A:  Here's the driveway (Indicating), and the Rolls-Royce would be 
parked right in this area (Indicating) where normally it would be 
parked in that --it's an open area, and it would be--if it wasn't in 
that entire area, most of it would be in that jetty there (Indicating). 
 
Q:  Is it a Bentley? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay, let's call it a Bentley then.  There is a Bentley parked 
where this indentation occurs on Exhibit 27 on the driveway that 
leads to the Rockingham gate.  Is that right? 
 
A:  That is correct. 
 
Q:  And you then got in what side of the Bentley? 
 
A:  I got in the passenger door.  So I sat in the passenger side, the 
right side. 
 
Q:  And did he have to unlock the door for you? 
 
A:  I think it was open.  I think I got in. 
 
Q:  How did you know that you were going to be going to eat in a 
Bentley? 
 
A:  I didn't know. 
 
Q:  You didn't know. 
 
A:  I just saw that he walked to that car, and I followed. 
 
Q:  So you assumed, because he was heading towards the Bentley, 
that you ought to also head towards the Bentley.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And by this time had he told you where you were going to eat? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Had he asked you what your pleasure was? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  You get in the car and he gets in the car? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Before you drive off now, was there any conversation en route 
to that car? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  No conversation from the moment that you asked him if you 
could go along until--all the way through this point in time, there is 
no conversation.   Is that right? 
 
A:  Up till I got into the car, no, we didn't talk. 
 
Q:  Up to this point in time there is no conversation. 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Now he starts the car up? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And then what does he do? 
 
A:  I believe the gate--he pushed a button and the gate opened.  In 
the car I think he had a remote, and opened the gate, and we took 
off. 
 
Q:  Let me stop you there now.  Which way did the gate open, the 
Rockingham gate, inward or outward? 
 
A:  It opened up inward. 
 
Q:  Did it open to the south side of the property or to the north 
side? 
 
A:  South side. 
 
Q:  Meaning this way (Indicating)? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Or this way (Indicating)? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  I'm not sure it's-- 
 
THE WITNESS:  My recollection is that it does open south. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Now, when he pulled out of that driveway and he pulled the 
Bentley past the point of the gate-- 
Are you with me? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  --did he stop and wait until the gate was completely closed 
before he left? 
 
A:  I don't believe so, no. 
 
Q:  Did he say, "Kato, let's make sure Chachi doesn't run out of the 
gate"? Yes or no. 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Was there any discussion about the dog Chachi at this point in 
time? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Your recollection is that he pulls out onto the driveway--I mean 
out of the gate and then begins to turn and take off.  Right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  And there is no hesitation or waiting other than to look for 
traffic? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Now, is it your--You've ridden in the passenger seats of cars 
before.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  When people are driving you around? 
 
A:  (Nods head.) 
 
Q:  Is that right? 
 
A:  I have. 
 
Q:  Are you fairly conscious of the traffic around you? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  When you are in the passenger seat, you sort of look both ways 
for oncoming traffic? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Kind of a habit of yours? 
 
A:  Uh-huh. 
 
Q:  You have to answer audibly. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  When you came out of this driveway, which --the Rockingham 
driveway now--Withdrawn. 
What time of the evening is it, to the best of your recollection, 
when you got in that Bentley and headed towards that Rockingham 
gate? 
 
A:  It's about 9:10. 
 
Q:  P.M.? 
 
A:  9:10 p.m. 
 
Q:  Dark out? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  When you pulled out of the Rockingham gate, which way did 
Mr. Simpson turn? 
 
A:  Out of the Rockingham gate, we made a left. 
 
Q:  Onto Rockingham. 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Now, when you pulled out of that  Rockingham gate, you were 
sitting in the passenger seat, and you had a window to your right.  
Correct? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  And there wasn't anything covering that window, was there? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you look out the window to see if cars were coming? 
 
A:  I believe I did. 
 
Q:  Now, right to the right--Withdrawn.  Did you see the Bronco 
parked right on the other side of the Rockingham gate? 
 
A:  Best of my recollection.  I did not. 
 
Q:  Now let me show you a photograph of the Bronco where it was 
found. 
We will have to mark this as the next exhibit in order.  There is 
another one that's a close-up.  Let me see it. 
Let me show you an exhibit--a photograph of the Bronco, which 
we will mark as the next exhibit in order, which is Plaintiffs' 
Exhibit 81, I believe, Michael, 78,-9 and 80? 
 
MR. BREWER:  78, 79, 80 and 81. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  This will be Plaintiffs' 81, and I will have 
copies made. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Okay. 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit was marked for identification by the reporter 
and is attached hereto.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  I have placed in front of you Plaintiffs' 81.  Do you recognize 
the automobile depicted in that photograph? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  What is it? 
 
A:  It's a Ford Bronco, O.J.'s Ford Bronco . 
 
Q:  You see where it's parked on the Rockingham Street there? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And it's right next to what gate? 
 
A:  Next to the Rockingham gate. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Now, when you came out with the Bentley at 
approximately 9:10 p.m.  on June 12 and when you looked to the 
right to see if there was any oncoming traffic before Mr. Simpson 
turned left, did you see the Bronco there where it is currently 
parked and positioned in this photograph? 
 
A:  I don't believe I did.  I probably would have seen it if it was 
parked so close, because I would have looked.  I would have 
noticed that. 
 
Q:  And you didn't notice it. 
 
A:  I did not. 
 
Q:  Now, as of this point in time, had Mr. Simpson told you where 
you were going? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  So when he made that left on Rockingham, you had no idea 
where you were going.  Is that right? 
 
A:  That is correct. 
 
Q:  Did there come a time in the ride that ensued when he told you 
where you were going? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you ask where you were going? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you make a suggestion as to where to go? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  And is one of the reasons because you felt awkward enough 
being there already? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Felt maybe you had overstepped your bounds? 
 
A:  Well, I felt as if it wasn't up to me to say, "Hey, let's go here."  
It wasn't my call to make.  I invited myself, so I wasn't going to 
say, "Oh, O.J.  let 's go to this restaurant."  It was his call.  So 
wherever the car was taking us, I was there for the ride. 
 
Q:  When did you discover where you were going to eat? 
 
A:  When we pulled into McDonald's. 
 
Q:  So Mr. Simpson at no time asked you what you would like to 
eat.  Right? 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  Did he even ask you whether you even liked the food at 
McDonald's? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Had you ever been to McDonald's with Mr. Simpson before? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  By the way, do you like McDonald's' food? 
 
A:  Not really.  I don't go very--very  rare. 
 
Q:  Okay.  When you saw him pulling into a McDonald's, did you 
say to him, "You know, I'd prefer to go someplace else? 
 
A:  No, I didn't.  I didn't, but that's what I was thinking. 
 
Q:  You were thinking that you wanted to go someplace else-- 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  --but you didn't tell him. 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  Now, what McDonald's did you go to? 
 
A:  It was on Santa Monica, and I remember it being across from a 
Carl's Jr. The address, I don't know, but I remember seeing a Carl's 
Jr. 
 
Q:  Did you go inside the restaurant? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  What did you do? 
 
A:  It was the drive-through.  We ordered and went to the drive-
through, and then we had to pick up the food. 
 
Q:  Was there a line there? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  How long did it take to get there? 
 
A:  I remember looking at the clock on the car.  At 26th and San 
Vicente there was a stoplight, and I remember it being 9:15 to 
9:18.  It was one of those analog, and I thought it was like 9:15 or 
9:18.  So I imagine from there to get to McDonald's was probably 
9:20 or-- 
 
Q:  Thereabouts. 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  When Mr. Simpson pulled in--pulled up to the drive-up 
window, did he ask you what you wanted, or did you just say what 
you wanted? 
 
Q:  I think I shouted what it was that I wanted to the intercom.  I 
think I said what I wanted. 
 
Q:  In other words, he didn't say.  "Kato, what do you want?" and 
then related to the person.  You just said yourself what you wanted. 
 
A:  I think I did. 
 
Q:  What did you say? 
 
A:  I had the chicken.  Chicken, fries and large orange soda. 
 
Q:  And what did Mr. Simpson order? 
 
A:  I think it was the Big Mac.  It was the big hamburger sandwich. 
 
Q:  The Big Mac. 
 
A:  Yeah.  I thought maybe fries, and I think that was it.  It could 
have been maybe just a Big Mac. 
 
Q:  Just the Big Mac. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  If you recall. 
 
THE WITNESS:  If I recall.  But I remember him eating it. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Huh? 
 
A:  I just remember the sandwich being eaten fast. 
 
Q:  By whom 
 
A:  O.J. After-- 
 
MR. PLOTKIN:  I think the question that's on the table is:  What 
was the sandwich? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  He said it was a Big Mac. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN:  Are you sure? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  No, that's not where we got off.  We got off 
on whether it was just the Big Mac or Big Mac and fries, and I 
think that's where he was a  little unsure 
 
THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  For sure I know it was the large 
hamburger sandwich. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Okay.  Large hamburger that McDonald's sells. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Are you familiar with their menu? 
 
A:  I know they have like Quarter Pounder and a Big Mac.  I don't 
know if it was the Quarter Pounder or the Big Mac. 
 
Q:  And then you--who paid? 
 
A:  I paid. 
 
Q:  Why? 
 
A:  I felt like I owed him, you know, for staying there.  I should 
pay for the dinner. 
 
Q:  For staying where? 
 
A:  For staying at the house.  You know, the least I could do was 
like, "Let me at least pay for the dinner."  It was one of those 
gestures.  So I gave him another 20. 
 
Q:  How many times before this evening had you ever paid for 
dinner before? 
 
A:  Never. 
 
Q:  How many times had you ever gone to McDonald's with Mr. 
Simpson before? 
 
Q:  Never. 
 
Q:  How many times before this evening on June 12 had you ever 
gone to dinner alone with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A:  Never. 
 
Q:  What money did you give Mr. Simpson? 
 
Q:  I had another 20, and I gave him a 20. 
 
Q:  You handed it to him? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And he handed it to the person? 
 
A:  Yes, he did. 
 
Q:  Did you get the change back? 
 
A:  He got the change and gave me the change. 
 
Q:  Now, did the food come in one bag or two bags? 
 
A:  One bag. 
 
Q:  And who kept the bag. 
 
A:  I believe O.J. did. 
 
Q:  And what did he do with your food? 
 
A:  He had tossed it at me, sort of like saying in a joking way, 
"Sorry about this," and he tossed the food at me. 
 
Q:  Sorry about this" and tossed you-- 
 
A:  "Sorry about doing this to you," and it was like fries, soda and 
chicken in my lap. 
 
Q:  With no bag. 
 
A:  No bag. 
 
Q:  And no tray. 
 
Q:  No tray. 
 
Q:  All in your lap. 
 
A:  Yes.  And then he drove off. 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Now, between the house, when you left the house in the 
Bentley, and McDonald's, did you guys go anywhere else, or did 
you go directly to McDonald's? 
 
A:  Directly to McDonald's. 
 
Q:  When he left McDonald's.  Did he come directly back to 
Rockingham. 
 
A:  To the house, yes. 
 
Q:  Both trips, no stops. 
 
A:  No stops. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Stops at locations, not obvious stop 
signs?. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  In other words, you didn't stop to go anyplace else-- 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  --or talk to anyone? 
 
A:  No.  Right back home. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Now, did you eat your food in the car on the way back? 
 
A:  No.  I think I had like one or two French fries that I took. 
 
Q:  Any reason why you didn't eat there in the car? 
 
A:  That it was I shouldn't eat in the car, anyways.  It was his 
Bentley, and I wasn't going to eat in the car. 
 
Q:  You didn't want to spill anything.  Right? 
 
A:  Yeah.  No, I didn't want to spill.  I just didn't want to eat in the 
car.  I thought I'd make crumbs and that sort of thing, and I didn't 
want to. 
 
Q:  And did Mr. Simpson eat his hamburger? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did he eat it slowly or quickly? 
 
Q:  I think he ate it before we left McDonald's.  It was like 
immediate. 
 
Q:  Like 10 seconds, it was down? 
 
A:  10--yeah, it was right out of the parking lot and it was gone. 
 
Q:  Okay.  When he ate that hamburger within a matter of seconds-
- 
 
MR. SIMPSON:  Oh, Jesus. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Wait. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Excuse me, please-- 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Why don't we take a quick break, a five-
minute break. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  I don't want to take a break.  I just--Okay, we 
have to take a break.  The tape-- 
 
MR. PLOTKIN:  We have to take a break anyway. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  This is the end of tape No. 1.  The time 
is approximately 11:49, and we are off the record. 
(Recess.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are on the record.  The time is 
approximately 11:59.   This is the beginning of tape No.  2. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  We had to switch videotapes.  Mr. Kaelin.  When--on the way 
home, you were telling me Mr. Simpson had eaten his hamburger 
very quickly,  almost before he even left the parking lot.  Is that 
right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And you didn't eat during the ride home.  Right? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did Mr. Simpson tell you that the reason he was eating his 
hamburger in the car was because he had to get someplace or was 
in a hurry? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he give you any reason why he was eating in the car and 
not at home? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he say anything to you about that? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  What did he do with the bag? 
 
A:  I remember having my orange drink, and I am pretty positive I 
said --I asked him if I could have a straw.  So I thought the bag was 
in his lap and I think I got the straw from him. 
 
Q:  You mean he didn't use the straw. 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  And he had kept the straw in the bag? 
 
A:  I imagined the straw was in the bag, and I think I was asking, 
"Can I have a straw?" 
 
Q:  Did you feel a little uncomfortable asking for the straw? 
 
A:  Well, it was one of those things that the food was in my lap, 
and I thought--we weren't really talking in the car, so I thought that 
would break it, and I just said, "Hey, can I have a straw?" 
 
Q:  And what did he do? 
 
A:  I think he gave me the straw I think he gave me a straw. 
 
Q:  What did you do with the straw? 
 
A:  Just put it--I put it--I don't think I put it in the drink yet.  I think 
I waited, because it was going to puncture.  The juice might come 
out, the orange soda. 
 
Q:  The orange soda might come out and would spill? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  And you wanted to avoid that? 
 
A:  Yeah .  So I waited to pop it.  Pretty  sure. 
 
Q:  Can you tell the route you took from Rockingham to 
McDonald's? 
 
A:  It was a left out of McDonald's, I think, and then straight up 
that road, whatever that--I think it's--, 
 
Q:  Left on what? 
 
A:  Out of the parking lot of McDonald's. 
 
Q:  No.  From Rockingham to McDonald's. 
 
A:  Oh, okay.  It was a left out of Rockingham, and Rockingham 
takes you to San Vicente, and then all the way to Santa Monica to 
McDonald's. 
 
Q:  Left or right on Santa Monica? 
 
A:  I believe it's a left. 
 
Q:  Did you go back home in the exact same way? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And when you came back home to Rockingham, you were then 
coming north on Rockingham? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  And which gate did Mr. Simpson use to enter the property? 
 
A:  I'm pretty positive it was Ashford. 
 
Q:  And he pulled in, and what did he do with the Bronco? 
 
A:  It was-- 
 
Q:  Or the Bentley, I mean.  I'm sorry. 
 
A:  The Bentley.  We parked it back in that spot-- 
 
Q:  What spot? 
 
A:  --that it's normally parked in. 
 
Q:  What is your best recollection of how much time transpired in 
this whole journey to and from McDonald's? 
 
A:  Getting home at about 9:35, 9:40. 
 
Q:  Let me show you some phone records, see if that will refresh 
your recollection. 
Now, your phone records indicate a call at 9:37 p.m. on June 12 to 
a number [Telephone number deleted].  Is that your friend Tom 
O'Brian? 
 
A:  That's Tom's number. 
 
Q:  And did you call Tom O'Brian after you got back home from 
McDonald's? 
 
A:  Yes, I did. 
 
Q:  So you were obviously home before 9:37 p.m.  Right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  What time do you think you pulled into the Rockingham 
property after McDonald's? 
 
A:  I would say it would be about 9:33. 
 
Q:  About four or five minutes before? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  Now, so you were gone a total of about 15-20 minutes.  
Correct? 
 
Q:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Now.  during that 15-, 20-minute period was there a lot of 
discussion between Mr. Simpson and you? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Would you say there was very little? 
 
A:  Yes.  There was conversation about, "So you got a flight.  So 
you're going to Chicago.  What airline," and I think that's sort of it. 
 
Q:  So you asked some questions.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  "You got a flight?"  Is that what you asked? 
 
A:  Yeah.  Oh, and also.  "You look tired," and all that.  "You 
should get a nap." 
 
Q:  "You got a flight.  You're going to Chicago.  You should take a 
nap."  Anything else did you say? 
 
A:  I don't think so. 
 
Q:  Now, did Mr. Simpson ask you a single question during this 
trip to and from McDonald's? 
 
A:  Not that I remember, no. 
 
Q:  At any point during this trip to and from McDonald's, did he 
initiate conversation on any topic? 
 
A:  Not that I remember, no, nothing. 
 
Q:  Did he respond to your questions? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did he respond with short or long answers? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Object as vague. 
 
THE WITNESS:  Short. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Very short? 
 
A:  Short answers. 
 
Q:  Did you feel that he pretty much didn't want to talk? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And at some point did you stop talking? 
 
A:  Yes, 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Object.  Leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Did you? 
 
Q:  I wasn't trying to force any more conversation, so-- 
 
Q:  Why did you stop trying to force conversation? 
 
A:  Because I felt --I've talked to people before and I think I'm a 
fair judge of when someone doesn't want to talk, through other 
communicating skills with people, that maybe I was talking too 
much and I would just shut up, would be the best thing to do. 
 
Q:  And so that's what you decided to do. 
 
A:  Not to talk, right. 
 
Q:  Did Mr. Simpson say to you.  "Look, we'll go inside and eat 
when we get home"? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Or, "Go listen to some music"? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Or, "Let's go someplace else after this"? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he make any plans to spend time with you for the rest of 
that evening? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he ask you to do anything with him? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he ask you to go anyplace with him? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he ask whether you were available to do anything? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you have any sense of why he wasn't talking? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Objection.  Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS:  I don't think I had a sense.  It was just one of 
those--I could see that it was--I called it kind of in thought.  So it 
was just a drive, and so he was thinking about something.  He was 
just in thought and-- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Quiet? 
 
A:  Quiet.   So I didn't want to disrupt it.  If there was thought 
going on, it was like okay, and knew not to be talking anymore, but 
it was definitely my feeling that he was in deep thought. 
 
Q:  Now, when you came back from McDonald's and you pull in 
and he parks the Bentley in the same place where it was before and 
you're sitting in the  passenger seat, you still have the drink, the 
chicken sandwich and the French fries in your lap without a bag 
and with a straw.  Is that right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did he offer--And he had finished his hamburger.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Now, did he offer to help you with the food? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he say "Here, let me help you take that food inside"? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he get the door for you so that you could get out without 
fumbling the food? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you open the door yourself? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  When you opened the door--it was the passenger door.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes, it was. 
 
Q:  And you got up, and you had this food.  Right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  And then you closed the door? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Was it awkward trying to carry these items without a bag? 
 
A:  Yeah.  I had a full load of items.  I think I probably pushed the 
door shut with my hip. 
 
Q:  What did you then do? 
 
A:  I walked to the kitchen nook. 
 
Q:  Now, did you walk at a brisk pace? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And you walked directly to the kitchen door to his home.  
Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Now, you didn't have a key. 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  And the only way you could have opened that door is if he 
opened it.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Now, when you walked to that kitchen door, how many feet 
from the Bentley was that door? 
 
A:  The Bentley would be-- 
 
Q:  Referring to Exhibit 7, the Bentley is in this little alcove 
(Indicating).  Right? 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  Where is the door to the kitchen? 
 
A:  The door to the kitchen is right here (Indicating). 
 
Q:  Between the entrance door and the garage.  Right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  How many feet is that, approximately? 
 
A:  It's about 15 feet. 
 
Q:  Could it be more than 15? 
 
A:  15 to 20. 
 
Q:  Okay.  When you got to the door, was it your expectation that 
you were going to be going inside the door into the house? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And it was your expectation that he would be with you to let 
you in.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And was it your expectation when you got to the door that he 
would be right behind you? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And was he right behind you when you got to the door? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  And how do you know? 
 
A:  Because I was at the door at the nook, and I thought he was 
behind me, so I looked and I saw him at the door of the car. 
 
Q:  So were you surprised when you didn't see him behind you? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And were you surprised when you saw him at the door of the 
Bentley? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Was he inside the Bentley or outside the Bentley? 
 
A:  Outside. 
 
Q:  Was he standing up? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Was he scooping lettuce into a bag? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Was he cleaning the floor of his Bentley? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Was he cleaning anything? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  He was just standing up. 
 
A:  Standing up. 
 
Q:  What did he wear on this trip to McDonald's? 
 
A:  I remember it being the same black suit from the trip from the 
jacuzzi door and the second time, that same outfit. 
 
Q:  Do you know for a fact what he was wearing on his feet? 
 
A:  I do not. 
 
Q:  Do you know what he was wearing? 
 
A:  No, I don't. 
 
Q:  No recollection of the shoes at this time. 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Now, when you walked into--when you walked to the door of 
the kitchen and surprised that he wasn't behind you and surprised 
to see him at the Bentley door-- 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Objection. 
Mischaracterizes his testimony. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  --what did you then do? 
 
A:  Well, I figured that he was going to be behind me at the door 
because I knew there was a flight coming up, and I looked--I 
thought we were going into the house together, so I looked and I 
saw that he wasn't there and I went, "Okay." I was like, "I shouldn't 
be here.  I should go to my room."  So I just turned around and 
went "Going to my room." 
 
Q:  You made a motion to him, "I am going to my room"? 
 
A:  Well, I had my food.  I went, "Going to the room.  I'm going to 
the room." 
 
Q:  You were holding the food with two hands? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  And you turned to him and said, "I'm"-- 
 
A:  I looked at him, and he was still at the door of the car, and I 
said "Okay," like I wasn't supposed to be going to that door, so I 
went, "I'll go  to my room." 
 
Q:  Did he say anything to you? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he say.  "Good-bye, Kato"? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  "Good night, Kato"? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  "Glad you could join me for dinner"? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  "Thanks for coming with me"? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he say anything else? 
 
A:  No . 
 
Q:  Did he say anything to you? 
 
A:  That was it. 
 
Q:  Nothing.  Was he just standing there? 
 
A:  Yes 
 
Q:  What was he doing? 
 
A:  He was just standing there. 
 
Q:  Was he looking at you? 
 
A:  Looking at me when I was at the door of the nook and then I--
when I said "Bye," that was-- 
"I'm going to my room," that was it, so-- 
 
Q:  So when you last saw Mr. Simpson-- 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  You cut him off. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Excuse me.  Had you finished your answer? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  When you last saw Mr. Simpson as you headed on towards 
your room, he was standing near the Bentley.  Is that right? 
 
A:  At the door of the Bentley. 
 
Q:  And you did not see him take a walk in the direction of the 
house.  Is that right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  You did not even see him take a step in that direction.  Is that 
right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Nor did he say anything to you to indicate he was going in the 
house.  Right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  One reason that stands out in your mind is that you were 
surprised he wasn't right behind you when you went to the door of 
his house.  Is that right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Objection.  Leading. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Excuse me. 
 
THE WITNESS:  Yes, I was figuring he was going in the house, I 
thought he was behind me, because I was walking fast and I didn't 
even realize it, so that's when I looked and I was surprised that he 
was at the door of the car. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Okay, Now-- 
 
A:  That's when I went to my room. 
 
Q:  When you went to your room, you then went by the entrance to 
the kitchen--excuse me. 
 
A:  Kitchen there (Indicating). 
 
Q:  Yeah, right here (Indicating).  And you walked on the driveway 
past the entranceway of the house.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And then onto that path.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Now, when you walked past this entranceway, did you see any 
golf clubs there? 
 
A:  I don't remember seeing any golf clubs. 
 
Q:  Did you see anything there? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  And then you walked down the path and into--around the house 
and into your room.  Right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  And then you put your stuff down?  What did you do? 
 
A:  I think the first thing I did, I did put my stuff, I started eating, 
but I think I called Tom back and was eating and just said.  "Hey, 
just went to  McDonald's and"-- 
 
Q:  That call is at 9:37 p.m. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And it took you maybe four or five minutes to get out of the 
Bentley and do the walk to your house. 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Objection.  Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS:  It was around that time, yeah. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  About how long? 
 
A:  From the time we got back, in that three to four minutes, and I 
went right to my room, so I imagine I called Tom immediately. 
 
Q:  When you went into your room, did you see any lights go on in 
the Rockingham residence? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you hear any sounds in the Rockingham residence? 
 
Q:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you have any indication or notion that Mr. Simpson was in 
the residence? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he yell "Kato" again to you for the rest of that evening? 
 
Q:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he come to your room again? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he come to your room and give you change? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Pay back the $5 or the S20? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  When he went to McDonald's, did he break change for the 
hundred dollar bills that he had? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he offer to repay you the 20 at that point? 
 
A:  No. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Okay, we can break now. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Okay. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are going off the record now, and

time is approximately 1:22. 
 
EXAMINATION (Resumed) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Okay, we are back from lunch now, Mr. Kaelin. 
I think I asked you this before, but let me just go back to it for a 
minute; make sure I understand your answer.  What was the 
amount of time between the visit Mr. Simpson made to your room 
about the jacuzzi and then the subsequent visit about skycap 
change? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Asked and answered. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  You may answer. 
 
A:  I had thought that it was happening within a one-to-five-minute 
period, so it happened in between that time.  It seemed pretty quick 
that he came back. 
 
Q:  I see.  And the first time that he came, you never got off the 
phone to talk to him.  Right? 
 
A:  I think I might have put the phone on the bed, but I did talk to 
him.  There was communication with him.  But it was about the 
jacuzzi.  So it could have been, you know, putting the phone on the 
bed and then going towards the door to talk. 
 
Q:  Extremely brief communication? 
 
A:  It was--the dialogue was about the jacuzzi jets and that he said 
he had turned them--I  thought I turned them off, but he said he had 
turned them off, and then walking back to the room and saying 
about the cookout, "Get" --"Call Susan back for the cookout." 
 
Q:  Did you believe that you had turned the jacuzzi jets off? 
 
A:  I thought I did. 
 
Q:  Okay.  When you went back to your room, what did you do?  
You called Tom O'Brian, and then what did you do after that? 
 
A:  Are we going from when I went back to my room from 
McDonald's? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A:  I went to call Tom back. 
 
Q:  Right. 
 
A:  And I called him, and I think I was eating my food while I was 
on the phone with him. 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
A:  And we were just having casual conversation.  Said, "Hey, I 
just went to McDonald's with O.J.," and we kinda laughed. 
 
Q:  And then what did you do? 
 
A:  I think I hung up with Tom, and I was gonna do this typing. 
One of the things that just comes to my mind now, part of the 
conversation also in McDonald's was that I mentioned about using 
a typewriter that was in the office; that now it just came back to my 
memory, so that's why I'm bringing it back up.  I had said in the car 
drive, "Is it okay to use the typewriter?" 
And that typewriter is the one that after I talked to Tom, I was 
going to type up resumes.  So there was an IBM electric typewriter 
in that office area, and I tried to make it work, and it wasn't 
working. 
 
Q:  You told Mr. Simpson that after McDonald's, that you would 
be typing resumes in your room, in that office area off your room? 
 
A:  I told him on the drive, the McDonald's drive. 
 
Q:  That? 
 
A:  If it would be okay to use that typewriter.  And he had said, "It 
was Nicole's typewriter.  Go ahead." 
 
Q:  Did you tell him when you were going to use the typewriter? 
 
A:  I didn't give a time, no, but if it was okay to use it.  I knew it 
was in the office, because I thought I would type up resumes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Go back to your room then.  You were saying? 
 
A:  I hung up with Tom, and I think, by trying to make the 
typewriter work, I figured out that it wasn't working, so I said, 
"Okay, might as well call Rachel."  It was just a friend that I called. 
 
Q:  What is her last name?  
 
A:  Rachel Ferrara. 
 
Q:  Was she your girlfriend at the time? 
 
A:  It wasn't my girlfriend, but we had gone out a few times, but it 
wasn't a set girlfriend at all. 
 
Q:  You called Rachel? 
 
A:  I called Rachel and said, "Oh, you know, I was trying to type 
these resumes" and I was explaining to her, you know, how this 
typewriter wasn't working, and I was putting into the outlets:  and 
while she was on the phone I said, "Watch." I was  explaining to 
her, shouting to her, going, "See, I'm trying it here and it's not 
working, and it's not working here."  And there were a few outlets I 
was trying, and I'd make I joke about it and go back on the phone 
with her. 
 
Q:  You had laid the phone down-- 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  --as far as it could go? 
 
A:  I was kind of pulling it, and it couldn't go any further, and 
when I saw it couldn't go any further, I kinda put it down. 
 
Q:  It wasn't a cordless phone. 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  And then you were sort of yelling into the phone? 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  From wherever you were.  Right? 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  Trying to find an outlet? 
 
A:  Yeah.  And, you know-- 
 
Q:  Acting kind of goofy.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And then-- 
 
A:  You said that too convincing. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  I'd object on leading grounds, but I've 
never heard that question before. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Now, had you seen Rachel Ferrara previous that day? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Had you seen her the night before? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  What were you doing the night before, on Saturday? 
 
A:  I believe the night before, on Saturday night, I think I was 
probably at a bar/restaurant called Rebecca's, and I probably went 
with a buddy of mine.  Dan, and just hung out there. 
 
Q:  And not with Rachel, though.  Right? 
 
A:  No, no.  It was just buddies and-- 
 
Q:  Who is Dan? 
 
A:  Dan would be a friend of mine.  Dan Frisch, who was a buddy 
of mine, who I think I went---we used to go there together.  We 
used to hang out there. 
 
Q:  Now getting back to this evening of June 12 in your room with 
Rachel on the line, was that a long telephone call? 
 
A:  Yes.  There was--there was quite a few phone calls to Rachel 
that night, but the one that was towards the 10:00 o'clock hour, 
which I think it was, was the conversation that ended up going 
pretty much throughout the entire night with the interruptions. 
 
Q:  Now, Rachel--where did Rachel live? 
 
A:  She lived in Palms. 
 
Q:  So that was a local call.  Right? 
 
A:  Yeah.  it was a (310) call. 
 
Q:  Did you at any time while you were talking to Rachel on the 
phone hear Mr. Simpson? 
 
A:  No 
 
Q:  Did you see him? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he call you? 
 
A:  No 
 
Q:  On the phone.  This is before you went outside. 
 
A:  Okay.  No. 
 
Q:  Did you see anyone? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you know whether he was home? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you know where he had gone when you had last seen him 
standing at the Bentley? 
 
A:  No.  That's the last I saw:  At the Bentley 
 
Q:  Did you know--Could you see if any lights were on in the 
house from where your room was? 
 
A:  I could probably tell.  I thought the bedroom light was on-- 
 
Q:  Upstairs? 
 
A:  In the upstairs. 
 
Q:  So you're on this pretty long phone call with Rachel. 
 
A:  Correct 
 
Q:  And then did anything happen? 
 
A:  Yeah.  Somewhere in the phone call, I was up against my bed, 
my back to it-- 
 
Q:  Your back against the wall? 
 
A:  Towards the wall of my--of the bed, talking to her-- 
 
Q:  Right. 
 
A:  --and that there was a noise, and the noise was a noise that 
moved the picture, and I said, "Did we have an earthquake?" 
And the noise was as if a body hit the back of a wall, and the 
picture moved, and it was like a thickness--a thick noise that 
moved it, and it was --I don't know if I can stand up or not.  but-- 
 
MR. PLOTKIN:  Stand up. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Can the video follow  Mr. Kaelin? 
 
Q:  Go ahead.  Keep your voice up. 
 
A:  So I thought it was something like a (Sound), like in that order, 
a (Sound), and it moved the picture on my wall.  And the picture 
on the wall--I said to Rachel immediately, "Did we just have an 
earthquake?" 
And she goes, "No."  I said, "This noise I just heard, my picture 
moved next to the bed." I said.  "It's so weird that this thing"--you 
know, I was trying to convince myself earthquake, but I started 
thinking there was something back there or someone back there,  
and that was--because it moved the picture, and then I got scared. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Rod, did you get that?  Did you get the 
sound? 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  (Nods head.) 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Okay. 
 
Q:  When you demonstrated the noise against the wall, you had to 
keep your microphone on the table and it didn't reach, so I just was 
curious if the  sound got picked up. 
 
A:  Now, this sound, this noise that you heard as though a body 
was falling against the outside of the wall, did this frighten you? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Mischaracterizes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Was it kind of a violent shaking? 
 
A:  It was in a shaky--the picture moved, so it was a noise that it 
definitely got my attention, and I felt there was something back--
someone back there.  It was powerful enough to move the picture.  
That's what caused me to say about the earthquake.  In my head I 
think I was realizing it wasn't an earthquake, but the belief that 
Rachel might say, "Yeah, we just had," kind of thing, but she didn't 
and... 
 
Q:  You intellectually concluded it was not an earthquake at that 
point.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Amond--And you also saw that there was nothing else in the 
room on the other side of that wall that moved.  Right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  And the ground wasn't moving underneath you.  Right? 
 
A:  No.  My back was against that.  That's where I felt the 
vibrating, so I didn't--that's what caused it more me asking the 
question about the earthquake to her. 
 
Q:  I see.  But after you quickly ruled out earthquake, you then 
believed there was someone on the other side of that wall.  Is that 
right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And you decided that for your own safety, you'd better go 
check? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Now let's take a look at some photographs of your room.  I am 
going to mark as the next exhibit in order, Exhibit 82, a picture of 
your room with the door leading to the bathroom, I believe, and 
then a picture of the other side of your room.  Well, actually I'm 
not sure. 
 
A:  This would be the office, not the bathroom (Indicating). 
 
Q:  Let me start all over again, okay, because I messed that up.  
Exhibit 82 will be a picture of your room that shows the door 
leading to the office, and Exhibit 83 will be a picture of your room 
that shows the other side of the room with the door leading to the 
bathroom.   Okay? 82 and 83. 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibits 82 and 83 were marked for identification by 
the reporter and are attached hereto.) 
 
MR. PLOTKIN:  We have a copy of what I believe is 82.  Can we 
have 83? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Let Mr. Kaelin work off the originals. 
 
Q:  Looking at Exhibit 82, does that show your room at the time? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Is that the way it looked that evening of June 12? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  And that door leads to where? 
 
A:  That door would lead into the office, and these stairs at the 
office (Indicating) would lead into the house, the main house. 
 
Q:  And is there another door on the other side of that office that 
leads to the main house? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And that's the door that remains locked.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Now, there is a picture--there is a bed against the wall.  Right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  And it has like a white headboard? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Is that what that color is? 
 
A:  Yeah, it's like egg white. 
 
Q:  Egg white.  Okay.  And you were laying on that bed.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And the phone is on the left side.  Correct? 
 
A:  Yes.  Yes, it is. 
 
Q:  On the side closest to the picture.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And that's where it was that night. 
 
A:  Yes.  That--  
 
Q:  And were you lying closer to the left side of the room? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Did you want to finish your answer on 
the phone? 
 
THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  My phone was on the left, but it might 
have been--that's not my phone in that picture.  I believe.  My 
phone was a different phone.  But I was on the left talking.  The 
phone would normally be propped up on that table. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  What I am trying to find out is:  Because, the phone was 
normally propped up on that table, would you have been more 
situated on the left side of the bed than the right side? 
 
A:  Yes.  Yes, I would. 
 
Q:  And your back was against the headboard? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  On the left side of the bed with your feet propped up? 
 
A:  Yeah.  My feet I think were somewhat hanging off this side 
(Indicating)-- 
 
Q:  The left side? 
 
A:  --propped up.  Yeah.  I wasn't putting my feet so much on the 
quilt. 
 
Q:  And was your head against the headboard or against the wall 
above the headboard? 
 
A:  On the headboard. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Now, is this a pretty thick exterior wall? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Do you know what it's made out of? 
 
A:  The wall right here (Indicating)? 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
A:  That's wood. 
 
Q:  Do you know if there is any concrete on the other side? 
 
A:  I believe it's concrete on the other side. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And then there is a picture right above the night stand 
where the telephone is.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes, there is. 
 
Q:  And the picture depicted in Exhibit 82 is of what?  Can you 
tell? 
 
A:  You mean what is it a picture of? 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
A:  I can't tell from that shot what it is.  It's a picture in a frame. 
 
Q:  Same picture? 
 
A:  Yeah, it looks like the exact same picture. 
 
Q:  Now, to the right of the bed is a lamp, right, and you can see 
that in Exhibit 83.  Correct? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  And to the right of the lamp is an air conditioner.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  So the air conditioner is actually located on the opposite side of 
the bed from where the picture is.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And it's about how many feet between the air conditioner and 
the picture? What's your best estimate? 
 
A:  Looks like about eight feet. 
 
Q:  And the air conditioner is what, at eye level? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  And can you describe to us, by looking at exhibits 82 and 83, 
where that loud sound was that you heard on the wall? 
 
A:  The loud sound I heard on the wall would be more right here 
(Indicating).  It happened right about there-- 
 
Q:  The center of the bed? 
 
A:  Towards the center, the beginning of it, and it kinda finished up 
maybe a foot and a half more there (Indicating) then. 
 
Q:  Hold on.  Let me just--let's try this again.  I want to be real 
precise here. 
 
A:  Okay. 
 
Q:  You think that you first heard this noise around the center of 
the headboard? 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  And then it kind of migrated towards the left? 
 
A:  On the third one .  The noises were boom, boom, boom, like 
that, and the third one was probably a foot off from the original.  It 
seemed like it was hitting a patter, like a boom, boom, boom. 
 
Q:  With the noise going in what direction? 
Air conditioner to phone?  Air conditioner to the picture? 
 
A:  Yeah, air conditioner to the picture. 
 
Q:  And did the noise--could you tell where on the wall the noise 
appeared to sound? 
 
A:  Yeah.  It was probably right where that arrow would be 
pointing behind there.  It would be-- 
 
Q:  What height? 
 
A:  Oh, okay.  It would be right--it's  about five feet. 
 
Q:  You tell me. 
 
A:  It would be--So if my back is up against the headboard, I can 
just point to you where I heard the noise. 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
A:  It would be right about there (Indicating). 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  The witness is pointing to near the top of the 
headboard in sort of the center, a little to the left of center. 
 
Q:  Is that right? 
 
A:  Yeah.  Yes, it is. 
 
Q:  On the air conditioning side. 
 
A:  (Nods head.) 
 
Q:  Now, you said the picture moved.  Okay? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  How many--how much did the picture move? 
 
A:  It moved at least six inches.  It tilted completely. 
 
Q:  Tilted completely. 
 
A:  Yes, the picture tilted. 
 
Q:  In what direction did it tilt? 
 
A:  It tilted--the picture would have gone that way (Indicating). 
 
Q:  So the bottom part of the picture, did it go towards the bed or 
away from the bed? 
 
A:  My recollection it was away from the bed.  That part went 
towards the bed (Indicating). 
 
Q:  The top went towards and the bottom went away. 
After you asked Rachel about the earthquake and she said no, what 
did you then do? 
 
A:  I remember part of my dialogue was telling her that I was 
going to investigate it, and I knew that there was a pen flashlight in 
my drawer next to the bed. 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
A:  And in talking to her, I had said.  "I'm going to go and check on 
that noise.   
And she was going, "No.  Come over.  Come over." 
I said, "No.  I'm going to check on this noise," and then I said, "But 
if I don't call you back in 10 minutes, start to worry.  Call the 
police."  It  was some joke--in a joking manner I said It. 
 
Q:  Now, you were joking with her.  Right? 
 
A:  I was joking, but it was a nervous joke, and then she said, "Oh, 
no, I'm going to start to worry now." 
 
Q:  But you were genuinely frightened? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Objection, leading. 
 
THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I was afraid to go back, but I was gonna 
do it. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Were you or were you not afraid? 
 
A:  I was afraid but playing the role that I wasn't afraid, but it--the 
real feeling inside was I was afraid. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And where did you get a flashlight? 
 
A:  In the drawer right here (Indicating). 
 
Q:  What kind of flashlight was it? 
 
A:  It was a small pen light. 
 
Q:  For the record, you pointed to that night stand where the 
telephone is. 
 
A:  In the top drawer. 
 
Q:  You got a little pen light? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Pretty dim light? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  What did you then do? 
 
A:  Got off--I hung up the phone-- 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
A:  --and then I took the pen light and headed back up out the door-
- 
 
Q:  Out the door. 
 
A:  --to the pathway, past Ashford.  I was going to go behind the 
garage and  head down there. 
 
Q:  Now, when you came up to--when you got out of your door 
and you went up the stairs, you were intending to go to the location 
behind your room.  Is  that right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  That's where you heard the noise, and that's where you were 
going to investigate.  Right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Now, was there another way of getting there instead of going 
around the house, out to the Ashford side and coming back 
around? 
 
A:  I could have gone--Yes, there is. 
 
Q:  How could you have done that? 
 
A:  I could have gone--instead of going up the pathway, I could 
have gone right. 
 
Q:  Past Arnelle's room? 
 
A:  Past Arnelle's room. 
 
Q:  And then what? 
 
A:  And then gone though--past the maid's other room. 
 
Q:  Right. 
 
A:  And then there is a gate or--wrought iron gate, but there is no 
door to it. 
 
Q:  Right. 
 
A:  And you could kinda squeeze in through there, but there was 
like a lot of trees, a lot of mud.  It was a thing that you wouldn't do 
normally.  You would never go--it wasn't a path. 
 
Q:  Had you ever gone in that area at nighttime, when it was dark? 
 
A:  No, never. 
 
Q:  And had you ever gone back in that area during daytime? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  How many times? 
 
A:  I did it twice in the same day for Arnelle. 
 
Q:  Why? 
 
A:  It was I think a Memorial Day party, and she had locked her 
keys twice in her room during the party and said, "Kato, will you 
do this for me?"  And I didn't even know about it, and she told me 
about a path that would go back there back behind her room and 
get into her room. 
 
Q:  And you didn't even know about that path. 
 
A:  Then I didn't, no. 
 
Q:  But she told you about it. 
 
A:  Yeah.  It wasn't a path.  It was just the dirt.  It wasn't like a 
cement path. 
 
Q:  She told you could get behind her room-- 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  --by going in that way. 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Now, what would it do to get you behind Arnelle's room?  How 
would you then get in her room. 
 
A:  You could go through her window, the bathroom window. 
 
Q:  I see.  And you were able to do that? 
 
A:  Uh-huh. 
 
Q:  You climbed into the bathroom window? 
 
A:  Yes, on the Memorial Day party. 
 
Q:  Was the window open? 
 
A:  Yeah, it was somewhat open.  Her window was a different 
window with I think no screen on it. 
 
Q:  Now, is there --are there any other windows from that window 
in Arnelle's bathroom? 
 
A:  Bathroom. 
 
Q:  To the point right behind your bed? 
 
A:  There's my bathroom window. 
 
Q:  Have you ever gone in that bathroom window? 
 
A:  No, never. 
 
Q:  Could you physically get in it and out of it? 
 
A:  I don't think so.  It opens up that way (Indicating), like a slant.  
I don't think you could get in there. 
 
Q:  Okay.  So you decided not to go around Arnelle's room because 
it was dark. 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Were you frightened to go that way? 
 
A:  Yeah.  A person would never go there like at nighttime.  It was 
like muddy and spider webs, and it was a thing where you kinda--I 
scraped-- 
 
Q:  Do you know if it was muddy that night? 
 
A:  Not --Well, there's like a --there's a garden but not really a 
garden.  It's just like a patch of mud that's --where a garden should 
be, but I  imagine, yeah, there would be mud there. 
 
Q:  Did you see mud that night there? 
 
A:  No, I didn't. 
 
Q:  Well, let's look at Exhibit 27 again, and right around Arnelle's 
room you see some trees and shrubs.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  That's the area you're talking about. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  But you went up --down the steps, past the pool, around this 
path.  Right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  And then you came around this path that heads on near Ashford 
Street.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And your intention was to do what? 
 
A:  Take the flashlight, go here, back there and (Indicating)-- 
 
Q:  You are pointing onto the driveway? 
 
A:  Back to the driveway. 
 
Q:  Go past the entrance to the house? 
 
A:  Go past the entrance and go over here to the side of the garage 
(Indicating) 
 
Q:  Go to the garage, and then go-- 
 
A:  Down the path. 
 
Q:  Make a left where the garage is and head in a southerly --in an 
easterly direction.  Right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  And that would start to take you behind the house. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And your intention was to walk from that point all the way in 
an easterly direction until you get behind your room.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Had you ever done that before? 
 
A:  No.  There was a guy from the cable company once, I believe, 
phone company or cable company, that I went back there with a 
long time ago, and the kids had been back there once or twice 
before in the daytime, and that was it. 
 
Q:  Had you ever gone back there as far as your room? 
 
A:  With the kids, yes. 
 
Q:  And the kids had gotten back there? 
 
A:  Yeah.  They can go back there. 
 
Q:  And you were going to get them? 
 
A:  Yeah.  I think it was hide-and-go-seek or something. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And you went back there once with the cable man. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Had you ever gone back there-- 
 
A:  It might have been the phone man or cable man.  There's... 
 
Q:  When you went back there with the phone man/cable man and 
the kids, was it in daytime? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Had you ever gone back there at nighttime? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  When you walked out of your room past the--Mr. Simpson's 
residence, as you walked by the pool, did you see him inside? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you see anything inside? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Was it dark? Bottom floor. 
 
Q:  Pretty sure it was dark.  Best of my recollection, it was dark. 
 
Q:  Were you walking briskly? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And what happened next? 
 
A:  So I had gone through my room door up the stairs to the 
pathway, and when I got to the pathway looked to my right, and I 
noticed that there was a limo  parked out in front at the gates.  The 
gates were not opened.  So I looked and I thought, okay, there's a 
limo there.  I thought it was all attended to, and I  walked back to 
the garage, the first gate. 
There's a--first gate here is broken.  You can pick it up manually 
and lean it against the tree.  There's a tree there.  So I picked it up, 
placed it there, and I walked down about five feet and-- 
 
Q:  Five feet from where? 
 
A:  Five feet from that gate, and-- 
 
Q:  That gate is at the beginning of-- 
 
A:  At the very beginning, right here (Indicating) at that garage lip. 
 
Q:  Okay. 
 
A:  And then I walked down just about--and I started going, no, I'll 
turn back around. 
 
Q:  Let me stop you right there:  When you went down about five 
feet, did you go beyond the length of the garage? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  You went about halfway down the length of the garage. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Objection.  Leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Is that about how far you said you went? 
 
A:  That's about how far I went. 
 
Q:  And then you stopped. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And why did you stop? 
 
A:  I think I was looking with the flashlight kind of like this 
(Indicating) and going, oh, it's dark.  I shouldn't be back here, and 
turned around, and I just turned around. 
 
Q:  Were you frightened? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And you believed somebody had been back there and might 
still be back there? 
 
A:  Yes.  I just had an eerie feeling that night, so it was just adding 
up. 
 
Q:  And you turned around. 
 
A:  I turned around. 
 
Q:  And did what? 
 
A:  So I turned around.  put the gate up, and I walked and I noticed 
the limo guy was still out there.  And so when I saw the limo guy 
still out  there, I went, huh, I probably should let him in. 
So I went to this gate control box (Indicating), and it's a button-- 
 
Q:  You are pointing to the gate control box inside the Ashford 
gate? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  What did do you? 
 
Q:  So I pressed the box--the button, and the doors opened up on 
the gate.  And Chachi was right there, the dog, and the guy started 
the car, pulled up, and I saw Chachi crossing.  Chachi went in front 
of the limo and laid down in this one spot that he lays. 
 
Q:  Now, the spot where Chachi lays is on the east side of the 
driveway north of the entranceway.  Right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  On the grass? 
 
A:  Yes, it's on the grass. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And then the limo driver pulled in after Chachi walked 
by, and he stopped where? 
 
A:  He went up to the driveway right here (Indicating) where the 
two park benches are. 
 
Q:  And stopped there? 
 
A:  And stopped there. 
 
Q:  With his--with the doors on the driver's side of the car facing 
the entranceway? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Objection.  Leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Is that what you are pointing to? 
 
A:  Yes, right in the front, yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Now go back to the point in time when you came out 
initially, and you were coming around the pathway to go 
investigate, and you saw the  limousine for the first time.  Okay? 
 
A:  Okay. 
 
Q:  Did you see who was in the limousine? 
 
A:  I didn't see. 
 
Q:  Did you see that it was a limousine as opposed to a different 
kind of car? 
 
A:  No.  I knew it was a limousine. 
 
Q:  You could tell? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Could you tell what color it was? 
 
A:  Yes.  White. 
 
Q:  White. 
 
A:  White limousine. 
 
Q:  And was the limousine facing--Which direction was the 
limousine facing? 
 
A:  The headlights were facing south, and it was right up against 
the gate, 
 
Q:  Do you know if the parking lights were on or the headlights 
were on or neither? 
 
A:  I think it was dark.  It didn't have lights on. 
 
Q:  But you saw it was facing in the direction of the house.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes, it was facing in the direction of the house. 
 
Q:  Now, when you saw that car there, having just heard the 
sounds, were you concerned about what that car was doing there? 
 
A:  No.  I figured the car was for the airport, and I figured--kind of 
in my head thought it was kinda late, car's still there, that O.J. must 
be there.  So I thought-that everything was under control, because I 
never--my phone doesn't let people in and doesn't ring to my room, 
so I thought everything was kind of under control.  And then when 
I came back from the garage, I went, huh, why is the car still out 
there, so I went out and I opened the thing. 
 
Q:  Now, when you saw that limousine, did you stop and pause for 
a minute?  
 
A:  I don't think so.  I think I continued --I think I might have 
looked at it and just continued on my walk. 
 
Q:  Is there any reason why you didn't simply go and let the 
limousine driver in then and there? 
 
A:  Yeah.  In my head I was thinking that everything was taken 
care of because there is a box there that someone can call, and it's 
all handled from the house, so I thought everything was under 
control. 
 
Q:  Does that limousine --Excuse me.  Does that box ring in your 
room? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  You know what I'm saying.  Does the phone in that box ring in 
your room? 
 
A:  Right, for me to let in cars or people.  No. 
 
Q:  About how long did it take from the time you first saw that 
limousine and then went behind the garage and then came back and 
let the limousine driver in?  How long was that interval of time? 
 
A:  The interval from when I first came out to the back to letting 
him 
in? 
 
Q:  When you first came out the path and saw the limousine driver.  
Starting from that moment in time and continuing walking down 
the driveway, going around, opening the gate, going down, coming 
back, coming around and going to the control box. 
 
A:  Minute to two minutes. 
 
Q:  Couple of minutes? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  During that period of time you walked by the entrance to the 
front door twice.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And did you see golf clubs there? 
 
A:  I did. 
 
Q:  Which time? 
 
A:  I think it was when I came back the second time.  Golf clubs.  I 
don't --they could have been there when I first walked, but I can't 
recollect,  and now I think that when I came back, I think there's 
golf clubs there.  So-- 
 
Q:  You remembered seeing the golf clubs for the first time on the 
way back from the garage. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And were the outside coach lights on? 
 
A:  Yeah, the little lights that were out there, yes. 
 
Q:  You saw those coach lights on when you came back from the 
garage.  Right? 
 
A:  Yeah.  They light up around the house. 
 
Q:  No.  I mean right where the doorway is, the entranceway. 
 
A:  Yes, I believe so. 
 
Q:  Are there lights outside that light up this entranceway? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And when you came back from the garage from investigating 
the first time, you believe you saw the golf clubs.  Where were the 
golf clubs? 
 
A:  Golf clubs were laid down right in front before the --it's on the 
pavement, but not on the driveway.  It would be right here 
(Indicating), right by the Y of the driveway. 
 
Q:  In the area between the two benches? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And you think you saw the lights on then? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And then you went and saw the limo was still there, and you go 
to the control box and press the box, and he comes in? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Now, is that the first time that you had ever let the limousine 
in? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  At the times you had lived there, you had never once buzzed 
the limousine driver in.  Is that right? 
 
Q:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Is that the first time at night that you had ever gone back to 
investigate noises? 
 
A:  Yes.  First time I'd ever been back there at night, ever. 
 
Q:  First time ever that you had gone to investigate noises on the 
property at night? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  First time ever that you had taken a flashlight at night to go 
someplace? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  On the property, I mean. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  When you came out this path and saw the limousine, did you 
see Mr. Simpson at that point? 
 
A:  I don't believe so. 
 
Q:  By the time --Withdrawn.  When you went to check behind the 
garage for the first time, did you see Mr. Simpson at that point in 
time? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  When you went back to let in the limousine driver, had you 
seen--did you see Mr. Simpson as of that point in time? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  When the limousine came in and parked and got out--when the 
limousine came and parked, the limousine driver got out.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  What did you then do? 
 
A:  The driver got out of the car-- 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
A:  --and I believe I mentioned to him a few things, and the order 
I'll try to do the best I can:  I asked if we had this earthquake.  I 
heard this noise, and I asked him, and he said no, that he was 
coming up from Redondo Beach and he wasn't aware of it. 
And then I said, "Did O.J. oversleep?"  And I think he had said no, 
that he just talked to him.  Sleep came up, but I think the driver 
said also that O.J.  said he overslept. 
But I told him about the noise, and I said, "I'm going to investigate 
this noise," and when I was saying that to him, I start walking back 
towards the garage area.  And I said to Chachi, the dog, I said, 
"Chachi, come with me." and he just laid there, and I commented 
to the driver, I said, "Isn't that a  great watchdog?"  And-- 
 
Q:  Jokingly. 
 
A:  Jokingly, right. So then I went back there, and I went and 
picked up the gate again, went back.  There is a second gate.  I 
made it up to that second gate, but I didn't open the gate.  I stayed 
right there and kinda went like this (Indicating). 
 
Q:  Did you go beyond the length of the garage this time? 
 
A:  I believe no.  I believe the gate ends right around here 
(Indicating).  There is a second gate at the house that doesn't go 
very far. 
 
Q:  Right around near the end of the garage? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  So you were still quite a ways from where you heard the sound. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And you knew you were still quite a ways.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Objection.  Leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  But you did not go back.  Why? 
 
A:  Well, I figured there is a limo driver there.  I was more nervy to 
go down a little bit further down the gate.  I had more nerve, and I 
figured, okay, this is far enough.  This flashlight's not really 
working.  I'm not gonna chance it anymore, so I came back. 
 
Q:  Did seeing the limo driver and having that little human contact 
give you some more courage? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And for that reason you went down a little farther. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  But still could not go down the rest of the way. 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Because you were? 
 
A:  Scared. 
 
Q:  Scared.  And when you came back to the limousine--Let me 
back up for a second.  When the limo driver got out of the car did 
you introduce yourself? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And-- 
 
A:  I said, "I'm Kato," and I believe he said his name, because I 
think I shook his hand. 
 
Q:  Why did you say something about an earthquake if you had 
intellectually ruled out earthquake? 
 
A:  You know.  I just said it to him to reassure myself.  I don't 
know.  It was just the part of the thing I just said to him.  I said, 
"Hey, did we have this earthquake?  Because I felt this thing."  I 
even went to explain about this picture moving.  "It's the weirdest 
thing.  You know, hey, this picture in my room moving around.  
Well, whatever, I'm going to go back to this here." 
So I explained to him where I was going.  I guess in case 
something ever happened to me, I was going back there, tell him.  
So I went back and... 
 
Q:  Did you ask him for a flashlight? 
 
A:  At one point I did, yes. 
 
Q:  Did--The reason--Did you put any luggage in the car before 
you went back there? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  What did you do in that regard? 
 
A:  I saw that the golf clubs were in an area where they normally 
would be like the luggage-- 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
A:  --for a trip, so I thought I'll pick it up.  I said, "I'll put these in 
the trunk," and he popped the trunk, and I put them in the trunk. 
 
Q:  Now, where the golf clubs were located was where you said 
you believed you had seen the clubs:  In between the two benches 
on the ground. 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  And you picked up the golf club bag? 
 
A:  The golf club bag. 
 
Q:  Now, was it a bag with clubs sticking out, or was it all in a--  
 
A:  It was, you know, like an airline-- 
 
Q:  Cover bag? 
 
A:  Cover bag. 
 
Q:  You picked up the whole thing, and you put it in the trunk. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Now, when you picked up that golf cover bag, did you see any 
other luggage there at that time? 
 
A:  No.  That was it.  Just the golf bag. 
 
Q:  And if there had been other luggage there, would you have also 
picked that up? 
 
A:  Yeah.  I would have assumed that that's what it was there for; 
put it in  there.  I thought the limo driver was going to do it, so I 
just put it in myself. 
 
Q:  Now, after you put that golf bag into the limousine, what did 
you then do? 
 
A:  Okay.  Now, I put the golf bag in there, and I asked him if we 
had--if he had a flashlight, and I was going to do it again to look 
for--even further down there with a better flashlight. 
So he had looked in his glove box, and he said, "No, I don't have a 
flashlight." 
 
Q:  And so what did you do? 
 
A:  Well, at some point O.J. was outside . 
 
Q:  Now, was O.J.--And then you saw him.  Right? 
 
A:  And then I saw him. 
 
Q:  Did you see O.J. before you went to make the second trip 
around the garage, or after? 
 
A:  I saw it--I saw it the first trip, and then I think it was the--in my 
head, it was a trip--I've already made two trips, but I thought there 
was a part where I had seen him.  And then I noticed a bag by the 
Bentley, a knapsack bag. 
But I had the dialogue of telling O.J., "I heard this noise, and the 
driver doesn't have a flashlight and my flashlight is just terrible.  
Do we have a better a flashlight?"  And--Go on? 
 
Q:  Well, let me stop you there.  Is it your recollection that you first 
saw O.J. Simpson that evening during this period of time after you 
made the second trip behind the garage? 
 
A:  The best of my recollection is the second time--after the second 
time. 
 
Q:  Now, when you came back from your aborted attempt to 
investigate a second time and returned to the limousine, is that 
when you first saw Mr. Simpson? 
 
A:  Say it again. 
 
Q:  When you came back from investigating the second time and 
returned directly-- 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  --to the limousine, is that when you first saw Mr. Simpson? 
 
A:  Best of my recollection, it is. 
 
Q:  And what was he doing at that moment in time when you saw 
him? 
 
A:  I thought I saw him going, into the house, and that was it, and 
then I had questioned him about the noise. 
 
Q:  Now, if he was going into the house, how did you question 
him? 
 
A:  I just got him outside before he went in the house and said to 
him-- 
 
Q:  He was about to go into the house. 
 
A:  Yeah.  I don't know if he was putting luggage into the car or 
what.  It was just there, and I started talking to him. 
 
Q:  What did you say to him? 
 
A:  "Hey, O.J., I heard this noise back there.  It was really weird.  It 
moved my picture," and all that.  And was like, you know, "I think 
maybe somebody's back there." 
 
Q:  What did he say? 
 
A:  He said.  "Oh, we'd better check on it."  And I said, "I've got 
this a flashlight.  This is like the only thing I have.  Do we have a 
better flashlight?" 
He said, "Well, I better check if we have a better flashlight," and 
then he went into the house. 
 
Q:  Now, before he went into the house, did he say anything like, 
"You go this way and I'll go that way"? 
 
A:  Yes.  Yeah, that was part of it.  He goes, "Well, I'll go that way 
and you go that way." 
 
Q:  Now, when did he say that? 
 
A:  Before checking for--that made me say, "Well, we need a better 
flashlight." 
 
Q:  Okay.  So give me the conversation again. 
 
A:  Okay.  So it was.  "O.J., I heard this noise back there.  It was 
like it moved my picture, and I think someone's back there." 
"We better investigate.  You go"-- "I'll go that way.  You go that 
way" (Indicating). 
 
Q:  Now, you are pointing right now. 
 
A:  He--okay. 
 
Q:  Which direction did O.J. indicate that you should go? 
 
A:  Back by the garage area. 
 
Q:  Where you had checked. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And which direction did he point indicating he should go? 
 
A:  He was pointing that way (Indicating). 
 
Q:  Meaning go back towards around the other side. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Towards Ashford. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Yeah, up towards that path where Ashford is. 
 
Q:  Now, did that seem--How did that comment strike you, "You 
go that way, I'll go that way"? 
 
A:  I was--it was a--I didn't expect him to say that, with the flight 
and that, I was going, "Oh," I was like, he's going to help me 
check, so-- 
 
Q:  And-- 
 
A:  And then I thought, okay, and then that made me go, "Well, we 
need a better flashlight," but I didn't--I was like... 
 
Q:  "We need a better flashlight." 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  What did he then say? 
 
A:  "I'll go inside and check." 
 
Q:  Then what happened? 
 
A:  So he ran into the house, and I followed behind him-- 
 
Q:  Right. 
 
A:  --and he went into the kitchen area. 
 
Q:  Right. 
 
A:  So he is in the kitchen area.  I didn't go into the kitchen.  I kind 
of waited by--there is an entranceway by the kitchen. 
 
Q:  Right. 
 
A:  So I didn't go into the kitchen, but I saw him go into the 
kitchen, and he got in there and looked and went, "Whoa, it's that 
time." 
 
Q:  He looked where? 
 
A:  There is a clock. 
 
Q:  Up on the wall. 
 
A:  On the wall. 
 
Q:  And he said what when he saw that clock? 
 
A:  "Is that the right time?" or "My God, is it that late?" or--it was 
in reference to being late.  He goes, "I've got to catch my flight." 
I said, "Oh, don't miss your flight."  And then he walked back out, 
and I was  there and walked out, and then he had mentioned about 
setting the alarm. 
 
Q:  Now, did you actually go in the kitchen with him? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you go into the kitchen and go to a cupboard and start 
looking for a flashlight? 
 
A:  No, I never made it into the kitchen myself. 
 
Q:  You never made it into the kitchen? 
 
A:  No, I never walked into the kitchen. 
 
Q:  So you were never in the kitchen with him looking for a 
flashlight. 
 
A:  Right.  Never. 
 
Q:  Did you see him on the counter dabbing blood off his finger? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you see him bleed at all at that time-- 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  --in the kitchen? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  How long was he in the kitchen from the moment he went in 
the door that leads to the kitchen until he came back out? 
 
A:  15 seconds. 
 
Q:  So he was out of your sight for 15 seconds? 
 
A:  No, he wasn't out of my sight at all.  I was at the doorway of-- 
 
Q:  What was he doing in the kitchen for 15 seconds? 
 
A:  It was kind of--I'm saying from the walk in, looking up, going 
like this (Indicating) and saying, "Oh, boy it's that time." 
 
Q:  So it was a continuous motion? 
 
A:  Yeah.  There was no looking for the flashlight. 
 
Q:  So he didn't stop to do anything in the kitchen? 
 
A:  No.  We never looked. 
 
Q:  Could you see the clock from your vantage point? 
 
A:  I think I glanced up at it and I thought it was 11:15, so I could 
see it if I looked up.  I think I did look at the clock. 
 
Q:  Now, he then walked past you to go outside? 
 
A:  Yeah, walked back out. 
 
Q:  So he was rushing? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  And so he walked right by you and went out the house, out the 
front door? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And what did you do? 
 
A:  I followed. 
 
Q:  Why? 
 
A:  I was--he was leaving.  I was getting out of the house. 
 
Q:  And then what did you do when you followed him out of the 
house? 
 
A:  There was a dialogue of--at the doorway by the foyer to the 
doorway about, "Kato, set the alarm to the house." 
And I said, "I don't know the alarm.  I don't want to set the alarm 
code."  So he said he would do it 
 
Q:  Okay. 
 
A:  And then I walked up and I saw that knapsack there, so I 
started walking toward the knapsack because I thought that was 
supposed to be packed up, and I started walking to it and O.J. said 
"No.  I'll get it." 
 
Q:  Continue. 
 
A:  So I just turned back around. 
 
Q:  Now, let's talk a little bit about that knapsack.  The knapsack 
was located where? 
 
A:  Right here (Indicating) on the-- 
 
Q:  You are pointing to where the Bentley is parked? 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  Behind the Bentley? 
 
A:  It was at the taillights of the Bentley. 
 
Q:  On the ground. 
 
A:  On the ground. 
 
Q:  About how many feet from the entranceway to the front door is 
that? 
 
A:  25 feet. 
 
Q:  Now, when you came outside with Mr. Simpson after he left 
the kitchen, what made you go to the knapsack? 
 
A:  I just thought it was another item that had to be packed. 
 
Q:  When did you first see that knapsack? 
 
A:  On my second trip. 
 
Q:  You noticed it at that time? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  Did you stop to pick it up at that time? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Why not? 
 
A:  I just didn't.  I was kinda wondering.  I  saw a knapsack there.  
That's a weird place.  It wasn't there before, I was thinking, and I 
was going-- 
 
Q:  What color was the knapsack? 
 
A:  I remember it being dark, maybe black, and I thought it had a 
brown patch of leather. 
 
Q:  Small or large? 
 
A:  The patch of leather? 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  Big as this coffee cup (Indicating). 
 
A:  That's about it? 
 
Q:  (Nods head.) 
 
Q:  That's the only leather on it? 
 
A:  That's the only leather I saw. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  What is that, about two inches? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Yeah, about two inches. 
 
Q:  Two-inch leather patch.  Right?  Two or three inches. 
 
A:  A square.  I think a square. 
 
Q:  Now, when you came out of the house after Mr. Simpson had 
gone past you,  you--where did he go as you decided to go get the 
knapsack? 
 
A:  Well, when I started walking, I thought he was setting the 
alarm.  I didn't know. 
 
Q:  How close had you gotten to the knapsack before you heard 
Mr. Simpson say, "No, I'll get it"? 
 
A:  I was about 75 feet from it. 
 
Q:  Where was Mr. Simpson when he said, "No, I'll get it"? 
 
A:  Back here by the Y of the driveway where it says the "Y" 
(Indicating). 
 
Q:  So you were about seven feet from reaching the knapsack, and 
he was about another ten or so feet behind you? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Farther from the knapsack.  Is that right? 
 
A:  Yeah, it was at least --it was about here (Indicating). 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Let the record reflect that the witness is 
pointing to the area where the entranceway intersects the driveway. 
 
Q:  Is that right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  So he was farther from you. 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Excuse me.  He was considerably farther than the knapsack. 
 
A:  Right.  I was in a walking mode. 
 
Q:  What exactly did he say? 
 
A:  "No, I'll get it."  I said I was gonna get it.  I said, "Oh, I'll get 
this," and I was in that walking mode. 
 
He says, "No, no, no.  I'll get it." 
 
Q:  When he said, "No, no, no.  I'll get it," did you stop? 
 
A:  Yeah.  I was going, huh.  I was closest, but okay.  So I stopped-
- 
 
Q:  Were you a little surprised by that? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  You cut him off. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Did I cut you off? 
 
MR. PLOTKIN:  Yeah. 
 
THE WITNESS:  I was surprised, but I was like going, huh, I was 
so close, maybe it's not supposed to go, or whatever.  So I just 
turned around, I went  "huh," and went back towards the limo 
driver, and my back was there, and I never saw it again. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Now, when he said "No, no, no.  I'll get it," and you stopped-- 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  --did he then start walking quickly to get the knapsack? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And did he overtake you? 
 
A:  Yeah.  It was--he passed me up, right. 
 
Q:  So he passed you up, and you started heading back-- 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  --and he went to get that knapsack. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  So you never did touch it, did you? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Let me show you some photographs.  This has been previously 
marked as Exhibit 23, and do you recognize what is depicted in 
that photograph? 
 
Q:  Golf bag. 
 
Q:  Yeah.  And is that the golf coverbag that you put in the trunk? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  That wasn't the knapsack you saw near the Bentley. 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Let me show you what has been previously marked as Exhibit 
24.  You see that garment bag? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Was that what you saw near the Bentley? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Let me show you what's previously been marked as Exhibit 27.  
This is what Mr. Simpson described as a suit bag. 25.  Excuse me. 
Is that the knapsack you saw? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  This is Exhibit 27, what Mr. Simpson described as a grip.  Is 
that the knapsack you saw? 
 
A:  No . 
 
Q:  This is Exhibit 26, which is a bag that Mr. Simpson said he got 
from his Bentley.  Is that it? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Exhibit 26 is not the knapsack you saw near the Bentley.  Is 
that right? 
 
A:  No.  It's a knapsack look to it. 
 
Q:  This is not it? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Describe what you mean by "knapsack." 
 
Q:  I think in my head it was like at college, you know, you put 
those things on your back, like that kind of a knapsack.  I meant it 
was-- 
 
Q:  Like a backpack? 
 
A:  Backpack, knapsack, yeah. 
 
Q:  But with one string at the end that closes? 
 
A:  Well, it had that shape to it, but I didn't see a string. 
 
Q:  Was it closed? 
 
A:  Yeah, it looked like it was closed.  It was on the edge.  It was 
that kind of shape (Indicating). 
 
Q:  Now, for the camera, could you do that again? 
 
A:  That kind of shape (Indicating), like a knapsack shape, where it 
was wider, and you would put your school books in. 
 
Q:  Soft cloth to it? 
 
A:  I thought it would have been. 
 
Q:  Any straps or cords on it? 
 
A:  I thought that--like I saw that the--where the patch would be.  
The patch would have been facing the top of the knapsack, and if 
you--right there on the knapsack.  It would be--possibly the logo 
part would have been right there (Indicating), and that's it.  That's 
the only patch I saw.  That's the only different color to it I saw, 
from my memory. 
 
Q:  This black grip that I showed you apparently is not Exhibit 27, 
but Exhibit 4, but for the record that's not it, is it? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  I will show you--that's all right.  It's the same picture. 
Did you see what Mr. Simpson did when he--with that black 
knapsack? 
 
A:  Never.  I never saw anything. 
 
Q:  Did he bring it in the car with him? 
 
A:  I didn't see it. 
 
Q:  When he left, did you see it behind? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you see it on the ground? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  The Bronco was not in the driveway during this time, was it? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  When Mr. Simpson asked you to set the code, was that the first 
time he had ever asked you to do so? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Are we talking in his foyer? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  Did he ask you to set the code in the foyer or as you were 
coming outside, or do you remember? 
 
A:  We were, I believe, right at the doorway, so we were still in the 
house and maybe a foot from beyond the house, if I remember 
correctly. 
 
Q:  What exactly did he say? 
 
A:  I think it was, "Kato, I'm running late.  Set the alarm to the 
house." 
 
Q:  What did you say? 
 
A:  I said, "No.  I don't know the alarm code, I'd rather not" 
 
Q:  What did he say? 
 
A:  I think he said he was gonna do it. 
 
Q:  He would do it? 
 
A:  Yeah.  And so that made me go to that motion to the bag. 
 
Q:  And so far as you thought, he was setting the alarm? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  You didn't put any other luggage in the car besides the golf 
bag? 
 
A:  Just the golf bag. 
 
Q:  Now, when you were talking to Mr. Simpson about the sounds 
and he said, "Oh, you go that way, I'll go that way" or "Let's 
check," did he seem genuinely concerned to you? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Objection.  Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS:  It was this feeling that it was not genuine.  To 
me, my feeling was that.  And I couldn't figure out why he wanted 
to check, because the flight and that.  So it was kind of, huh.  So it 
just left me--just gave me a strange feeling. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Did he tell you to call the cops? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Call Westec? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did he tell you to look our for Arnelle when she came home? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Or to try to get in touch with her and see that everything was 
okay so that nothing jeopardized her safety? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  He said nothing more than what you just testified to? 
 
A:  That was it. 
 
Q:  Was he wet? 
 
A:  I didn't notice being wet--I did not notice him being wet. 
 
Q:  To the best of your recollection, did he appear wet to you? 
 
A:  Did not. 
 
Q:  Did he appear that he had just gotten out of the shower? 
 
A:  Did not appear that way to me. 
 
Q:  Did he tell you that he had just gotten out of the shower? 
 
Q:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you ever notice if Mr. Simpson wore a watch? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  What kind of watch?  
 
A:  Usually a Swiss Army.  He had a company-- 
 
Q:  Normally when you saw him, he had a Swiss Army watch on? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  And did you ever notice if he had any jewelry on his fingers? 
 
A:  Usually a ring.  I thought a big ring. 
 
Q:  A big ring. 
 
A:  How big his fingers were, I always noticed that ring. 
 
Q:  A pretty big ring? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  Do you have any reason to believe that he was not wearing the 
watch this evening? 
 
A:  I didn't see his hands, but, no.  I would assume that it was on. 
 
Q:  The watch? 
 
A:  Watch and ring. 
 
Q:  My question to you is:  Do you have any reason to believe he 
was not wearing the watch or the ring that evening? 
 
A:  No. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  He doesn't want you to assume anything. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Let me make sure you understand my question.  Do you have 
any reason to believe he was not wearing the watch that night? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Do you have any reason to believe he was not wearing the ring 
that night? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  During this part of the evening when you saw him, you had the 
brief exchange about the noises and going in the house, were you 
ever like standing next to him for a sustained period of time? 
 
A:  There was never--it might have been for a few seconds, but it 
was always movement. 
 
Q:  Always movement. 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  Did you get a clean, sustained look at his hands? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  His fingers? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Now, Mr. Simpson got in the car, and then what happened 
next? 
 
A:  I think I shut the door possibly, but he was in the limo, and 
then I opened the gate at Rockingham for the limo driver.  So when 
I pressed the button for the limo to get through-- 
 
Q:  Pressed the button where? 
 
A:  The button would be right --gate control box on the-- 
 
Q:  On Exhibit 27? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  On the Rockingham gate. 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  On the inside.  Right? 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  And then what did you see? 
 
A:  Pressed the button, and they drove off-- 
 
Q:  Right. 
 
A:  --and I waited for the gate to close-- 
 
Q:  Right. 
 
A:  --and then I started running--I wanted to get back in my room, 
because I kept thinking, I have got to call Rachel, da, da, da.  And 
so I ran and I went--I saw that the green light was still on, and I 
went, oh, the alarm's not set; great, and then I went back to my 
room. 
 
Q:  Now, you said you waited for the gate to close.  Why did you 
do that? 
 
A:  I usually always wait for the gate to close for when I would just 
use it any time.  Just one of my idiosyncrasies, that I would just 
watch a gate closed. 
 
Q:  Just to make sure it closed? 
 
A:  Just to make sure it closed. 
 
Q:  Do you know whether the limousine waited on the other side of 
the gate until the gate closed before it took off? 
 
A:  No 
 
Q:  Did it? 
 
A:  No.  It took off.  It didn't stop--you mean after the gate? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A:  No.  It took off. 
 
Q:  Did the dog run out?  
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  When you went to McDonald's and you exited through the 
Rockingham gate, did the dog run out? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  You told me before that you usually would park on the Ashford 
Street side and then get into the Ashford gate.  Right?  
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  But you didn't have a remote control for that gate.  Right? 
 
A:  Correct 
 
Q:  How would you get in through that gate? 
 
A:  Michelle was the maid that used to work there. 
 
Q:  Yeah 
 
A:  She showed me a thing on the gate where you can--it's like--I 
don't know if it's a nut.  There is a certain thing on the bottom of 
the gate you can manually push a little bit, and you can push the 
gate open and get in and then close the gate back and then go back 
and reset it. 
 
Q:  Is it something that you do at the bottom of the gate? 
 
A:  Bottom of the gate. 
 
Q:  At the center or at one of the hinges? 
 
A:  It's at a hinge.  That's the word I'm looking for. 
 
Q:  On the left hinge? 
 
A:  I'd use the left hinge of the gate 
 
Q:  Is it something that was obvious to you? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Would it be obvious to anybody, you think? 
 
A:  No, No.  She had to point it out.  I never knew it existed. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Speculation.  Belatedly. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Mr. -- Excuse me.  Michelle pointed it out to you? 
 
A:  Yes.  She said.  "You know, there's a thing you can do here if 
you ever want to get in.  It's right here.  You just move it and get 
the gate and then get out that way." 
 
Q:  And that's how you were told to get in? 
 
A:  Yeah.  As long as I just locked it back up. 
 
Q:  Did you ever tell that to anyone? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you ever tell anyone to get in that way? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Now you went back to your room.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Now, before you got back to the room, I would like you to 
focus on this entire time that you were out on the property.  Okay?  
Going out to the  Bentley to go to McDonald's, coming back from 
the Bentley, going around to your property, coming back out to 
investigate once, going back to the limo, going back to investigate 
a second time, going back to the limo, going inside, coming out, 
going to the Bentley, stopping in your tracks.  The whole 
description.  Okay? 
During any of that time on the property, did you see any golf balls? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  At any time during that evening did you see Mr. Simpson 
practicing golf? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Chipping golf balls? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Swinging a golf club? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Had you ever seen him swing a golf club on the property 
during the evenings? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Had you ever seen golf balls on the property? 
 
A:  Yeah.  There was a time when there was a video being shot 
there, a Playboy video, and I don't know if golfing was part of the 
video or not, but he was golfing and hitting--chipping a ball into a 
tree, hitting a tree.  That's the only time I saw it. 
 
Q:  With a camera crew there? 
 
A:  Yeah, there's a crew there.  A bunch of people were there. 
 
Q:  That was in the daytime? 
 
A:  Daytime. 
 
Q:  Did you ever see golf balls there on any other occasion on the 
property? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  And you never saw him playing golf at night. 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you see Mr. Simpson walking his dog that evening on the 
outside of the property? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you see him normally walk his dog? 
 
Q:  No. 
 
Q:  Chachi. 
 
A:  Chachi, no.  Chachi was--didn't walk, I mean, Chachi was like 
arthritic, turned-in leg. 
 
Q:  And Chachi would go to the bathroom on the Rockingham 
property? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Objection.  Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  Yeah, I imagine it was Chachi went to the 
bathroom right there, always on the grass somewhere. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Were you ever asked to walk the dog? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  And you never saw Mr. Simpson walking the dog.  Is that 
right? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Is that right? 
 
A:  No.  I never saw the dog being walked. 
 
Q:  Okay. 
 
A:  You know what? One time I did take Kato and Chachi on a 
walk.  A long time ago. 
 
Q:  I am just asking about Chachi. 
 
A:  Yeah 
 
MR. PLOTKIN:  Can I just ask a question?  Do you know whether 
he went to the   bathroom on the premises, or are you speculating? 
 
THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I'm pretty sure there was like dog dung on 
spots on the property. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Now, when you went back to your room, were you still 
concerned that--about the noises? 
 
A:  Yes.  I was concerned about the noises, and I was concerned 
that the alarm wasn't set.  And I started--I was just very weird on 
that night, and I 
explained it to her on the phone-- 
 
Q:  To whom? 
 
A:  To Rachel on the phone. 
 
Q:  When? 
 
A:  As soon as I got back in the room, I called her. 
 
Q:  So when you got back to your room that evening, you called 
Rachel Ferrara. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And what did you say to her? 
 
A:  I said.  "Rachel, this is weird, all these things that are going on 
here right now."  I said--I explained to her about the noises I heard.  
She asked  me about checking it out.  I go, "I didn't see anything."  
I had said about O.J. coming by--asking to help out behind the 
house, and I thought that was  kind of weird. 
And then I said, "We never got the  flashlight," and then I just 
went, "And now this alarm isn't set."  So without the alarm being 
set, I was like--now I said, "Now the house is kinda like  open." 
And she was going, "Sleep over here.  Come over here." 
I said.  "No.  Now I better not come over there." 
So she was convincing me to come in to sleep the night, to come to 
her place, and then the phone clicked in.  At some point the phone 
clicked in. 
 
Q:  How long after you got back to your room did the phone click 
in? 
 
A:  In my mind, I'm thinking like 10 or 15 minutes into the 
conversation. 
 
Q:  Might it have been longer? 
 
A:  It could have been. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Can we take a quick break-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Yes. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:--a bathroom break? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Yes. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are going off the record now, and 
the time is approximately 2:27. 
 
(Recess.) 
 
(Robert C. Baker enters the deposition.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 2:41. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  When you were on the phone with Rachel Ferrara, at some 
point you said you heard the call waiting signal? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  What did you do? 
 
A:  I told her, I said, "Ah, Rachel, hold on.  The other line is 
ringing.  Let me check it." 
So I checked it, and it was O.J., and he said that he had forgot to 
set the alarm and that I should set the alarm. 
And I said, "I don't know the alarm code."  And so he gave it to me 
over the phone, and he told me the procedure, what happens when 
you set it.  You wait a few seconds, and it will turn red.  That 
means it's set.  So I said, "Okay, I'll do it." 
And I didn't really hear any noise.  I don't know if it was the airport 
or not.  I didn't know where the phone call was coming from.  In 
my mind I think I was registering that it wasn't the airport because 
I didn't hear any real noise, but I didn't know. 
I just got back on the line with Rachel and said, "You won't believe 
this.  I'll call you back again," because I've done this all night to 
her.  I said, "I'll call you back again.  I'm going to go set the alarm 
now." So... 
 
Q:  Did you write down the alarm code? 
 
A:  Yeah, I put it on like a little pad next to my bed I had.  And so I 
took it out there with the code, and hung up with her and ran out to 
set the alarm code. 
 
Q:  What key pad? 
 
A:  By the--the key pad at the front entrance.  There is a keypad 
right there (Indicating). 
 
Q:  Is that the one he told you to use? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  When you set the alarm, did you see a light go on? 
 
A:  Yeah.  It went from green to red, so I knew I had done it right.  
And so when I'm punching it in.  I was outside going, please, hurry 
up.  Go, go, go,"  and as soon as it did, I ran right back to the room. 
 
Q:  Why did you run? 
 
A:  I didn't want to go back outside.  I was scared. 
 
Q:  Still. 
 
A:  Still scared. 
 
Q:  Was that the first time Mr. Simpson had ever buzzed in while 
you were on a call? 
 
A:  I think so, yes. 
 
Q:  In other words, the first time you were on a call, you hear the 
call waiting sound and you check who it is, and it's O.J. Simpson? 
 
A:  Yeah.  I think it could have happened maybe once, but I don't 
remember.  It never happened any more than once. 
 
Q:  Was that the first time he ever called you at night in your 
room? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Did you finish again? 
 
THE WITNESS:  I was finished with that statement. 
What was--. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Had you finished your answer? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Was that the first time O.J. Simpson had ever called you 
at your room at night? 
 
A:  I think so. 
 
Q:  You could not tell where he was calling you from.  Is that what 
you said? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  How long did the conversation occur? 
 
A:  How long did it last-- 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
A:  --the conversation?  I think, max, about a minute, two minutes. 
 
Q:  And once again, tell me everything you can recall that he said. 
 
A:  I think it was, "Kato, you won't believe this, but I forgot to set 
the alarm, and you're gonna have to set it." 
I said, "I don't have the code.  I don't know it."  He goes, "I'm 
going to give you the code, and I'll tell you what you have to do.  
And what happens is it goes from green to red, and when you 
punch in the code, you have to wait a few seconds and then it will 
go to red.  That means the house is set.  That means the alarm is 
on." 
I said, "Okay, I'll do it." 
 
Q:  Did he say anything in that conversation about the noises you 
heard? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you tell him anything about the noises? 
 
Q:  No. 
 
Q:  He asked you no questions? 
 
A:  No questions, no. 
 
Q:  About the noises. 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Is that right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Did you then call Rachel back after you came back from setting 
the alarm? 
 
Q:  Yes.  As soon as I did that, I called Rachel right back. 
 
Q:  What did you tell Rachel? 
 
A:  I said, "That was weird.  I had to set the alarm."  I said, "It's a 
weird night, Rachel.  I don't know why.  It's just a weird night." 
So I'd gone over the whole night of what happened, and that was 
pretty much it, and we just talked, and she was continually trying 
to convince me to come over.  I didn't ask her to come over to my  
place.  I don't think I did. 
And, you know, then I just mentioned everything from the 
typewriter, to the noise, just the weird events of the night, 
explaining to her.  So I think I was freaking her out, scaring her, 
and that's why she kept telling me, "Come over." 
 
Q:  In this telephone call did Mr. Simpson say anything about his 
daughter Arnelle? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Tell you to call the police or anything? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Or-- 
 
A:  Very quick conversation. 
 
Q:  Very quick? 
 
A:  Very quick.  Alarm, get it done, and that was about it. 
 
Q:  Did you get to sleep that evening? 
 
A:  After I talked to Rachel.  I believe it was about 1:00 a.m., I 
hung up with her. 
 
Q:  You were on that long? 
 
A:  Yeah.  I was on for quite a long time with her.  And I had the 
Calendar section of the Times because I wasn't tired.  So I started 
to read that Calendar section, and it was about 1:30 when I heard 
high heels, the clicking of heels.  It sounded like a woman's heels 
going --coming from it seemed like the house down the pathway, 
and I assumed in my head it was Arnelle. 
 
Q:  Did the clicking stop at some point? 
 
A:  Yeah.  That's why I assumed.  I probably heard her door open.  
I'm not positive, but I'm assuming that that all happened.  But, yes, 
definitely heels.  And when I heard the heels walking and all that, I 
just turned my light off, and I felt she's there, and I felt a little safer 
that there was   someone else on the grounds. 
 
Q:  Let me ask you a question back about the limousine:  When 
you saw that limousine out there on the outside of the Ashford gate 
when you came out the first time to investigate-- 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  --was that the first time you had ever seen a limousine parked 
out there waiting to get in? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Now, you were awakened at some point in the morning or next 
day? 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  When was that? 
 
A:  I was having--I wasn't sleeping good at all, and it was one--like 
I said, it was still--Arnelle was home.  I felt better that someone's 
on the grounds but still shaky, and I wasn't--I was not in a real deep 
sleep. 
And during part of the night I thought I was dreaming, but I kept 
hearing the continuing--continual ringing of a phone.  And the 
phone from the house rings different than my phone, and it was 
kind of like a phaser on stun, that kind of noise from STAR TREK, 
that (sound), that kind of noise. 
So that noise kept going on and on and on, and I thought it was in 
my dream.  I kept going, what is going--because it seemed like it 
was for hours.  But I was just turning and turning, and then there 
was a pounding at my door. 
 
Q:  And-- 
 
A:  In that--I mean, I don't know how much time had passed 
because I was tossing and turning, but there was that phone ringing 
noise.  It was pretty  continual. 
 
Q:  What happened when you heard the pounding? 
 
A:  At my door? 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
A:  I woke up.  You know, I was-- 
 
Q:  What did you do? 
 
A:  "Who's there?"  And they said, "The police."  And I went.  "Oh, 
God," and I got--I  looked through that little latch.  I have those 
wooden panels, and I couldn't really tell if they were police.  They 
were in suits.  And I started thinking  about the whole night and I 
go, "Oh, my God, are they really cops," and all that, and then I 
kind of saw a badge on the belt, and I opened the door. 
 
Q:  What happened when the police came in? 
 
A:  They asked who I was.  You know, I don't know the exact 
order of everything.  They asked who I was, and I told them who I 
was, whose house it was, who else was here. 
One of the detectives came in then, into my room, asked me what I 
wore that night, checked the things that I wore from jeans to boots, 
and I started going, "What happened?  Did O.J.'s plane crash?  
What's going on?" 
They wouldn't answer me.  They wouldn't answer anything I was 
asking them.  I'm going--and so I was just getting very uptight.  
And at some point they said, "Is someone else here?" I pointed to  
Arnelle's room, and I think Mark Fuhrman stayed with me and did 
a test with the light or--one of the two, to see if I did drugs or 
something. 
 
Q:  Did he ask you if you had done drugs? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  And-- 
 
A:  He said, "Did you"-- 
 
Q:  What did you tell him? 
 
A:  I said, "No." I said, "I don't do drugs." 
 
Q:  And then he shown a light in your eyes? 
 
A:  I think it was follow a pen.  It was one of the two.  It was 
definitely one of those tests, though. 
 
Q:  To see if you were on drugs? 
 
A:  Right.  My eyes were red.  My eyes were red.  And he asked 
me then if I smoked pot that night.  I said, "No." 
 
Q:  Why were your eyes red? 
 
A:  Because I have this infection here (Indicating).  It's still kind of 
red.  I have these things on my eyes, and they always are pretty 
much red, and if I read, they get real red. 
 
Q:  You said one of the officers was looking at your clothing and 
your boots? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Who was that? 
 
A:  I believe Fuhrman. 
 
Q:  And what did he do when he looked at your clothing? 
This is clothing that you had taken off? 
 
A:  No, no.  I was in my pajamas, so this was there on the chair. 
 
Q:  You were in your pajamas? 
 
Q:  Yeah.  I was in shorts and a shirt. 
 
Q:  He asked you what clothing you wore the night before? 
 
A:  Yeah.  And I still was--I couldn't figure out what he was talking 
about, so--but I was showing him everything, and I was kind of 
talking very high energy and going, "I don't know if it means 
anything"; I told him about this noise I heard.  I said, "I heard this 
noise back there, and this picture moved.  I thought we had an 
earthquake again." I mentioned that thing and-- 
 
Q:  This is Fuhrman? 
 
A:  To Fuhrman.  I think I said it to everybody, but I think 
Fuhrman first. 
 
Q:  And then--Well, let me get back to looking at your clothes.  
What did he say to you about your clothing? 
 
A:  He wasn't really talking to me. 
 
Q:  Did he look at your clothing? 
 
A:  He was doing all the talking.  If he had something to say, he 
would tell me, but everything I was saying, he wasn't really paying 
attention--he was paying attention, but he wouldn't really comment 
on anything I was saying. 
 
Q:  He wouldn't respond.  He looked at your clothing? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And he checked it all out? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  And what about your shoes?  What did he do with your shoes? 
 
A:  He looked at the bottom of my shoes. 
 
Q:  What shoes did he look at? 
 
A:  They were these like the boots, they're like Doc Martens. 
 
Q:  Why did he look at those boot?  Do you know? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS:  I have no idea. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Did you tell him these are what you had worn the night before? 
 
Q:  Right. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Where did he look on the boots? 
 
A:  To turn them over. 
 
Q:  Did he tell you what he was looking for? 
 
A:  No. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  You mean the sole?  I couldn't 
understand. 
 
THE WITNESS:  The sole, the sole of my shoes. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  Thank you. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  He looked at the sole of your shoes-- 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  --and examined-- 
 
A:  The sole of my shoes.  He might have looked around the room.  
There was a point where I was out of my room, too.  He was still 
there, and I came in.  It was very confusing.  I was just very 
flustered.  And so much was going on, I was trying to remember in 
the right order, but Detective Vannatter--Detective Vannatter took 
notes at one point, and I was at the bar, and I told him the events of 
the night. 
 
Q:  So you first told Fuhrman about the events of the night and 
then Vannatter? 
 
A:  Well, Fuhrman I was telling kind of everything to.  It wasn't--it 
was just kind of, "Yeah, well, did his plane crash?  Did this 
happen?" 
"Did you smoke pot?" 
"No, I don't smoke pot." 
"And who else lives here?" 
"Arnelle."  I go, "I heard this noise.  It was here.  It moved my 
picture." 
And then he'd go on.  And I was talking very fast. 
 
Q:  When he finished--when Fuhrman finished talking to you in 
your room, what did the police then do with you? 
 
A:  Oh, I was--they never left.  There was always someone with 
me.  I pointed out where Arnelle's room was, so two of them went 
there.  They were pounding on her door for quite a while, like 
pounding on her door and pounding on her door, and she wasn't 
answering. 
 
Q:  Were you watching? 
 
A:  Yeah.  I was starting to think, "I know I thought I heard"--you 
know, from the footsteps, I think I said, "I think she's in there.  
And there was  pounding and pounding and pounding, and it 
seemed like three or four minutes she then came out.  They said 
"Police" again. 
 
Q:  Now, did you say anything to the police about the alarm being 
on or that you had set the alarm? 
 
A:  They might have asked me that.  I might have said something 
about that--probably when I was sitting at the bar with Vannatter, I 
said about the call coming from O.J., that he asked me to set the 
alarm.  I don't think I had set it until then. 
I think he asked if there was an alarm to the house, and I think I 
said, "Yeah, there's an alarm."  If I had keys.  I said "No." 
 
Q:  Did you deactivate the alarm for them? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Do you know-- 
 
A:  I don't know how to. 
 
Q:  --if Arnelle did? 
 
A:  She might have.  I don't know.  I wasn't aware of that. I don't 
think so. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  He doesn't want you to guess at anything.  
Just answer what you know. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  When you went--I'm sorry.  Are you finished? 
 
A:  I don't know if Arnelle did then. 
 
Q:  At some point after they banged on Arnelle's door, they took 
you inside the residence? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  How did they get inside? 
 
A:  Arnelle had keys. 
 
Q:  Did you follow them while they were going in? 
 
A:  All of us walked in, right.  I followed them. 
 
Q:  Which door did Arnelle open? 
 
A:  The back door, the back door here (Indicating). 
 
Q:  You are referring to Exhibit 27? 
 
A:  Yes.  The black dot here, the black square. 
 
Q:  There is a little black mark next to the office. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  The patio door, is that where we're 
looking? 
 
THE WITNESS:  No.  There is patio doors here (Indicating), but 
this is the door that would kind of walk into the bar. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  From the outside yard area? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Do you know whether there is a keypad there from which the 
alarm can be deactivated? 
 
A:  I don't think there is.  I'm not aware of it if there is. 
 
Q:  Do you think that's the door that they went through? 
 
A:  Pretty positive that was the door they went through, yes. 
 
Q:  That's the door that you believe Arnelle opened with a key? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And then all of you filed into the room? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And they talked to you some more? 
 
A:  Yes.  There was always someone with me and her at all times, 
and then they--someone pointed out that I should just have a seat 
here, and that was 
a seat at the bar.  But I don't know exactly when because I know I 
was in the kitchen at one point, out of the kitchen, and that's when 
they asked me if I  knew about the Bronco keys were, if there were 
a set of Bronco keys. 
I said "Yeah.  I think there's another set around here somewhere," 
and I helped look through like a drawer or two but never found 
them. 
 
Q:  Do you remember anything else they asked you? 
 
A:  If it was--I think stuff about O.J.'s flight, what time it left.  I 
said he was in Chicago.  Yeah, I mean there's a lot --I mean, if you 
know something, I mean-- 
 
Q:  That's what you can recall right now? 
 
A:  There's that.  There's looking for the keys.  Then at some point 
they told us the news of what happened. 
 
Q:  What did they say? 
 
A:  That Nicole was murdered. 
 
Q:  Who said that? 
 
A:  I think it was on the phone I heard Arnelle scream, and that's 
when I knew something, and then they--came in. 
 
Q:  Who told you Nicole had been murdered? 
 
A:  I don't know if it was Fuhrman or Vannatter. 
 
Q:  Did they ask you if you knew anything about it? 
 
A:  They asked if I knew her.  I said "Yes, I know her," and they 
asked me some questions about her, and I think I explained to them 
how I knew her, and  then I told them-- 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  We are still in the bar area.  Right? 
 
THE WITNESS:  Yes, in the bar area.  See, part of this--where I'm 
at the bar area where I'm at a bar stool with Vannatter taking notes, 
and I can't distinguish exactly the scream, when they came in, 
when I started looking for Bronco keys.  Everything is just so --
happening all at that same time, it seemed like, so I can't tell you 
exactly.  It seemed like I was--sat down right away, though. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Okay.  Did they at any time ask you to show them around the 
house at all? 
 
Q:  No. 
 
Q:  Did they take you through the foyer at all? 
 
A:  At one time, yes. 
 
Q:  For what purpose, if you know? 
 
A:  That's when they said I was going to the police station, and 
then they led me out.  And when they were leading me out, they 
said, "Watch out for the blood," and I went--and I saw blood on the 
ground. 
 
Q:  Where did you see blood? 
 
A:  It was in the foyer.  Drops of blood. 
 
Q:  How many drops did you see? 
 
A:  Quite a few.  It's one of those floors that has--they're the round 
circles to the floor, the wood, and they're like that pegs-- 
 
Q:  Right. 
 
A:  --and they're circles, and they were mixed in with the pegs. 
 
Q:  Right. 
 
A:  And it seemed like there were quite a few.  I can't give you a 
number, but it seemed like with those dots and everything, there 
was quite a few drops of blood. 
 
Q:  Some of the dots were the peg-like markings that are part of the 
flooring.  Right? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  But some were blood. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  About what time was it when you saw the blood in the foyer? 
 
A:  I'm guessing about 6:45, 7:00 a.m.  I'm thinking--I know I was 
waiting on the street for a while for the police to take me down. 
 
Q:  Was that blood in the foyer--did you notice if it was near the 
door to the kitchen? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And what happened after you saw the blood? 
 
A:  I watched my foot, my steps, because I looked down and I 
went, there's blood. 
 
Q:  Had you gotten dressed yet? 
 
A:  I think at one point they let me put on jeans and a shirt.  I don't 
know exactly when, but definitely when I was waiting in the street, 
they let me go and get some clothes on. 
 
Q:  Then they took you down to the station? 
 
A:  No, they didn't.  They said they had a squad coming.  And the 
squad never showed up, but there were squad cars there already, 
and then they just said "You guys take him." 
So the squad they called to take me never did show, and there were 
two other cops in uniforms outside, that were outside on the street.  
They were the ones that eventually took me down there, because 
the people that were supposed to, whoever they were, didn't--
weren't --didn't show up. 
 
Q:  So about what time did you leave to go to the police station? 
 
A:  It seemed like it was about 7:30 a.m. 
 
Q:  And you only made one trip back to your room to get dressed? 
 
A:  Yeah.  I believe so. 
 
Q:  You had an answering machine? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did you check your messages? 
 
A:  At that time, no. 
 
Q:  You did not check. 
 
A:  No.  I didn't check my machine or anything at that--there was-- 
 
Q:  You don't know whether you had any messages at that time.  Is 
that right? 
 
A:  Correct.  I usually don't have any before that time, anyway, so I 
would assume there--don't assume, but... 
 
Q:  When was the next time after you left your room after changing 
that you next were in your room? 
 
A:  After changing? 
 
Q:  Yeah.  You went to the police station. 
When did you next go to your room? 
 
A:  Oh, I don't think I went back in my room until like Monday at 
10:00 at night or 11:00 at night. 
 
Q:  On the 13th. 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Did you check your messages then? 
 
A:  I checked messages from the police station. 
 
Q:  Ah, from a remote? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And did you have any? 
 
A:  I had--the entire tape was filled up.  And I was with the police 
there, and it was so long.  I just heard my mom was crying.  And I 
wasn't aware that it was a big media event yet, so I didn't figure out 
through my mom's message she thought I was dead. 
So someone had told her that the person that was dead was me, and 
so she was leaving this message, and like I couldn't figure out 
exactly what was going on.  So that--I hung up the phone on the 
thing because it was so long, and the police then called me back 
into this room, so I never finished it. 
 
Q:  You didn't listen to all your messages? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did it tell you how many messages you had? 
 
A:  No.  But it's a beep that I could tell that it was like full.  I think 
it's a 15-minute tape. 
 
Q:  How many messages did you listen to? 
 
A:  Maybe two or three. 
 
Q:  Were there any hang-ups? 
 
Q:  Boy, there could have been. 
 
Q:  You don't know? 
 
A:  It doesn't say "hang up."  It just might make a click or-- 
 
Q:  Did you hear any of those when you were listening to your 
messages? 
 
A:  I can't remember.  I can't remember but my mom's. 
 
Q:  Okay.  When you were at the police station, did you give a 
statement to the officers? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And do you remember who took your statement? 
 
Q:  I believe it was Brian Carr and Paul Tippin. 
 
Q:  And you told them about the events of the night before? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did they eventually take you home? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  I was there for a long time.  Eventually-- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  What time did they take you home? 
 
Q:  I think it was 4:00 or 4:30.  It was late afternoon. 
 
Q:  Did they take you to Mr. Simpson's residence? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Where did they take you? 
 
A:  They said to me it's not good for me to go back right now.  It's 
a big huge media thing.  They said, "Where do you want to go?" 
I said.  "Take me to my buddy's house,  Grant's," so they dropped 
me off there.  Grant Cramer. 
 
Q:  How long were you at Grant Cramer's? 
 
A:  I think I was at Grant's house probably from, estimating, 5:00 
until maybe 9:00, 8:30, 9:00. 
 
Q:  Did you get any phone calls from Mr. Simpson during that 
time? 
 
A:  I don't think so. 
 
Q:  Or Cathy Randa? 
 
A:  I got a phone call I think maybe the next day there or was--it 
could have been the same day there at Grant's house, and I think it 
was Cathy Randa.  It could have been that same day. 
 
Q:  What did Cathy Randa say? 
 
A:  That Howard Weitzman wanted to talk to me.  And I don't 
know if she gave me the number or I gave her that number where I 
was at; I don't remember, but I remember talking to him at his 
house, at Grant's house.  Weitzman on the phone, and it was a 
three-way call.  O.J. was on one line, too. 
 
Q:  Now, did that call with Weitzman occur before you went back 
to Rockingham on the 13th or after? 
 
A:  I think it occurred before I went to Rockingham.  I think.  I... 
 
Q:  On the 13th? 
 
A:  I believe so. 
 
Q:  And you said you got back to Rockingham finally on the 13th 
around what time? 
 
A:  I think it was 9:00 or 10:00.  It was later. 
 
Q:  Why did you go back to Rockingham? 
 
A:  I didn't have any clothes.  I thought everybody was wondering, 
where's Kato? Why isn't Kato here, and I didn't want it to seem 
like, God, Kato's not here.  I wonder what he thinks.  One of those 
things where everybody was going to gang up on me.  So I felt like 
it was my--I should go back to the house. 
 
Q:  How did you get there? 
 
A:  I believe Grant took me. 
 
Q:  And you believe as of this time you had spoken to Mr. 
Weitzman and Mr. Simpson on a three-way call? 
 
A:  I think so. 
 
Q:  Tell me about that call. 
 
A:  It was a call where he was asking me about the events again.  
Howard Weitzman asked me what went on and... 
 
Q:  Let me stop you right there. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Let him finish. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  I just want to make sure we have our timing 
right. 
 
THE WITNESS:  Yeah, because this is --I want to think here, 
because I remember talking and, boy, I can't give you the exact 
time in my mind-- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Is this the first time that you had spoken to Mr. Simpson since 
learning about Nicole's murder, was on the telephone in the three-
way call? 
 
A:  Yes.  I believe so. 
 
Q:  Do you remember that, or do you remember seeing Mr. 
Simpson in person for the first time? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS:  What my mind says is I thought I saw him in 
person that night first.  I thought that's what it was. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Okay.  Well, then why don't you tell us about going back to 
Rockingham that evening. 
 
A:  Okay.  So I got dropped off at Rockingham, and I think they let 
me in the gate.  They saw it was me, and they let me in the house-- 
 
Q:  Who is "they"? 
 
Q:  There was people there that I didn't know, and some group was 
all family, and other people that I just did not recognize at all. 
 
Q:  Keep going. 
 
A:  People were continually coming in.  I couldn't tell you from 
day to day when I saw one person, if it was the Monday or a 
Tuesday, because it was like a continual flow of people coming in, 
into the house. 
So I walked into the house, and everybody was in the living room, 
and there were --all three TVs were on.  There was a big screen and 
two TVs above the big screen.  And O.J. was sitting in a chair.  It 
was kind of like--this one is kind of a leather chair, but a big one.  
And I was to the side, and they  were all watching the--I think it 
was KNBC and shouting things to the TV. 
 
Q:  Shouting things? 
 
A:  Well, like "Oh, no, that's not true," or  that--I don't know the 
exact things, but, "What are they saying"-- 
 
Q:  What were they watching?  Coverage of the-- 
 
A:  Coverage of the whole case going 
 
Q:  Okay.  Continue. 
 
A:  So I was back behind-- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  Object.  Narrative. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  You can keep going. 
 
A:  So I was behind the chair where O.J. was, and I just remember 
him with a tissue with blood on a finger, and I just was like in my 
head thinking, oh, I didn't want to be right there at that time. 
And I remember O.J. saying something like, "Well, Kato knows 
where I was." It was a thing about the McDonald's, I think, on TV.  
And someone said, "Kato's right there," and then O.J. looked, and I 
said, "I'm sorry about what happened and about Nicole," and it was 
me saying that. 
And I think I went into the kitchen then and-- 
 
Q:  Before you went in the kitchen, when O.J. said.  "Kato knows 
where I was," did you say anything back to him about that 
comment? 
 
A:  No.  I think I was quiet.  I was pretty much quiet the entire 
time.  I wasn't feeling good, and I was shook up from everything. 
 
Q:  Did you see blood on his finger? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Where? 
 
A:  If I remember, I thought he had a tissue on this finger 
(Indicating). 
 
Q:  Like a paper tissue? 
 
A:  I think it was paper towel. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  What finger are you pointing to? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Middle one. 
 
THE WITNESS:  This one, middle (Indicating). 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  Middle finger-- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Middle finger, left hand?  So you saw blood on his finger. 
 
A:  I saw the blood coming through the tissue. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Did you ask him how he-- 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  --how he got cut? 
 
A:  No.  I didn't.  I didn't bring it up. 
 
Q:  Why not? 
 
A:  Just didn't.  Scared. 
 
Q:  You were scared. 
 
A:  Yeah.  I just didn't want to think bad thoughts. 
 
Q:  You were thinking bad thoughts 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  What bad thoughts were you thinking when you saw the blood 
on O.J. Simpson's finger? 
 
A:  I thought it was possibly that something --O.J. could have done 
something. 
 
Q:  You mean like murdered his wife? 
 
A:  Possible.  I mean it crossed my mind. 
 
Q:  You then--By the way, at that point did you associate back to 
the noises that you heard the night before? 
 
A:  Everything-- 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS:  I thought of everything possible,  and I was 
getting sick to my stomach with everything.  I just was thinking 
about the events of everything and going, why did I hear that, why 
did I do this, and the setting the alarm--everything, I was just 
trying to figure out.  I was going, no, it can't be, and just all that 
stuff was adding up. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  How did you feel in that roomful of people? 
 
A:  I wanted to go away, just myself.  It was nothing against any of 
the people.  I just wanted to get out.  I didn't feel good about being 
there. 
 
Q:  Did you feel pressure? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS:  It was just an uneasy feeling, that I wanted to go 
and get out of the house. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Okay.  But you didn't go out of the house, you said. 
 
A:  No.  Well, I left many times.  I was there.  I never--I--slept in 
the room again.  I kind of gave my room up.  I slept--when I stayed 
there.  Other times I slept at Grant's house or a friend's house 
during that time, and I didn't go really back into my room.  I gave 
it up to the family, O.J.'s family members. 
 
Q:  You said you went into the kitchen. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  What did you do in the kitchen? 
 
A:  Either I was in the kitchen first or O.J. was in the kitchen, but 
we both ended up in the kitchen. 
 
Q:  Alone?    
 
A:  Yes.  I mean, there's people in the house.  In the kitchen alone. 
 
Q:  You and O.J. Simpson were in the kitchen alone. 
 
A:  Right.  I think it was condolences I started giving again, and 
then I propped myself up on the kitchen sink.  I kind of hung over.  
And I believe O.J. just said, "You know I went into the house from 
McDonald's."  And I-- 
 
Q:  Excuse me.  What did he say? 
 
A:  "You know I went into the house after McDonald's." 
 
Q:  Okay. 
 
A:  And I said--I believe I said, "No, I didn't see you go in," and 
that was it. 
 
Q:  What did he do? 
 
A:  I don't think I--I think that was the end of the conversation.  
Maybe he went back into that room or I took off. 
And I think I just said, "O.J., I didn't see you go in there.  I didn't 
see you go in the house.  I didn't" 
 
Q:  Did he say anything back to you? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS:  I don't remember right now. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  And what happened after that?  Did you or he leave the 
kitchen? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS:  Something came up.  Either someone came in or 
there was a disruption.  I went to my room.  I don't remember right 
now. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:  Remember, he doesn't want you to--
anything you don't recall, he doesn't want you to testify to. 
 
THE WITNESS:  Right. 
Okay.  I just don't remember right now. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Okay.  But you spent the evening there.  Is that right? 
 
A:  I think I did.  I think I did.  I think I slept on the floor next to 
Gigi. 
 
Q:  Now, the next day did you go anywhere? 
 
A:  Yes.  That next day I went to Robert --to O.J.'s business, where 
Skip Taft and Robert Shapiro were. 
 
Q:  Who took you there? 
 
Q:  Arnelle and a guy named Jonah, a friend of hers. 
 
Q:  Okay.  What time did you go? 
 
A:  It was nighttime.  I think it was about 7:00 
 
Q:  Before you went there, had you already spoken to Mr. Simpson 
and Mr. Weitzman on the three-way call? 
 
A:  I think so.  I think there was a call about the meeting.  I don't 
remember if it was Cathy Randa set it up or--there was a 
conversation, though.  At the time, I just don't know. 
 
Q:  Do you remember where you were during that conversation? 
 
A:  I thought I was at Grant Cramer's house. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Well, tell us as best you can recall what was said in that 
conversation with Mr. Simpson and Mr. Weitzman and yourself. 
 
A:  I believe that he was saying that I was gonna be at a meeting, if 
I had a problem going to-- talking to Skip Taft I think at that time 
to talk about the events of the night and about O.J. and Nicole, 
their relationship. 
I said.  "No.  I don't have a problem.  I'll go." 
And I--the part of it was O.J. saying to me.  "Just tell the truth."  
And some of the other dialogue.  I just can't remember.  I don't 
remember it being very long. 
And then I remember going back to the house for some--at some 
point to the Rockingham house and more people being there, and 
one comment of--that a person made just sticks out in my mind. 
 
Q:  What comment was that? 
 
A:  A guy named Mark Slotnik? 
 
Q:  Slotkin or Slotnik? 
 
A:  Mark Slotkin.  If I saw the face, I'd know it, but I think it's 
Slotkin.  Said --there were many people in the room, and I was 
going to meet with Shapiro and Skip Taft, and I had met him 
before, Mark Slotnik-- 
 
Q:  Slotkin? 
 
A:  Slotkin.  I had met him before, seen him before, and I met him-
-I didn't know him well enough--you know.  I never had hung out 
with the guy and all that, but he knew my name and he just said.  
"It's O.J., man.  Get your story straight.  It's O.J.  Get your story 
straight."  And I got so scared from--I couldn't figure out why he 
was saying that to me, because he didn't know me. 
 
Q:  Did you say anything back to him? 
 
A:  "Oh, okay.  And the whole time this was going on, I was just 
sick to my stomach.  Went down to the office to meet those guys.  I 
went down to the office to meet those guys, and they did an 
interview with me. 
 
Q:  Who interviewed you? 
 
A:  Robert Shapiro and Skip Taft. 
 
Q:  And you? 
 
A:  And myself. 
 
Q:  Anyone else in the room? 
 
A:  No.  A call came in from O.J., but they asked me to leave the 
room. 
 
Q:  And did you? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did you overhear the call? 
 
A:  I thought I heard something going on. 
 
Q:  What did you hear? 
 
A:  About how Kato was doing.  And I think that during a part of 
it, part of the interview, a call came in.  I think at that time they 
were getting Henry Lee.  I think already they were getting 
specialists.  That's all I can remember right now. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Well, we will have to stop here for the tape 
change.  Okay?  We will take a short break. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  This is the end of tape No. 2.  The time 
is approximately 3:18, and we are off the record. 
 
(Recess.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are on the record.  The time is 
approximately 3:37.  This is the beginning of tape No. 3, 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Mr. Kaelin, tell us as best as you can recall everything that was 
said in the discussion with Shapiro and Taft. 
 
A:  Okay.  It started with a kind of a history of how I met Nicole; it 
went into the move from Nicole's to O.J.'s; it went into that night 
of events; it went into history, I think, of fighting of O.J. and 
Nicole; and then it ended with--I have that--the questions they 
asked me.  I'm trying to think-- 
 
Q:  What do you mean, you have the questions they asked you? 
 
A:  The DA's office gave me a thing-- 
 
Q:  Transcription? 
 
A:  A transcript of it.  And basically all the events of that night, 
they went into and talked to me about that. 
 
Q:  And then you left?   
 
A:  Yeah, then I took off.  I called back at the house and said I was 
done, and Arnelle and Jonah picked me up again. 
 
Q:  You went back to Rockingham? 
 
A:  Went back to Rockingham. 
 
Q:  And did you stay there? 
 
A:  I don't know if I stayed or not.  I stayed one of the nights, 
maybe two of the nights.  I can't distinguish exactly what nights I 
stayed there.  I could have stayed that night at the Rockingham 
house, but then again I could have headed over to Grant Cramer's 
that night. 
 
Q:  Why did you leave Rockingham. 
 
A:  I didn't want to be there. 
 
Q:  Why not? 
 
A:  I just had an uneasy feeling and-- 
 
Q:  About what? 
 
A:  Of being in the house. 
 
Q:  Why? 
 
A:  Well, it was a few things:  It was seeing so many people that I 
didn't know and everybody that knew me.  It was seeing people 
make comments to me,  from Mark Slotkin to just other people that 
were all, "Come on, Kato."  Just statements.  I mean, that one with 
Slotkin sticks out, but it was kind of a bunch of people I didn't 
know making comments to me about what went on when no one 
knew exactly what went on because I didn't tell anybody about all 
these events.  So no one knew anything but me. 
 
Q:  What kind of comments were people making to you at 
Rockingham? 
 
A:  There was a lot of shouting at TV reporters, just, "How can you 
say that?"  It was just a lot of--there was a lot of people in the 
house, and I, thought it would be better if I wasn't there, to giving 
them more room to people. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  This is on the 14th, we're talking about? 
 
THE WITNESS:  I believe it was the 14th. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  14th.  Right?  After Shapiro and Taft? 
 
A:  There were people all week for quite a while. 
 
Q:  This was after the Shapiro-Taft interview? 
 
A:  Yeah.  Well, it happened after the Shapiro--the next day, and 
even before the Shapiro-Taft interview there were always people 
there. 
 
Q:  And you were not feeling comfortable? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  And then you moved out? 
 
A:  I--yeah, I pretty much--my stuff was still there for a bit, but 
two of my friends picked it all up when I got a place. 
 
Q:  Let's go back in time now to when you first--no.  Let me back 
up for a second. 
Had you ever in all the time that you knew O.J. Simpson --which 
was what length of time did you know O.J. Simpson? 
 
A:  About a year, a year and three months . 
 
Q:  Prior to what? 
 
A:  When I met Nicole.  I met O.J. probably in February of '93. 
 
Q:  So from the time you met O.J. Simpson in February of '93 until 
Nicole's death in June of '94 is about a year and three months.  
Right? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  And during that year and three months, you lived at Gretna 
Green in the year 1993.  Correct? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  And you moved to Rockingham when? 
 
A:  In January of '94. 
 
Q:  So during this entire time that you knew O.J. Simpson and 
during the time that you lived at Rockingham, how many times did 
you and Mr. Simpson go out together alone? 
 
A:  From the time even on Gretna Green to that time of Nicole s 
death, maybe once, twice.  Just us two? 
 
Q:  Yeah, just the two of you alone. 
 
A:  Right now I can't think of any at all, so I'm assuming maybe 
once. 
 
Q:  Don't assume anything. 
 
A:  Maybe never. 
 
Q:  Except for the McDonald's trip? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  That's the only time? 
 
A:  Alone, yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  So the two of you never did anything as friends alone 
together, like go to the ball game or-- 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  --anything like that? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  And did the two of you ever--did he ever invite you for dinner 
in the house together? 
 
A:  Yeah.  I had a dinner when Michelle would cook up like a 
special chicken.  It would be--I could come in for that, and O.J. 
would be at the table.  So I got an invite for that. 
 
Q:  How many times did that happen, where you and he ate alone 
in the Rockingham house? 
 
A:  Just he and I alone? 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
A:  Two times, two or three times maybe. 
 
Q:  During the time you were living there? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  And all told, do you have any estimation of how many hours 
you've ever spent with O.J. Simpson alone or with others? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  Just so that I'm clear, are we talking 
about the time before he moved into the-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah, starting from February of '93 all the 
way until Nicole's death. 
 
Q:  What are we talking about? 
 
A:  Total time of spending time together-- I want to distinguish 
from spending time to actually seeing him.  If you could just 
maybe be more specific. 
 
Q:  Seeing him--well, spending time together. 
 
A:  Because seeing him would be different, right.  If he saw if I just 
waved and he drove off, that would be different. 
 
Q:  No.  I mean spending time together in his company. 
 
A:  You know, like 48 hours, 72 hours, around there. 
 
Q:  Total? 
 
A:  Total. 
 
Q:  Most of that with other people? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Now, you first met Nicole in Aspen? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  In December of what? 
 
A:  Of '92. 
 
Q:  And you spent some time with her and her friends and your 
friends.  Right? 
 
A:  I didn't spend too much time with her really.  My buddy did. 
 
Q:  And how did it come to be that you came to live in her house in 
Gretna Green? 
 
A:  My friend at that time was seeing her, you know, somewhat, 
and he said that she's throwing a party-- 
 
Q:  Who is this friend? 
 
A:  Grant Cramer.  He said.  "She's throwing a party, so why don't 
we go to it." 
I said.  "Oh, okay, Nicole from Aspen." I wasn't--you know, I 
wasn't really keeping in touch. 
 
Q:  When you met Nicole in Aspen, did you know that she was the 
former wife of O.J. Simpson? 
 
A:  I didn't know it until Grant Cramer told me. 
 
Q:  In Aspen? 
 
A:  Yeah.  I didn't know it for quite a few hours.  Then he said, "Do 
you know who that is and who I've [sic] been talking to?" 
 
Q:  I went.  "No." 
 
Q:  How many days did you spend with Nicole and Grant in Aspen 
in '92, December? 
 
A:  I didn't spend too much time with them at all.  They were 
together almost the entire time with Faye Resnick. 
 
Q:  Did Nicole talk to you about O.J. Simpson at all during that 
trip? 
 
A:  No.  I mean, they were divorced.  I think, but there wasn't too 
much talk about that.  She was talking about some other guy. 
 
Q:  Do you know his name? 
 
A:  His name was Brett. 
 
Q:  Brett Shaves? 
 
A:  I think that's his name. 
 
Q:  And you came back to L.A. and sometime got an invite to a 
party? 
 
A:  Yes.  When I saw Nicole in Aspen, the times I did see her I was 
always kinda goofing off and making her laugh and just being the 
third wheel.  You know, if they were together.  I was just the comic 
relief. 
 
Q:  Were you attracted to her sexually? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  You came back to Los Angeles, and you went to her party.  Is 
that what you said? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And when did that happen? 
 
A:  I think that happened two weeks after Aspen, so I'm thinking 
sometime in January. 
 
Q:  Where was the party? 
 
A:  At the Gretna Green house. 
 
Q:  And did you talk to her that evening? 
 
A:  Yeah.  I talked to her a lot that evening.  I mean, there was a lot 
of people there, but it was like kind of a reunion, so we got--I think 
I got more attention. 
 
Q:  Did you spend any private time with her that evening? 
 
A:  I think the private time, if it ever came up, was when I saw the 
guesthouse. 
 
Q:  That night? 
 
A:  That night. 
 
Q:  Tell me about that conversation when you saw the guesthouse. 
 
A:  So we got to the party, and it was pretty much packed, and 
there was a bartender and there was food everywhere.  It was like, 
oh, my God, I can't  believe this.  I was expecting a quarter barrel, 
and you know, that kind of party, but it was like a classy party.  I'm 
going, "Oh, my God, there's salmon and all."  I go, "I'm not used to 
this kind of party." 
So we ate, and then just jokes throughout the whole night, and then 
I saw the house back there, and I said, "Who lives back there?" I 
go.  "What a great pad." 
She goes.  "No one lives there."  I said, "Oh, could I?"  And I was 
kind of  joking. 
And she goes.  "Yeah."  And I said.  "No, no.  I'm serious.  Can I 
live there?" 
And she says.  "Yeah, I'm serious, too.  You can have that place, 
and we'll work out some deal." 
I went--I kept going, "I'm really serious.  I'm gonna do this."  And I 
was living in Hermosa at the time.  And that was pretty much it.  
Because I called like the next day or two.  I said, "I  hope you still 
remember," da, da, da.  And she goes, "Yeah.  Come check it out."  
I checked it out again there, and she goes, "You have to move out 
all the furniture, though."  They had all this furniture and a 
treadmill and I think a Stairmaster.  It was packed with stuff.  She 
said, "If you move it all out, you can have the place." 
 
Q:  Okay.  And you moved in shortly thereafter? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And you lived there for the rest of '93? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And during that period of time did you get--did you become 
close friends with Nicole? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  What kind--How much time did you spend with Nicole alone? 
 
A:  There was times when I--the kids would always be around 
when I spent most of my time with Nicole.  We never really had--it 
would be if Nicole went out, I'd watch the kids.  But sometimes 
she would come by and talk to me about the night or just have 
times when the kids went to bed and I could come in.  There was 
total access to the house if I wanted it.  So if she was around to 
talk.  she'd come downstairs and just talk to me. 
 
Q:  Did you have a key to get in the main house? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And did you and she eat dinners together? 
 
A:  Yeah, I ate dinners with their family and-- 
 
Q:  You baby-sit the kids? 
 
Q:  Many times, yes 
 
Q:  Did she discuss with you personal matters? 
 
A:  Sometimes.  yes.  
 
Q:  Did she share with you stories about men she was dating? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Who did she talk to you about as the year progressed? 
 
A:  About guys? 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
A:  One of the guys was obviously Grant at that time, and he was 
seeing someone else at the time, and one of the conversations was 
that he wasn't gonna see her anymore and that she told me he's 
never allowed in this house, and I went--"He can never come over, 
and if he comes over, you have to leave."  She told me that. 
So I went, "Okay."  So I told Grant that, and he went "Fine," so he 
never came by. 
The stuff about Brett Shaves, she had said that when she was in 
Aspen, he was starting to bug her, so she wanted to get rid of him, 
and I guess did by starting to see Grant. 
I didn't know too much about a guy named Joseph.  She had 
mentioned a guy Joseph, that they were friends.  I didn't know 
where it was in the relationship, but they seemed to be more 
friends than like daters, dating, and they kept in touch, I think, 
and... 
 
Q:  Did she tell you about a guy named [Name Deleted}? 
 
A:  I didn't know too much about dating a guy named [Name 
Deleted] . 
 
Q:  She never discussed [Name Deleted] with you? 
 
A:  Because I think she had mentioned something that she had seen 
him or not, but I looked and I thought, no way that guy was her 
type.  So I didn't--until she told me--I think she told me, but it 
wasn't a thing that I had thought, this guy that she used to date.  I 
think she brought it up once or twice. 
 
Q:  What about Marcus Allen?  Did she discuss him with you?  
 
A:  She said certain things about Marcus at different parts of the 
relationship:  That Marcus was--liked her more than she liked 
Marcus, and that I think it might have changed at one point, but at 
that time when I was there, it was kind of Marcus liking her more. 
 
Q:  You re talking about when you were living at Gretna Green in 
'93? 
 
A:  Gretna Green. 
 
Q:  She told you that she was seeing Marcus Allen and that he 
liked her more than she liked him. 
 
A:  Yeah, at certain parts.  At certain times of weeks and months 
that he came by sometimes. 
 
Q:  Do you know when it was that she was dating him? 
 
A:  No.  I can't give you--I don't want to take a guess.  but I 
thought April.   
 
Q:  Did she say anything to you about whether Mr. Simpson 
should or should not know about her relationship with Marcus 
Allen? 
 
A:  I--yeah, that she shouldn't know --O.J. should not know about 
Marcus ever coming by, and if he ever came by, he would park 
somewhere different. 
 
Q:  Who would? 
 
A:  Marcus. 
 
Q:  Did she ever tell you not to tell Mr. Simpson about people who 
were there,  like Marcus Allen? 
 
A:  Well.  I tried not to--I mean, I knew kind of what was going on, 
but I wasn't going to say anything.  I mean, I don't know what they 
were doing behind the closed doors and that, so I didn't-- 
 
Q:  But she didn't tell you not to say anything to O.J.? 
 
A:  She didn't like say.  "Don't say a thing."  I think she was more 
like, "Boy, O.J. would go crazy or something he knew Marcus was 
here." 
 
Q:  In time did Nicole start to talk to you about her relationship 
with O.J.  Simpson? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And did those conversations progress through the year? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Was there a time when they intensified? 
 
A:  There were points when the conversations would--she would 
say some intense things certain days and then say it again maybe 
three days later and say certain things, and I'd go "Really," things 
that I--like, "Kato you're being videotaped." 
And I go, "What?"  And my phones were tapped.  And she had said 
that O.J.  would kill her one day.  She said this. 
 
Q:  She told you those things. 
 
A:  She said this. 
 
Q:  Nicole Simpson told you that you were being videotaped by 
whom? 
 
A:  By O.J. 
 
Q:  And what else did you say?  Somebody was spying on you? 
 
A:  She said --yeah, that "Your phone's tapped"-- 
 
Q:  Who? 
 
A:  She was talking about O.J. 
 
Q:  That O.J. was spying on you, tapping your phones? 
 
A:  Spying or that my phones were probably tapped.  And I would 
say.  "Why?"  
 
Q:  What did she say? 
 
A:  "Because he's jealous."  I said "Of me?" 
 
Q:  What did she say? 
 
A:  "Probably."  I mean, it was-- 
 
Q:  Did you and she ever have a romantic relationship? 
 
A:  Never. 
 
Q:  At any time? 
 
Q:  Never. 
 
Q:  Did you ever kiss her affectionately-- 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  --romantically? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you ask her why O.J. Simpson would be jealous of you? 
 
A:  I'm sure I brought that up, but I would be going things like, 
"He'd be jealous of me?"  Like that, and I think it was kind of just 
the reply would  be, "Yeah," and it would end there. 
 
Q:  Now, you said Nicole told you that O.J. Simpson said that she--
excuse me.  You said that Nicole told you that O.J. Simpson told 
her that he would kill her. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN:  I don't think that properly characterizes the 
answer. 
 
THE WITNESS:  Say it-- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  I didn't mean to, so I must have misunderstood you.  Why don't 
you give me that testimony again. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN:  You want to read it back? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  No. 
 
Q:  You can tell it to me again.  What did she say--what did Nicole 
tell you about O.J. Simpson in that regard? 
 
A:  In sometimes talking with her, she said that she thought O.J. 
would kill her one day. 
 
Q:  Oh, she thought O.J. Simpson would kill her. 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  Did she ever say that O.J. Simpson said that to her? 
 
A:  No, 
 
Q:  Are you sure? 
 
A:  I--he--it could have been said that way, I mean, I know that she 
said that she thought O.J. was going to kill her one day and that 
O.J. might have --she might have said that O.J. was going to kill 
her one day.  I think.  I can't be 100 percent positive, but it could 
have been part of the dialogue. 
 
Q:  Did you ask her why she thought that? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  What did she tell you? 
 
A:  That he was jealous, jealous of her. 
 
Q:  Dating other men? 
 
A:  Partly dating other men. 
 
Q:  And partly what else? 
 
A:  I think being independent. 
 
Q:  That's what she told you? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  When you say you "think," can we go 
back to your question what she told you? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Is that what Nicole told you, that O.J. Simpson was partly--was 
jealous in part because she was dating other men and in part 
because she was independent? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  Again, leading. 
 
THE WITNESS:  There is a thing that she thought if she was--at 
certain times in the relationship, if she could be not needing O.J., 
she said that would be driving him crazy because...  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Nicole told you that if she could not be needing O.J., that 
would drive him crazy.  Is that right? 
 
A:  Right.  Because she would say to me that O.J. likes to 
manipulate.  So he was going to manipulate other people around 
her and herself.  So she would say that he was the king of 
manipulators, and so he could manipulate people. 
 
Q:  And  what did Nicole tell you would drive O.J. crazy? 
 
A:  I think it was if she didn't need him anymore. 
 
Q:  These conversations occurred on an ongoing basis? 
 
A:  Not ongoing.  It would be --it would happen certain times when 
she would have hot tea at the end of the night, on certain nights. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you why she and O.J. Simpson got divorced? 
 
A:  I think because--I think O.J. was seeing Paula at the time or 
there was another woman. 
 
Q:  Another woman? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Is that all she told you? 
 
A:  That I can remember right now, yes. 
 
Q:  Did Nicole Simpson ever talk to you about having been beaten 
by O.J.  Simpson? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  What did she say to you about that? 
 
A:  She told me about in 19---I think it was in New Year's Eve she 
talked about a party that O.J. beat her up.  I believe it was the '89--I 
don't know if that's the '89 911 call, but it was an incident in '89, 
and I think I remember it being a New Year's Eve party, where she 
talked about getting beat up by O.J., and that's the one that I 
remember. 
 
Q:  Where were you and Nicole when she told you about this 
beating? 
 
A:  I believe right at the kitchen table at Gretna Green. 
 
Q:  When did that conversation occur? 
 
A:  Like just at night, like 10:00 o'clock or so.  It was-- 
 
Q:  What date? 
 
A:  Oh, when I was in Gretna Green.  During the time I heard it 
more than once; that, you know, if I we had tea one night, she 
would bring it up again  about possibly getting back, and she didn't 
want to get beat again, and so it was that story would come back.  I 
heard it probably in March and in April. 
 
Q:  She would talk to you about whether or not to go back with 
O.J. Simpson? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And in that--excuse me.  In conversing about that, she would 
bring up that she didn't want to get beat up again? 
 
A:  Yes.  It was that, and she had told me that sometimes O.J. had 
other women, and she didn't like--she had told me that in all the 
time she was with O.J. that she never cheated once and that she 
said she was totally faithful to O.J. during the relationship, and she 
couldn't understand why he didn't stay faithful, and caught him 
with other women. 
 
Q:  Nicole told you that she caught O.J. with other women during 
their marriage? 
 
A:  Well, one that I know. 
 
Q:  Who? 
 
A:  I don't know who the girl was, but it was at the--his house on 
Rockingham one time when they were married. 
 
Q:  Did Nicole ever talk to you about O.J. Simpson's treatment of 
her while she was pregnant? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  What did she say to you about that subject? 
 
A:  At certain points when she was pregnant, O.J. said, "You re 
fat," and I think, "You're looking like a pig" or "You're getting fat." 
 
Q:  When Nicole told you these things, did you ever tell them to 
O.J.  Simpson? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  You were Nicole's friend then? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  During the times of these conversations,  did you know O.J. 
Simpson? 
 
A:  Did I--I met him. 
 
Q:  Did you know O.J. Simpson? 
 
A:  I--yeah, I knew--yeah.  I met him like in February. 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
A:  But I didn't really hang out. 
 
Q:  No, but what I am asking you is:  When she was talking to you 
about these stories about O.J. Simpson that you're relating, did you 
know who she was talking about? 
 
A:  Oh, yes. 
 
Q:  Had you met the man? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  What did --Strike that.  Did Nicole tell you how she had been 
beaten New Year's Eve, 1989? 
 
A:  Yeah.  I think she said she got pushed around and got hit. 
 
Q:  Hit where? 
 
A:  In the face. 
 
Q:  She told you that? 
 
A:  Yeah, I'm pretty sure 
 
Q:  Did she say how O.J. Simpson hit her in the face? 
 
A:  With his hand. 
 
Q:  Did she say what happened to her as a result of being beaten? 
 
A:  Yeah.  That she got bruised up, and she had--something was 
fractured.  I think she fractured part of her head. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And did she--I'm sorry.  Had you completed your 
answer? 
 
A:  Yes.  That she had fractured her head.  I think it was from a fall 
or from a hit. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you whether the police had come out that evening? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  What did she say about that? 
 
A:  That the police came out there, and I think she said she was in 
her underwear and bra, and the police came by.  I think the cop 
gave her a coat or something like that.  And said "O.J.'s beating 
me," or something like that. 
And they said something like "Don't let him off," or--don't know 
the exact words.  Like, "He did it, so take him in," or something 
like that. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you whether or not the police took him in? 
 
A:  I think they did not.  So-- 
 
Q:  What did she tell you? 
 
A:  I think she said, "The cops didn't take him in.  They said it was 
O.J.  Simpson, so they didn't want to take him in." 
 
Q:  That's what she told you? 
 
A:  I'm pretty positive .  It was in reference to him being O.J. 
Simpson. 
 
Q:  And getting special treatment? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  That's leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Did she tell you whether or not the police pressed charges? 
 
A:  That they didn't 
 
Q:  They did not? 
 
A:  That--I don't know how it works, but thought that she didn't 
press the charges.  I don't know if the person has to press the 
charges, but there was no charges pressed. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you why she did not press charges? 
 
Q:  I think because O.J. came outside, and I think there was like a--
they reconciled it.  I don't know if the police had talked--I don't 
know the  exact-- 
 
Q:  What I am asking you, Mr. Kaelin, is what she said to you.  
Okay? Just-- 
 
A:  The dialogue, I can't remember. 
 
Q:  Okay.  But the substance of it, did she say anything to you 
about why she had not pursued legal action against him? 
 
A:  I don't remember the answer. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you about any other beatings? 
 
A:  Specifically I think there was another beating, but I can't 
remember the beating offhand.  I remember there might have been 
something where mentioned about --or she found a woman in the 
guesthouse one time, and I don't know if there was a beating or not, 
but it was I think when she was pregnant, but I don't know if there 
was a beating involved. 
 
Q:  And you are relating to me what Nicole told you? 
 
A:  What Nicole had said. 
 
Q:  To you? 
 
A:  Yes, to me. 
 
Q:  During these conversations that you have been relating, was 
there anyone else present? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did Nicole ever discuss with you the effect of the beatings on 
her children? 
 
A:  Yeah.  She said that she thought Sydney --I used to say, "God, 
Sydney's like six or so or seven," and she has this thing called a 
"nuck" or whatever.  It was a blanket, and she'd suck these fingers 
at all times, and she said she--Nicole would say that she's doing 
that, she was like desensitized from all the shouting that went on, 
and she could sleep through all the fighting, and that's amazing. 
 
Q:  That's what Nicole told you? 
 
A:  That's what Nicole told me. 
 
Q:  Did she ever tell you whether either Sydney or Justin had ever 
witnessed a beating? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  There was one-- 
 
MR. SIMPSON:  He said one beating. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  There is one beating that he's talked 
about.  When you say "beating" and "beatings"-- 
You've got to be quiet, O.J. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  I just said "witnessed a beating." 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  Well.  you talked about beatings when 
you were talking about this. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  MR. Simpson needs to not talk, because it 
could have an effect on the witness. 
 
Q:  But in any event, what my question was, is-- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  If I could control Mr. Simpson... 
 
(Pending question read as follows: 
 
Q.  Did she ever tell you whether either Sydney or Justin had ever 
witnessed a beating?" 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  You may answer. 
 
A:  I believe Nicole said Sydney had seen a beating or a very big 
argument at one time and went right to bed and was--she was 
relating that she was used to it, the arguments, and Sydney would 
go to bed and sleep through it. 
 
Q:  Did Nicole ever tell you whether or not she ever received 
medical treatment for a beating by O.J. Simpson? 
 
A:  I believe that was when she got a fractured skull, and she went 
to the hospital, and it was from--I don't know if it was a fall or it 
was from the hit, but it was related to the beating, to the fight they 
had, that she injured something, that I believe it was a fractured 
skull. 
 
Q:  Did Nicole tell you what she informed the doctor when she 
went to seek medical treatment? 
 
A:  What she informed the doctor. 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A:  I believe it was a fractured skull. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you whether she told the doctor that she had 
suffered it as a result of a beating? 
 
A:  I don't think she did. 
 
Q:  What did she tell you in that regard? 
 
A:  I believe it was that she got it from a fall, and she didn't admit 
to the beating. 
 
Q:  That's what I'm trying to find out, whether or not she told the 
doctor about the meeting--excuse me--about the beating. 
 
A:  She didn't tell the doctor about the beating.  It was from 
something else.  What it was, I don't remember. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  I'm really having trouble concentrating with 
Mr. Simpson's talking. 
 
Q:  You're telling me that Nicole told you that she told the doctor 
that the injuries occurred from something else. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Not the beating. 
 
A:  To the doctor.  She was telling--she was basically lying to the 
doctor of what really happened. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you why she had done so? 
 
A:  I think she was embarrassed. 
 
Q:  Are these conversations that Nicole had with you after a time 
that you and she got close? 
 
A:  Yeah.  I believe in our relationship we got close pretty fast, 
though.  I mean, it was the thing that she trusted me with her 
children, so I thought it was--that's what the basis was, that she saw 
that I was trusting with the kids, and I think that made her open up 
to tell me things.  So I think, you know, she opened up --she 
trusted me in telling me things. 
 
Q:  How do you know she trusted you? 
 
A:  I think anybody that's a mother that would give their kids to me 
while she went out would have to be pretty trusting of me. 
 
Q:  Mothers leave their children with baby-sitters they've never 
met before. 
 
A:  I think that.  I think having the key to the house.  I think she 
felt comfortable, if there was money laying around, she knew I 
would never take  anything.  I just think the little things just made 
her trust me. 
 
Q:  Did you and she spend many hours talking together? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  Did Nicole ever express her feelings for you? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  What did she say to you? 
 
A:  She had told me one day that--one night that--she goes, "I think 
I'm falling in love with you." 
And I said, "No, no, no, you're not.  We're friends and that's"--at 
one point she had said that, but I knew--I thought it was just--it 
couldn't be.  I thought it was just she had said because I was good 
with the kids.  And I was on a date when it happened, and she said 
I was so polite opening the door and all that stuff, and I went--and I 
had the date in the room, so I said "No." 
 
Q:  When Nicole told you that she thought she was falling in love 
with you, did you think she was kidding around? 
 
A:  I thought it was somewhat--I knew it wasn't--she wasn't falling 
in love like "Let's get married" love, so-- 
 
Q:  You thought it was a joke? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  Can I just have the last of the last answer 
because you answered--your question came out on the heels. 
 
(Answer read from Page 284, Line 24 to Page 282, Line 9.) 
 
THE WITNESS:  That's enough.  That sounded too much like me. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN:  That sounds like a hit rap song. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Okay, let's go back. 
 
Q:  What I am trying to find out is when Nicole told you that she 
thought she was falling in love with you, do you think she was 
expressing real feelings to you, or was she joking with you? 
How did you take and understand her statements? 
 
A:  Okay.  Now, I took it as not a joke, but it wasn't plausible for it 
to ever happen because I wasn't attracted to her in a romantic way, 
and I think  that's pretty much where it stopped. 
 
Q:  You were not attracted to her. 
 
A:  Was not attracted to her romantically.  And the period after 
that, it was like no talking for a week because I had said that. 
 
Q:  What did you say to Nicole when she said she thought she was 
falling in love with you? 
 
A:  That it couldn't happen.  "I could not be romantic with you, and 
I think at this moment you're just saying that," because it was a 
night that we had gone out and had drinks. 
 
Q:  You and Nicole? 
 
A:  I wasn't really drinking.  Nicole had some drinks. 
 
Q:  Where did you and Nicole go that evening? 
 
A:  It was four people. 
 
Q:  Who went? 
 
A:  It was my friend Kelly, and Nicole was with Marcus Allen and 
myself. 
 
Q:  Is Kelly a woman? 
 
A:  Kelly's a woman. 
 
Q:  What's Kelly's last name? 
 
A:  No idea. 
 
Q:  Did Nicole make this comment to you about falling in love 
before or after you had drinks? 
 
A:  After. 
 
Q:  When was this? 
 
A:  This happened when I was living at Gretna Green.  I would say 
it happened maybe in April, May. 
 
Q:  1993? 
 
A:  1993. 
 
Q:  Do you believe, based on living with Nicole, that she felt 
comfortable being with you? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did she ever undress in front or you? 
 
A:  Not undress in front of me, but she was at the pool topless. 
 
Q:  Knowing you were around? 
 
A:  Well, I mean, I think she just did it anyways.  I think she knew 
I was around.  But like when I had my daughter there and she 
would do it, my daughter would just go, "Why is she doing that?" 
I said, "It's okay.  We'll walk out," and we'd walk out, head down.  
It wasn't --she just did it. 
 
Q:  Did there come a time when--Well, first of all, have you told 
me everything that you can remember about Nicole being beaten 
by O.J. Simpson that Nicole told you? 
 
A:  From this moment right now, from what I can think of, I can't--
that s it, but... 
 
Q:  Did there come a time when Nicole told you that she was 
attempting a reconciliation with O.J. Simpson? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Do you remember when that was? 
 
A:  It could have been in May, but I think I mentioned before that 
it was a constant kind of reconciliation in the time I was at Gretna 
Green. 
 
Q:  The first time, I'm talking about. 
 
A:  The first time was probably in March, reconciliation in March. 
 
Q:  When you moved into Gretna Green-- 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  --was there a time where Nicole was not seeing Mr. Simpson? 
 
A:  Yeah.  It was January, February he would come by and get the 
kids.  I believe-- 
 
Q:  I meant, you know trying to reconcile with him.  Was there a 
few months where there wasn't any effort to reconcile? 
 
A:  I thought maybe the first three months, although he came by 
and got the kids and that.  but there was no contact that I remember 
seeing, and then  it maybe happened possibly in May. 
 
Q:  Now,  when it happened, did Nicole tell you.  "I'm going to try 
to get back with O.J."? 
 
A:  I believe so. 
 
Q:  When she told you,  do you know whether you had already 
heard from her about her prior beating  or beatings? 
 
Q:  I had heard from her already, yes, before that. 
 
Q:  About the jealousy and so forth.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Now, did you say anything to her to the effect of, "Why are you 
going back with O.J. Simpson?" 
 
A:  I believe so. 
 
Q:  And what did she say? 
 
A:  That she was in love and she wanted to make it work again. 
 
Q:  And did she tell you anything about  whether O.J.  had 
changed? 
 
A:  I think so. 
 
Q:  What did she say? 
 
A:  That he was going to be committed to her, that I believe that he 
was done seeing Paula, I think  it was all over, and I think they 
were going to try to make it work, just those two together again. 
 
Q:  Monogamous? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you about whether she was  satisfied there would 
be no beating in the future, no  physical abuse? 
 
A:  I believe so. 
 
Q:  What did she say on that? 
 
A:  I think she just said that there was they're gonna make the 
relationship work.  I think if there was going to be a beating, she'd 
never see him  again, that if there was--that O.J.  said there would 
be like no fighting.  I think they were just trying to make it work 
and-- 
 
Q:  I am not asking what they were trying to do.  What she told you 
when she first told you about her getting, back together with O.J.? 
 
A:  I think that was it. 
 
Q:  And did you then observe that she and  Mr. Simpson began 
seeing each other again? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And from that point on, do you know  whether-- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  You say "again."  Had he ever observed 
it before? Because I don't-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  That's true.  He had never observed it before. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  I don't think he had, from the testimony. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  This was the first time when O.J.  began to see Nicole that you 
had ever seen them as a  couple.  Right? 
 
A:  Yeah, --like I said, O.J.  had come by a few times, though, to 
Gretna Green, but this was--this was when they were dating.  But, 
you know, sometimes he came by with the kids--or he would see 
the kids.  Sydney and Justin, and she'd be there, and--but it was a 
thing where there was some talking going on, but I don't think the 
dating process had started yet. 
 
Q:  When did it start? 
 
A:  I thought the dating process started I think in May. 
 
Q:  May? And when the dating process started, did Nicole continue 
to confide in you? 
 
A:  I believe so. 
 
Q:  About her relationship with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And do you know whether, starting in May when you believe 
they began to date again, whether Nicole saw other men in addition 
to O.J.? 
 
A:  Well, there was a period where they--that O.J.  and Nicole went 
on a vacation that I thought  that was in my mind their 
reconciliation trip was going to take place, where she went--I don't 
know,  think it might have been Cabo.  But there was a trip  they 
took together, and I think it was after the  Marcus incident, and 
they were going to try to make it work, their relationship. 
 
Q:  That's what she told you? 
 
A:  Yes.  And the first--the trip--I asked her how the trip was, and I 
believe she said the first two days were just terrible, and then it got  
better after that. 
 
Q:  During this period of time in 1993, do you know who Nicole's 
best friends were? 
 
A:  Yes.  I would say her best friend was Cora Fishman.  She hung 
out with Faye Resnick.  She  hung with Chris Jenner, a girl named 
Cici.  Don't know her last name.  I think that was it.  It was kinda 
like that it was Cora and Cici.  and mostly Cora would go running 
every day.  They'd go on runs.  But I thought Cora was the closest 
one she said was a friend, and sometimes she said different things 
about Faye Resnick. 
 
Q:  When Nicole and O.J.  started to date again, did Nicole tell you 
about any ground rules  that the two of them had established for 
their reconciliation? 
 
A:  There was something about I believe not seeing anybody else,  
and that was it.  If they were going to do it, it had to be just those 
two. 
 
Q:  Do you know whether Nicole abided by  that?  
 
A:  I believe she did. 
 
Q:  When she started to date O.J.  Simpson, did you begin to 
develop a friendship of your own with  Mr. Simpson? 
 
A:  Yeah.  When they were together, I thought it was--when those 
two were together and all that, I was supportive of them making it 
work. 
 
Q:  You began to talk to him-- 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:--O.J.  Simpson-- 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  --when he would come over to the house? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  As the year progressed, did you ever see  them get into any 
arguments? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  On how many occasions? 
 
A:  Maybe two or three. 
 
Q:  In your presence? 
 
A:  There were like not so much an argument, it was like a quiet 
time where you could tell there was something going on.  There 
was no talking going on.  So it would be a situation where, if there 
was no talking going on, I knew something was wrong. 
 
Q:  Did you ever in your presence witness a very loud argument 
between them? 
 
A:  Oh, yes.  There was --I came home-- 
 
Q:  On how many occasions? 
 
A:  One that I know for sure. 
 
Q:  Can you remember more than one? 
 
A:  Yes.  There was another one at a Christmas party, and there 
was one also of a 911 call. 
 
Q:  So how many in all do you remember? 
 
A:  That I remember, two for sure. 
 
Q:  What's the earlier of the two? 
 
A:  The earlier one would be the one at the 911 call,  and I think it 
was October. 
 
Q:  1993? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Tell me what you remember about October of 1993. 
 
A:  I know that I saw that the Bronco was parked kind of in front 
of Gretna Green with the  flashers on.  I went,  "Oh.  O.J.'s here."  
So I was coming back from I don't know where, but I was coming 
back from somewhere, and I started going in the back of the house 
in Gretna Green,  and I heard shouting going on, and in the 
process--there was a fight already in progress when I got there.  So 
I went right to the guest house  because I knew there was shouting 
going on,  and it was loud shouting.  So I saw that the French doors 
to the  Greta Green house were open already, and O.J.  was yelling 
at Nicole, and I saw that she was on the phone in the kitchen, and 
they were about 10 feet apart.  And I saw it was escalating, that the 
voices were getting higher and he was screaming louder.  and I put 
my head out of the guesthouse, and then I finally  said, I'm going to 
go out there and find out what's  going on.  I said,  "What are you 
guys fighting about?" And then he turned to me and started kind of 
directing the energy to me of the yelling, and it was a lot of 
shouting about the National Enquirer, that  there was some kind of 
article printed in the National Enquirer.  "They're always picking 
on me."  And then at some point he went to a door.  In the bottom 
level there's a door that was locked in  the Gretna Green house, and 
it was locked, and he was  going--trying to open it and said, 
"Who's in there?"  And I kinda looked at Nicole and went, "Is 
someone in there?" I thought there was a guy in there, in the house.  
And I was going, "Oh my God, I hope he knows there's like a back 
door.  I don't want  something to happen here."  And then there was 
a picture--there was a lot of shouting about some picture that 
Nicole had  up in the house of an ex-boyfriend, and then I just 
remember Nicole on the phone crying and calling 911, and then the 
police came. 
 
Q:  When O.J.--when you heard O.J. yelling and screaming, was it 
intense? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  He didn't say O.J.  He said  he heard 
yelling and screaming. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Oh, did you hear O.J.  Simpson yell and scream? 
 
A:  Yes, I heard O.J. 
 
Q:  Was it intense? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Now, you said at one point he turned and  directed his 
statements to you. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  He said they turned and directed the 
statements to him-- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Who turned? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:--not O.J. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:   
Q:  Who turned? 
 
A:  Well, it was--when I came there, it was O.J. that was telling me 
the events that were happening, so I made sure that it was going 
towards me while Nicole was on the phone. 
 
Q:  So you had sort of engaged him one on one? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And Nicole is on the phone? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  What is O.J.  telling you at that point? 
 
A:  He was telling me--I didn't--I wasn't making sense of all the 
things that he was talking about because I don't know what was 
going on.  I kept  thinking, there's someone in that room.  In my 
head I'm going, there's someone in that room.  I'm going, oh, boy.  
And then he was just talking about some picture she had up, that he 
doesn't have pictures at  his house up.  The National Enquirer had 
put some bad article about him,  and I believe it was about [Name 
Deleted].  I didn't understand that whole dialogue going on about 
having oral sex in the living room.  I didn't understand that until 
later, what that was all about,  because I didn't know what he was 
talking I about. 
 
Q:  But you--what you're saving is that Mr. Simpson was talking 
about at that time [Name Deleted] and Nicole having oral sex? 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  But you didn't know who [Name Deleted] was.  Right? 
 
A:  I knew--I think I had met the guy.  I didn't associate it as that 
guy. 
 
Q:  I see.  And was there any property damage? 
 
A:  Yes.  The French doors were broken, were  kicked in, I guess, 
and I fixed them when the cops  left. 
 
Q:  Were they broken before this day to your  knowledge? 
 
A:  No.  No. 
 
Q:  Had you ever fixed those doors before? 
 
A:  No. No, I--they had to have a guy come  out, actually. 
 
Q:  You fixed them temporarily? 
 
A:  Yeah,  just had them closed, so it was  like putting nails in 
them so they would stay locked, you know, temporarily, until the 
guy would come out. 
 
Q:  At some point the cops came? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Was Nicole on the phone that entire time until the cops came? 
 
A:  I only saw her on the phone the time that was there. 
 
Q:  The whole time you were there,  you only saw her on the 
phone. 
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  So initially when you got there, you went into the guesthouse. 
 
A:  Yes.  I didn't want to make it my business, that I had nothing to 
do with it,  so I let them, you know, deal with whatever was going 
on themselves, and then I-- 
 
Q:  And then you heard the yelling and screaming from the 
guesthouse? 
 
A:  Then I put my head out, and then I walked out. 
 
Q:  Is that the first time you heard Mr. Simpson yell and scream? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  After the police came did Mr. Simpson at some time leave? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And then you were there with Nicole? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did Nicole leave? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you and she then talk about what had transpired? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And tell me what you and she discussed. 
 
A:  She was talking about what the yelling was all about, about 
some picture.  That's what I  thought it was, some picture of a guy 
she had up there,  just a friend that she used to date or--and that 
O.J. she said had blown up over that.  And so I fixed the door, and 
I don't know if she talked about the police report, if there was a 
police report filled out.  I don't remember if there was.  The cops 
just gave cards out to them,  cards to her to call if anything ever 
happened again, and --but when the cops came, they all went to my 
room with O.J. to talk to him, in that same story. 
 
Q:  In your presence? 
 
A:  Yes.  Well, they said, "Who's this guy? And he said, "Oh, He's 
okay," but they all talked in my room.  They had two with O.J., 
two with her.  And then I said, "I'll go," so I just waited outside 
while they talked. 
 
Q:  Did you hear what O.J. said to the police? 
 
A:  Part of it, I heard. 
 
Q:  What did he say? 
 
A:  Was, "We're just having an argument."  And then I exited, I 
think, out of there.  I was--it was their thing, so went off by the 
pool area. 
 
Q:  Now,  where was the Bronco when you drove up to Gretna 
Green? 
 
A:  The Bronco was kind of parked in front of the driveway, 
blocking Gretna Green's driveway.  The  flashers I believe were on.  
And I think at some point  I moved it, I think. 
 
Q:  To park it normally? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  Did Nicole tell you how she felt later on  that evening about 
this incident? 
 
A:  I think so.  I don't remember the words. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Now, when is the next time that you remember 
witnessing an argument between the two of them? 
 
(Peter Gelblum enters the deposition.) 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  Does Peter know what happened at 3:15?  
Peter,  do you know--Can we just go off the record? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  They stipulated that earlier today.  Was there 
a hearing Peter? 
 
MR. GELBLUM:  Yeah.

<P>O.J. Simpson was in an extremely bad mood shortly before his former wife and Ronald Goldman were murdered, according to Brian "Kato" Kaelin in this Feb.15. 1996 deposition. When Simpson and Kaelin went to McDonald's that evening, the conversation was so strained that he felt awkward about asking Simpson for a straw, Kaelin says. This is the second day of Kaelin's three-day deposition.</P>

EXAMINATION 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Good morning, Mr. Kaelin. A: Good 
morning. 
 
Q: When you saw Mr. Simpson on June 12 after the McDonald's 
trip -- okay? You with me? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: At any time thereafter did you see him in a black robe? 
 
A: No. . 
 
Q: Terry cloth robe? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Any other kind of black robe? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or a dark robe? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Any robe? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: I want to go back to some of the conversations that you spoke 
about yesterday on the 11th and on the 12th of June. There was 
conversation between you and O.J. Simpson about Paula Barbieri 
on those two days. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: There was some on Saturday and some on Sunday. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: The conversation that you described yesterday about Ms. 
Barbieri being upset that she could not go to the recital, do you 
remember that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When did that occur? 
 
A: On Sunday. 
 
Q: June 12. 
 
A: June 12th, Sunday. 
 
Q: Do you know approximately what time that occurred? 
 
A: That was in the afternoon. It was afternoon. The noon hour. 
 
Q: What did O.J. Simpson say to you about that? 
 
A: That I believe that Paula wanted to invite herself to this dance 
recital. and O.J. wasn't comfortable to have her there because he 
just wanted to make it kind of a family thing, and not to have Paula 
there would be a better thing. So -- and if Paula was there, it would 
be maybe some friction. 
 
Q: With whom? 
 
A: Possibly the Brown family or Nicole. 
 
Q: That's what he said? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What else did he say? 
 
A: And he really didn't want her to go. He wanted to be there with 
just the family. 
 
Q: And what did O.J. Simpson say to you that Paula Barbieri said 
on that subject? 
 
A: That Paula probably wasn't the one to get married. She wanted 
kids. and O.J. already had kids, and he wasn't going to have more 
kids. 
 
Q: Did -- That's something that Mr. Simpson told you that he and 
Paula had discussed? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that there was friction about that subject? 
 
A: Yeah. I think -- I don't know if it was 100 percent to Paula 
discussed it. He told it to me that he wasn't going to -- you know. 
that she probably wanted to get married. She did want to get 
married. she loved O.J. a lot and she wanted the kids, and that was 
him telling me that. 
 
Q: What did O.J. say about whether he wanted to marry Paula and 
he wanted to have kids? 
 
A: That she probably wasn't the one, and he didn't want to have 
kids. 
 
Q: Did he tell you why he didn't want to have kids? 
 
A: He has kids already. Why would he want more kids? 
 
Q: Did he tell you what Paula's reaction was to Mr. Simpson's 
unwillingness to invite her to the dance recital? 
 
A: That she was upset. She got upset with him that she couldn't go 
to the recital, and she was complaining. 
 
Q: And O.J. Simpson told you this in this meeting -- this 
conversation on the 12th? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did he tell you what Paula said to him when she got upset at 
him? 
 
A: I think it was that she just wanted to be invited, and she was just 
ticked off that she couldn't go. I think it was the thing that if she 
could go, it would kinda show that -- if she was there, then Nicole 
would know then for sure that she was the woman. 
 
Q: Did O.J. tell you whether he wanted Nicole to know for sure 
that Paula was the woman? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he discuss that with you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he discuss his feelings towards Nicole in that conversation? 
 
A: The conversation was just about having a family. It came up 
once or twice about having a white picket fence and having the 
kids run around, to be a happy family. That conversation came up. 
 
Q: You're telling me now about something that came up in the 
conversation in the afternoon of June 12th? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: In that conversation did he express to you his feelings toward 
Nicole? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Did he say that he wanted Nicole to be that one who would be 
with him at the house with the picket fence and the kids? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, I object on two grounds: Number 
one, there is no foundation for that from this witness' testimony --  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: You can answer. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: -- and, number two. there is -- he's never 
talked that O.J. wanted a white picket fence. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: You can answer. 
 
A: Yeah, that he said that he wanted a white picket fence, the 
family. There was a futility to saying the relationship was over 
between he and Nicole. 
 
Q: O.J. Simpson told you that the relationship between Nicole and 
him was over? 
 
A: That it was over. 
 
Q: And he said it was -- when you said "finality," you mean over 
once and for all? 
 
A: That it was going to be over, and that's somewhat why I had the 
Tracy Adell call and all that because I thought I was being a good 
guy, and also like Susan Wilkinsen. She was like a Christian girl, 
and she was -- it was just bringing my friends in because it was 
kinda like be okay to do that. 
 
Q: Did O.J. tell you that the relationship with Nicole was over for 
good? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did he tell you how it came to be that that relationship had 
ended for good? 
 
A: I don't -- it was -- it had to do with the argument with -- that 
IRS thing, that he was putting pressure on her with the IRS. 
 
Q: Tell me what he said to you about that. 
 
A: I don't know exactly how the IRS thing was working, but it was 
the change of address, that somehow it was going to screw up 
Nicole and she was going to get in trouble with the IRS. 
 
Q: O.J. Simpson told you that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And he told you that he would take some action to get Nicole in 
trouble with the IRS? 
 
A: To report it to the IRS. 
 
Q: That's what he said? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. You know, the reason I keep asking you, "That's what he 
said.'" is because I want to know who the speaker is, who's doing 
the talking. 
 
A: Okay. I should say who said it. 
 
Q: If you could, it would be helpful. I know Mr. Baker would 
appreciate that. too. Now, you had a conversation with O.J. 
Simpson on the same day after the recital. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, you said you played some basketball when Mr. Simpson 
went off to the recital? 
 
A: Yeah, at some point in the afternoon I played basketball in 
Santa Monica, like 14th Street school and --  
 
Q: I -- I'm sorry. 
 
A: -- and at some point the recital was over with, and I was in the 
kitchen nook area with O.J. 
 
Q: At some point. 
 
A: At some point. And he said he --  
 
Q: What -- hold on. Let me stop you right there. I don't want to get 
into the conversation quite yet. When you left Mr. Simpson after 
the first conversation that you just decided, you said you went off 
to play basketball. Right? 
 
A: At some point, yes. 
 
Q: I think you said yesterday you also went to Vons and had a 
California roll. Right? 
 
A: A carton, right. 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: A carton of those. It was not fresh. 
 
Q: A carton. You ate them in the car? 
 
A: Ate them in the car. 
 
Q: While sitting in the parking lot. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you do anything else before you had the conversation with 
Mr. Simpson about the recital? Did you watch any TV or --  
 
A: I watched the playoff game. 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: The playoff game, the Knicks and Astros -- Houston. Houston. 
not the Astros. 
 
Q: The Houston Rockets. 
 
A: Rockets. I watched that. That was on that afternoon. I don't 
know if it was Game 7 or not. but I was watching that game, and --  
 
Q: Do you remember watching it? 
 
A: Yes. I remember being in my room and on the floor. because I 
was sweaty from I believe my run. 
 
Q: Do you remember if that was before or after the playing of 
basketball that you watched the Rocket game? 
 
A: I don't remember 100 percent, and -- I just don't remember, but I 
know that I did watch that game. 
 
Q: You are not a hundred percent sure of the sequence of some of 
these events. 
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q: Is that what you're saying? 
 
A: Yes, I am. 
 
Q: Okay. Tell me, at some time -- at some point you said you 
ended up in the kitchen nook with Mr. Simpson after the recital? 
 
A: Yes, I did. 
 
Q: And just you and he? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Were you sitting down? 
 
A: Yes, I was. 
 
Q: And was Mr. Simpson sitting down? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You said yesterday that Mr. Simpson said that he was upset 
because Nicole was playing hardball with the children. Right? 
 
A: Yes, I did. 
 
Q: Now, can you -- you also said that he was upset about the 
wearing of a tight black miniskirt. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: That's what he said to you. Right? 
 
A: Yes, he did. 
 
Q: Did -- I'll tell you what: Why don't instead of asking you how 
upset he was, why don't you show us. 
 
A: It was sitting down. There's a phone here when he sits down, 
and I'm sitting across about five feet away, and it was, "Nicole's 
playing hardball with me. Sydney's my child, too. I can see her 
when want to. "And the dresses, the dresses they wear. I mean. 
Kato, what are they gonna do when they're grandmas? Are they 
going to wear those kind of dresses? Come on, how can they wear 
those dresses when they're older like that. It was a recital. They 
shouldn't -- it was like they're wearing stuff that they would wear 
to a club." 
 
And the phone would ring -- and the phone was ringing constantly, 
and he'd pick up and go "Hello" --  
 
Q: Let me ask you about that -- Are you finished? 
 
A: Yeah. So the phone would ring, and then it would go -- let him 
do the phone call. and it would change into some other -- the 
subject was sort of over then, and it was on to the phone call, and I 
wasn't paying attention, or trying not to, when he was on his calls. 
 
Q: So when he was talking about his interaction with Nicole at the 
recital he talked in the way that you just tried to describe to us? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I object as leading. There is no 
foundation for that from that testimony. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You can answer. 
 
A: That's what happened. 
 
Q: You just tried to recreate how he appeared to you and what he 
said to you. Is that right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
a After the recital. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Talking about what had happened at the recital? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did he tell you whether he and Nicole spoke words to one 
another at the recital? 
 
A: I don't think they did speak. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Move to strike. I guess we're withholding 
all those, because I would have been on the record more than he 
would have been. The question had to be responsive. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did -- We'll, if you have objections, 
Mr. Baker, you should make them. 
 
Q: Did he tell you whether or not Nicole and O.J. exchanged words 
at the recital? 
 
A: I think it was just that he wasn't going to be getting his 
daughter, and they took off. 
 
Q: Now, you said that there were some phone calls during this 
conversation with Mr. Simpson about the recital. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When he answered the phone, did his demeanor change at all? 
 
A: It was "Hello" however you pick up the phone when someone 
calls. 
 
Q: And when he spoke on the phone, did he speak in an agitated 
way? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was he sort of normal. relaxed? 
 
A: If the phone would ring, you'd answer "Hello." 
 
Q: Did he express any of his frustration about Nicole playing 
hardball with the people on rhe phone? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I object to your characterization. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. No. he didn't. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: He did not? 
 
A: He did not. 
 
Q: He didn't share any of what he was telling you to the people 
who called? 
 
A: He did not. 
 
Q: He did not. Just normal banter? 
 
A: Conversation with whoever was on the phone. 
 
Q: Did you even see him laughing from time to time while he was 
on the phone? 
 
A: Yes. Q: You tried not to listen? 
 
A: I did listen -- I mean, if there were conversations going on, it 
was normal conversation tone: I could hear. 
 
Q: When he got off these phone calls, did he then resume talking 
about Nicole and what had happened at the recital? 
 
A: I don't know if it came up again. I mean, it might have gone on 
to something else. The exact dialogue, I don't know. but the 
Sydney incident sort of was that one comment about playing 
hardball and shaking of the head. "She can't do that." that sort of 
statement. But the phone call -- there was no real point to repeating 
it anymore, so there was nothing more really said about that to me. 
 
Q: Then you went off and took your Jacuzzi? 
 
A: At some point I did, yeah. I was also reading -- there was all 
this Sunday paper there, so I was reading a lot of the newspapers in 
that nook area while conversions were going on. 
 
Q: Okay. Later on you took the ride in the Bentley to McDonald's. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You already told us about that yesterday. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Can you describe Mr. Simpson 's mood in the Bentley to and 
from McDonald's? 
 
A: Well, I said I was kinda forcing conversation in the -- on the 
ride. I felt that because I kind of invited myself for that ride, and I 
thought he was -- myself thought he was in thought, like deep 
thought and gloomy. It was --  
 
Q: Gloomy? Gloomy? Did you say "gloomy"? 
 
A: Yes. I didn't want to talk, but I brought up conversations. 
 
Q: Introspective? 
 
A: Yeah. He was in thought. 
 
Q: Quiet? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: He was leaned back and driving. He was just very 
-- sort of just very relaxed and in thought. and I was bringing up 
conversation, but l knew it was kinda forced conversation, and I 
was comfortable bringing up things because I was trying to get a 
conversation. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Why was it forced? 
 
A: Because I was forcing it. I was, "So what time's the flight?" 
"Where you going?" 
 
Q: What made it forced in your mind? 
 
A: There was no dialogue. He wasn't bringing up anything. So I 
thought it was my lead to bring up stuff, and then when there's just 
kind of one answers to the things. I thought, all right, Kato, don't 
talk. 
 
Q: Were you feeling awkward about even asking for a straw? 
 
A: After I got my stuff, yeah. I already had the stuff and I was 
gonna say to myself, "Okay," in my head, "Should I ask for a 
straw? Ask for the straw," so I asked for the straw. 
 
Q: In other words, you had to go through a process of deciding in 
your mind whether you should ask for a straw. 
 
A: Yeah 
 
Q: Did you ask him you know, what was wrong? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, I object. There is no indication that 
anything was wrong. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did you ask him what was wrong? 
 
A: No. I just -- if anything, I just felt he didn't want to talk, and 
maybe lonely, and I brought up maybe being tired, that he should 
get a nap. 
 
Q: Did you ask him if anything was bothering him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was it your habit to ask questions like that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: In your relationship with O.J. Simpson, did you pry into his 
personal matters? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you inquire about his personal matters? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you inquire about his private feelings? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: I think if that would ever come up the other person would bring 
it up to me more than me having to pry. 
 
Q: you wouldn't bring it up. A: I wouldn't bring it up. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: Because I would think, he's O.J. Simpson. I'm not going to ask 
him what's going on. what was wrong. 
 
Q: You didn't feel close enough to him? 
 
A: To ask him personal questions, no. If they were going to come 
up, I thought he would bring them up. If he wanted to talk, he 
would ask me. 
 
Q: Did you share with Mr. Simpson personal things about your 
life? 
 
A: Maybe one or two. I mean, nothing really. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: There's nothing really going on. 
 
Q: No. What I am getting to is: Did you feel close enough to him 
that you would share personal things in your life with him? 
 
A: No. If I had personal problems. no, I wouldn't bring it up to 
him. Q: you would not. 
 
A: I would not. 
 
Q: Yesterday we were talking about your conversations with 
Nicole during the year 1993 when you were living at Gretna Green. 
and you told us about a number of conversations that she and you 
had about O.J. Simpson. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did you talk to Nicole about things other than O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Frequently? 
 
A: I think Nicole would mostly bring up other things that were 
going on in her life. She would tell me about her friends, the 
people she hung out with, what she was gonna do for the day or 
what she didn't do for the day. She pretty much told me exactly 
what was going on in her life. When I was around, what I was 
gonna do. 
 
She talked about Cora. She had running friends,Cora and Cici, that 
would usually come over in the morning and the friends, Cora 
almost every day, and then after that they would all go to the coffee 
-- I don't know what coffee place they go to, but they get their 
coffee and then hang out at the pool. 
 
She told me things about Cora. She didn't like going out at night so 
much with Cora because she didn't really like drinking and 
partying, and she kinda had a thing of friends, going Cora wasn't 
the big party -- Cora wasn't big at drinking --  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me, Mr. Simpson. 
 
THE WITNESS: Cora wasn't the big drinker. She would go out, 
but she wasn't like the big drinker. where if Faye went out -- Faye 
and Cici I think. I think it's those two that hated each other. 
 
So it would be a certain clique of friends that would always go out, 
and one friend didn't get along with one of the friends. I'm trying to 
think of who. I think it was Faye and Cici that didn't -- couldn't 
stand each other. 
 
Cici was more the one they made fun of, that she kept looking for a 
man. Cici could never get a guy and always in search. Faye, she 
said, was always someone going after like the rich guy, always had 
to find the richest guy, was Faye's motive to -- for money, just 
money was the big motivation thing and... 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: She had views like this about all of her friends, different views 
for different friends? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: The question that I was asking you -- I think you've answered it 
-- is whether or not Nicole talked with you about a wide variety of 
things, and the answer is what? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And frequently? 
 
A: Yes, she would talk to me a lot. 
 
u -- Okay Did Nicole ever talk to you about Mr. Simpson being a 
jealous man? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did she say to you about that? 
 
A: She just would say, "O.J.'s a very jealous person? that he liked 
having her just at home. 
 
la That's what she told you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did she ever give you any examples of his jealousy? 
 
A: She said at certain points she had seen Marcus, Marcus Allen, at 
certain times when I was living at Gretna Green, and that he had to 
park somewhere else, and it was because if O.J. found him, he'd be 
really pissed. 
 
Q: She told you that? 
 
A: Yes. So he parked somewhere else. off of some other street. 
 
Q: Did you ever talk to Marcus Allen about O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Can you think of any other examples that Nicole gave you of 
O.J. Simpson's jealousy? 
 
A: There was pictures she had up of other people that were her 
friends in the Gretna Green house, and she would say that that 
picture, if O.J. knew that was a guy she had dated, he'd get pissed. 
So pictures had to come down at certain points in the house. 
 
Q: Was there an incident in which you were driving the Ferrari 
owned by Nicole? 
 
A: There's an incident where she was driving the Ferrari,and she 
went to a lunch --  
 
Q: Were you in it? 
 
A: Yes, I was in the passenger side. 
 
Q: Describe that incident. 
 
A: She had said -- I didn't -- I was -- we went to get sushi at this 
one place that used to be in Brentwood on the corner, and she was 
driving the car, and she said that O.J. drove by. and I didn't see O.J. 
drive by. She had said O.J. drove by in a Testarossa, and she said 
that when he saw that, she said the face that he made. because I 
was a guy in the car, was a pissed-off look. 
 
Q: Did she tell you whether or not O.J. Simpson had called her 
later on to inquire about the man in the car with her? 
 
A: I believe so. yes. 
 
Q: What did she say about that? 
 
A: Who the guy was. 
 
Q: And what did Nicole say she told O.J.? 
 
A: I think that, "It was Kato, the guy that lives in the house." 
 
Q: Did you ever talk to O.J. about his jealousy toward Nicole? 
 
A: No. I don't think so, no. 
 
Q: Never? 
 
A: If anything, the conversions would be -- if they were trying to 
get back together and all that, if they didn't work, I would always 
say that "Maybe you guys should go apart for a while and see if it 
works then after not seeing each other?" 
 
Q: Did O.J. ever ask you to tell him about Nicole's activities? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Never? 
 
A: No. He might have just said once that -- if I saw her somewhere, 
but it wasn't a thing like, "Go out and spy on her?" 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: But if I saw her somewhere, I would say, "Oh, I saw her at this 
place." 
 
Q: And what would he then say to you? 
 
A: I think it was --  
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: -- a thing that it was a -- Thursday night was the 
night out for the girl thing; that I believe at that time all the girls 
would go to a place called Renaissance that he was aware of, with 
her friends. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Right. 
 
A: So he knew that that was the club to go to. 
 
Q: And did he tell you to let him know if you saw Nicole at 
Renaissance? 
 
A: He asked me if I did see her. 
 
Q: If you did see her. 
 
A: Yes. he did. 
 
Q: And you would tell him if you did or didn't? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Did he ever ask you about Nicole's romantic relationships 
with other men, other than -- you mentioned Grant Cramer 
yesterday. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did he ever ask you about Marcus Allen? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or any other men? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: The incident at Gretna Green on October 25, 1993, you heard 
O.J. Simpson yelling and screaming, as you testified yesterday. 
Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you heard him yelling and screaming about Nicole 
performing oral sex on [name deleted]. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When he was yelling and screaming about Nicole performing 
oral sex on [name deleted]. did you know when the oral sex had 
occurred? 
 
A: I didn't know the date. No, I didn't. 
 
Q: Do you know if it was recent? 
 
A: No idea. Q: No idea? Did you know that it was more than a year 
and a half earlier? 
 
A: I believe I knew it was in the Gretna Green house. 
 
Q: Or a year earlier? You didn't know when it occurred. 
 
A: I didn't know a date, no. 
 
Q: How did you know that it was in the Gretna Green house? 
 
A: Because I believe Nicole had told me that O.J. was outside one 
time, that he had told her that he was outside the front window, and 
he mentioned that she was having -- giving oral sex to [Name 
Deleted]. 
 
Q: Nicole told you that --  
 
A: I heard it from both. 
 
Q: First -- who did you hear about it from first? 
 
A: I believe it was O.J. 
 
Q: Tell me what O.J. said to you. 
 
A: That he was outside a window in Gretna Green, and Nicole was 
having oral sex with this [Name Deleted]. And I was -- "Huh." -- 
There was nothing really I -- it was really kind of intense . What do 
you say. 
 
Q: What did you say? 
 
A: I don't think I said anything. I went "Wow." I was thinking in 
my head. if you were watching your ex, that would be tough. 
 
Q: What did Nicole tell you about that incident? 
 
A: I don't remember exactly, but she I believe did -- was seeing 
this [Name Deleted] guy for a bit, and she was in the Gretna Green 
living room, and I believe she did it. I believe she had oral sex. 
 
Q: But what did she tell you about O.J. Simpson watching her? 
 
A: She couldn't believe it. 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: She couldn't believe it. 
 
Q: How -- did she tell you how she found out that O.J. Simpson 
had watched her and [Name Deleted] have sex? 
 
A: I think it was O.J. told her. 
 
Q: And what did she say to you was her reaction when O.J. told 
her this? 
 
A: Well, it was a few things. I believe that it was that she couldn't 
believe it, and I think that prompted some of the conversation to 
tell her about my phone might be tapped and -- I mean. the exact 
dialogue, I don't know. I just don't know. 
 
Q: You mentioned that yesterday. Phones tapped and videotaping? 
 
A: That by living in the guest house, she goes, "You know, you 
should worry about that." 
 
Q: Okay. Did you see any -- Withdrawn. You said yesterday that 
the door to the Gretna Green residence -- I guess the French doors 
were broken. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: That they had not been broken before this incident. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: At least to the extent that you saw them. Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: No, no, I object. He didn't say to the 
extent that he saw them. He said they weren't broken. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Okay. They were not broken. Right? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: At all. 
 
THE WITNESS: Correct. The French doors in the back of the 
Gretna Green house. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did you see any splinters on the floor? 
 
A: After the incident was over? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: you saw splinters on the floor. 
 
A: The splinters -- it was busted on top. It was broken. The wood 
was, you know, hanging down. I had to nail it. 
 
Q: Were there splinters on the floor? 
 
A: Yeah, there was some debris, but it was the nailing of -- do you 
know what I'm talking about, those kind of doors that you have 
like the latch lock? That was broken, and the wood was -- I had to 
go back and hammer that so the thing wouldn't fall down and we 
could shut the door. The wood part. 
 
Q: Did you clean up the debris? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Were you frightened by that incident? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When O.J. Simpson told you on June 11 -- Withdrawn. On June 
11 you and O.J. were watching TV and the GARP movie came on 
and the oral sex scene. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Right? 
 
A: (Nods head.) 
 
Q: And he talked to you at that time about the [Name Deleted] 
incident. Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: At that time did Mr. Simpson tell you when the [Name Deleted] 
incident had occurred? Was there any discussion of the timing of 
the [Name Deleted] incident? 
 
A: That it had happened at the Gretna Green house, and I knew 
what the time frame would have been was when she moved in 
there then, so it had to be within that year, year and a half. 
 
Q: Did he say anything to you about [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: He didn't like [Name Deleted] 
 
Q: That's what he said? 
 
[Portion deleted] . . .  
 
 
Q: How did you meet O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: I was -- the first time I met him was I was at Gretna Green. and 
I believe it was -- I was tossing a ball with Justin, and he came 
over and --  
 
Q: You were already living there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did Cathy Randa call you at some point to say that O.J. wanted 
to meet with you? 
 
A: There was a thing where Cathy Randa had called about -- 
inquiring about who the guy was, and then --  
 
Q: Who did she call? 
 
A: I believe Nicole. 
 
Q: Nicole told this to you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did Randa ever call you or talk to you? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: What did she say to you? 
 
A: That at first, I guess, he didn't know me, O.J. really didn't know 
who this Kato guy was, if he liked him or not, and he -- I was the 
guy living back there. And then Cathy had said that after talking to 
me a bunch of times, "How can he not," like a -- so --  
 
Q: How can he not like you? 
 
A: Well, I've never met him yet. So it had been a thing where at 
first he didn't, and then he understood what I was about, I guess, 
and then liked me. 
 
Q: Now, these discussions that you had with Nicole and Cathy that 
you just described, they occurred shortly after you moved in 
January of '93? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when you moved out of -- Withdrawn. Tell me the reason 
you moved out of Gretna Green. 
 
A: When I moved out of Gretna Green? Okay. When I was moving 
out of Gretna Green, there was a few incidents that happened: One 
time during the -- living with Nicole, she had asked me, I believe it 
was sometime in April when I was living there, that she was 
moving and I'd have to go out and get a place. And I said "Okay," 
and she gave me, you know, a few weeks' notice. 
 
So I was looking for places, and then she was looking for a place 
and found a place. And then while we were looking at this place in 
I believe like Bel Air off the Mountainside Road, I think it was 
called. We all looked at this house and she said -- and they said. 
"Kato, there's a room for you, too." And then she said, "We can 
move here all together." 
 
I said "Fine," but that never happened. And then it was December, 
January, when Nicole had said that "Kato, you're gonna have to 
move out." 
 
And then I said "Okay." So I thought she wanted me out of the 
house, and so I started to look, and then she had changed her mind 
and said, "No. The place on Bundy has a room that you can stay in 
now." 
 
But at that time I believe O.J. already asked me that I could stay -- 
I could go to Rockingham into his house, and so I said, "Well, 
God, that's great," and then I made the move there instead of 
Bundy. 
 
Q: Why was it great? 
 
A: Well, because I didn't have a place, and then -- at first I didn't 
have the place with Nicole, and then Nicole offered it back and -- 
and Nicole offered the place back --  
 
Q: Bundy? 
 
A: -- the Bundy place, and then O.J. gave me the place on 
Rockingham. and I thought it was pretty cool. I had like a pool, 
Jacuzzi. 
 
And I offered him money. He said he didn't want my money. I 
thought it was an unbelievable deal. 
 
Q: Did O.J. talk to you about your living at Bundy? 
 
A: That at one point he said it probably wasn't right for me to be in 
the same house with Nicole and the kids, and I thought there -- I'm 
going to make that thing work, and I said, "Okay, I understand that, 
that it wouldn't be probably best for me to be in the house with 
Nicole." 
 
Q: You mean under the same roof. 
 
A: Under the same roof. Because there wasn't a guest house. It was 
in the same house. 
 
Q: How did Nicole react to your moving in with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: She was very mad at me. 
 
Q: What did she say to you? 
 
A: She said, "Kato, he manipulated you," and she stressed that. that 
she goes, "See, Look it, he got to you, too. He manipulated you." 
 
I said, "What? I'm still your friend. He's not manipulating me." 
 
And then Cora Fishman said, "The reason she's pissed at you," 
because then she started not talking, so Cora said, "This is the 
reason she's pissed: She needs the money from you and that O.J. 
got away with manipulating you, and now he's got you as his 
friend." 
 
I said, "God, I'm still her friend. I don't know why she doesn't want 
to be friends anymore." So it changed from that. 
 
Q: From that point on Nicole and you were not close friends any 
longer? 
 
A: I thought I was still her friend, but she wasn't the same. She 
wasn't, you know, really talking to me, and when I would see her 
running, it was just run right by. 
 
Q: Did you try to engage her in conversation and resume the 
friendship with her? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what would happen? 
 
A: Well, I made her a tape with a letter I wrote, and I just said, 
"God, I wish we could still be friends." And then my daughter also 
would come by and play with Sydney, and when Nicole would 
come by the Rockingham place with the kids, she would talk to 
Tiffany and not me, and it was just uncomfortable for that. 
 
And then the other time we kinda talked was there was a picnic I 
think at O.J.'s where all the chairs are being set up. I think it was 
for Sunshine School. So she just said, "Kato, move these chairs and 
set up this thing for this party." 
 
And I said "Sure." So I thought I'm getting -- you know, we're 
getting not closer, but at least talking. 
 
Q: And after that incident did you talk with her more? 
 
A: No. It was she wanted me to move out quite a few times. She 
would tell me to move out of the place. 
 
Q: Whose place? 
 
A: Out of O.J.'s place. And so I was looking for places. 
 
Michelle, the maid, would always say, "O.J. wants you out," and 
then O.J. said to me that "I'll tell you when I want out not 
Michelle." Then Nicole would come by sometimes with O.J. and 
either be swimming in the pool or with the kids, and just she would 
say, "When are you leaving?" 
 
So I thought, if they're gonna try to make it work, it would be the 
best thing if I did leave. So I went out and looked for places. 
 
Q: Did O.J. know you were looking for places? 
 
A: I think so. I'm not positive. 
 
Q: Had he ever asked you to leave? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So when you decided to move into O.J.'s place instead of 
Nicole's Bundy place, your relationship with Nicole came to an 
end? 
 
A: It wasn't the same. It was -- yeah. we didn't talk as much . I 
think maybe we talked on the phone once or twice. 
 
Q: And from that point on did she ever share anything private with 
you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Talk to you about her feelings about anything? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So it wasn't like it used to be. 
 
A: No, it wasn't. 
 
Q: And Cora told you that it was be cause of your moving into the 
place and --  
 
A: That was back then when I did the move, Cora told me that. 
 
Q: When Nicole said to you that "O.J. has now manipulated you?" 
did you ask her what she meant by that and did she tell you? 
 
A: That she had said he gets to all her friends. Whenever she has a 
friend. that O.J. can take him away. 
 
Q: And she thought you had been taken away from her by O.J.? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: That's what she told you. 
 
A: That's what she told me. 
 
Q: When was the last time you saw Nicole before she died? 
 
A: I think it was in May, it could have been. I don't know what 
time that -- when that Sunshine party was where I set the chairs. I 
think it was in May. beginning of May. 
 
Q: When was the last time you spoke to her? 
 
A: I don t know. I don't know the last time I had dialogue with her. 
 
Q: When Nicole and O.J. broke up for the final time, did you have 
an understanding as to who ended the relationship, Nicole or O.J.? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: .No foundation. Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I thought it was O.J. that said it was over. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Do you know whether one of them 
had told the other that it was over? 
 
A: Well, there's things. I believe it had do in May with that bracelet 
being back that Nicole wasn't going to see him anymore, that it 
was over. 
 
Q: When Nicole returned the bracelet? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: In -- Do you -- how do you know that Nicole returned the 
bracelet. by the way? 
 
A: Cora Fishman I believe told me that there was a bracelet that 
she returned that was an expensive bracelet. 
 
Q: Nicole didn't tell you. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did O.J. tell you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Cora tell you why Nicole returned that bracelet? 
 
A: I believe it was -- had something with O.J. being possessive. I 
don't know the exact reason. That he couldn't get her back with the 
bracelet; that this bracelet was supposed to be the bond that would 
bring them back together, but she didn't want it, and that was kind 
of the thing of giving back the bracelet, he couldn't buy her. 
 
Q: Cora told you that. 
 
A: Cora said this. 
 
Q: What did Cora tell you about O.J. being possessive? 
 
A: That O.J. was possessive, that he bought gifts for, you know, 
her or others. 
 
Q: Did anyone say anything -- did Cora or anyone else say 
anything to you about the IRS letter? 
 
A: Yes, Cora mentioned about that. 
 
Q: What did Cora say about that? 
 
A: That he was going to change the -- that address, that it was 
going to get Nicole into a lot of trouble financially, and if she got 
in trouble financially that she would have no money. 
 
Q: Cora told you that? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And Cora told you that Nicole said that to her. Right? 
 
A: Yes, that there was a thing that Nicole didn't have enough 
money, and that was one of the reasons why the IRS thing would 
be difficult to handle. 
 
Q: Did anybody else besides Cora discuss with you the breakup 
between O.J. and Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When would you talk to Cora Fishman? 
 
A: When would I or when --  
 
Q: Well, that's a bad question. When would you meet up with her, 
see Cora Fishman, during this time frame? Now we are into late 
May, early June l 994 . 
 
A: Cora I saw once or twice at this market in the -- I don't know 
what it's called. It's right in Brentwood. And I saw her running a 
few times, and I saw her during the trial a lot. 
 
Q: Before Nicole's death. 
 
A: Oh, before, but after. 
 
Q: Let me ask you this: The conversations with Cora that you just

A: Somewhat she had a feeling.

A: No. 
 
Q: Did Cora say to you why she believed O.J. Simpson might have

she was pounding on O.J., on O.J.'s chest.

Q: The day before the funeral. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Or the night? 
 
A: It was daytime. 
 
Q: And where was the wake? 
 
A: Somewhere in Dana Point or Laguna. It was down -- It was in 
Orange County. I don't know the name of the place where it was at. 
 
Q: Funeral parlor? 
 
A: It was a funeral parlor. 
 
Q: And you saw Cora Fishman --  
 
A: Cora --  
 
Q: -- pound on O.J. Simpson's chest. Is that what you are saying? 
 
A: Yes, saw her in the hallway, and she was in the hallway and she 
was shaking and hugging me, and she was just uncontrollable and 
screaming, and then she had run in and did that. into where Nicole 
was out. 
 
Q: Laid out, you mean? 
 
A: Laid out. 
 
Q: And you saw it? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q: And you heard what she said. 
 
A: I heard, "Why?" 
 
A. You heard, "Why?" 
 
A: And hitting. And, "What?" "Why," I heard, "Why?" 
 
Q: Did O.J. say anything back to her? 
 
A: I didn't hear it. 
 
Q: What was O.J.'s appearance or demeanor at that time? 
 
A: His head was down. 
 
Q: Did he say, "I didn't do it?? Did he say that? 
 
A: I didn't hear him say anything. 
 
Q: Did Cora Fishman at any time tell you why she believed that 
O.J. might have killed Nicole? 
 
A: Cora just brought up that O.J. was jealous. I mean, she said she 
didn't have like proof in that, but she just had a feeling at that time. 
 
Q: Let me see if I understand this. When you and Cora were 
talking about --  
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I told you that's not the test. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: There are a lot of things that are not the test, 
Mr. Baker, but let me get back to this. 
 
Q: You and Cora were where having this conversation about why 
Cora believed O.J. Simpson might have killed Nicole, and in that 
context Cora said to you that O.J. was very jealous. 
 
A. Yes. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I would just object. That is without 
foundation, your preamble, that they were having a conversation 
about O.J. killed Nicole. That's never been testified to. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI 
 
Q Did you have that conversation? 
 
A: We had talked about their relationship and somewhat of how 
here was just button pushing. 
 
Q: You and Cora talked about this? 
 
A: On both parts they were always pushing buttons, and Cora and I 
talked about that. 
 
Q: And this was after Nicole 's death? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You and Cora were where at this time? In the market or --  
 
A: No. This was at a coffee shop in Beverly Hill. 
 
Q: Coffee shop? What was the name 
 
A: It was called Michelle Richard. 
 
Q: And just the two of you?  
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q: How long were you there? 
 
A: Hour. 
 
Q: And in this hour conversation it was about Nicole, Nicole's 
death? 
 
A: What was going on. That was pretty much the point of getting 
there, to have coffee, and that was the conversation that came up. 
 
Q: Did you ask Cora if she thought that O.J. had done it? 
 
A: Did I ask her? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Yes. I said, "What's your feeling?" 
 
Q: What did she say? 
 
A: That she felt at that time, yes, that she was thinking that O.J. did 
it. 
 
Q: And did she say why she thought that? 
 
A: Because of how all the button pushing was happening. And 
Cora was with Nicole a lot during that period: I wasn't at that time 
when I was living at O.J.'s, and she said there was just a lot of 
arguments going on and a lot of manipulating on both sides and 
there's a lot of button pushing of what -- who could get who mad, 
and I don't know the exact incidents of what the button pushing 
was, but that's what it was -- she was saying. They knew how to 
get each other mad. 
 
Q: Did she describe to you any of the button pushing? 
 
A: Not that I can remember. 
 
Q: Had you seen any of it yourself in your I year and a half with 
both Nicole and O.J.? 
 
A: Yeah, I believe so. 
 
Q: What button pushing did you see? 
 
A: On whisk part? 
 
Q: On either part. 
 
A: I would see. I believe, O.J. could make a call possibly to a girl 
and tell her about it. and Nicole could also say something about 
being with younger guys and possibly talking about. you know, 
that she would just be with a younger guy while O.J.'s getting 
older, was one of the button-pushing things she would do. and then 
O.J. would just have other women, I think, during the relationship. 
 
Q: And tell Nicole about it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And how do you know that they did these things to one 
another? 
 
A: Well, I saw -- I heard Nicole tell me certain things, and I could 
see things that would go on at some times. 
 
Q: Tell me what you saw. 
 
A: I guess one of the incidents would be the Jenner incident, of 
being in the car on that Christmas where he got on the phone to 
someone; I don't know who, and it was to prove a point that he, I 
believe, wasn't with someone. and then that would get her mad. 
And I think hers was just maybe going out and dressing, I mean, 
sexy, and going out with the girls. 
 
Q: Tell me --  
 
A: And that's about it that I know. 
 
 
 
Q: That's what you can recall seeing for yourself? 
 
A: (Nods head.) 
 
Q: Did you ever talk with O.J. about the button pushing? 
 
A: I think part of the conversations were -- was just that I -- just 
that, "If you guys couldn't make it work," and I think button 
pushing, "if you couldn't make it work, then get apart. and then 
maybe it'll work later" 
 
Q: What would O.J. say to you in response to that? 
 
A: I don't think there was any kind of response. It was just me kind 
of going on and talking. I mean, I wasn't a counselor -- I mean, 
maybe I was a counselor. I don't know. I wasn't a psychologist. 
 
Q: Did he ever -- did O.J. ever tell you about his feelings towards 
Nicole. whether he loved her? 
 
A: Yeah. he loved her. 
 
Q: Did he tell you that? 
 
A: Yes, I heard him say he loved her. 
 
Q: You heard him say it to her, or did he say it to you? 
 
A: That he had told me he loved her. 
 
Q: When did he tell you that? 
 
A: There were times at the house that they'd be together and I 
would just say, "You two, you should kiss," and they were kissing 
and they were happy. 
 
I mean they laughed together, and it was a, you know, thing at the 
house, at a party, I think, when they were together and I said, 
"Well, you guys should just kiss each other, hug each other," and 
they did, and think that was -- they seemed to get along great. 
 
Q: So you -- in the year and a half that you knew both Nicole and 
O.J., you saw times during the relationship that were good. 
 
A: Yes 
 
Q: And these arc some examples that you're giving us. Right? 
 
A: Yes, definitely, that there were times they were good. 
 
Q: And there were times that were not so good. 
 
A: Stormy times. 
 
Q: Stormy? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And both, you believe, pushed each other's buttons. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
 
 
Q: Tell me about this incident at the Jenners' party in Christmas of 
1993. 
 
A: From everything I remember, I went to this party. It was a 
Christmas Eve party at Bruce Jenner's house. So we're at the party, 
and we pretty much had just gotten in there. There was a lot of 
people there, and it was not everybody that I knew. And I started 
meeting people, and O.J. went one way, and everybody was kind 
of at the party, just talking to people. And then Nicole at about 15 
minutes into it just tapped me and said, "You can stay if you want 
to or you can leave, but we're fighting and we're leaving." 
 
And I said, "I'm gonna go then," so we all left. 
 
And then I went into the car when I believe Faye drove up, Faye 
Resnick, and then Nicole went to her and started telling her what 
the -- what the reason was of the fight. 
 
So I was in the car with the kids in the back seat. and then they 
both got in the car. And it was a quiet ride, and then they started 
yelling at each other, and I don't know exactly what it was about. 
the yelling at the time. because I was in back with the kids. and 
Christmas Eve and occupying them while the argument was up 
front, and then it got a heated argument, and I just said, "Hey, you 
guys it's Christmas Eve." 
 
And I remember him getting on the cell phone, the carphone, and 
saying, I'll prove to you something that -- I don't know exactly 
what, that he was somewhere, but he was on the phone. 
 
And she goes "l don't care. I don't care." 
 
And I said, "It's Christmas. It's Christmas. Let's go." 
 
And then we ended up at the house, and there was a dinner, and it 
was quiet. It was quiet. And something happened where everybody 
became friends again. and it was -- I mean, at least it got better. 
 
So the whole argument, I don't know exactly what it was, but it had 
something to do, I believe. with a girl, and a guy named Joseph 
was at the party. I don't know if that was part of the argument, but 
that was an ex-boyfriend, I believe. of Nicole's. 
 
Q: Did you see O.J. visibly upset? 
 
A: Not at the party. All of a sudden I was pulled out of the party, 
and then it was in the car. 
 
Q: Did you see him visibly upset in the car? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And was he yelling? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And was Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you were with the kids in the back seat? 
 
A: In the back seat. 
 
Q: And how -- Did you observe the children -- You were talking 
about Justin and Sidney. Right? 
 
A: In the back seat. right. 
 
Q: And did you observe the children's reaction to this heated 
argument? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: You've characterized it as 'heated? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It was his word. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I missed it if it was. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Proceed. 
 
A: Yeah, I was in back with the kids and just keeping them 
occupied and joking with them, making jokes, and they were 
laughing, or rolling into them or -- doing goofy stuff. 
 
Q: You were attempting to divert them from the argument? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: The yelling was loud? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: By O.J.? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was there any -- Did Mr. Simpson appear out of control? 
 
A.: There was yelling going on. He was driving the car. I wouldn't 
say he was out of control, but they were both yelling, and he was 
yelling at her, and it was over this thing. He got on the phone and 
said, "I'll show you. I'll prove to you that." 
 
And then she said, "I don't care." And so I didn't know exactly 
what it was about, if that was from the party. so I just kept going, 
"What happened that this is going on?" 
 
Q: It was just kind of sudden that it happened? 
 
A: Yeah. It happened, Like I said. 15 minutes, I think, into the 
party. 
 
Q: Were there ever times at Mr. Simpson's home when you were 
present that you saw he and Nicole get into arguments at the 
house? 
 
A: Not really. I mean, I can't think of -- like major arguments. If 
there was like a thing -- I noticed times when there was just silence 
when there would just be -- I could see that something was up. But 
Nicole sometimes would just get in a mood so there was no talking 
at all, so something was up, something happened. What, I don't 
know, something. You -- I have... 
 
Q: Did you know whether Nicole was seeing Marcus Allen again 
in 1994 after Marcus' marriage? 
 
A: I didn't know it. 
 
Q: No one told you that? 
 
A: No. I know there was something going on with Marcus, but I 
think Marcus is married, so I didn't believe it. 
 
Q: Who did you hear it from? 
 
A: Oh, I knew he got married. 
 
Q: Who did you hear it from that something was going on with 
Marcus? 
 
A: I believe it was Cora. I pretty much talked to only Cora after 
anything had happened because Cora was the only person I really 
talked to. 
 
Q: What do you mean, "after anything had happened"? 
 
A: After the murders. 
 
Q: Your conversations after the murders were with Cora? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you think Cora told you that Nicole had been seeing 
Marcus? 
 
A: I believe that at some point also I heard in May that there was a 
thing that Nicole was seeing Marcus. From who I don't know, but 
it was like one of those things you hear, a rumor. But I didn't know 
-- I couldn't say it was true or not. so it's nothing that I could justify 
and go. "Yes. I know it. I saw it," but I didn't. 
 
Q: Do you have any knowledge about Mr. Simpson flowing Nicole 
around town or checking on her whereabouts? 
 
A: I don't. I don't know. 
 
Q: Did you ever see him do that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever -- did anyone ever tell you that he did that? 
 
A: The incident about -- with [Name Deleted] was the only one I 
really knew, at the Gretna Green house. 
 
Q: Right. Any others? 
 
A: People would say that, that he was following and that, but I 
didn't see it. 
 
Q: Well, tell me who told you that. 
 
A: I believe it was -- you know, I can't say. I thought it was like 
Faye Resnick. but I don't really talk to Faye, so I don't know. But it 
was something you would just hear in Brentwood. 
 
Q: Before Nicole's death? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What would you just hear around Brentwood in this regard? 
 
A: If you got a coffee at like Starbucks, that "O.J. follows Nicole 
around." I can't give a name, so it's tough for me to say. But that 
was something I had heard, that he followed her around. 
 
Q: Did you ever ask O.J. if that was true? 
 
A: No. I didn't see it. I mean, that's -- from what I know, I didn't 
see him following her around. I think also it was one of the things 
that --  
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: There is no question pending, Mr. Kaelin. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Phil, aren't you going to reprimand Bob for 
interrupting the witness? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: I don't even think I was paying attention, I 
think. MR. PETROCELLI: He gave me a hard time about that 
yesterday, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Good. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Why don't we take a short break. 
 
MR. R0BERT BAKER: Why don't we take a lunch. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let's take a lunch break

anyone in which you heard that an investigator of O.J. Simpson 
had called your lawyer? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what did you hear about that conversation? 
 
A: Yeah. it was a phone call to Bill Genego, a criminal lawyer, and 
it was I think the detective, private detective for O.J.'s side had said 
that -- Bill had told me that the detective had a question from O.J. 
to see if I remembered after McDonald's that he went into the 
house, and I said, "No, I didn't. I didn't see him go unto the house." 
 
Q: An investigator called Genego pass a message to you? 
 
A: Yes. And Bill told me what the message -- the question was and 
to give Bill a reply. 
 
Q: The question was, "Did you see O.J. go into the house" --  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- after McDonald's?" 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what did you tell Bill? 
 
A: That I did not. 
 
Q: O.J. Simpson asked you that same question on the evening of 
the l3th in his kitchen. Is that right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: He asked you. "Did you see" -- what did he say to you? 
 
A: It was -- I was in the kitchen area. and he said, "Kato, you saw 
me go into the house."  
 
And I said, "No, I didn't." 
 
Q: Now, when you went into the kitchen with Simpson --  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- that was the first time you were alone with him since the 
night before. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And the only thing Simpsons said to you was this statement that 
you just made? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: "You saw me go into the house. Kato "? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: In other words, did Mr. Simpson ask you any other questions, 
such as. "We took a ride together in the Bentley, Right, Kato?" 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: He didn't ask you that? 
 
A: No, he didn't. 
 
Q: And he didn't ask you, "Well, we were in my house watching 
TV yesterday, talking about things. Right?" He didn't ask you that 
question? 
 
A: No, he didn't. 
 
Q: He didn't ask you, "You saw me get in the limo. Right?" 
 
A: He didn't ask me, no. 
 
Q: None of those kind of questions by me jog your memory into 
remembering any other questions that O.J. asked you? 
 
A: Not that I remember. 
 
Q: You had left the police station from -- on the day of the13th to 
go to Cramer's house. Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And while you were at Cramer's house, you got a phone call? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And from whom? 
 
A: Howard Weitzman. 
 
Q: Now, had you told Howard Weitzman where you were going to 
be? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Had you told anyone in Mr. Simpson's residence where you 
were going to be? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: Do you know how Howard Weitzman tracked you down? 
 
A: I don't. I don't have any idea. 
 
Q: Were you surprised that you got a phone call from Howard 
Weitzman? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did Howard Weitzman say to you on the telephone? 
 
First of all. was Simpson on that call. too? 
 
A: Yes. It was a three-way call. I cannot remember like the 
conversation that went on. I think it was for set up a meeting, and I 
think he asked me about the events. It seemed to be -- I think that's 
what happened, because that would seem logical, that it would 
have been talking about the events of the night. 
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: And I think I discussed it with him. and I think that was it. I 
think he said he was going to set up an appointment to meet. 
 
Q: Did you ever meet him?. 
 
A: I never met him. 
 
Q: So you think in the telephone call with Weitzman and Simpson 
that you were asked what the events of the night before were 
according to your memory. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did they ask you what you had told the police? 
 
A: I think so. I think I told them. 
 
Q: Simpson and Weitzman asked you what you told the police 
earlier in the day. 
 
A: I'm pretty sure. yes. I told them that I was there, that I had been 
at the police station, and they had asked and I think I told them. 
 
Q: And you told them, in effect, the events that you recalled? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when you related the events to Simpson and Weitzman that 
you had told the police earlier, did you say anything about not 
seeing Mr. Simpson go into the house after Me Donald's? 
 
A: If that question was asked to me, I would have answered it that 
way, yes. 
 
Q: Do you have a recollection of exactly what you said to them 
you told the police or generally what you told them? 
 
A: Told the police? 
 
Q: No. Weitzman and Simpson. 
 
A: I think I would have gone over that night, and if that question 
was asked about going into the house, I would have, I'm pretty 
sure. said., "No, I didn't see him go into the house." 
 
Q: Okay. Now. later on that evening you went to the Simpson 
residence, and you've described those events. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And the next day you said Arnelle took you to Shapiro and 
Taft's office. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And Slotkin made the comment to you, "It 's O.J. You better get 
your story right"? 
 
A: Yes, he did. 
 
Q: And you also said O.J. told you to tell the truth or something 
like that. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When you got to the Simpson residence the evening of the 13th, 
was anyone inquiring of you what you had told the police? 
 
A: I think people were saying to me at the house -- the specific 
people, I don't know. I think it was just the people that were at the 
house that day were saying, "What did they ask you? What did you 
tell them?" 
 
And I tried to make it a point of not saying anything, like, "Oh. just 
questions," and that. "and what happened. " I was trying to not talk 
about it to anybody. 
 
Q: When you were talking to Mr. Simpson after the recital on June 
l2, did he tell you that his relationship with Nicole was over for 
good? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did Nicole Simpson ever tell you that she caught Mr. Simpson 
in bed with another woman while she was pregnant? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Relate that story to me. 
 
A: I was living at Gretna Green, and it was a story -- one of the 
stories she would have told me was that when she was pregnant, 
that O.J. had got someone in the guest house, and he caught her 
with the girl. 
 
Q: She caught him? 
 
A: Nicole caught O.J. in the guest room with another girl. 
 
Q: And she was pregnant with Sydney at the time? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: That's what Nicole told you 
 
A: Yes. she did.

O.J. would kill her one day. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did she ever tell you how she thought O.J. would kill her?

Q: How did she say O.J. would kill her? 
 
A: She said with scissors. 
 
Q: Did she say what would happen to O.J. if O.J. did kill her? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
A: What did she say? 
 
A: She had said that "If O.J. would ever kill me, he'll get away 
with it because he's O.J. Simpson." 
 
Q: She told that to you. 
 
A: She said that to me. 
 
Q: And she told that to you during the time that you were living at 
Gretna Green? 
 
A: At Gretna Green. 
 
Q: Was there anything that you recall that prompted these 
comments by her? 
 
A: No. It was just -- it would be one of the tea talks or stuff, she 
would start opening up about her life. 
 
Q: When you say "tea talks," Mr. Baker is smiling I would like to 
know --  
 
A: It was -- Q: -- what do you mean, for the record? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: My countenance is not an issue in this 
case. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: He wasn't here yesterday, or maybe he was --  
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I was. I think this is very entertaining. 
Not true , but entertaining. 
 
THE WITNESS: Gretna Green, I was in the guest house in back. 
and sometimes she'd knock on the door and say, "Oh, you know, 
I'm seeing if you want to talk," or she'd just start talking. and then 
we'd go in the house and she'd make tea or something to drink and 
talk --  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Do you drink tea? 
 
A: Sometimes tea or whatever was in the refrigerator. 
 
Q: Did Nicole drink tea? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was it hot tea? 
 
A: Hot tea. Decaffeinated usually. 
 
Q: Decaffeinated? 
 
A: Usually, yeah. Like the Celestial Seasonings, I think, that type 
of tea. 
 
Q: You had a conversation with Cora Fishman after Nicole's death. 
Right? 
 
A: I did. 
 
Q: On several conversations. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now. did Cora ever tell you, as between O.J. and Nicole, who 
ended the relationship? 
 
A: Cora said that Nicole had ended the relationship. 
 
Q: Did she tell you when? 
 
A: I believe it was sometime in May. 
 
Q: Did Cora tell you when Nicole had -- excuse me -- where 
Nicole had reached that decision? 
 
A: It was a trip they had in Cabo, Cabo San Lucas, that she decided 
that it was over. 
 
Q: When Cora told that to you, was anyone else present? 
 
A: I don't think so. It was just me. Q: Was your lawyer present, 
Michael Plotkin? 
 
A: Oh. at one of the conversations. yes. 
 
Q: With you and Cora? 
 
A: Cora Fishman. 
 
Q: When Cora said this about Nicole having decided to end the 
relationship in Cabo. 
 
A: Yes. Q: May of 1994? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Did Cora tell you that Nicole had said that it's over 
forever? 
 
A: Yes. Q: Did O.J. Simpson ever talk to you and describe Nicole 
as stubborn? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And made some comments, "It must be her German ancestry"? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did O.J. say to you about Nicole in that regard? 
 
A: There were just things that would happen certain times. Nicole 
would do -- they were going to take a trip together, and many times 
Nicole would -- O.J. would already get the ticket, and Nicole 
would just cancel it. 
 
It was kinda like the ebb and flow of things would go that way, and 
she would have a -- sometimes this streak that she would have it 
her way, and he would relate it to her being of German ancestry. 
 
And there would be. like I said, these trips that would come, and I 
think Cathy Randa would make the reservations and everything, 
and they would l be ready to take a trip, and then she would just 
cancel that day after he got the ticket, and that would cause another 
big problem of -- between them in their relationship. 
 
Q: O.J. told you those things? 
 
A: Yeah, and I saw that happen with that. With the German thing, 
he told me that, and then also the cancellation of trips I've seen. 
when the trips were canceled. 
 
Q: You saw that for yourself? 
 
A: Well, I knew just where and what was going to happen, when 
she was going to be gone for a weekend. I'd go, "I thought you 
were gone." 
 
She goes "No, I'm not gonna go. I canceled it." 
 
Q: And O.J. would get upset about it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did -- Yesterday you testified that when you saw Mr. Simpson, 
he usually was wearing a ring. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: A large ring? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: On his what, ring finger? 
 
A: I think it was here (Indicating). 
 
Q: Left hand? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Is it the ring that Mr. Simpson is wearing now that you usually 
see him wear? 
 
A: That's usually the ring. 
 
Q: The ring he wore yesterday. Right? 
 
A: I think that's what he wore yesterday, yeah. I don't know. That 
was the hand yesterday, I guess. I think. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Did you say left or right hand that he 
usually had the ring on when you saw him? 
 
THE WITNESS: I would think it was the right. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You see it's on his left. Right 
 
A: Yeah. I see it's on the left. 
 
MR. SIMPSON: I don't wear rings on the right hand. I've never 
known a man to do that. 
 
THE WITNESS: I have one on. 
 
BY Mr. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You've been interviewed by a number of lawyers, haven't you?

Q: Did Nicole ever mention it to you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Cora Fishman? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And after the death of Ron and Nicole, did anyone ever mention 
to you Ron's name? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Who? 
 
A: Cora. 
 
Q: What did Cora say to you about Ron Goldman? 
 
A: That Cora said that they had seen each other sometimes, they 
had coffee together, that he had driven her car. and she didn't say 
they were dating, but I think they were -- there was an interest 
 
Q: By whom? 
 
A: I think by both. I don't know that for sure, but they had seen 
each other. 
 
Q: And Cora was telling you about Nicole and Ron. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did Cora tell you that O.J. Simpson knew that there might be an 
interest between Ron and Nicole? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: Did she say anything about O.J. ever meeting or seeing Ron 
Goldman? 
 
A: I don't believe so. Not that I can remember, 
 
Q: Has anyone else ever told you that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you have any information about that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is that all that Cora told you about Ron Goldman? 
 
A: I think so.

night he was murdered?

A: That I can remember, yes. 
 
Q: Did she tell you -- did Cora tell you anything about what 
Nicole's plans were the evening she was murdered after she got 
back from dinner at Mezzaluna? 
 
A: It was I think that she was -- someone was coming over, and 
there was gonna be a get-together and --  
 
Q: Cora told you that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Cora said that Nicole was meeting a man that evening? 
 
A: I believe it was a man and someone else, a woman, too. 
 
Q: Two people were coming over? 
 
A: I thought so. 
 
Q: That's what Cora told you? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: And did Cora indicate who these people were? 
 
A: I thought it might have been Faye Resnick. 
 
Q: Faye was in a treatment center at that time. 
 
A: That's who I thought it was, was Faye. But that one person was 
coming over. I thought it was Faye was the other person, and it was 
a girl that was involved. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I just want to object to you testifying. 
 
THE WITNESS: That's all I can remember.

Fishman after Nicole's death --  
 
A: Yeah.

woman were going to visit Nicole?

was Ron.

all, but I didn't know at the time. 
 
Q: You didn't know at the time? 
 
A: No, I did not. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Simpson ever talk to you about his public image? 
 
A: Yeah, I guess that people like him.

A: Oh, that people liked him, and I think he was on the board of a 
few different companies. 
 
Q: Did he ever talk to you about the type of image that he believed 
he had in the public or with the public?

wanted to project? 
 
A: I don't remember. It was -- I don't remember.

A: Yes. That it was important to be liked by people, yes. 
 
Q: What else did he say about that subject? 
 
A: I just -- it was O.J., and he had to have people like him. I think 
it was a thing, he liked to be around people. 
 
Q: This is what he told you? 
 
A: From what I can remember, he said that he liked people liking 
him, and giving autographs was very important to him, and people 
would come by and ask for autographs all the time or sign certain 
things, and -- - 
 
Q: Did he ever complain to you about his celebrity status? 
 
A: I don't know how the question -- I don't understand it.

A: Yes. 
 
Q: And from whom did you hear this? 
 
A: From Nicole.

Also the police, the detectives on the police.

for anything relating to this case. 
 
Is there anything that you have to give me? 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: There are no documents to my knowledge of 
which you did not already have copies, with the exception of one, 
and I believe that would be the Eliot manuscript, and I don't have a 
copy of it. 
 
THE WITNESS: I think-- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Do you? 
 
A: I think Bill Genego has everything. 
 
Q: He has -- what do you mean by "everything"? 
 
A: I think he has the -- a cassette tape and the manuscript, 
manuscript of the -- his first draft of Eliot's. I believe Bill has it.

Q: On you for this deposition. 
 
A: I didn't -- I think Bill knows, but I didn't tell him. I never 
received -- it came to Mike's office, I think. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: Yes, it came to my office. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: If there is any thing that Mr. Genego has that 
is responsive to my subpoena, Mr. Plotkin, can you make that 
available? 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: Yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: When you -- you testified yesterday that you told Mr. Simpson 
when you saw him out near the limousine that you had heard some 
noises. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then he said something like. you know, "you go that way. 
I'll go this way." and you told the rest of that story. Do you 
remember that? 
 
A: Yes. I do. 
 
Q: When you told Mr. Simpson that you had heard noises, did you 
tell Mr. Simpson when you had heard the noises? 
 
A: No. I did not. I didn't say that. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Simpson ask you when you had heard the noises? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: From your bedroom in the guest house, can you see the upstairs 
of Mr. Simpson's bedroom? 
 
A: Yeah, I can see the windows and part of, you know, his room. 
 
Q: Can you see whether or not his lights are on? 
 
A: Yeah, I can see if the lights were on. 
 
Q: Can you see whether or not his television is on? 
 
A: I could if -- yes, I could. I could tell if it was on. 
 
Q: How could you tell from your room downstairs whether his 
television was on in his bedroom upstairs? 
 
A: You could see the glare off his window and you can see part of 
the TV screen. 
 
Q: Have you observed from the vantage point of your room the 
television flashing in his bedroom? 
 
A: I could tell -- if I was gonna come out of my room, I could see 
through the door and all that, oh, he had the TV on. He must be 
watching TV. 
 
Q: Now, when you came out of the -- of your room to go 
investigate the sounds that you heard --  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- and you went out into the backyard to begin your route 
around the house-- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: -- did you notice if Mr. Simpson's bedroom lights were on? 
 
A: I thought they were off. I thought the lights in the bottom were 
off, and I thought the lights upstairs were on. In my testimony 
before I always thought the lights upstairs were on. 
 
Q: When you say 'upstairs." you mean Mr. Simpson's bedroom? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you observe any sign or flashing or any other 
indication that the television in Mr. Simpson's bedroom was on? 
 
A: I did not notice it. 
 
Q: Then you walked around the property, you said you thought that 
the lights downstairs were off? 
 
A: I thought they were off, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And when you walked around the path, saw the 
limousine and then walked down the driveway to the garage to 
investigate the sounds, did you observe whether the lights 
downstairs in the front of the house were on or off? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: By the "front of the house," do you mean 
the coach lights at the entrance, or do you mean interior lights? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I don't know what "coach lights" mean, 
but let's talk about interior lights. 
 
THE WITNESS: I believe, from what I recollect, the lights in the 
bottom were not on, in the bottom of the --  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Inside the house? 
 
A: Inside the house there was dark. 
 
Q: Now, Mr. Baker just interjected a comment about "coach 
lights." Do you remember if -- do you know what he's talking 
about, by the way, what coach lights are? 
 
A: I thought the coach lights were lights that were the small ones 
on the path, but now I know coach lights are on the door, brighter 
lights. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That what you mean, Mr. --  
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yeah, that we've been talking about for 
five days in Mr. Simpson's deposition. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You mean the lights up near the door. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Sure, the two lights on either side of the 
door. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: On the outside. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Front lights, either side of the door. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: He wasn't here for those five days. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I understand. 
 
MR. KELLY: Nor does he live there 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Now, I asked you about coach lights yesterday, and I'm glad 
Mr. Baker brought this up-- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: So am I now. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: -- because I was a little confused yesterday because you referred 
to coach lights as lights that were apparently on the ground. Is that 
right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And your recollection was that the lights on the ground were on 
or off? 
 
A: The ground lights I thought were on. They're usually on. 
 
Q: And these lights that are being called coach lights that were 
outside the front door, left and right of the door --  
 
A: I recollect those being off. 
 
Q: Now, do you recollect those being off as you went by the door 
the first time to investigate? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And do you -- when you went by the door the first time to 
investigate, did you go past the Bentley to get to the garage? 
 
A: Yes, I walked by. a you walked by the Bentley? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: The Bentley was in the driveway? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you see anything behind the Bentley? 
 
A: I don't remember. l don't think so. I think it was -- there was 
nothing there. 
 
Q: In other words, did you see this black knapsack that later on you 
saw? 
 
A: At that time I believe I did not see it. 
 
Q: And then you walked by the Bentley and you go investigate. 
Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, when you came back and walked back to the limousine -- 
to the area where the limousine was waiting outside, you then let 
the limousine in. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So on your way back to letting the limousine in, did you notice 
if any of the downstairs interior lights had been turned on? 
 
A: I thought the lights were on. I thought then lights were on. 
 
Q: And did you also think that the downstairs coach lights on the 
outside of the entryway door were on? 
 
A: I think so. I think they were on. 
 
Q: Now, at any time during this trip in -- to investigate the sounds 
and go back to let the limo driver in, did you see O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: I -- in my head I remember always seeing the dark sweat suit. 
The time, I don 't know. I don 't know. I was investigating sounds. 
I always have a picture in my head of the dark suit. and I can't 
distinguish exact time, but it was the time that the limo driver was -
- I think -- I don't know if he was already out or in, but I just 
remember that always having a dark suit. 
 
Q: Well. I'm focusing on a period of time now before you let the 
limo driver in. Okay? 
 
A: I can't --  
 
Q: Let me ask you this question: When you came back from 
investigating the noises the first time and you walked back towards 
the Ashford gate, you had to walk by the Bentley. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: When you said "by the Bentley," I mean, 
I'm not sure what-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The Bentley is in that area. and he has to go 
past it. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: It's 20 feet away. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, Mr. Baker, let's get out-- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Let's do that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let's do that. 
 
Q: I am showing you what we have previously seen yesterday. 
This is Plaintiffs' 27. and this is a sketch of the Rockingham 
property, and I cannot represent that this is to scale. I just don't 
know. 
 
Anyway, you told us yesterday that you -- when you came out 
from this pathway behind the house on the north side -- Do you see 
that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- you walked out onto the driveway. You did not stop to wave 
or signal in any way to the limousine. Is that right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: You didn't even know who the driver was. Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you came down the limousine and you walked around the 
garage. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: To go investigate. 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Now, where was the Bentley? 
 
A: (Indicating.) 
 
Q: Okay. You are pointing to this little alcove. Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And did you see, when you came by that time to investigate, 
whether there was any piece of luggage --  
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: -- on the ground behind the Bentley or on the lawn, for that 
matter? 
 
A: I'm pretty sure there was not. 
 
Q: Now, at some point --  
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Can you answer his question? Did you 
check and see? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I didn't ask that question. I didn't ask that 
question. That will be your question. 
 
Q: Did you see it? 
 
A: I don't recollect seeing it. 
 
Q: You do not recall seeing it. 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Now, when you came back from investigating and went to let 
the limousine driver, did you see it then? 
 
And by "it," I mean any piece of luggage like the black knapsack 
that you later saw. 
 
A: On my second trip? 
 
Q: On the return from the first trip. 
 
A: I don't remember seeing it, no. 
 
Q: Okay. Then you went and let the limousine driver in. Right? 
 
A: I believe so. Yes. 
 
Q: And the limousine pulls in. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And then you had a little conversation with the limousine 
driver, and then you went back to investigate a second time. Right? 
 
A: I think I put the golf clubs in. 
 
Q: Yes. you did. I am not trying to, by the way, have you testify 
about the whole thing again. I'm just sort of cutting to particular 
points. But you 're right, that you said yesterday. 
 
After you put the golf clubs in and conversed with the driver. You 
then went back to investigate a second time. Is that right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And when you came back to investigate the second time. did 
you see the black knapsack or other piece of luggage was --  
 
A: I think --  
 
Q: -- at the base of the Bentley? 
 
A: I think I noticed it being there. 
 
Q: When you investigated the second time? 
 
A: Yes. came back. 
 
Q: On the way back? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: On the way back. So you turned around and then headed back 
towards the house. 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: And did you pick it up at that time 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- to take it back to the house 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you saw it, did you wonder what it was? 
 
A: I believe so. I saw a bag there. I didn't know if it was part of the 
trip or not, the packing, but I saw a bag. 
 
Q: And then you walked back to the limousine. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then Later on, you told us moments later, after you went in 
the house with Simpson and came back out, you then went to 
retrieve that black knapsack. Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And is that the same knapsack that you believe you had 
previously seen? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when you attempted to retrieve it, Mr. Simpson said? 
 
A: "I'll get it. Okay, I got it." 
 
Q: And then he overtook you to get it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you see what he did with it? 
 
A: I didn't. I never saw it again. 
 
Q: You don't know if he took it in the back seat with him? 
 
A: I don't remember at all. I don't remember seeing him pick it up 
or anything. I was walking back already when the action took 
place. 
 
Q: When Mr. Simpson passed by you to get the black knapsack, 
was he carrying anything? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: Did you see him at any time go down to the Rockingham gate, 
go out the gate and go to the Bronco? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you see him go to the Bronco? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you see him go to the Rockingham gate? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you see him open the Rockingham gate? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know if the Rockingham gate can be opened manually 
without requiring the gate to open electronically? 
 
A: I don't think it can. I don't think that gate can. 
 
Q: Can you somehow slip in and out without the gate opening --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- all the way? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: You don't know of any way of doing it. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever tried getting in that gate without opening it up 
with the key? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether you can get onto the property from the 
[Name Deleted]' property directly to the south? 
 
A: I believe you can. 
 
Q: You can. 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And how can you do so? Well, could you do so in June of 
1994? 
 
A: I believe you could, yes. 
 
Q: And how could you have done so in June of 1994? 
 
A: I think just walking their front way. 
 
Q: Show me on the map. 
 
A: I think you can just get in that way (Indicating). 
 
Q: Onto the [Name Deleted]' property. Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. In other words, you just walk on their property. Right? 
 
A: Right.  
 
Q: Is there any opening in the shrubs or in the fence to your 
knowledge that existed in June of l994 by which you could have 
then simply walked onto the Simpson property? 
 
A: To my knowledge, I don't know of any. 
 
Q: Did you ever -- There is a fence there on the south side. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you ever jump that fence yourself? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you went to investigate the voices the first time and then 
walked back, is it when you walked back to the limousine that you 
saw the interior lights on at that time? 
 
A: I can't be positive. I remember in my testimony at some point I 
said the doors were opened and I thought the lights were on, the 
front doors-- 
 
Q: I see. 
 
A: -- and I don't remember the exact timing of that, but I remember 
saying in testimony, "The doors were open and the lights were on," 
and my concentration was still on the thumps --  
 
Q: I'm not trying to ask you about what your testimony was. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Let him finish, though. 
 
THE WITNESS: Oh. okay. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I just want you to tell me what your recollection is of the events 
of that night. 
 
A: That I remember at that -- I can't remember the exact trip -- 
could have been the second one -- where I thought the doors were 
open and those coach lights were on and the lights were on 
downstairs, from what I remember. 
 
Q: And could it have been the return of the first trip that you then 
saw the lights on and doors open for the first time? 
 
A: It could have been. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, at anytime before you let that Limousine driver in, 
do you believe you saw a person who you believed to be O.J. 
Simpson? 
 
A: It could have been. It could have been-- 
 
Q: When you say, "It could have been," where could it have been? 
 
A: Right here (Indicating). Could have been happening here 
(Indicating). 
 
Q: You are pointing to the area where the Rockingham --  
 
Excuse me, Mr. Simpson? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: He's discussing something with his 
lawyer. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I know, but he's discussing it audibly at a 
time when I'm trying to complete my examination of the witness, 
and it's interfering. 
 
THE WITNESS: There was -- that I -- in my head there was just --  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I want to go back to where we were before Mr. Simpson 
interjected. Okay? 
 
You said that you saw a person who you believed could have been 
O.J. Simpson on -- at the corner where the Rockingham driveway 
intersects the Ashford -- I'm sorry -- where the driveway coming 
from Rockingham intersects the driveway coming from Ashford at 
that corner there. Right? 
 
A: Yeah, I remember seeing O.J. outside. I don't know if it was at 
the time I let the limo in or not, but it was the dark sweat suit, and 
that I remember. 
 
Q: You have a clear image of seeing O.J. in a dark sweat suit? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you have a clear image of seeing O.J. in a dark sweat suit 
at that spot that you just indicated where I am pointing to 
(Indicating)? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: The corner right there (Indicating)? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Sort of behind where the Bentley would be? 
 
A: Well, I think it was more here -- it was I thought walking right 
around here (Indicating). 
 
Q: Walking? 
 
A: I was over here (Indicating). I think it was kind of in a walking 
mode. 
 
Q: Walking in what direction? 
 
A: It looked like to the door. 
 
Q: Walking to the front door. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: So from the general direction of the Bentley? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So you believe you may -- you believe you saw O.J. Simpson 
walking from the general vicinity of the Bentley to the general 
vicinity of the front entrance of the door. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And when you saw that person, you thought it was O.J. 
Simpson. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You didn't think it was a prowler, did you? 
 
A: No. It was O.J. 
 
Q: Did he have on a black robe? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: He's not a judge . 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You said he had on a black sweat suit. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Can you describe that sweat suit for us? 
 
A: I thought it was that one I described before. It was like a black-
all black. I thought + there was a white type zipper. 
 
Q: Was it a two-piece? One-piece? Jogging? I mean, can you give 
us a little more description? 
 
A: I think it was a jogging -- I think it reminded my of like a 
jogging/tennis outfit. and black with a white-kind of a sharp one. It 
just was black with white -- like if this zipper went all the way 
down like this (Indicating), it was white, and then black. Black 
pants. 
 
Q: And did you notice the shoes? 
 
A: I didn't. 
 
Q: Were they dark shoes? 
 
A: It could have been, but I don't know. I don't know. 
 
Q: If you thought that person was Simpson. did you say something 
to him? 
 
 
 
A: That's what I don't know, if it was the time that happened. I 
remember seeing like the dark sweat suit. I thought that was the 
suit -- the entire time was the dark suit. So I don't know if Alan 
Park was in yet or not. I can't get it in my mind the exact timing of 
that, of that event, but I remember a dark sweat suit in my head and 
O.J. in a dark suit. 
 
Q: But you also remembered seeing a person walk from the 
vicinity of the Bentley to the front door. 
 
A: Going towards the front door. I didn't see anybody go in. I don't 
know if the doors were open at that time or not. I can't associate in 
my head if the doors were open yet or not. 
 
I just have that image that O.J. was in a dark sweat suit. 
 
When that person -- when you saw O.J. walking towards the front 
door, do you know if the lights on the outside were on or off? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Or the lights on the inside of the house, were they on or off? 
 
A: I don't -- I can't remember. I don't remember if they were on or 
off. 
 
Q: After you saw Mr. Simpson heading in that direction of the 
front door, do you remember what you did next? 
 
A: That's when -- I don't know if that's when I let the limo driver or 
if he was in already or not. I'm trying to remember if that's the 
timing of when I let him in. I can't remember the exact moment if 
he was already in or not. 
 
There was just so much that was going on, with the call to Rachel 
back there, the noises I heard, the little flashlight, and I couldn't 
associate it. and I think that's when I let the limo driver in, but I'm 
not l00 percent positive. I just don't know. I just don't know. 
 
Q: You're not a hundred percent positive if that occurred before or 
after you saw the-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- let the driver in? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: What's your best recollection? Was it before or after you let the 
limo in? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: If you have a best recollection. 
 
THE WITNESS: I can't recollect when it was. I don't know for 
sure. I don't know for sure when it was. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I am not asking you for sure. I am asking you what your best 
recollection is, whether you saw Mr. Simpson heading towards the 
front door before or after you let the limo driver in. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: Don't guess. If you don't know, say you don't 
remember. 
 
THE WITNESS: I just don't know. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well --  
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know because this is so long ago and 
there's been so many news stories. that I'm so confused. So I don't 
know if it's before or after. I can't -- I don't -- BY MR. 
PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I am asking what your best recollection is. Do you have an 
answer? 
 
A: I don't know. I can't say. 
 
Q: You let the driver in. Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And no one had let him in before you let the driver in. Right? 
 
A: I let the driver in, correct. 
 
Q: Was Mr. Simpson -- what pace was Mr. Simpson walking? 
Quickly? Slowly? 
 
A: I --  
 
MR. PLOTKIN: When? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: When you saw him go from the area of the Bentley to the 
entranceway of the house in dark sweats. 
 
A: I thought it was in a fast motion. 
 
Q: A fast motion. And we will have to stop now because they want 
to change the tape. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: This is the end of tape No. of Volume II. 
The time is approximately 3:15, and we are off the record. 
 
(Recess.) 
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 84 was marked for identification by the reporter 
and is attached hereto.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are on the record. The time is 
approximately 3:38. This is the beginning of tape No. 2 of Volume 
II. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: We are back on the record after the tape change. and I've gotten 
copies of what was previously marked as Exhibit 27. We have re-
marked a Xerox copy of that as Exhibit 84. Mr. Kaelin, I am going 
to ask you to make some markings on this. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: Can I have one? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Oh. sure. I'm sorry. And then we will hand 
out copies of this at the end. 
 
Q: When you -- could you with blue pen circumscribe your path 
starting with the departure from your room -- before you do it, let 
me tell you what I want you to do -- departure from your room 
around to the driveway when you went to first investigate the 
sounds and then around the garage where you went? 
 
Okay? Do you understand my question? 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: I think it will make it easier to make it with a 
marking pen 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Okay. Do you understand the question? 
 
A: Make -- draw my route . 
 
Q: Right from your room, yeah, and then to where you investigated 
the --  
 
A: The noise the first time 
 
Q: The first time, correct. (Witness complies.) 
 
Q: And that's where you stopped. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Because you were frightened. A: Right I picked up the gate and 
came back that far. 
 
Q: When you made that initial route, your testimony is you did not 
see any lights on in the inside, you did not see the coach lights on 
the Outside, and you did not see the knapsack behind the Bentley. 
Is that right? 
 
A: As far as I remember, yes. 
 
 
 
Q: By the way, following up on Mr. Baker's suggested question 
about 20 minutes ago, did you check to see if the knapsack was 
behind the Bentley or if anything was behind the Bentley? 
 
A: I don't believe that I did. I was kinda focused on that. 
 
Q: Now, during the time of that entire route, of course, the limo 
driver is still outside the Ashford gate. Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you had not spoken to him yet. Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And did you take that walk rather briskly? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And was it a matter of seconds for you to get, let's say, from 
this path to the garage? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. And from the beginning of the driveway --  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: - -- where the path terminates to the garage is a matter of 
seconds. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. Correct. 
 
Q: Now --  
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Everything is a matter of seconds. It's just 
how many. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: It's a few seconds. Right? Correct? 
 
A: (Nods head.) 
 
Q: You're shaking your head. You have to answer audibly. 
 
A: It has to be from there to there (Indicating), I'm thinking 10 
seconds. 
 
Q: Could it be less than 10? 
 
A: Could be. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, on the way back from that trip of investigating the 
sounds --  
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: -- is that when you recall seeing O.J. Simpson go into the 
house? 
 
A: I don't know for a fact. I just -- I don't know. I just don't know if 
that's when I did see him or not. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: In my mind I saw the dark outfit, but I do not know when. 
 
Q: Okay. Tell me when -- tell me -- excuse me. Describe the route 
with your pen -- hold on before you make a mark -- that you saw 
Mr. Simpson take from the vicinity of the Bentley into the vicinity 
of the entryway, as you previously testified. You said he was 
moving --  
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Do we have another color? 
 
MR. PETROCELL1: It's not going to Xerox. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Regardless, we are going to have this as -
- It's okay. I mean, whatever you want. 
 
MR. PETROCELL1: You can do a squiggly line. 
 
Q: Why don't you do a squiggly line 
 
MR. BREWER: Designate line 1, Line 2. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Just put a dotted Line. That's all. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: A dotted line where you first picked up Simpson walking in the 
direction of the -- not where you were --  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: -- where he was, where you first picked him up and then where 
you last saw him. 
 
A: I thought it was right about here (Indicating). 
 
Q: That's what you saw. 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: Now, that squiggly line -- Mr. Simpson just asked, "Who was 
that? You" I think you're saying that that was Mr. Simpson. Right? 
 
A: I believe, yes, that's Mr. Simpson. 
 
Q: That squiggly line is what you saw Mr. Simpson doing: 
Walking in the vicinity of the entryway to the door. right, to the 
house? 
 
A: Yeah. I saw him there. I believe he was walking to the house. I 
don t know if he was walking in or out. I just saw --  
 
Q: And what did he have on? 
 
A: Black sweats. 
 
Q: And what shoes did he have on? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Are you sure? 
 
A: Yeah, I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, put an X where you were at that time that -- point 
in time that you saw Mr. Simpson heading towards the house. 
 
A: I thought it was right here (Indicating). 
 
Q: Take it a little bit more discernible. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Circle maybe. Okay. X. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: X. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Perfect. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You're the ultimate politician. You did both a circle and an X. 
Okay? 
 
A: And now I am going to have Paul Lynne in the center to block. 
Circle gets the square. I'm sorry. 
 
Q: When you -- Where did you then next go after you turned and 
saw Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: If this was at the time -- I don't recollect l00 percent, I don't 
know if the limo driver was in yet or not, but after my first trip I 
went to the gate box and let him in. Seeing O.J. there, I don't know 
if it was on that first trip or not. I just saw the dark sweat suit, him 
there at that time. The exact time, I just don't remember. 
 
Q: Let me ask you this question: When you went to open the gate 
for the limo driver, did you wonder to yourself, why is the limo 
driver still out there? 
 
A: Yeah, I just -- he was out there. Yeah, from coming in there, 
and then I started saying to myself, "I should open the limo." 
 
Q: Did you wonder to yourself. "Why is the limo driver still out 
there. because I've seen O.J. already?" 
 
A: I just didn't know. I didn't know 
 
Q: But did that thought enter your mind, that the limo driver is still 
out there, you had just seen O.J.: what s going on? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE W1TNESS: So much on my mind, I just -- 1 don't -- I can't -- 
I just can't answer it 100 percent. I just can't. It's on my mind -- BY 
MR. PETROCELLI q: Well, give me your best recollection. I 
know you are trying very hard --  
 
A: 1t's so incredible that I just -- can't answer it where it was -- I 
was thinking of the noise. I was thinking of calling her back, and --  
 
Q: No, no. 
 
A: I know. Everything was in my mind at the time that I can't 
answer the question. 
 
Q: Stay with me. Okay? I'm trying to ask a specific question now. 
Okay? 
 
Had you already seen O.J. when you let in the Limo? 
 
A: I don't know. I don't know. 
 
Q: And when you went -- when you let in the limousine, did you 
think to yourself, "I wonder why he 's still out there. because I've 
already seen O.J"? Did that thought enter your mind? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Leading. Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: I just don't know. I don't know if that's what I 
was thinking. I don't know if the door was already open and the 
coach lights were on. I just can't get it in my mind, the thought of it 
-- of that happening, if the lights were on or not, if I saw O.J., that 
the doors were already open when I saw him there. Had the doors -
- were they opened already when saw him, that's what I'm confused 
on. It's such a -- it's -- that's what I'm troubled with. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I understand, but I am trying to get to the truth here. Okay? 
 
Draw the path that you took from the garage to the limo when you 
went to open the limo box. 
 
A: I think I --  
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: The "limo box'"? I'm not sure I 
understand that question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I'm sorry. That was a bad question. 
 
Q: When you went to let the limo driver in, what path did you take 
from the garage to the limo? 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: You mean the gate box? 
 
A: Oh. 
 
Q: I mean draw a continuous line. 
 
A: I think it was here (Indicating). 
 
Q: Yeah 
 
A: I think I saw golf clubs. 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: And then I went over here (Indicating). 
 
Q: Okay. And then you let the limo in. Right? 
 
A: I believe that was it. 
 
Q: Now, when you took that path, the lights were already on. 
Right? 
 
A: I think so. I think the door might have been opened. 
 
Q: Okay. And then you let the limo driver in? 
 
A: I think so, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And then he came in. 
 
A: Yes. I came -- he came there after the second trip. That I know. 
It was my -- I was going -- after this first trip it was coming there --  
 
Q: Hold on. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Let him finish. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: But he is not answering my question. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: But that doesn't matter, understand it 
does, but what I'm saying is that it doesn't matter in terms of your 
interrupting him. He should be able to finish his answer. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Mr. Kaelin. when you then -- when the limo driver was let in by 
you, okay, and the car came in, you said yesterday that the dog -- 
you called Chachi --  
 
A: Chachi. 
 
Q: -- to make sure that Chachi wasn't going to get run over. Right? 
Did the Ashford street open? 
 
A: After I pushed the button, yes. 
 
Q: Yeah. By the way, did Chachi run out the gate? 
 
A: No. Chachi was just by a patch of grass on this side 
(Indicating), and then when he saw the doors open -- the doors -- 
the windows open --  
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Gate. 
 
THE WITNESS: -- gate open thank you -- he kind of cut in front 
and I had to make sure he got there before the limo would hit him,

conversation with him. and that's when you went the second time t 
look. Right? 
 
A: Yes.

investigate the sounds, did you see the knapsack behind the 
Bentley?

Q: Coming back the second time. 
 
A: I think that's --  
 
Q: Were you checking to see? 
 
A: NO. 
 
Q: You just happened to notice it? 
 
A: Yeah. I think it just stood out, I believe. I just saw a knapsack 
there.

A: I did not. 
 
Q: Was there any lighting on the property near that Bentley or 
behind that Bentley?

track lighting, and that ' s what I was on. I believe, those -- around 
the grass areas, like lamp Lights.

of light (Indicating).

TV at any time on June 12th?

Q: Yes. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When Mr. Simpson watches TV downstairs, , do you know 
what room he watches TV? 
 
A: Usually in the living room or the den where the big screen is. 
 
Q: In the den where the big screen is, what --  
 
A: There is also a TV though, that could be on. It's in the nook 
area. 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: That sometimes can be watched if the --  
 
Q: Can you write that on Exhibit 84, where that would be. where 
that big TV is? 
 
A: Okay. Should I put both TVs down. Would that help you out? 
 
Q: First put "den," d -- e -- n. 
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: And can those lights be seen -- when the den lights are on or the 
television lights are on in the den, do you know if they can be seen 
from the Ashford Street?

A: The front entrance, nook, TV. Nook. 
 
Q: Okay. And when that TV is on, do you know whether it can be 
seen from right outside the driveway there? 
 
A: It might be able to, because you could turn that TV around. 
 
Q: And if that light is on in the nook. could that be seen right 
outside the driveway? 
 
A: Pretty sure it could, yeah. 
 
Q: When you took your first route to go behind the garage, did you 
see those lights on? 
 
A: I did not see them on. 
 
Q: Okay. You know these mushroom lights we've been talking 
about on the ground? How high off the ground do they extend? Do

A: (No audible response.)

EXAMINATION BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Mr. Kaelin, you 
gave a recorded statement on June 14th, 1994 in Mr. Simpson's 
office with Bob Shapiro. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And at that time you talked about events that occurred less than 
hours previous to that, did you not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you have a copy of that statement. Correct? 
 
A: Yes, somewheres.  
 
Q: And you've read it over since June 14th, 1994, have you not? 
 
A: I haven't read it since -- probably during the trial, I read it. 
 
Q: And everything you said in that statement was true and correct. 
Is that true? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: And you testified before the Grand Jury in June of 1994, did 
you not? 
 
A: I did. 
 
Q: And everything you said to the Grand Jury was true and correct 
at that time, was it not? 
 
A: I think so. 
 
Q: And you testified at the preliminary hearing in July of 1994, did 
you not? 
 
A: I did. 
 
Q: And everything you said at the preliminary hearing was true and 
correct. Is that right? 
 
A: From what I know, yes. 
 
Q: And then you testified again at the trial in 1995.True? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And everything you said at the trial was true and correct. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you ever go back and look to see if any -- and compare 
any of the statements that you made at the trial. the preliminary 
hearing or the Grand Jury testimony or the statement of June l 4th, 
1994? 
 
A: Did I ever look back at that stuff? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever attempt to make a comparison of your testimony 
in any of those proceedings to any of the other proceedings? 
 
A: Well, I think at certain points I was in with lawyers. Like 
prepping, and that the testimony was out and we went over things. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, when you met with Mr. Petrocelli, do you want to 
tell us when that was? 
 
A: The dates were I think on last Tuesday -- I don't know the dates. 
Within a week. 
 
Q: All right. And you say "the dates." Did you meet with him on 
more than one day? 
 
A: Yes. Two days, two afteroons. 
 
Q: All right. And where did you meet? 
 
A: We met here and -- yeah. I think both times here. No, not both 
times here. One here, and I'm trying to think of the first time. 
 
Q: Are you telling me that you've met with him on two days last 
week, and you can't remember where it occurred? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It's argumentative. I object. 
 
MR. -- ROBERT BAKER: You can have a standing objection to 
everything. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: And sitting. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Perfect. 
 
THE WITNESS: I believe in Michael's office. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: That's your best recollection as you sit here today: That last 
week one day you met here and one day you met in Michael's 
office. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How long did you meet on the first day? Was that a Tuesday, 
you say? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You sure it was a Tuesday? 
 
A: I don't know the exact date, no. 
 
Q: Well, we're only nine days away. Was it Wednesday? 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: Do you want the dates, or do you want his 
recollection? 
 
MR. ROBERT E3AKER: No, I want to examine the witness, if I 
may. 
 
THE WITNESS: I believe it was Friday. BY MR. ROBERT 
BAKER: Q: All right. 
 
A: And then on Tuesday. 
 
Q: Okay. So Tuesday, was that at the office we're presently in? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And Friday, that was at your attorney's office? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what time did you start the meeting on Tuesday? 
 
A: On Tuesday, about 2:00 o'clock. 
 
Q: And how long did the meeting go? 
 
A: I'd say till about 6:30, 7:00. 
 
Q: And who was present? 
 
A: Mr. Petrocelli, Michael Plotkin, myself. 
 
Q: And what did you discuss for those five hours? 
 
A: Going over my testimony from the previous trial. 
 
Q: And what testimony did you go over, Mr. Kaelin? 
 
A: Things that we're going over right now. 
 
Q: I mean, did you say you went over your previous trial 
testimony? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Petrocelli bring the transcript of the trial of your 
testimony? 
 
A: There was testimony from -- they had the court documents of 
the trial, transcripts. 
 
Q: Was it only of your testimony, Mr. Kaelin? 
 
A: That we went over? I believe so, yes.  
 
Q: Did he have transcripts of other witnesses besides you when he 
met with you last Tuesday at this office? 
 
A: We went over mine, but there was a book of it, but we didn't go 
over the other -- what other people had said. 
 
Q: And did you review with Mr. Petrocelli the testimony that you 
had given at the trial? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you review all of the testimony that you had given at 
the trial 
 
A: Not everything. 
 
Q: Did you review the transcript. including the three or four days 
that you testified? Did you see every day that you had testified? 
 
A: I had that myself. 
 
Q: All right. And he brought it along as well? 
 
A: Well, no. I was gonna go through it on my own, and I didn't go 
through all of it. I just went through as much as I wanted. and I got 
that from Michael Plotkin. 
 
Q: And did Mr. Petrocelli do this last Tuesday? Did he tell you that 
he was doing this to prepare you for your deposition this week?  
 
A: Well, it kinda went through Michael, the call, and I agreed to 
meet. 
 
Q: It was your understanding, was it not, Mr. Kaelin, that you were 
doing this so you could prepare yourself to be examined by Mr. 
Petrocelli this week. Correct? 
 
A: To go through questions. 
 
Q: Yeah, and being prepared to be examined by Mr. Petrocelli this 
week. True? 
 
A: I guess it was just going over some of the questions, but it 
wasn't -- it was topics of what would be questioned. It wasn't 
specific questions. It was certain things that I should go over. 
 
Q: And what were those topics, Mr. Kaelin? 
 
A: Things we went over already today. 
 
Q: Well just enumerate for me all the topics that you went over on 
the first day for five hours. 
 
A: We went over background history. 
 
Q: What do you mean by that? 
 
A: Background of myself, O.J.. . Nicole. 
 
Q: How long did that take? 
 
A: Two hours. I mean, it wasn't -- there was a lot of other kind of 
talk going on, too. 
 
Q: What do you mean. "a lot of other kind of talk going on"? 
 
A: I was in Michael's office. He was taking calls, so there would 
be, you know, quiet -- I mean times when he would talk about 
sports or something, and it wasn't all just trial. 
 
Q: Okay. And so the background history took a couple of hours. Is 
that correct? 
 
A: Yeah, I think so. 
 
Q: Okay. What was the next topic you talked about? 
 
A: June 11th and 12th. 
 
Q: Did anybody have a tape recorder on when this was going on? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is there a reason they didn't? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Calls for speculation. How is he supposed to 
know? 
 
THE Witness: I don't know. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: You've made your objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: I didn't ask for one, I guess. I don't know. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: Was anybody taking notes during this period of time? For 
example, was Mr. Petrocelli taking notes? 
 
A: I think so. 
 
Q: Did he ever make available to you the notes that he was taking 
that day? 
 
A: If I -- I never asked for notes. 
 
Q: So he never volunteered to give you his notes? 
 
A: No. I never asked for notes. 
 
Q: Now, did Mr. Petrocelli ever suggest to you any answers to any 
questions? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he ask you, as he has for the last day and a half, leading 
questions that suggest the answers -- MR. BREWER: Objection. 
Argumentative. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: -- in that five hour seance you had on --  
 
A: I think it was --  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Hold on. You are talking over each other. 
 
I am also going to object to the kind of snide voice that you're 
using in asking these questions. It's argumentative. 
 
MR. KELLY: I don't think the witness testified they had a seance, 
Mr. Baker unless I missed something. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I wanted to give you a sound bite, John 
Q. 
 
MR. KELLY: I'll be sure to use it and attribute it to you, Mr. 
Baker. 
 
MR. BREWER: Bombshell. 
 
MR. KELLY: It will be a bombshell. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay, let's get back to business, Mr. Baker. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: Did Mr. PETROCELLI make any offer to give you the notes 
that he had taken in the five hours that you were in his office last 
week? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Assumes -- lack of foundation. Assumes 
there are such notes. 
 
THE Witness: Neither. I wasn't given notes, nor did I ask for notes. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: Did Mr. Plotkin take any notes. that you're aware of? 
 
A: I think he might have taken a few notes. 
 
Q: Now, did Mr. Petrocelli pay you for the five hours of your time 
that he took last week? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ask to be paid for it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he indicate to you that you would be reimbursed for your 
time in any way, shape or form for the five hours of last week on 
Tuesday? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, how many hours did it take to go over the June 11th and 
June 12th time periods? 
 
A: I think that was the concentration of most of that -- of the hours, 
of the remaining hours. 
 
Q: Okay. So as I understand it -- you correct me if I'm wrong -- 
that you started about 2:00 o'clock and you finished around 7:00 
o'clock. Is that correct? 
 
A: 6:30 --  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He said 6:30 or 7:00 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: And the first two hours were on background history, and the 
rest of the time was on the 11th and 12th. Is that right? 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: I beg your pardon. I believe that he said he started 
at 2:00 and finished at 7:00 on Tuesday of this week. I don't think 
that related to the Friday. If you want to ask him when the Friday 
meeting started --  
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well. maybe I've been mistaken. 
 
Q: You had a meeting this Tuesday as contrasted to a week ago last 
Tuesday? 
 
A: Two meetings: Tuesday and then a Friday. 
 
Q: And the Tuesday was this week' 
 
A: This Tuesday. 
 
Q: Okay. And that's the one that started at 2:00 and ended at 6:30 
or 7:00? 
 
A: Tuesday's. yes. Q: And the Friday meeting was at Mr. Plotkin's 
office. Is that correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What time did that meeting start? 
 
A: I think it started about 12:30 or 1:00 and ended -- no? It was 
like a three-hour meeting. 
 
Q: 12:30 or 1:00 p.m. on last Friday? 
 
A: Can I check also? 
 
Q: I just want your best recollection as you sit here now. 
 
A: I remember it being about a three hour meeting, three-and-a-
half-hour meeting. 
 
Q: Do you remember about when you got out? 
 
A: I know about 6:00 Mr. Petrocelli left, but I hung out with 
Michael afterward. But when I hang out with Michael, it's not -- it's 
just hanging out with Michael. We're friends also, so it's not just 
talking about the... 
 
Q: Okay. So you left Mr. Plotkin's office around 6:00 Friday last. 
Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And what time did Mr. Petrocelli leave? 
 
A: On Friday? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: I think it was about 6:00. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, what did you talk about -- Strike that. Who was 
present on Friday? 
 
A: Mr. Petrocelli, Mr. Plotkin and myself. 
 
Q: Had you ever met Mr. Petrocelli before last Friday? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Had you seen him on television? 
 
A: I saw him, yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No one has ever asked that question before. 
Mr. 8aker. 
 
MR. BREWER: That's an honor. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Now, on Friday when you had the 
initial meeting with Mr. Petrocelli. had you then scheduled the 
Tuesday meeting with Mr. Petrocelli? 
 
A: I don't think it was scheduled yet. I -- there was gonna be 
another time to meet. 
 
Q: And when was that other time to meet? 
 
A: Tuesday. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: I don't know when it took place. l might have found out on 
Monday if it was okay to meet on Tuesday, through Michael, and I 
said, "Yeah, that's fine." 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: Can I, just to clarify times? I don't know --  
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I'm not interested in your clarifying 
times, to be honest with you. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: I am not much concerned in whether you're 
interested or not. I am going to give you the information whether 
you want it or you don't. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, if you want to coach the witness, 
Mr. Plotkin, you can coach the witness. You've seen fit to have 
your client have at least, as I figure it, about 10 to 10 and a half 
hours of meeting. If you now want to refresh his recollection, do so 
at your peril, because I think I am entitled to get his testimony, and 
I don't give a damn about yours. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: That seems to me that we share something: 
Neither of us give a damn about the other. 
 
ROBERT BAKER: Okay, fair enough. But if you --  
 
MR. PLOTKIN: But the fact is that the meeting --  
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I don't want to hear you. If you have an 
objection place it on the record, but don't testify in this proceeding, 
Mr. Plotkin . You are not a witness. You are not sworn. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: I'd be happy to be sworn, sir. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: If you want, I will take your deposition, 
but right now I would like to take Mr. Kaelin's. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: By the way, Mr. Baker, your addition of 
hours was incorrect. I think he said about eight hours, give or take. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: Now, Mr. Kaelin, is it your testimony on Monday of this week 
that you did not know. that is, the 12th, when the second meeting 
was being scheduled with yourself and Mr. Petrocelli? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Assumes there was going to be another 
meeting, and I object on that ground. 
 
THE WITNESS: Can you repeat the question? 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: Sure. Is it your testimony that on Monday, February 12, 1996, 
you did not know when the second meeting was going to be 
scheduled between yourself, Mr. Plotkin and Mr. Petrocelli? 
 
A: I believe I found out that Monday it was gonna happen on 
Tuesday for sure. 
 
Q: All right. And you knew on Friday when you left Mr. Plotkin's 
office that there was going to be another meeting between yourself 
and Mr. Petrocelli and Mr. Plotkin. Right? 
 
A: If -- if by the time -- there was going to be time to do it. It 
wasn't a for sure. 
 
Q: And tell us the subjects that you went over on Friday. 
 
A: I think it was also June llth,12th, those days. It was going over 
some of the trial transcripts of the testimony, and they asked me 
questions about it. 
 
Q: Who is the "they"? 
 
A: Mr. Petrocelli asked me. 
 
Q: -- Now. you stated, you say, about 12:30 or 1:00 O'clock and 
that would have been on the 9th of February, 1996, the Friday 
meeting. Correct? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: And you say that Mr. Petrocelli left about 6:00 p.m. in the 
evening. Is that right? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI Mr. Baker -- THE WITNESS: You know, I 
want to go over that --  
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Just let me ask the question. If you've got 
an objection, object. 
 
THE WITNESS: You know what? I do. It was nighttime. It was 
not in the afternoon on Friday. And whether it was. . . But it was at 
about, I believe, the 5:30 hour or so that it started, not at the noon 
hour. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: So it's your recollection as you sit here now that six days ago it 
was either at 5:30 in the afternoon this meeting started or at 12:30 
in the afternoon the meeting started. Right? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: Okay. So it was one of those two times. True? 
 
A: I think so. 
 
Q: Now, in any event, how long did you talk about June 11th and 
12th or February 9th,1996? 
 
A: Hour. 
 
Q: And what else did you talk about on the 9th? 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: Search for the truth. 
 
THE WITNESS: Do you know what day I was there? If you do, 
tell me. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He does. He does indeed. 
 
THE WITNESS: I remember talking with Mr. Petrocelli last week, 
and I didn't write down the date. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: I know the day that I was to show up, I showed up, and I 
answered him honest and told -- answered the questions. 
 
Q: Fair enough. Now, after the one hour that you talked about the 
11th and 12th, what else did you talk about last Friday, February 
9th,1996? 
 
A: Okay. We talked about the 911 call. 
 
Q: How long did that take. approximately? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: If you recall. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't recall. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: You don't recall --  
 
A: I don't recall the length of time on that. We didn't go from -- we 
went to a different subject. It wasn't a set like, "Here, we'll take 
that, this 911 call, and then we'll go..." I just -- did a lot of the 
talking. 
 
Q: All right. The 911 call you're talking about is February 25.1993. 
True? 
 
A: Say the date again. 
 
Q: I'm sorry. I said it wrong. apologize . It's October 25. 1993, was 
the date. 
 
Q: I believe so. yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And do you have an estimate whether you talked about 
that for 5 minutes or 55 minutes or any time in between? 
 
A: Time in between. 
 
Q: Okay, 30 minutes? 
 
A: Sure. Q: Okay. And --  
 
A: The day that we met, though. there was a Laker game that was 
going on that Mr. Petrocelli missed, and I don't know the date. 
 
Q: God. I'm so sorry. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: So was I. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: Now. what else did you talk -- what other topics did you talk 
about, Mr. Kaelin? 
 
A: I think that's it. It was all those events that were -- we talked 
about somewhat today. 
 
Q: Did you talk about any history that you had with -- while you 
were living at Gretna Green? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was that on the Friday, the 9th? 
 
A: believe so. 
 
Q: All right. And do you remember how long that took? 
 
A: Two hours. 
 
Q: And did you talk about any of the events that occurred with the 
police subsequent to June 12, 1994 that involved you, on that 
Friday, February 9th? 
 
A: The June 11 the date, talking about events that --  
 
Q: Let me reask the question. On February 19th when you were 
discussing with Mr. Petrocelli the events and circumstances around 
the death of Nicole, did you discuss what you had experienced 
with the police on June 12th, June 13th and thereafter? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: And how long did that take? 
 
A: An hour. 
 
Q: Did you discuss with Mr. Petrocelli on February 9th,1996 
approximately how long -- Strike that. Did you discuss with Mr. 
Petrocelli on February 9. 1996 the conversations that you've 
described here with Cora Fishman that you've testified occurred 
subsequent to the murder of Nicole? 
 
A: We didn't really discuss that. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you discuss that in the Tuesday meeting that lasted 
approximately five hours? 
 
A: Maybe touched on it. 
 
Q: So did you have, what, 8 to 10 hours of conversations with Mr. 
Petrocelli within the last six days before you became a sworn 
witness for your civil deposition? 
 
A: I would say between seven and eight. 
 
Q: Now, on the Friday, February 9th, 1996 meeting, was Mr. 
Petrocelli taking notes? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: Was Mr. Plotkin taking notes? 
 
A: On one of the days, probably both those days, yes. 
 
Q: And you were not compensated for the seven hours of time that 
you gave to Mr. Petrocelli. Is that correct? 
 
A: I was not. 
 
Q: By the way, what do you do for a living presently? 
 
A: Presently I'm still at the KLSX radio station. 
 
Q: And what are your present hours of -- what do you work? 
 
A: I was there 2:00 to 4:00, and I'm doing a show, and now I'm 
there working on a show of interviews, presently still in working 
with Robert Moore 
 
Q: How many hours a week do you presently work? 
 
A: Well, I'm always writing things down with the ideas and -- 
 
Q: Well, can you give me an estimate as to how many hours a 
week you work? 
 
A: Well, on that I work probably two hours a day on the ideas, so 
10 hours. 
 
Q: 10 hours a week? 
 
A: Yeah. on that, on the radio, and probably an hour on the -- 
writing a CD-ROM. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, in terms of the book that was produced by Marc 
Eliot, you got a royalty off that, didn't you? 
 
A: Nothing. 
 
Q: You had a contract that called for you to get a royalty, did you 
not? 
 
A: I did not. 
 
Q: You never signed a contract with Marc Eliot? 
 
A: No. There was some collaboration worked out that was never 
signed. It was verbal. 
 
Q: And it's your testimony that you got absolutely nothing for the 
book that was published. Correct? 
 
A: Nothing. 
 
Q: All right. And did you ever subsequent to the murders of Nicole 
Simpson and Ron Goldman try to market your story? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What do you mean by "story"? You mean his 
knowledge of the events and circumstances and of the Simpsons? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yeah, I'll adopt that. That's fine. 
 
THE WITNESS: Did I market --  
 
MR. PLOTKIN: What do you mean by "market"? 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: Did you go out and tell somebody that "I'm trying to sell my 
story"? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever go to NBC and try to sell your story? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Never occurred? 
 
A: To sell my story for money? 
 
Q: For money, yeah, sure. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Since the murders, have you followed in the media the 
coverage of the events of June 12th .1994? 
 
A: Yes, I've seen some of it. I had cable, but I took the cable out, 
so I had local reception. It was shaky. but I saw events, yes. 
 
Q: And have you read any books: for example, Faye Resnick's 
book? 
 
A: Did not read the book. I saw a buddy pointing out the Kato 
thing that she had written, but I didn't read her book. 
 
Q: Was the Kato thing that she had written to your knowledge true 
and correct? 
 
A: I'd have to refresh my memory: it was a long time ago. but I 
don't believe it was. 
 
Q: We will get back to that tomorrow. 
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: Relative to your -- what's in the tapes and in Mr. Marc Eliot's 
book, have you read that? 
 
A: I haven't. 
 
Q: Did you ever review the transcripts of the interviews you gave 
to Marc Eliot? 
 
A: No, just here at this deposition. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you review those at all with Mr. Petrocelli on the 
13th or the 9th of February, 1996? 
 
A: Not the tapes. There was some of the printed words. 
 
Q: Written transcripts of the --  
 
A: Written transcripts of the tapes. 
 
Q: And did you review those? 
 
A: I went over some of it. 
 
Q: And what particulars did you go over? 
 
A: With the fights that O.J. and Nicole had and things that were 
said that dealt with Cora Fishman, the Cabo trip, and what we went 
over today. 
 
Q: Let me ask you: When you say "the fights," you were asked 
about fights or arguments on June l4th, 1994 when you were 
interviewed by Mr. Shapiro. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you then told Mr. Shapiro all of the arguments that you had 
witnessed. Isn't that true? 
 
A: Yeah. At that time I was very nervous. I had never been in a 
courtroom: I had never been in any kind of proceeding, and so I 
was nervous, and I didn't know exactly if I had that one shot. 
Maybe it was one of those things where you're put on the spot, and 
you go back home and you go, "Hey, wait a minute. There was 
another thing that happened," and that's what my problem was. I 
couldn't think so much on the spot. 
 
When you asked me about the dates about the meetings, I have to 
like take a minute and go, "Okay, now I remember when it was." 
So that's the way I am, and it -- like tonight I'll go, "Oh, God, the 
meeting was then." So that's the whole problem, the thinking that I 
would think and go, "Wait a minute, there was another fight," 
because I remember saying in that meeting, "I don't remember that 
Bruce Jenner thing," and I went, "Wait, there was that thing that 
happened. " 
 
And like if someone says, "Well, don 't you remember that 
happening?" 
 
And I go, "Well, yeah," and then I get into detail about what 
happened. And so it's a cue word this sets me off. and I go with 
what I remember. 
 
Q: Okay. Well, let's use a cue word as the Cabo trip. Are we 
talking about May of 1994? Is that when the Cabo trip was? 
 
A: I believe, yes. Q: And so it's your recollection that Mr. Simpson 
and Nicole Brown Simpson were in Cabo San Lucas in May of 
1994. Correct? 
 
A: Of what I've heard from Cora, correct. 
 
Q: Well, you lived at the house in May of 1994, and you were 
around Mr. Simpson. Do you have a recollection that it occurred or 
it didn't occur? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It misstates his testimony, that he was 
"around." 
 
THE WITNESS: I didn't ask O.J. everywhere he was going. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: Okay. But that's what your understanding was, was that Miss 
Simpson and Mr. Simpson were in Cabo San Lucas May of 1994. 
Right? 
 
A: Correct . 
 
Q: And that's when Cora told you that Nicole Brown Simpson 
broke off with Mr. Simpson. Correct? 
 
A: Yes 
 
Q: There is another thing I want to clear up and then start back. 
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: On the night of June 12th, 1994 after you're back from the 
infamous burger trip and you say you saw Mr. Simpson, but you 
can't remember whether it was your first trip past the garage or 
your second trip. True? 
 
A: Okay. So the -- after the McDonald's trip --  
 
Q: Right. And you say you heard these noises. 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Right? You came out of your bungalow, you went around by 
the patio and around onto the driveway, past the entrance and past 
the garage. Correct? 
 
A: Yes 
 
Q: All right. Then you say on the first or second trip, that is, the 
first or second inspection trip of yours, you saw O.J. Simpson 
move from an area by the grass, across the driveway, towards the 
entrance. Correct? 
 
A: Well. l didn't know --  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The squiggly line on 84. 
 
THE WITNESS: Where I pointed the line, it was in that motion of 
the grass. It was over here (Indicating), but that's where I draw the 
squiggly. And it was on the driveway. and I just remember a dark 
outfit, and I don't know exactly first or second trip, but I remember 
that dark outfit. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: Okay. Is it your recollection that that's the same outfit that Mr. 
Simpson was in when you saw him enter the limousine? 
 
A: That's what I remember all day him wearing from the 
McDonald's trip on. 
 
Q: So he had never changed clothes from the McDonald's trip to 
the time that you saw him enter the limousine. Correct? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I just don't remember any -- I just remember that 
outfit in my head 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: Okay. Now, you were in the Bentley when you were going to 
McDonald's. You were sitting in the right front passenger seat. 
Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And there is a center console in that vehicle, is there not? 
 
A: I believe so. I --  
 
Q: And there is -- is there a little area for a cell phone in the 
Bentley? Do you have any recollection? 
 
A: That was my first drive in it. It was dark, so I don't know. There 
could be . 
 
Q: All right. And in any event. Mr. Simpson's shoulder -- from 
your left shoulder to Mr. Simpson's right shoulder would be 15, 18 
inches. Correct? 
 
A: Sitting in a car. yeah. 
 
Q: And your recollection is he had this dark sweat suit on, black 
probably, with a white zipper on it at that time. Correct? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: And your recollection is that when you saw Mr. Simpson and 
from the exhibit that we have now labeled 84 and you draw the 
squiggly line, as it's been called, he was in exactly the same outfit. 
Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And your recollection is that when he was exiting the entrance 
on Rockingham and going from the entrance, the front entrance to 
the limo, he was in exactly the same outfit. Correct? 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: You mean the entrance to the house? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yeah. 
 
Q: The entrance from the front entrance of the house into the limo 
to leave, he was in the same outfit. Right? 
 
A: That's what I -- I remember this, the dark outfit. 
 
Q: Sure. And I take it that your recollection is that it was -- in your 
mind's eye you can recall this white zipper that went down the 
front of that outfit. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And you have a recollection of that when O.J. exited the 
front door and went towards the limo. True? 
 
A: I have more of the image in the driveway, but I remember the 
outfit. 
 
Q -- All right. Now. as I understand your testimony, that you have 
looked at part of the transcripts from the interviews you gave to 
Marc Eliot, you have looked at least part of the transcripts of the 
trial that you gave -- trial testimony you gave in 1995, you have 
looked at part of your Grand Jury testimony, part of your 
preliminary hearing testimony, and reviewed the statement that you 
gave to Mr. Shapiro on June l4th, 1994 in preparation for your 
deposition here the last couple of days. Is that true? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Now, what else, if anything, did you do to prepare yourself to 
testify here in these last two days? 
 
A: Psyched up, got ready for it. 
 
Q: All right. Did Mr. Petrocelli indicate to you how long the 
deposition was going to last when he had you over here and was in 
Mr. Plotkin's office? 
 
A: I believe I just said what the times were. I thought it was -- the 
understanding was 9:00 to 5:00. 
 
Q: Did he tell you how many days it was going to last? 
 
A: No. I didn't know. I think we took a thing like, -- "How long is 
it going to last?"  
 
"Three days, "I said, "Three days?" 
 
So he said, "Probably three days." 
 
Q: Okay. Did you have any -- did you go out of the office at all 
with Mr. Petrocelli while you were here at this office and have a 
Coke or anything? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you do that at Mr. Plotkin's office? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: I take it that after seven, eight hours, you got to be pretty 
friendly with Mr. Petrocelli. True? 
 
A: I think so. My demeanor is friendly  
 
MR. PLOTKIN: Excuse me. Is your question whether they went 
out socially or whether he was out of this office with Mr. 
Petrocelli? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I meant out of this office. 
 
THE WITNESS: I mean, I don't know. 
 
Not hanging out, but I was there to answer questions, and, you 
know, I was there any time --  
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: you were trying to be helpful. Right? Is that true? 
 
A: Sure. 
 
Q: Okay. And you. of course, knew from your previous .seeing Mr. 
Petrocelli on television that he was representing Mr. Goldman. 
Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you knew, of course, that from seeing Mr. Petrocelli on 
television, that he was suing O.J. Simpson for every bit of money 
that Mr. Simpson could ever have for the purported wrongful 
deaths of Ron Goldman -- MR. PETROCELLI: I am not suing 
him. My client is. 
 
THE WITNESS: I didn't know what -- how much money it was, 
but I know there was a lawsuit over moneys. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: Okay. And you wanted to be helpful for Mr. Petrocelli in the 
two meetings that you had last week and this week. Correct? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: Okay. And if you hadn't wanted to be helpful, you wouldn't 
have sat down there for seven, ten hours and answered questions. 
Isn't that true? 
 
A: True. I was open. 
 
Q: All right. Now, as I understand it, you met Nicole in Aspen in 
December of 1992.Is that correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you then moved into the house in Gretna Green in January 
of 1993. True? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, when you moved in, had you seen her more than at 
Aspen, I mean been physically in her presence, and I am 
discounting the phone calls that you testified to? 
 
A: Was I more in her contact when I lived there? 
 
Q: No. Poor question. I'll be happy to rephrase it. 
 
Between the time that you met her in Aspen, Colorado, and the 
time you moved into Gretna Green, other than the phone calls, had 
you -- when you had talked about moving into her back house. had 
you communicated with her? 
 
A: I think, yeah, there was a call, and I think maybe once we had 
seen each other. 
 
Q: At a nightclub? 
 
A: It could have been. I think it was with Grant. I don't know if it 
was a nightclub, but it might have been a restaurant. It might have 
been. 
 
Q: Now, how many days did you spend -- I know you weren't with 
her all the time, but did you see Nicole in Aspen, Colorado? 
 
A: Probably four days. 
 
Q: And then after that you had one meeting and two phone calls 
and then moved into her back house. True? 
 
A: The calls came to Cramer's house. and I'd be there a lot of the 
time. so I would be on the phone also, you know, saying hi and all 
that. So there was quite a few calls to him that I was usually there 
for and said hi and all that. 
 
Q: Okay. Said hello, but so I'm clear, four days you were in Aspen. 
You saw her every day of those four days with Cramer. Correct? 
 
A: Yeah. You know, on the ski slopes. If he wasn't there, I still 
would see her and then hook up somewhere, too. 
 
Q: And then you were back over the Christmas holidays? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then you contacted her in January of 1993 relative to 
moving in. True? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: And wanted to confirm that this was not just cocktail talk, that 
this was for real. True? 
 
A: Oh, for the move-in? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Oh, at the party at her house. Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you contacted her again after that. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, then when did you decide, if ever, what your rent 
was going to be? Or what did she decide your rent was going to 
be? 
 
A: She said if I'd be willing to take care of the kids, to do a 
deduction. and then she just came up with 500. Q: And sometimes 
you paid 500 and sometimes you didn't. Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Sometimes you didn't pay anything. 
 
A: No . The first month it was like she didn't make me pay, and 
then I paid. 
 
Q: Well, every month after, which would be February through 
December of 1993. did you pay $500? 
 
A: It wasn't 500.500 like a few times, and then 450. It was always 
decided on how much I would see Sidney and Justin, and she 
would tell me. She was never really forceful with the rent situation. 
 
Q: So would it vary between $450 and $500 in those -- 
 
A: 4 to 5 -- I'd say. 
 
Q: Okay. And how did you pay her. check or cash? 
 
A: I think once I might have paid her cash when Cramer and I were 
doing that casting sessions and we had like large amounts of cash. 
Otherwise, check. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, when you talk about these tea conversations that 
you have related to us, did you talk to Mr. Petrocelli about the tea 
conversations in the seven to ten hours of meetings you had with 
him in the last seven days? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And those tea conversations, I take it, didn't start immediately 
in January of 1993, did they? 
 
A: Oh. boy. It could have towards the end. I mean, I was -- she 
took a liking right away, I mean. as far as what kind of guy I was. 
So I think there were a lot of conversations she would tell me 
things. I don't know. I can't say it was like tea talks. It could be at 
any moment. Like the kids just started coming by the room 
immediately when they found out who Kato was, and so she'd be 
out there in the daytime, it could be, or nighttime. But there was 
conversations. 
 
Q: Is it your best recollection that Nicole Brown Simpson started 
telling you the intimate details of her personal life as early as the 
end of January, 1993? 
 
A: Maybe February. 
 
Q: All right. So by February of 1993, she was -- had she indicated 
to you that she wanted to get back with O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: Yeah, I think there were times when she would tell me things 
about getting back. Like I said, I don't know exact dates, but she 
talked about the marriage. She used to always show me her photo 
albums, I mean constantly always had photos and showed me like 
the wedding pictures and trips they took. So I imagine from seeing 
that stuff that she still loved him. But I can't give you dates exactly. 
It's too confusing. 
 
Q: Welt, let's see if we can put it in parameters. By May of 1993 
you were aware that they, that being O.J. and Nicole, had agreed to 
try a reconciliation. Correct? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: So -- and she started chatting with you about personal details of 
her Life. Let's see if we can concentrate between February of 1993 
and May of 1993. Okay? 
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: Now, during that period of time did Nicole suggest to you that 
she wanted to get back to having a marriage with O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: Yes, it came up. 
 
Q: And she told you that she wanted to remarry O.J. Simpson, 
didn't she? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: And she told you she was in love with O.J. Simpson, didn't she? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And she told you that some of the best times she'd ever had in 
her life was in the company of Mr. O.J. Simpson. Isn't that correct? 
 
A: Yeah. That's when the photo albums would come out. That's her 
thing, when she would show me that stuff. 
 
Q: And she told you that he was a charming, gracious guy, didn't 
she? 
 
A: At times. yes, she did. 
 
Q: And she at that time indicated to you that she was having this 
affair with Marcus Allen. Is that correct? 
 
A: Well, it was a time where she had told me that Marcus started 
taking a real liking to her, and she didn't really like Marcus. So she 
had got -- told me that he kept coming by, and she goes, "I just 
don't like Marcus that way. I like Marcus as a friend." 
 
And then she would tell me that she had stuff in common, that 
Marcus has been such a good friend that she didn't think it would 
be good to be like a lover. And then she would say that "He's really 
a great guy, and we like the same music, and Marcus was 
religious," and she was telling me all these like good things, but 
she wasn't in love with him. And so that's the parts that I knew, and 
I didn't know what kind of went after. 
 
Q: All right. As I understand your testimony, Mr. Kaelin, you were 
reasonably certain that after May of 1993 until May of 1994 Nicole 
was monogamous with O.J. Correct? 
 
A: That the marriage was monogamous. That she told me in our 
conversations that the whole time she was married to him, she 
never, ever cheated on O.J. during the marriage. 
 
Q: Let me go back, and I want to reask my question, or maybe I 
asked it poorly. 
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: Your understanding was in May of 1993, O.J. and Nicole got 
back together for an attempted reconciliation. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you've testified in this proceeding that between the time 
that Nicole agreed to get back and wanted to get back with O.J. for 
a reconciliation, that she was never untrue to O.J. Correct? Never 
cheated on him. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: I don't believe that was his testimony. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember that part. I don't know. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: I understand. But I mean it was your impression that subsequent 
to May of 1993 and certainly up to and including May of 1994, 
Nicole did not have any relations with men that you're aware of 
other than perhaps with O.J. Correct? 
 
A: Yeah, I thought that was the time they were going to try to 
make it work. It was one of those things where -- that I had 
mentioned one time they had a good relationship. It was a stormy 
relationship, but Nicole would say she was together with him since 
19 and it was like 17 years together, and although they still were 
friends, and they would go apart, and it was very stormy, and yet I 
said that was good because they're still in each other's life. And I 
thought it was kind of like that unconditional thing, that although 
she said that during the relationship that O.J. cheated, that she still 
took him back. It was kind of that stormy --  
 
MR. SIMPSON: Took him back? 
 
THE WITNESS: And that's how I said it was kind of a good 
unconditional, that it was still happening; they were getting 
together. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: I want to use a time frame here. 
and if in fact it was your impression that Nicole was not being 
untrue to O.J. following their reconciliation in May of 1993, at 
least up to May of 1994, the incidents when Marcus Allen would 
come over were before May of 1993. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, when -- between February of 1993 when you first started 
learning the personal intimate details of Nicole 's life and May of 
1993, when did Marcus Allen come over and park his car any place 
other than in the front of the house? 
 
A: There was a trip that O.J. and Nicole took I think to Cabo back 
then. That would get my memory if I knew the date, because it was 
before then that Marcus was coming over and seeing Nicole. I 
think they might have took the trip in April. 
 
So Marcus was maybe coming there in April. I don't know when 
they took the trip in -- to Cabo, and that was Like -- I think that's 
when Nicole told him that Marcus was seeing her. I don't know the 
exact thing, but I think Marcus was coming over in April. 
 
Q: All right. Let me go back a bit further. After you moved into the 
back house at Gretna Green, you were aware that O.J. didn't go 
into the house. He would pick up the kids from the front. Isn't that 
true? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And O.J. -- Strike that. And Nicole told you that O.J. had 
agreed not to come in the house, didn't she? 
 
A: I think so. 
 
Q: And before O.J. was even coming in the house, Nicole was 
telling you that she wanted to get back and remarry O.J. Simpson 
because the best years of her Life was when she was married to 
him. Isn't that right? 
 
A: There were times when she said she wanted to get back together 
with O.J., yes. 
 
Q: And she told you that she was making a concerted effort to get 
back in O.J.'s life between February and May of 1993. Isn't that 
true? 
 
A: Yes. she was trying to get back together at times. 
 
Q: And during that period of time she informed you that she had 
told O.J. about her relationship with Marcus Allen. Right? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: And it was in April of 1993 that she indicated to you that she 
told O.J. about this relationship. Isn't that correct? 
 
A: I think it was April, yes. 
 
Q: And at that time O.J. was coming around the Gretna Green 
house, was he not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And he was not jealous or angry or at all upset to your 
knowledge about anything she had done with Marcus Allen. Isn't 
that true? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Calls for speculation.  
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT LAKER: 
 
Q: And as a matter of fact, Mr. Kaelin O.J. -- Well, strike that. 
 
A: There was -- can I say something? There was a trip that was 
took, and she said the first two days of the trip were real tough, but 
they got better with O.J. I think that was after the Marcus situation. 
 
I don't -- that was -- it was like very tough. There was a fight and 
she almost came back, she said, but they stuck it out there, and I -- 
but I -- I think it was in April. That was the Cabo trip. 
 
Q: Now, Mr. Kaelin, as you sit here today and yesterday, you have 
heard a lot, you've read a lot about the surrounding events of the 
murders of Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman. True? 
 
A: True, 
 
Q: And can you tell us that the testimony that you gave all 
yesterday was clearly your recollection of events unaided by 
anything you've read or heard? 
 
A: I think some of the --  
 
MR. KELLY: Well, objection. I think he's already testified as to 
what he's reviewed and heard prior to his testimony. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I object to the question as to form. Lacks 
foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: The question again? 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: Sure. Can you tell us that the testimony that you gave yesterday 
and up to an hour ago or so when we took the break and they 
changed the tapes was all your testimony from your recollection 
unaided by anything you've read in the media, unaided by anything 
you've seen on the electronic media and simply your recollection 
of events? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am going to object, Mr. Baker. I think the 
question is fundamentally unfair because it literally requires him to 
canvas each and every piece of testimony that he gave over two 
days and make an association as to whether or not he read anything 
about it or heard anything about it, and I don t think it's possible 
for that question to be answered, and I object to it. It lacks 
foundation, it's overbroad, it's compound, it's vague and it's 
ambiguous. Those are my objections for the record. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: I just have a question 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Ripkin doesn't recognize any of them. Go 
ahead, ,Mr. Plotkin. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: If you will clarify the question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Does Ripkin wear a robe? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: He was too smart to do that. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: These days he's not wearing much of anything. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: We won't let the judge read that part, Mr. 
Baker. 
 
MR. KELLY: I might give it to him.. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah, RIVERA LIVE tonight. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Let Mr. Plotkin put what he wants on the 
record, please 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: Simply to understand the question, are you asking 
whether his reaction to what is now I guess 18 months of media 
and the like has tempered his -- or are you asking whether 
something he read in preparation for this deposition affected his... 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: Basically what I'm asking, Mr. Kaelin, is: What you have heard 
on the media, whether it be on the radio, on television, what you 
have read in the news media print, has that tempered your 
recollection and has altered your testimony from what you 
previously have given to the Grand Jury --  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Same objection. 
 
MR. BREWER: Same objections. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Okay. 
 
THE WITNESS: Should I go? 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: Go ahead. 
 
A: This is -- obviously I have seen some things on TV: I have seen 
things in print, but with my testimony maybe -- I don't know -- like 
the degree I can't give but, yeah, I've read certain things that it 
didn't taint what I said. but certain things did come up that I didn't 
know before from trial and. . . 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: Can I ask one favor? l assume when you whisper 
to Mr. Baker that you don't intend for me to hear what you're 
saying. 
 
MR. SIMPSON: Did you hear what I just said? 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: No, but I've heard a number of things that you 
have said. 
 
MR. SIMPSON: Well. you can hear. No secrets. I've got no 
secrets. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: I just think in fairness that you ought to be aware 
of it. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Thank you. 
 
Q: Now. you testified within the last hour and a half something to 
the effect, "I don't know because it's been so long ago and there's 
been so many news stories, that I'm confused " Do you recall your 
testimony in that regard when you were talking about your 
movements on June 12th, 1994? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, have you read anything about the background of Nicole 
and O.J. Simpson that has colored your testimony relative to the 
time period between February of 1993 and May of 1993, if you 
know? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Same objections. 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection to the form of the question. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know the answer. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: All right. Fair enough. 
 
Now. do you have a recollection of when you were talking to 
Nicole in this time frame between February and May of 1993. that 
she indicated to you that O.J. would be upset about Marcus Allen? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Tell me when that was. 
 
A: It was when Marcus was coming by, those trips before he was 
going to leave for camp, and she just said that O.J. would be so 
pissed if he knew Marcus was coming over. 
 
And I went, "Really?" Because I didn't know anything was really 
even going on and -- but he was parking on a different street. 
 
Q: And then you found out later that, of course, O.J. wasn't upset at 
all about Marcus when Nicole actually told him that she wanted his 
assistance to end Marcus coming over to the house. Isn't that right? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That misstates his testimony, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. BREWER: Also calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I just -- I think so, because I know he got married 
at her house -- at his house. I didn't know what the situation was 
with Marcus at all, what was actually going on. but I didn't -- I 
know that he got married at the house, so I thought everybody was 
--  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He is not asking you if he got married. Listen 
to the question. 
 
THE WITNESS: Oh, okay. I just know -- I didn't know -- there 
wasn't any -- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: How come you didn't do that when you 
were questioning? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I tried to, but you inter -- 
 
Listen to the question. That's why I did it Mr. Baker. He's running 
out of paper. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: Now, you indicated to Mr. Shapiro that O.J. was never upset 
about Nicole dating other men, did you not? 
 
A: At that time, yeah. I think O.J. knew Nicole was seeing other 
people. 
 
Q: He was never upset about that, was he? 
 
A: Not that I saw. 
 
Q: He never told you he was upset about Nicole dating anybody. 
Isn't that true? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Now, what point of time? 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: At any time that you were either a guest in Gretna Green or a 
guest in Rockingham. 
 
A: Well, there was a thing with the pushing of buttons that I 
mentioned that started happening at the Gretna Green -- Q: Well, 
maybe you didn't understand the question. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: Why don't you let him answer the question. 
 
MR. KELLY: Well Objection. I'd like to See if he can answer it 
before you decide if he didn't understand it, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: All right. 
 
THE WITNESS: There was --  
 
MR. PLOTKIN: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Let's make sure that you do 
understand the question, and then --  
 
THE WITNESS: I think what you're trying to say is, was there any 
-- was O.J., mad that Nicole was dating others. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
 
Q: No, that isn't what I asked at all. I asked you: Did O.J. ever tell 
you that he was upset that Nicole would date other men? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's the question. It's different from before, 
but that's the pending question. 
 
THE WITNESS: Not that I can remember. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Ed says it was different. I agree with him.  
 
Now, I think we're running out of paper, and why don't we --  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Call it. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: -- call it for today. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 9:30 tomorrow' 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Why don't we make it 10:00. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 10:00 o'clock tomorrow? 
 
You guys can get an early tee time before then, can't you? You can 
play nine. 
 
MR. SIMPSON: My normal game -- THE VIDEOGRAPHER:

<P>Under questioning from Robert Baker, an attorney for O.J. Simpson, Brian "Kato" Kaelin reveals his ambivalent attitude toward the Simpsons' marriage. "Are you telling us, Mr. Kaelin, what you wanted to occur was that Nicole Brown Simpson would be reunited with Mr. Simpson who had had a physical altercation with her and, further, that she thought that person was going to kill her with scissors? Is that what you wanted?" Baker asks.</P>
 
<P>"Yes," Kaelin says. This was the third day of Kaelin's deposition, taken Feb. 20, 1996 in Los Angeles.</P>

EXAMINATION: 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Good morning, Mr. Kaelin. 
 
A: Good morning. 
 
Q: You realize you are still under oath? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: All right. Between Thursday day and today, have you done 
anything in addition to prepare yourself for this deposition? 
 
A: I read a little book. 
 
Q: All right. And that's Marc Eliot's book? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Anything else that you have done? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you meet with anybody from the plaintiff's side? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you meet with Peter Gelblum? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you meet with Dan Petrocelli? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: All right. Michael Brewer? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. KELLY: John Kelly. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: John Q. Kelly? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, in terms of the conversations that you have related in this 
deposition that you had with Nicole, did those conversations 
continue after the reconciliation that she had with O.J. Simpson in 
May of 1993? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The question is vague as to what 
conversations. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Let me see if I can make it more specific. 
 
Q: The tea conversations, as we referred to them, where Nicole 
indicated to you some personal areas of her life, did they continue 
after she had began reconciliation with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: I had conversation with her all the way up until I moved. 
 
Q: So the conversations continued from January of '93 to January 
of 94. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And after the conversations that you had with Miss Simpson 
concerning her personal life-- 
 
(Telephone interruption.) 
 
Q: After the conversations that you had with Miss Simpson about 
her personal life, did you feel that you were a very close friend of 
hers in December of 1993? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then in January of 1994 you moved in with Mr. Simpson 
and your friendship ended as you had previously known it. Is that 
true? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Friendship with Nicole? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: With Nicole. I'm sorry. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: In terms of your relationship with 
Nicole, she had given you a place to live for approximately a year. 
Had she not with the reduced rental rate? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And she had brought you into her circle of friends so that you 
knew Cora Fishman, you knew Cici; you knew Faye Resnick. 
Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you then went to Mr. Simpson s house because you didn't 
have to pay any rent at all. True? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So it was a better deal and you forsook Miss Simpson for $500 
a month. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And you then after you had done that, you -- Well, strike 
that. 
 
Q: Did you have any social dates that you went out with Nicole 
Brown Simpson and Marcus Allen before January of 1994? 
 
A: Before January of 1994-- 
 
Q: Sure. 
 
A: --if I had gone out with-- 
 
Q: With Marcus Allen, Nicole, yourself and a date? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How many occasions? 
 
A: Once. 
 
Q: And approximately when was that? 
 
A: I don't know the exact date, but I remember the event. 
 
Q: All right. In terms of the calendar year if '93, do you have any 
recollection if it was in the spring, the summer or the fall? 
 
A: I believe it was the spring. 
 
Q: All right. It was before the reconciliation with Mr. Simpson and 
Nicole? 
 
A: I don't know when the reconciliation was, but the event was I 
think in spring, with the date. 
 
Q: Is it your testimony now that you do not know when Mr. 
Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson tried to get back together? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The question is argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know the exact date. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Well, do you know approximately 
when it was? 
 
A: Somewhere in '94 -- in '93 when the reconciliation -- 
 
Q: Do you know whether it was the spring, the summer, the fall, 
the winter? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, as you sit here today. can you state with certainty 
that the testimony you gave last Wednesday and Thursday was 
untainted by what you read and heard in this case in the media? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am going to object to the question on the 
ground that it lacks foundation; it's vague; it's compound; it's 
overbroad. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: You can answer. 
 
A: Say the question again. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: David, would you read it back. please. 
(Pending question read as follows: 
 
Q: Okay. Now, as you sit here today, can you state with certainty 
that the testimony you gave last Wednesday and Thursday was 
untainted by what you read and heard in this case in the media? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Same objections. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes, some of it -- some -- some news stories I did 
hear. My testimony was the truth but there are news stories that I 
did see on TV. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Well, maybe my question is 
unclear. What you have testified to last Thursday, as I understand 
it, was your recollection about events as they occurred in 1993 and 
1994. Is that true? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what I am asking you is: Can you tell us with certainty that 
the testimony you gave on Wednesday and Thursday last is 
untainted by what you read and heard in the media in this case 
subsequent to the events that you've been testifying to? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Same objections. Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Sure. 
 
THE WITNESS: I can't be a hundred percent certain. no. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Do you have any estimate, if you 
can, as to what testimony you were giving is untainted by what you 
read and heard in the media and what is your recollection? 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection-- 
 
THE WITNESS: I can't give a percentage. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: All right. Thank you. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Same objections as previously made. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Now, relative to Nicole's 
conversations with you in 1993, you, as I understand it, wanted 
Nicole and O.J. to get back together. Is that correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And during that period of time she had talked to you about an 
event that occurred on January 1st, 1989 where there was a claim 
that O.J. had hit her. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then she had also indicated to you that she believed that 
she thought O.J. would one day kill her with scissors. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now. did you ever indicate to the Grand Jury or to the lawyers 
questioning you in the preliminary hearing anything about the 
conversations with Nicole relative to this thought that she had-- 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection-- 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: -- concerning O.J.'s going to kill 
her with scissors? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Lacks foundation. Assumes he 
was asked these questions, among other things. 
 
MR. BREWER: Are you talking about with respect to the actual 
proceedings themselves also? 
 
MR. KELLY: And it would be irrelevant and inadmissible if 
asked. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: Can I ask that the question be read back? 
 
(Pending question read as follows: 
 
"Q: Now, did you ever indicate to the Grand Jury or to the lawyers 
questioning you in the preliminary hearing anything about the 
conversations with Nicole relative to this thought that she had 
concerning OJ.'s going to kill her with scissors? ") 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: Answer the question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Same objections. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, I don't believe I was asked that. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Was the first time that you ever 
relayed that to anybody when you were giving your interview to 
Marc Eliot? 
 
A: I think so. 
 
Q: You never mentioned it to O.J. Simpson before you had 
mentioned it to Marc Eliot. Isn't that true? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, are you telling us Mr. Kaelin, that what you wanted 
Nicole to do, who was a friend of yours, was to go back to O.J. 
Simpson who you say had had a physical altercation with you and 
who she thought was going to kill her? Is that what you wanted her 
to do? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. There is no testimony about a 
physical altercation between Mr. Simpson and Mr. Kaelin. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I am sorry. I misspoke. Mr. Simpson and 
Nicole. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You want to rephrase your question? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Sure. 
 
Q: Are you telling us, Mr. Kaelin, what you wanted to occur was 
that Nicole Brown Simpson would be reunited with Mr. Simpson 
who had had a physical altercation with her and, further, that she 
thought that person was going to kill her with scissors? Is that what 
you wanted? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Okay. Now. and that thought of 
yours that is, the reuniting of Nicole Brown Simpson and O.J. 
Simpson, was constant from 1993 January of l993 to December of 
1993. Correct? 
 
A: Repeat that again. 
 
Q: You had the same thought, that is, of reuniting Nicole with O.J., 
from January of '93 to and including December of '93. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: All right. Now. I want to -- Did that thought remain your desire 
during and after the event of October 25, 1993? 
 
A: That was the first time I was scared. 
 
Q: All right. Now, I take it that you had never been scared in the 
presence of Mr. Simpson before October 25,1993? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And Mr. Simpson didn't strike anyone on October 25,1993, did 
he? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: He didn't threaten anyone with physical harm on October 
25,1993, did he? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And did you ever testify--Strike that. You testified here on 
Thursday that the door was not broken before the incident of 
October 25, 1993, did you not? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Misstates his testimony. You 
objected to my question about to the extent the door had been 
previously broken. 
 
THE Witness: The door had been broken. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Was the door at all broken at the 
time -- Well, strike that one, too. Was the door broken before 
October 25, 1993? 
 
A: I believe it had been fixed and rebroken on the 25th. 
 
Q: So is it your testimony that the door was not broken at the time 
the incident occurred on October 25, 1993? 
 
A: It was not broken. 
 
Q: And did you ever listen to the tape and what we have called the 
surreptitious tape of the incident of 10-25-93 that the police have? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. There has been no testimony about 
the surreptitious tape. From this witness' mouth, anyway, Mr. 
Baker. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I understand that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: You say you have called the surreptitious tape." 
Can you identify that for us? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yes. There is a tape that was apparently 
taken by a police officer who was present at the house that has 
been identified, and there is a tape recording of that. 
 
Q: Did you ever listen to that tape? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever listen to the tape? 
 
A: From TV I did. 
 
Q: Did you listen to the full tape or do you know? 
 
A: I don't think it was the full. I heard a few minutes from it. I don't 
know how long it was. 
 
Q: And if on the two tapes, the tape and the surreptitious tape, 
Nicole Brown Simpson said the door was broken before O.J. ever 
came over and O.J. Simpson said the door was broken before he 
ever got there on 10-25-93, you would disagree with both of them. 
Correct? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: I just know that he broke the door down. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: And you don't know -- Strike that. 
You do know that the door was not broken before Mr. Simpson 
impacted the door with whatever. Correct? 
 
A: I think you need to clarify "broken" to me. It was fixed but then 
it had to be re-fixed after it was broke again. That's what I'm trying 
to get. 
 
Q: All right. So in your opinion it was broken, fixed and then 
rebroken by Mr. Simpson on October 25 of 1993. Is that correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: All right. Now, did you see Mr. Simpson break that door? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So you don't know if he broke it at all. 
 
A: No. I fixed it that night. and it was said it was broken by him. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What was the rest of his answer? 
 
THE WITNESS: Just now? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 'Said it was broken by him." Who said that? 
 
THE WITNESS: Oh, Nicole said. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Nicole said it was broken by him 
on October 25,1993. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: All right. What else did Nicole say?  
 
A: She was talking to the police. It wasn't in part of the 
conversation with the police, but she told the police that he had 
broken it too. 
 
Q: Now, you heard her say to the police that he had broken in?  
 
A: That he had broken the doors. 
 
Q: You didn't hear Nicole say that O.J. had broken into the house, 
did you?  
 
A: Just broken the doors. 
 
Q: Now, when you entered the house on October 25, 1993, where 
was Nicole? 
 
A: Okay. I never entered the house. I entered the guesthouse in the 
back. 
 
Q: Okay. You never came into the house during the time the 
argument was ensuing? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever see from the guesthouse where Nicole was -- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- physically located in the house? 
 
A: Yes, I did. 
 
Q: And where was she physically located when you saw her? 
 
A: She was in the kitchen on the phone. 
 
Q: And did she remain to your knowledge in the kitchen on the 
phone? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was that a cordless phone or phone that had a cord? 
 
A: Phone with a cord. 
 
Q: All right. And from the tape that you heard, was--the portion 
that you heard. was she in the bedroom at the time she was calling 
the police? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: You think she had remained throughout the argument in the 
kitchen? 
 
A: From what I know, I think that's correct. 
 
Q: And by the way, was Nicole Brown Simpson yelling at O.J.? 
 
A: She was yelling on the phone. 
 
Q: And was she yelling at O.J. that you heard from your back 
house? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I think there were shouts to him. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: All right. By the way, did you 
come to the opinion and conclusion that Nicole Brown Simpson 
was a strong woman, strong-willed woman? 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection. Vague. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Lacks foundation. No foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: To a degree strong on certain things. I mean, 
that's open-ended. I don't know what part of strong, strong-willed. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: She didn't take a lot of static or 
grief from people, did she? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Lack of foundation. Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know the answer. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: All right. Now, in terms of her 
going out and going out with Cora Fishman and Faye Resnick, did 
she express to you any reservations about Faye Resnick? 
 
A: I think that Faye was just after money a lot. 
 
Q: Did she express to you that Faye Resnick was using drugs? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Vague as to time. 
 
THE WITNESS: At what time? 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: At any time in January of '93 to 
December of '93 when you were having these tea conversations. 
 
A: I think she mentioned Faye was doing drugs, had been doing 
drugs. 
 
Q: Was it your understanding that Faye Resnick was doing drugs 
from January of 1993 through and including the time that you were 
living there in December of 1993? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know that. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Did Nicole Brown Simpson 
suggest to you that Cora Fishman would not go out with Faye 
Resnick because Faye Resnick was doing drugs? 
 
A: I think it was that Cora just didn't like Faye. It could have been 
that, I don't know, but they didn't get along. 
 
Q: All right. Now, when they went out -- did you ever go out with 
the girls when they went out on their Thursday night outings? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Nicole tell you that O.J. Simpson was jealous of Nicole 
Brown Simpson? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you -- after you moved into Rockingham, did you find 
out that O.J. Simpson was not jealous of Nicole Brown Simpson? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Lacks foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: The only time I saw jealousy was on the call. 
That's when jealousy entered the picture for me. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Did you find out after you moved 
into Rockingham that O.J. Simpson was not jealous of Nicole 
Brown Simpson? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Once again. at times yes and times no. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Did you testify in the Grand Jury 
proceeding that O.J. Simpson didn't care whether Nicole Brown 
Simpson was dating or not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you think that was a sign of jealousy or lack of 
jealousy? 
 
A: I didn't know. I didn't know in someone's mind. 
 
Q: Did you testify in the preliminary hearing that O.J. Simpson 
didn't care whether Nicole Brown Simpson dated anybody. 
including Marcus Allen? 
 
A: Yes, that was going on. I mean. There was dating on both ends. 
and it seemed like it was okay for them to date. 
 
Q: And it certainly didn't bother O.J. did it? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It calls for speculation, lack of foundation. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: As far as you were aware Mr. 
Kaelin. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: It did or did not bother O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: It didn't. 
 
Q: All right. Now, did you suggest in your interview with Marc 
Eliot that Nicole had told you that she wanted a younger guy rather 
than O.J. Simpson? 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection as to the form. The word 'suggest" 
specifically, Mr. Baker. 
 
THE WiTneSs: Yes. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: And did Nicole tell you that? 
 
A: She would say sometimes that she would like a younger guy. 
 
Q: Now, I take it that this conversation about a younger guy 
occurred at some time during 1993. Correct? 
 
A: On Gretna Green when I was living there. Yes. 
 
Q: And your ability to communicate with Nicole about anything in 
her personal life ended when you moved into Rockingham. 
Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, do you have a recollection as to when she said that she 
wanted a younger guy, that she didn't -- thought O.J. was too old 
for her? 
 
A: Just during--the specific times, I don't know. Just she would say 
that. 
 
Q: Did she say it more than once? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And do you have a recollection of when she said that? 
 
A: Just during the time in Gretna Green. Probably early Gretna 
Green period. 
 
Q: Did you believe during the time that you were at Gretna Green 
that O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson had a good 
relationship between them? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Vague as to time. 
 
THE WITNESS: I didn't see much of him during the Gretna Green 
period.  
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Well, you testified in the criminal 
trial, that you thought that they had a good relationship. That is 
Nicole Brown Simpson and O.J. Simpson. did you not? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Lack of foundation.  
 
THE WITNESS: I said that when I saw that they were in love, it 
was a good relationship. If they were apart--I had mentioned that if 
they were apart, if they couldn't reconcile, it was fine; maybe they 
could live separate, and when they were together and loving each 
other. I said it was a good relationship. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: So--  
 
A: But I also mentioned it was stormy at times. 
 
Q: Well was it your testimony, Mr. Kaelin, that O.J. and Nicole 
had a good relationship from the time you knew them? 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: Was it his testimony when? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Good objection. 
 
Q: Did you ever testify that Nicole and O.J. had a good 
relationship from the time you knew them? 
 
A: I think I remember saying they had a good relationship. 
 
Q: Let me read to you from what you testified to on page -- March 
27, 1995, page 2067 [sic]-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: One second. Mr. Baker. Was this the Grand 
Jury? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: No. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: This is trial. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Can you give it to me again? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Sure. 20267. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Line 24 through 28. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay, thank you. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: "Question By Miss Clark: You stated 
an opinion that the defendant and Nicole had a good relationship 
from the time you knew them. Do you recall that?" "Answer: Yes." 
Now. that was your testimony on March 27, 1995. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you wouldn't call a good relationship what you've testified 
here relative to the concerns that you've expressed Miss Simpson 
had about O.J. Simpson. True? 
 
A: Well, what I-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: What I just said, though, was covering it by 
saying when I say "good relationship," when Miss Clark asked me, 
it wasn't--it was one question. She went unto another one. I wanted 
to explain that. When they were in love, they were a great couple 
in love. When it was stormy, it was a bad couple. And I can't 
answer exactly what goes on in someone's mind, but it was this 
thing that if they were in love, it was great, but if they were going 
to be apart and -- it was a stormy relationship. It was never a set 
thing. It was always if they were in love, great, stay in love, but 
then something else would come up and it would draw them apart. 
And so the question that she asked me in court was a yes, and it 
wasn't a continued --it wasn't continued by her. Now that I can say 
in the deposition, that's what it was. It was very stormy. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Okay. So it wasn't a good 
relationship. It was a very stormy relationship. Right? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Misstates his testimony. Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: You can answer the question. 
 
A: When they were together and in love, it was a good 
relationship. When there was troubles going on. it was a bad 
relationship. 
 
Q: So the troubles that you saw going on, as I understand it, was on 
October 25, 1993 and on Christmas of 1993. Correct? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That he personally observed. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yeah. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: That's it. Right? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: "That's it" what? 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: That's it. That's all you saw, 
observed yourself? 
 
MR. BREWER: I think the witness has testified as to periods of 
coolness between the parties also. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: You can answer my question. He 
can ask you questions later. 
 
A: Of what I saw of them together, yes. 
 
Q: And, now, characterize the relationship. Do you think it was a 
good relationship, as you testified to on March 27, 1995 or a very 
stormy relationship, as you've testified here today? 
 
MR. BREWER: It's argumentative. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It's argumentative and it assumes that-- 
 
MR. BREWER: The question is argumentative. It's also been 
asked and answered three times now. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: If that was the test, Mr. Simpson's depo 
would be over. 
 
MR. BREWER: Maybe so. That's the objection, though. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know the-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Somehow I feel I've been slighted in this 
exchange. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know the date that you had mentioned. I 
dont know any--the date. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: That's the date of the testimony I 
just read to you Mr. Kaelin. 
 
A: And that I had said-- 
 
Q: You had said they had a good relationship from the time you 
knew them. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, do you characterize as you sit here now, their relationship 
as a stormy relationship or as a good relationship or anywhere in 
between? 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: Or any one single adjective? Is that what you are 
asking him to do, define their marriage with one single adjective? 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Go ahead. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am going to object to Mr. Simpson's audible 
remarks on the record. Ask that he refrain from making them. Also, 
with respect to the question. Mr. Baker, I think it's objectionable. 
You've asked and answered a number of times. Argumentative. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Fine. Your objection is noted. 
 
Q: Go ahead and answer the question. 
 
A: Stormy. 
 
Q: And this was the entire time that you knew them from about 
February of '93 when you first met Mr. Simpson through June of 
1994. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, in 1994 was O.J. Simpson present in Rockingham in 
January of 1994, he month you moved in? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember. Maybe some of the days. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Do you remember having any 
conversations with him in January of 1994? 
 
A: I can't remember January. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you remember having any conversations or being 
present at any time when O.J. Simpson was present with Nicole in 
January of 1994? 
 
A: As of right now, I can't remember. 
 
Q: How about February of 1994? Were you present at any time 
when Nicole and O.J. were present? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: At Rockingham? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Anywhere. 
 
THE WitnEss: I may have seen them present. I can't give you exact 
dates but I had seen them present together during that period I was 
at Rockingham. yes. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Now, it is true, Mr. Kaelin, that 
you were told by Nicole that she didn't want you around 
Rockingham when she was present. Isn't that true? 
 
A: She had said that, yes. 
 
Q: And in fact when she was going to come over with the kids and 
to swim around the pool, she didnt even want you on the 
property. Isn't that true? 
 
A: She had asked me just to leave--when I was leaving. She didn't 
ask me to leave the house. She just asked me when I was leaving 
OJ.'s to move out. 
 
Q: Well, my question was: When she was over with the kids 
swimming with Justin and Sydney, she didn't want you on the 
property. Isn't that true? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Calls for speculation. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: She told you she didn't want you 
on the property. Isn't that true? 
 
A: To move out. Yes. 
 
Q: And she didn't want you anywhere around the swimming pool 
when her kids were there and she was there. Isn't that also true? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: It depended if I had my daughter there. My 
daughter would play with Cindy--Sydney.  
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: She didn't want you there 
regardless of whether your daughter was there or not. Isn't that 
true? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Calls for speculation. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: The "she" being Nicole. 
 
A: She wanted me to move out. 
 
Q: And I take it then from the conversation -- Strike that. I take it 
from the answers that you have no recollection of any conversation 
with Nicole and O.J. in February of 1994. True? 
 
A: I can't remember February of '94, if the conversation--if I had 
conversation or not in February of '94. 
 
Q: And you can't remember doing anything with O.J. Simpson, 
that is, going to dinner or seeing him around the house or going in 
the main house in February of 1994. True? 
 
A: I could have seen him in the main house in February 94. 
 
Q: I understand you could have seen him. 
 
A: But I can't remember--I can t remember specific dates. I know 
events when I was in the house. I know events of seeing O.J. and 
Nicole. 
 
Q: All right. And in March do you have any specific recollection of 
any conversations with O.J. at all. March 1994? 
 
A: I can't be specific on the date again. 
 
Q: April of 1994. Do you have any recollection of him even being 
in the house? 
 
A: Yes. of being in the house, I'm sure in April I've seen him in the 
house. 
 
Q: All right. And do you have any recollection of how many 
occasions he was in the house in April of 1994? 
 
A: I do not. 
 
Q: Now, don't you recall that in fact O.J. Simpson was not in the 
house the whole month of April of 1994: he was in Puerto Rico 
shooting a movie? 
 
A: The whole month? Like I said. I don't know the exact dates. 
 
Q: Now, you didn't keep track certainly of the comings and goings 
of Mr. Simpson. did you? 
 
A: I did not. 
 
Q: You didn't know, for example, whether or not he would leave 
and go play golf with his buddies or not leave and go play golf 
with his buddies. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: You never saw him being picked up by his golfing buddies or 
leave with his golfing buddies to play golf on any day. Isn't that 
true? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: You never saw him come back from golfing with his golfing 
buddies on any day in the five-plus months you lived there. Isn't 
that true? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Now, in terms of events that you say you have-- 
 
A: You know, I think one time he -- when he shot golf in Del Mar 
with a buddy, Cory, I think saw them leave for that. 
 
Q: All right. What time, approximately, did you see them leave? 
 
A: It was--they went to Del Mar. I thought it was morning they had 
left. Or they were -- Cory was staying in the room next to mine, I 
think at that time. I don't know. But they went to Del Mar--and 
they played golf, and Clinton was down there. I don't know the 
exact date. But I know they went to play golf down there. 
 
Q: Do you have a recollection of that being in May of 1994? 
 
A: It could have been. 
 
Q: All right. Now. do you recall that Mr. Simpson didn't live at 
Rockingham in January and February of 1994: he was in his New 
York apartment? 
 
A: I don't know for sure. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, in May of 1994--did you hear early in the month of 
May 1994 that O.J. Simpson had broken up with Nicole and that it 
was over for good? 
 
A: I believe I heard something about that. 
 
Q: In fact, you testified that it was over early in May, and you 
heard that it was over early in May for good. Did you not? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: And you also heard and testified that you heard again in mid-
May that it was over for good. Isn't that true? 
 
A: That's possible. yes. 
 
Q: Well, and when I say "over for good," you understand I'm 
referring to the relationship between Nicole and O.J. Simpson. 
Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: All right. Now it certainly was no surprise to you on June 11th 
and June 12th that the relationship between Nicole and O.J. 
Simpson was over. Isn't that correct? 
 
A: Well, thats when I had spent more time. There was just a 
finality to it. It was different. I heard it from others, and this was 
me sitting there hearing it from that weekend. So it was more final 
to me. It had finality to it. 
 
Q: Mr. Kaelin, you had tried to fix O.J. Simpson up on dates before 
June 11th, 1994. Had you not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you think that they were still a duo, that is, Nicole and O.J., 
and you were fixing him up with dates? 
 
A: They weren't--they were just not dates. I think what you're 
thinking. It was just someone come over in the day and play tennis. 
It was my friend Susan. It wasn't going to be a romantic 
relationship. 
 
Q: Didn't you fix him up with some girlfriend of yours and go to 
some nightclub? Correct? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Didn't you call him from the Renaissance one night and ask O.J. 
Simpson if he would come over because you had some girl, a 
Ferratti or Ferrari something there? 
 
A: Rebecca Ferrara, right, but it wasnt for a date. 
 
Q: And isn't that the only time ever from the time you knew O.J. 
Simpson until the time of you moving out of Rockingham, that 
O.J. asked you if Nicole was there: When you called from the 
Renaissance Club? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And he called--he asked you that question--Strike that. You 
knew that the Renaissance Club was a club that Nicole Brown 
Simpson frequented. Isn't that true? 
 
A: Correct. There were two different parts to it. I wasn't in the 
club. I was at the dinner house and there were walls, and it was 
closed. The club was closed, so I didn't go into the club. 
 
Q: But he told you the only reason he was asking you whether 
Nicole was there was because he didn't want to run into Nicole. 
Isn't that true? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then he declined to go to the club in any event, didn't he? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, in May of 1994 were you aware of Nicole having the flu? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And were you aware of O.J. Simpson taking care of her during 
that period of time? 
 
A: He was taking soup there, I believe, yes. 
 
Q: And he was making sure the kids were all right, and you knew 
he was going over to Nicole's house in late May of 1994 taking 
care of her because she had the flu. Did you not? 
 
A: In May I believe. I'm not sure on the dates, but yes, I remember 
in May taking soup, Michelle making soup-- 
 
Q: All right. Now-- 
 
A: --or Gigi. 
 
Q: When did Michelle leave and Gigi become the housekeeper on 
Rockingham, to your recollection? 
 
A: During the time that I was Rockingham. So it was in that time 
frame of that six months. I cant give you the exact dates. 
 
Q: Did you come to find out why Michelle left and Gigi became 
the housekeeper? 
 
A: I believe it was over a fight with Nicole and Michelle. 
 
Q: And who told you about that? 
 
A: Michelle. 
 
Q: And did she tell you that Nicole had struck her? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that she wanted to go to the police and file charges? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did she tell you that O.J. had suggested she not do that? 
 
A: I don't remember exactly. I know she didn't do it. 
 
Q: Did she tell you that she was going to leave because of Nicole 
Brown Simpson? 
 
A: It could have been. Michelle was -- I-- very high-strung, so I 
dont know. It could have been from-- 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection. Ask the witness not speculate. Just 
answer the question if he can. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know the reason why she had left. It could 
have been.  
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Well, relate to us the physical 
altercation where Nicole hit Michelle. 
 
A: Well. I wasn't there. This is from Michelle? 
 
Q: Sure. 
 
A: I believe the dog or--and the kids or someone came in and they 
were making puddles, and I guess Michelle got upset and said. "I 
just cleaned up," and I think Nicole said, "Don't yell at my kids 
or "the dog." I don't know exact -- exactly, but I know that from 
the yelling, Nicole slapped her. 
 
Q: In the face, did she not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And how long after that physical altercation between Nicole and 
Michelle did Michelle leave? 
 
MR. BREWER: Well, lacks foundation as to time. If he knows 
when that altercation occurred. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know the date. I would guess within two 
months, if not a month. I don't know the date. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Did you have conversations with 
Michelle off and on during the time that she was the housekeeper 
at OJ.'s house? 
 
A: Yes. off and on. 
 
Q: And did you think you got to know her pretty well? 
 
A: I don't know the definition of "well." I mean. she said--we 
talked. 
 
Q: Do you know how long she had been OJ.'s housekeeper before 
she left? 
 
A: I think at least 10 years. 
 
Q: And did you get the impression that she was fond of O.J. 
Simpson? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when she left, did you get the impression it had nothing to 
do with Mr. Simpson; it was because of the physical altercation she 
had had with Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now. I want to jump for a moment to June 13th, 1994. Now. 
you were sound asleep in your bed in the early morning hours. 
Correct? 
 
A: Yeah, tossing and turning. 
 
Q: And at that point you heard a knock on the door, did you not, on 
your door? 
 
A: That morning? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: At approximately what time was that? 
 
A: Approximately, I think. 5:30 a.m. 
 
Q: All right. And you got up and opened the door. Did you not? 
 
A: Yes. I did. 
 
Q: Did you normally sleep with that door locked. The one that 
went out to the pool? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And next to your room there's an office. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And if you were facing the bed, the office would be to the right 
or the north. True? Or the west, I guess. 
 
A: It would be to my left. It would be going west. Correct. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What do you mean, facing the bed"? If he's 
lying on the bed? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: No. no. 
 
Q: I meant if you're standing there -- And I think he got it wrong, 
too. If you are standing looking at the bed from the foot of the bed, 
the office would be to the right or closest to the main house. 
Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And on the left of the bed where you slept was a bathroom. 
Correct? 
 
A: Looking at the foot still? 
 
Q: Correct. 
 
A: It would be correct. It would be left. 
 
Q: And if you look at the area where the bed is in that room, there 
is a night stand on the left and the right of the bed. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And over the night stand on the left side of the bed is an air 
conditioner. True? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And that's a room air conditioner as contrasted to some central 
unit. True? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And there are two doors that have the same covering as the wall 
that close over that air conditioner. Isn't that true? 
 
A: I'm pretty sure, yes. 
 
Q: Now, in the room where you resided, you got up at 
approximately 5:30 and opened the door to the patio/pool area and 
let in the police officers who were there. True? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: And who were the police officers who were there at 5:30 in the 
morning, approximately? 
 
A: I believe Vannatter and Fuhrman and-- 
 
Q: Anyone else? 
 
A: Lange and Phillips. 
 
Q: So there were four officers then that came into your room? 
 
A: I think only one came into my room. 
 
Q: Who was that? 
 
A: I think the first one was Phillips, quick; then Fuhrman. 
 
Q: All right. Now, when Phillips came into the room, the other 
three officers were just outside the door? Were they on the elevated 
portion of the patio or below in the entrance area? 
 
A: What I remember. I believe two were elevated and two were 
down. 
 
Q: All right. 
 
A: If it's correct in my memory, thats what my memory is. 
 
Q: The patio that comes off of the main house comes up to an area 
right adjacent to the area where you lived in, and let's call that the 
bungalow. Fair enough? Your area of living, where you and 
Arnelle lived, was the bungalow? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: All right. And you go down steps to get into the door of your 
entrance. True? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you can go either in your entrance or an entrance into the 
office. Can you not? 
 
A: One door would lead right to my room. 
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: Then you could go make a right into the office. 
 
Q: And then there are some stairs that go up into the main house. 
True? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: All right. Now, all four officers were down--Strike that. Two 
officers were up on the patio area, and two officers were down in 
front of the door. Is that true? 
 
A: Best of my memory. yes. 
 
Q: And I take it the two officers that were down in front of your 
room were Phillips and Fuhrman. True? 
 
A: I couldn't give you the exact--if it was those two. I'm pretty sure 
I remember two down and two up. 
 
Q: All right. Were they in uniform? 
 
A: In suits. In dress suits. 
 
Q: All right. And when Phillips came into the room, did he show 
you a badge? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What did he tell you? 
 
A: They were the police. 
 
Q: Did they tell you they were Los Angeles Police Department? 
 
A: I think they just said "Police." I don't know if they said "Los 
Angeles." 
 
Q: All right. And what else did Phillips tell you? 
 
A: This is when the door's open? 
 
Q: Yes sir. 
 
A: I think, "Who lives here? Who else lives here?" I don't know 
what exact dialogue happened first, but who lived here. Who I was. 
 
Q: Had--when he was asking you these questions, was Fuhrman in 
the room? 
 
A: I don't think so. I think Fuhrman came into my room after they 
went out and two of them knocked on Arnelle's door. Then I think 
Fuhrman came when they said. "Who else lives here?" and I think I 
pointed to her room. 
 
Q: All right. .Now, while Phillips is asking you these questions, is 
it your recollection that he was alone in your room? 
 
A: No. There were--always were two and two. I was never left 
alone until Fuhrman came in, but they were still outside. I was 
never--they were always in proximity to me. 
 
Q: When Phillips came into your room at approximately 5:30, how 
many steps or how many feet did he come into your room? 
 
A: Probably two. 
 
Q: And you were standing there basically in the doorway talking to 
him. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And the doorway was open. True? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did any of the officers who were up on the elevated portion of 
the patio come down the steps into the doorway portion? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: How long did the conversation that you had with Phillips take 
before Vannatter came into the room? 
 
A: I don't think Vannatter came into the room. I had Vannatter later 
in the house. 
 
Q: All right, we are going to get to that. 
 
A: Okay. I think Fuhrman--it was Phillips, and I believe they went 
to Arnelle's room, , two of them, and then-- 
 
Q: Which two went to Arnelle's room, if you know? 
 
A: I think Vannatter and Lange. 
 
Q: By that time had Fuhrman come into your room? 
 
A: No. I was waiting for them--for Arnelle to answer the door. 
Then I believe after she got her door and was talking to them, 
Fuhrman came in and talked to me. 
 
Q: All right. When Fuhrman came and talked to you, had Phillips 
remained in the room the whole time? 
 
A: I don't think so. He could have been outside. 
 
Q: You said they never left you alone. 
 
A: He could have been outside the door but Fuhrman was in my 
room giving me a test. I believe it was Fuhrman . 
 
Q: All right. Now. between the time that you opened the door at 
approximately 5:30 and the time Fuhrman had gone apparently to 
Arnelle's room and come back to your room, approximately how 
much time had elapsed? 
 
A: I don't know if Fuhrman went to her room. I thought it was 
Vannatter and Lange, I said. 
 
Q: I apologize then. So Fuhrman stayed there during that whole 
time? 
 
A: I believe it was--I think Fuhrman and Lange were with me -- 
Fuhrman and Phillips with me, and I know at one point I believe it 
was Fuhrman came in my room and looked at my clothes and did 
his thing. I said "Go ahead." 
 
Q: I want to take it step by step if I may. 
 
A: Okay. It's-- 
 
Q: I understand it's almost two years ago, but I want to try to go 
back in your mind and try to recall. After you had this conversation 
with Phillips and he asked you about who lived there and you told 
him you lived there and Arnelle lived there -- correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And did you tell him that anybody else lived there? 
 
A: I believe--I think I said it was OJ.'s house, and I said, "Did the 
plane crash?" And I thought something was -- something happened 
to O.J. 
 
Q: Did you ask them what happened, if anything, that is, Phillips 
and who else was in earshot? 
 
A: I think I said that. I said, "Did the plane crash?" They didn't say 
anything. I said, "What happened? What's this about?" 
 
Q: Did you get an answer? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, with you talking to Phillips, that conversation only took 
approximately a minute or so? 
 
A: I think so. 
 
Q: And then Lange and Vannatter go down to Arnelle's door, 
which is about 20 feet from your door. Correct? 
 
A: 15.20. I guess. yeah. 
 
Q: And did you hear any of the conversation that Vannatter and 
Lange had with Arnelle? 
 
A: I don't. I remember them -- it just seemed like they were 
knocking on her door for a while; I remember that pounding and 
pounding and pounding. She never was answering the door and 
then she got the door. 
 
Q: And did you hear anything that she said to the police officers in 
front of her door? 
 
A: I think she might have said, "What's this about?" I don't 
remember. 
 
Q: All right. Now, did the two officers stay at Arnelle's door for a 
period of time? 
 
A: I think so. 
 
Q: And how long was that period of time? Just approximately. Was 
it ten minutes? Was it five minutes? Three minutes? 
 
A: Maybe three to five. 
 
Q: All right. And then did Vannatter and Lange come back to your 
room? 
 
A: I believe after Fuhrman. I think everybody left together into the 
house. 
 
Q: Did Vannatter and Lange come back from Arnelle's room with 
Arnelle? 
 
A: I don't think so. They went to my doorway up on the top, is 
where I saw them next. 
 
Q: All right. Was Arnelle with them at that time? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: Did she have a robe or something on? 
 
A: I think so. 
 
Q: All right. Now, when the two officers were up on the patio 
above the entrance to your area with Arnelle, did Vannatter or 
Lange come down into your bedroom? 
 
A: I don't remember. I don't remember if they did. 
 
Q: Had Fuhrman been into your house before Lange and Vannatter 
came back with Arnelle from her room? 
 
A: It's possible. I think he might have been in my room with me. 
 
Q: Fuhrman came in and administered a drug test to you, did he 
not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And-- 
 
A: I think with a pen. I don't know if it was pen or finger. It was 
my eyes, checking my eyes. 
 
Q: Well, did he administer this test, whatever it was, before you 
went into the main house? 
 
A: I think so, yes. 
 
Q: All right. Now. approximately how tall is Fuhrman? 
 
A: I think about six foot. 
 
Q: And how tall are you? 
 
A: 5-10. 
 
Q: Did you do anything other than cooperate with Phillips and 
Fuhrman on the morning of June 13, 1994? 
 
A: Did I do anything other than cooperate? 
 
Q: Yeah. Were you cooperative? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you threaten them in any way? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you become hostile in tone in your conversation to them? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What is your weight? 
 
A: About 155,160. 
 
Q: And what's Fuhrman's approximate weight, if you know? 
 
A: I don't know. If I guessed would I win a tie? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Don't guess. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. I don't know his weight. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: You get a free ride on the 
carrousel. When Fuhrman was administering this test to you, was 
Phillips in the room? 
 
A: I thought they were all out on that -- on my door. I thought it 
already possibly they were -- one on the bottom and two on top 
with Arnelle at that time. 
 
Q: Where was Phillips during the time that Vannatter and Lange 
were down at Arnelle's? Was he in your room the whole time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Well, did he walk out the door? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: When? 
 
A: I believe -- there is a screen in my door. He stayed at the 
doorway when the door was shut, while Fuhrman was doing that. 
The other two had gotten Arnelle and then came back after those 
minutes and waited up on top there, and I thought that was for 
them -- for everybody to go outside now. 
 
Q: All right. 
 
A: There was--I'm trying to get this time-wise. I mean I don't know 
exactly every question. 
 
Q: All right. So Phillips had actually exited the screen door, and 
Fuhrman had come into your room? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: And when Fuhrman came into the room, what did he say to 
you? 
 
A: He asked me what I wore that night. 
 
Q: And did you tell him? 
 
A: And he asked me--Yes. 
 
Q: What did you tell him you had on? 
 
A: I showed him everything that I wore, and he -- 
 
Q: What did you in fact wear the night of the 12th? 
 
A: I believe they were boots and jeans, and I don't know what shirt, 
and it was on the chair and -- 
 
Q: Chair over by the -- 
 
A: By the--the chair that would be in the room. I usually hung 
them on a chair. And I told him about the night something -- I 
believe I told him about the noise I heard. 
 
Q: The thumps? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: And this is still while you were in the room? 
 
A: I was talking a lot. I don't know everything I said. I was very 
fast-paced talking. And at some point he did that thing -- I don't 
know if it was a pen or with a pencil -- that test, and I think that 
was it. 
 
Q: All right. Did Fuhrman inspect your boots? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did he go over and pick up the boots and look at the soles? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What kind of boots were they? 
 
A: They were like a cheap kind of Doc Martens--not Doc Martens, 
but like a cheaper brand.  
 
Q: Okay. Rubber soles? 
 
A: I think so. 
 
Q: Do you still have them? 
 
A: Plastic. Rubber. I think I have one of them. When there was a 
move a lot of my stuff wasn't ever accounted for. 
 
Q: Did those boots have similar pat terns to the footprints that you 
became aware of at Bundy? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Lacks foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: All right. Would you preserve the 
boot that you presently have of that set? Did you keep that boot? 
 
A: I think so. 
 
Q: But will you keep that boot? 
 
A: Sure. 
 
Q: Till I get a subpoena on that boot. 
 
A: Sure. I think I have -- I don't know if I have it or not, but I will 
find out. 
 
Q: All right. Now, what are the height of the soles? 
 
A: The height of the sole? 
 
Q: Yeah. Is it a quarter--thin, quarter inch, or are they an inch 
thick? Do you have a recollection? 
 
A: No, I--a sole. I I don't know. 
 
Q: What's the color of the soles? Are they light colored? 
 
A: No. They're dark. 
 
Q: Now, what size shoe do you wear? 
 
A: Different. 9-1/2,10. 
 
Q: Now, had you been drinking any alcohol the night of June 13--
June 12, 1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Had you used any drugs on June 12th, 1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When Fuhrman was giving you this test, whatever it was, was 
he the only person in the room at the time? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Describe for us the test that Fuhrman gave to you. 
 
A: If it's a pen or a light, I don't remember, but I had to follow him, 
follow the finger or pen. It was one of those "watch it," and that 
was it. 
 
Q: Did he tell you why he was giving you this test, that is. 
Fuhrman? 
 
A: He had asked me if I had smoked pot. I think that's why. 
 
Q: Did he ask you that and you indicated you had not? 
 
A: I did not. 
 
Q: Did he ask you anything else about using drugs before he 
administered this test? 
 
A: I think he asked me if I had used drugs that night, if I used 
drugs or something. I said no. 
 
Q: Okay. And the whole thing was just moving either his finger or 
his light back and forth in front of your eyes. Correct? 
 
A: Pretty positive. Yes. 
 
Q: And he asked you to follow the finger or the light with your 
eyes. Is that true? 
 
A: I think so, yes. 
 
Q: Was he directly in front of you when he was administering this 
test? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did he -- Strike that. Where was he standing in the room? 
 
A: It would be right by the doorway. 
 
Q: And were you standing closer to the bed? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Where were you standing? 
 
A: I was standing-- he would be standing at the foot of the bed. I 
would be turned that way (Indicating). So-- 
 
Q: Towards the bathroom? 
 
A: No, it was right by the door. So almost like we are right now. 
 
Q: Okay. How far apart were you from Fuhrman? 
 
A: Two feet. 
 
Q: Okay. And what did he do after he administered this test? 
 
A: I think we all went outside. 
 
Q: So both you and he left the room at that point in time? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was that the first time you had left the room after you had been 
awoken at approximately 5:30 in the morning on the morning of 
the 13th? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when you left the room, did Fuhrman leave with you? 
 
A: I think so. I think we all left. I think we all ended up in the 
house together. 
 
Q: All right. Now, do you have an estimate as to how long this 
took from the time that you heard the knock on the door until the 
time that you all believe you left the room and went into the main 
house? 
 
A: I don't know. Within an hour. I don't know exactly the time we 
went to the house. 
 
Q: Now, when you interviewed with Marc Eliot, you indicated to 
him that you left your room and went to the main house with 
Vannatter, and Fuhrman stayed back in your room. Do you have a 
recollection of that? 
 
A: I don't. 
 
Q: Let me ask you to read page 64. lines 3 through 14, of the 
transcript of your interview with Mr. Eliot. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I don't know what this document is, Mr. 
Baker. I've never seen it. It's a transcript of the Eliot tapes? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Yes. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: If you want a copy, we can sell it to you 
at the same price as the video. 
 
MR. KELLY: Mr. Baker, can I ask for a stronger foundation--I 
think there were a number of days and volumes and dates and 
things -- in terms of where this came from? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: You can ask for it, but that doesn't mean 
you're going to get it. 
 
MR. KELLY: I'll hold my breath. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I wouldn't., 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: Did you have these transcribed, or were they 
given to you as a transcript? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: They were given to us as a transcript. If 
he wants them, I'll make them available to him. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: Thanks. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yeah, it out of the D.A.'s office. 
 
MR. KELLY: Oh. if we have a date on that, that's all I'm asking-- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: April 2, 1992. The date of the 
transcription was complete on April 2. The date of the interview 
was 12-27-94. 
 
MR. KELLY: Thank you. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Interview between Kato and Marc Eliot? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Does the-- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Here, look at it. It's all date stamped. 
That's what it is. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What I am trying to find out is, I understood 
there were about 16, 17 hours of such interviews. What you have in 
front of you, did the D.A. transcribe the entirety of that interview? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I don't know the answer to that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Because it looks too thin to be 16 or 17 hours. 
So that's my question. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Let me ask you to read page 6 
starting at line 2, I believe, down the end of your answer. 
 
(Witness complies.) 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It's the proposed tape interview. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yeah. 
 
Q: Now, does that refresh your recollection that you went off to the 
main house with Vannatter, and Fuhrman stayed behind in your 
room? Fuhrman. 
 
A: I don't know. I just know going into the house. I cannot say for 
sure right now. 
 
Q: I take it that your recollection was better in December of '94 
relative to the events of June of '94 than it is now in February of 
'96. 
 
A: I can only tell you what I know right now. 
 
Q: All right. Now, do you have a recollection that Fuhrman stayed 
be hind and was in your room by himself the morning of June 13th, 
1994? 
 
A: He could have been. I do not know. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Don't speculate. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. I don't know. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: In terms of your initial discussions 
in the room when you asked did the flight go down, did anyone ask 
you about the flight that Mr. Simpson was on? 
 
A: I think so. I think I mentioned-- like I said--I was talking so fast. 
I' m sure I said. "Did OJ.'s plane crash?" And I think they might 
have said something. I said he was in Chicago and I think I 
mentioned that he was in some Hertz thing. 
 
Q: Did they ask you whether or not he had gone on a private 
aircraft as contrasted to a scheduled flight? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did you ever indicate anything other than the fact that he had 
gone on a scheduled flight to-- 
 
A: I might-- 
 
Q: -- Fuhrman and Vannatter and Phillips and Lange? 
 
A: I might have said American Air Lines. 
 
Q: All right. But you certainly didn't indicate that he had gone on 
anything other than a scheduled flight to Chicago, did you? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: There has been no testimony about a 
scheduled flight . 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. I think I said red eye. I might have 
said a red eye flight. I don't know. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Okay. And what I am getting at is: 
You never suggested to the--you never said or intimated to the 
police at all that Mr. Simpson had gone to Chicago on an 
unscheduled flight, did you? 
 
A: I don't think so, no. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: You want to take a break? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Sure. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the 
time is approximately 10:37. 
 
(Recess.) 
 
(Edward Medvene enters the deposition.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 10:55. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Mr. Kaelin, I take it that after you 
heard this pounding on the door at approximately 5:30 in the 
morning on the morning of June 13, 1994, you were somewhat in 
shock. Is that true? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when you heard that it was the police, you were frightened, 
were you not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And I take it further that what you did was you wanted to 
explain to the police, including Mr. Phillips and Mr. Fuhrman, as 
much as possible what happened the evening before. Isn't that true? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And while you were still in your room and before you had gone 
into the main house, you were talking rapidly to Detectives 
Fuhrman and Phillips, were you not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you--Strike that. I take it that you explained to them 
not only the thumps, but the interrelationship that you had had with 
Mr. Simpson both before and after the recital. Correct? 
 
A: I think that's when I sat with Vannatter, and he was asking me 
about--he sat down, taking notes. I don t know if I said it in the 
initial--I was talking a lot; I can tell you that. I was 
 
Q: Your purpose in talking a lot was not only to answer their 
questions, but to make sure that you weren't involved in whatever 
they were knocking on your door for. Isn't that true? 
 
A: I have no idea. I was--I didn't know what it was about yet. 
 
Q: Okay. Whatever they were knocking on your door for at 5:30 in 
the morning, you wanted to make sure you weren't in any criminal 
difficulty, and you explained everything you could to them as 
rapidly as you could. True? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: I mean, part of your fear was-- 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection. I don't think he has answered--completed 
his answer, yet. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He isn't understanding your question, Mr. 
Baker. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Now, again, again you're starting to talk 
as you did early in this case, about somebody's state of mind. I 
object to that. How do you know he's not understanding? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, just from the record, he seemed really 
confused. It was a long question. too. 
 
MR. KELLY: I'm sorry. Maybe more importantly, Mr. Baker, I 
thought he was still talking, but I might be mistaken. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Did you get an answer, David? 
 
THE REPORTER: Yes. I did. The answer was "Yes." 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Now, when you were discussing 
with the detectives. were you directing your--Strike that. Was it 
Phillips or Fuhrman who was questioning you while you were still 
in your room and before you went to the house? 
 
A: They both, I think, talked to me, 
 
But it was--the last person I talked to I believe was Fuhrman. 
 
Q: And as I understand it, Phillips was not in the room when this 
follow-the-flashlight or finger test was administered. Correct? 
 
A: I think he was at the screen door on the outside. 
 
Q: All right. And at that point in time was Fuhrman asking you 
additional questions as to what had happened the preceding 
evening? 
 
A: I don't remember that. 
 
Q: Do you have a recollection of indicating to Fuhrman about the 
thumps that you had heard the previous evening? 
 
A: I thought I might have told him about the thumps I heard. 
 
Q: And you also had this conversation at some time shortly after 
5:30 that Mr. Simpson was--had taken an airplane to Chicago. 
Correct? 
 
A: I had said that, I believe. 
 
Q: So as far as you knew, Mr. Fuhrman certainly knew that O.J. 
Simpson was not on the property after he talked to you. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And it's also true, is it not. that you explained to him that you 
and O.J. had discussed the thumps before O.J. got in the 
limousine? 
 
A: That I had told him about the noise, just told him I heard noises 
last night. I don't think I mentioned OJ.'s name with the noises. 
 
Q: All right. That was when you were talking to Mr. Vannatter 
when you were up in the bar in the main house? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: All right. What exactly did you tell Detective Fuhrman about 
the noises you had heard? 
 
A: To Fuhrman? 
 
Q: Yes, sir. 
 
A: Well, I think it was in my room. and I was talking first of all of 
the plane crash, if there was a plane crash. I said. "Oh. I think it 
was a weird night, anyways. I heard these thumps. I don't know if 
it's important or not, but my picture moved." So I think I pointed to 
my picture, and I think he was looking around the room, and it was 
sort of me talking, him listening, and then I felt as if he would do 
the talking then, that I was-- that he wanted me to shut up, and I --
he was gonna ask me questions. 
 
Q: Now, at that time when you were alone in your room with Mr. 
Fuhrman, did he ask you where the thumps had come from? 
 
A: I think I just pointed. 
 
Q: And where did you point, Mr. Kaelin? 
 
A: I think I pointed right to the back wall. 
 
Q: Did you point to the back wall directly behind your bed, or did 
you point to the back wall over near the air conditioner? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Vague as to the position. You know, we have 
a pretty wide bed there. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: The width of the bed is what, 
about five feet? 
 
A: I guess it's about that much. I think I just pointed, though, I just 
said the back wall. I don't even know if I looked when I pointed. I 
just said, "Oh, I heard this noise back there." 
 
Q: Do you have a recollection at the time if the doors that covered 
the air conditioner were open or closed? 
 
A: No, I don't. 
 
Q: Did you use that room air conditioner at all? 
 
A: I don't think I ever did. 
 
Q: Did you leave the bathroom window open consistently when 
you were living there? 
 
A: I think I usually closed it. 
 
Q: What did you use for ventilation? 
 
A: If I was taking a shower, I'd open up that--the crank on it. 
 
Q: On the bathroom window? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did the bathroom window have a screen on it? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: Did the screen--was it on the inside or the outside of the 
window, if you know? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: All right. Now, you indicated to Detective Fuhrman that a 
picture had moved. Is that correct? 
 
A: I think I might have said that to him. 
 
Q: And did you indicate how many thumps there were to Detective 
Fuhrman? 
 
A: I don't know if I said there were three. I think I just said the 
noises, I heard a noise. I don't know if "thump" was even the word. 
 
Q: All right. Did you motion to what picture had moved? 
 
A: I think so. 
 
Q: What picture had moved, Mr. Kaelin? 
 
A: The picture that would have been over the phone, where the 
phone was. 
 
Q: And as you faced the bed, again looking at the bed from 
standing in front of it, the phone was on the right night stand, was 
it not? 
 
A: Yes. it was. 
 
Q: Now, where had those thumps come from the night before in 
relationship to the air conditioner as contrasted to the picture that 
you say may have moved? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The question is vague. You mean where did 
the thumps occur? 
 
THE WITNESS: I thought. the thumps occurred behind my--the 
bed--headboard of the bed. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: In the middle? On the left? On the 
right? Again, using- 
 
A: The noises were from-- 
 
Q: Again, let me just see if I can--so that we have a frame of 
reference, what I would like you to do is to tell us where those 
noises came from in your best recollection using looking at your 
bed from the foot of the bed facing the bed, so that the air 
conditioner would be on the left, the phone and night stand would 
be on the right, and the picture you say would be on the right, and 
then how far from the ceiling down and how far from the middle of 
the headboard left or right. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I showed him a photograph-- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Fine. Good. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:--in my examination and pointed to the spot. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Can you--is that the photograph 
where you-- 
 
A: Yeah. right there (Indicating). 
 
MR. BREWER: Can you identify the exhibit number? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I don't have the exhibit number on here. 
I'm sorry. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: We will get it later. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: So it would be about at the height 
of the headboard and to the left side of the bed. Correct? 
 
A: Yeah. It was like a beginning noise and an ending noise, it had, 
and they are all within a foot of each other. I would think 
(Indicating). 
 
Q: And that would be to your best recollection: About five feet 
away from the air conditioner? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: All right. And the noise that you heard, were there three noises? 
 
A: I thought in my head there were three noises, like a continued 
(Sounds). 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: So the record is clear, Mr. Baker. we are now 
back to when he heard the noises, not talking to the police. Is that 
right? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Correct. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: At the Grand Jury hearing you hit 
the table three times to demonstrate the noises that you heard. 
Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you did it with approximately the same velocity, so it 
produced the same noise every time, did you not, at the Grand 
Jury? 
 
A: At the Grand Jury I did, yes. 
 
Q: And you did exactly the same thing when you testified in the 
criminal trial. Is that true? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: And you did the same thing in the preliminary hearing, did you 
not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: All right. And so your recollection is essentially there were 
three noises of equal velocity, producing an equal amount of 
sound. Is that correct? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am unclear what you mean by "velocity." 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I agree. That's a poor question. 
 
Q: The three sounds that you heard were approximately of the 
same volume. Is that true? 
 
A: Yeah. I didn't know back then that I was able to move around. I 
think that's what made me--they said, ''Mr. Kaelin, go and show us 
with your hand. They didn't say, "Mr. Kaelin, get up." So I just 
listened to what they said. 
 
Q: By the way, did you rehearse that getting up and hitting the 
wall, as you demonstrated here last week. with Mr. Petrocelli in the 
room? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am going to object to what you mean by 
"rehearse.'' 
 
THE WITNESS: I didn't rehearse. I just said what the noises sound 
like. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Did you show Mr. Petrocelli in the 
seven to ten hours that you spent with him in the last couple of 
weeks before your deposition, did you show him the move that you 
made here in the deposition room? 
 
A: It was me saying if I--the noise that it sounded like was 
someone doing this. It was me saying this IS what the noise 
sounded like. 
 
Q: So did you do the maneuver that you did here in the room for 
Mr. Petrocelli in that seven to ten hours that you spent with him? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me. There wasn't any seven-to-ten-
hour meeting. You're mischaracterizing his testimony. You may 
answer. 
 
THE WITNESS: I said, "This is what it sounded like." 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: And you did that for Mr. 
Petrocelli in the last couple weeks when you were in the meetings 
with him? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: All right. Now, was it your--is it your recollection that the 
sound stayed in a static location? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You mean same location? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: That's what "static" means. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let's make sure we all know-- working with 
the same words. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: So that where you have drone-- 
drawn the "X" on whatever number this exhibit is-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: "Drone" was a Freudian slip. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Where you've drawn the "X" on 
this exhibit, that's where the noise to the best of your recollection 
came from. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: All three of the noises came from where the X is. Correct? 
 
A: Within a foot, I'd say. 
 
Q: All right. And is it your testimony then that the picture moved 
when you heard those noises? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And the picture would be about what, five to six feet away from 
the-- where the "X" is drawn on the exhibit? 
 
A: I believe so. yes. 
 
Q: So the picture moved five to six feet away. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. it did. 
 
Q: And was there more than one picture on the south wall of your 
room in June of 1994? 
 
A: I think so. I think they're on both sides, pictures. 
 
Q: And the picture on the left night stand didn't move at all? 
 
A: Well, my attention went to this one because I saw and heard it 
move. 
 
Q: So you were lying, as I understand it, on the bed and in a 
position with your back onto the bed and your head up at the 
pillow end. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you were talking on the telephone. True? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: And the picture was over to your left and above you. Correct? 
 
A: To my left and above me, yes. 
 
Q: And there is a light there on the night stand that partially 
obliterates your vision of the picture, true, from the position you 
were lying in? 
 
A: It's above the lamp, the picture. 
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: So that the lamp impedes your ability to see the picture. True? 
 
A: No, I don't think--I mean, I could see the picture if I turned-- 
like right there, here's the lamp (Indicating). The picture would be 
right here (Indicating) 
 
Q: Okay. And is it your testimony that the lower portion of the 
picture moved six inches from left to right, as you faced the bed 
again? 
 
A: Yeah, I can't tell you inches, but it moved. The picture moved. I 
believe it moved that way (Indicating). 
 
Q: And your description would be the lower left corner of the 
picture, again as you're facing the bed, would move in a--down 
towards the floor, and the upper right-hand portion of the picture 
would move up towards the ceiling. Correct? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: All right. And do you have an estimate as to how many inches 
that moved? 
 
A: Between five inches and ten inches. 
 
Q: Five and what? 
 
A: Five and ten inches it moved. 
 
Q: All right. Now, did you straighten the picture out? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: So the next morning when the police came in at 5:30 and there-
in-after the picture would have been in the same position. Correct? 
 
A: If I didn't straighten it. I don't know if I did or not, but it would 
have been. 
 
Q: Did you tell ,Mr. Fuhrman on the morning of June 13th that the 
picture had moved this five to ten inches? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: All right. Now, we're going to direct your attention, if I may, to-
- again to June 13th of 1994. After you had this pencil or flashlight 
test with Mr. Fuhrman, then did you exit the room? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Fuhrman exit behind you, that is, was he the last person 
out of your room? 
 
A: He could have been. I don't know for sure, but he could have 
been. 
 
Q: All right. And then is it your testimony that you then went into 
the main house? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Through the closest door to the main house, that is. up on the 
patio and the left door that we have talked about that you marked 
the other day? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, you had set the alarm the night previous, had you not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: There is no pad on that door. Isn't that correct? 
 
A: I'm pretty sure there's not. 
 
Q: How did you people get in with- out setting off the alarm if you 
went in that door, as you previously testified? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Lacks foundation, 
 
THE WITNESS: Arnelle had a key: that's all I know. I didn't have 
anything to do with it. I just walked--followed them. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: All right. When you went into the 
house, did the alarm go off? 
 
A: I don t think so. 
 
Q: Have you ever heard the alarm go off in that house previous to 
June 13, 1994? 
 
A: I don't know if I've heard it go off once or not. 
 
Q: It is an audible alarm, is it not., Mr. Kaelin. as far as you're 
aware? 
 
A: I don't know if I've heard it or not go I off. That's why I don't 
know. I'm sure it is. 
 
Q: And in any event, your recollection is nobody went around the 
house and did anything with any of the pads. What happened was 
that all six of you, you, Arnelle and the four detectives, went in the 
door that would be to enter into the den area of the house. Correct? 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection. There is misstatement of his testimony. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No foundation as to what all the officers did. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I am asking a question  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He only can observe what he saw. 
 
THE WITNESS: I went through that door. That's what I remember. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: All right. In any event, when you 
went through that door, was Lange, Phillips, Fuhrman and 
Vannatter with you and Arnelle going through that door? 
 
A: As far as I remember, I think so. 
 
Q: Now, you're familiar with the bar area as you go through that 
door and into Mr. Simpson's house. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you sat down at that bar area, did you not. after you entered 
the house? 
 
A: I don't know if that was my first move or not. I don't know if we 
went to the kitchen or if they sat me down at the bar area, but, 
yeah, I was at the bar area at some point. 
 
Q: Fuhrman was behind you, was he not, at that point? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: At what point? 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: When you went into the house. 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Let me read to you from your testimony of March 22, 1995, 
page 19946. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: One second. Mr. Baker. 19946? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What line? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: 1. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: "Question: When you entered the 
house, did you enter before or after Detective Fuhrman? "Answer: 
I think it was before. "Question: Okay. You were ahead of him? 
"Answer: I was ahead of him. "Question: And when you entered 
the house, what area did you go to? "Answer: I--when you go into 
that door, there is a bar area. I went into the bar area. "You went 
unto the bar area? "Answer: Yes. "Question: And what did you do 
at the bar area? "Answer: They asked me to have a seat there. 
"Question: Detective Fuhrman? 
 
"Answer: I believe so. 
 
"Question: So you sat in the bar area, did you? 
 
"Answer: Yes. 
 
"Question: Then what happened? 
 
"Answer: Well, I sat at one of the stools at the bar, and then 
Detective Vannatter sat next to me. "Answer" -- or "Question" -- 
pardon me--"Okay. Now, after you sat down in the bar area, where 
did Detective Fuhrman go? Did he stay n with you? 
 
"Answer: No. 
 
"Question: Did he leave? 
 
"Answer: He wasn't in the room with me. 
 
"Question: Okay, Did he leave after you sat at the bar? 
 
"Answer: Yeah, he was in the room, so he left." Now, is that your 
best recollection as to what happened after you got inside the door? 
 
A: Yeah. I was in the kitchen area, too. I can't give you exact 
times, but I know I sat down with Vannatter at that--what that said. 
what you just read-- 
 
Q: All right. 
 
A: --and that did happen. I know at one point they wanted to see if 
there were keys to the Bronco, so I don't know if that happened 
before or after, 
 
But I did sit at the bar with Vannatter and he questioned me. 
 
Q: All right. And at that point in time did you see where Fuhrman 
went 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How long was Fuhrman gone, that is, from when you were 
seated next to Vannatter asking him questions until you next saw 
Vannatter. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I am going to object to what you mean 
by Fuhrman is "gone." You mean how long was Fuhrman out of 
this witness' purview? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I'll stick with my question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I object to it. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I can't answer. I don't know. If I'm sitting in the 
bar, I don't know who's in the I kitchen area. I don't know I didn't 
know their names at that time, so 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: How long was it before you saw 
Fuhrman again after you were sitting at the bar with Vannatter? 
 
A: I don't know. I don't know the time. 
 
Q: Do you have any recollection at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Now-- 
 
A: I think I did see him again, but I don't know, I can't tell you 
time-wise . 
 
Q: Now, when you sat down at the bar with Vannatter, that was the 
first time you had had any conversation at all with Vannatter. Is 
that correct? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: And when you talked to Vannatter, did he I have a notepad? 
 
A: I think so. 
 
Q: Was there any recording device on, tape recording or video 
recording? 
 
A: I don't think so, no. 
 
Q: By the way, with your seven to ten hours of meetings with Mr. 
Petrocelli, were those videotaped? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: There was no recording made of those whatsoever, huh? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Okay. In terms of your conversation with Vannatter, tell me 
everything that you recall him asking you and you telling him. 
 
A: Boy. I think we talked about if I knew Nicole, if--my events of 
the night, what all happened, to go over the events of the night, 
mentioning the noises behind the bed. I think he asked me what I 
did there, if I worked there on the -- Rockingham, if I knew when 
O.J. was coming back, I think. I think questions about O.J., the 
flight. I think it was -- whatever routines they--questioning, it was -
-I can't remember exactly what they were . 
 
Q: Do you recall telling Vannatter that O.J Simpson had a flight. 
and he had left Los Angeles the night previously. 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: And did you tell him that he had been on American Airlines and 
he was going from LAX to Chicago? 
 
A: I think I did. 
 
Q: And did you tell him he was going to play in a Hertz 
tournament on Monday? 
 
A: I think I just said he had a Hertz thing going on. 
 
Q: All right. And with regards to your telling Vannatter of the 
events of the night, did you tell Vannatter the events really of the 
day of June 12th, 1994, the conversations you had had with Mr. 
Simpson? 
 
A: I don't know if I got into that detail. I don't know. 
 
Q: All right. You certainly told him about the trip that you had 
with Mr. Simpson to McDonald's, did you not? 
 
A: I think so. yeah. I think I was talking about the last--the night, 
what happened on that night. 
 
Q: And he also asked you about Mr. Simpson's mood on the 
evening of the 12th didn't he? 
 
A: He could have. He could have. 
 
Q: You indicated to Mr. Vannatter that Mr. Simpson was not 
anxious, was not depressed, was in a usual mood, did you not? 
 
A: I think so. 
 
Q: And you said the only thing that you noticed about Mr. 
Simpson the evening of June 12th 1994 was the fact that he was 
tired. Isn't that true? 
 
A: I think so, saying that he was tired. I don't know if they asked 
me if he had a cut on his hand or not, if I noticed cut. It could have 
been. I don't know for sure. 
 
Q: Okay. Well, certainly you hadn't seen a cut on his hand, had 
you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: All right. And in terms of the conversation with Mr. Vannatter, 
do you know approximately how long that took? 
 
A: Sitting with Vannatter, maybe 15, 20 minutes. I can't be specific 
exactly on the time. 
 
Q: All right. Now. you had testified earlier this morning that after 
you were awoken I approximately 5: 30 on the 13th, and we went 
through what was accomplished before you went inside the house, 
you said that took somewhat-- something under an hour. Do you 
recall that testimony? 
 
A: I think so. 
 
Q: Do you have an estimate as to how long it took before you were 
in the main house following your being awoken at approximately 
5:30? 
 
A: I don't. I don't have an estimate. 
 
Q: More than 30 minutes? 
 
A: It could have been. 
 
Q: All right. 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: When was the next time after you were awoken at 
approximately 5:30 in the morning you have a clear recollection of 
what time it was on June 13th, 1994 in the morning? 
 
A: Of what time it was, my recollection of my-- 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: The kids came over, Sydney and Justin. It might have been like 
7:15 the kids came by, I think. 
 
Q: All right. 
 
A: I can't be specific on time, I just know the events that happened. 
 
Q: All right. Now, after you sat down with Detective Vannatter and 
you went through the events that you've related to us, what did you 
then do, Mr. Kaelin? 
 
A: I think I was in the kitchen area, and I might have been with 
Justin and Sydney and kind of watching them, and also they asked 
if there were an extra set of keys to the Bronco, and I remember 
helping look for those. 
 
Q: All right. So we've gone through the events in your house 
outside the --moving from your bungalow into the main house, the 
interview with Vannatter, and the next thing you remember is that 
at approximately 7: 15 you're in the kitchen with Justin and 
Sydney. True? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: All right. Is there anything between 5:30 and 7:30 that you 
haven't told us about this morning in your deposition? 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection to the form of the question. Vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: That I can remember. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He answered your questions. 
 
THE WITNESS: At one point I know Arnelle got on the phone. I 
don't know what time that was, I thought I was in the bar area 
when I heard her crying. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: And was that before you had gone 
to the kitchen area with Justin and Sydney? 
 
A: I think it was. I think it was. 
 
Q: And before you were in the kitchen area, had Detective 
Vannatter, Phillips, Lange or Fuhrman told you that Nicole had 
been murdered? 
 
A: I don't think it was until Arnelle was screaming. 
 
Q: And were you still at the bar area when Arnelle was screaming? 
 
A: I think so. I'm pretty sure. 
 
Q: Now who--I take it when she started screaming, you turned 
around and looked at her, did you not? 
 
A: No. She was in the kitchen. I was at the bar area still. 
 
Q: All right. She wasn't in the-- 
 
A: I thought she came--I can't get it straight. I think she came unto 
the bar area and was crying, and that's when they said. I believe. 
that Nicole had been murdered. 
 
Q: All right. Now, prior to that time when you walked into the 
main house with the detectives, had you seen where Arnelle had 
gone? 
 
A: I think she went to the kitchen. 
 
Q: And to the best of your recollection, she remained in the kitchen 
till she came out when she was crying? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: Now, did Detective Fuhrman when he left your room take a 
boot or more than one boot or any of your clothing? 
 
A: Not that I saw, no. 
 
Q: Did any detective take any of your personal belongings when 
they left your room when you went to the main house? 
 
A: I didn't see that, no. 
 
Q: All right. Now, after your discussion with Vannatter and you 
went into the kitchen, did you ever again see all of the four 
detectives together? 
 
A: I think I saw them all in the kitchen while they were looking for 
Bronco keys. I thought all four were together then. 
 
Q: And that would have been approximately? 
 
A: About that. I think. 
 
Q: And did they ever find any Bronco keys? 
 
A: Not that I'm aware of, because I --they asked me to leave the 
street (sic) then. They escorted me to the street then. 
 
Q: Who is the mythical "they"? Which detective escorted you to 
the street? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Or detectives. 
 
THE WITNESS: I think it was detectives. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: All right. 
 
A: I think it was Lange and Vannatter. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you see Fuhrman around at that point in time? 
 
A: Not that I remember. 
 
Q: And when you were escorted to the street, do you know 
approximately what time that was? 
 
A: Approximately I think about 7:30. 
 
Q: Now, after you were escorted to the street, did you get back to 
the house at any time prior to the evening of June 13th, 1994? 
 
A: No . When I was escorted, that was it, I'm pretty sure. I didn't 
come back. 
 
Q: Now, why did they tell you they wanted you to go to the police 
station? 
 
A: They didn't really say. They just told me to wait on the street 
and-- 
 
Q: Did they tell you that you were a suspect to the murder? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did they ask you if you wanted to go to the police station? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did they tell you they were going to charge you with any 
crime? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did they tell you you had to go to the police station? 
 
A: No. I think they said they were going to do an interview there. 
That's --I think that was it 
 
Q: They had already done an interview of you in the bar area of 
Mr. Simpson's house, had they not? 
 
A: They talked to me there. 
 
Q: Did they indicate to you that they were going to tape-record an 
inter- view? 
 
A: They didn't indicate that, no. 
 
Q: Before you left to go to the police station, did they indicate to 
you that you can have a lawyer present for the interview? 
 
A: No . 
 
Q: Did they read you any Miranda rights or any rights that you had 
as a human being? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did they tell you that you had the right to have a lawyer present 
before Vannatter interviewed you at the bar area? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Fuhrman ever indicate to you, or Phillips, while you were 
still in your bungalow that you had the right to have a lawyer 
present before you answered any questions? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did they ever tell you you had a right to remain silent at any 
time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So none of the four detectives from the time you were woken up 
until after you had been deposited back to Mr. Simpson -- or to 
Grant Cramer's house on the 13th ever told you you had a right to 
remain silent did they? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: I guess I put the question in the wrong phraseology. You were 
never informed of your right to remain silent at any time by the 
Los Angeles Police Department on June 13th, 1994. Correct? 
 
A: As far as I can remember, correct. 
 
Q: All right. Now, between the time that you left your bungalow 
and you were escorted to the street, the time period of 
approximately two hours, did any police officer ask you to give 
them a tour of the house? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did they point out to you any blood spots or what they 
purported to be blood spots on the morning of June 13th, 1994? 
 
A: On the escort out when I was walking out, they said. "Watch 
out for the blood." 
 
Q: All right. And where did they point to the blood when they 
escorted you out? 
 
A: It was by the foyer, the front door entrance, walking out. 
 
Q: All right. And how far was it from the door to the area they 
showed you where there were blood spots? 
 
A: Well, what happened when I was walking, they said, "Watch 
the blood spots," so I went "Huh," looked down and there was 
drops. So there were like drops of blood. 
 
Q: All right. And could you tell from your vantage point that there 
were drops of blood? 
 
A: Well, I mean, I didn't test it or anything. I mean, it looked like it 
was drops of something. 
 
Q: How many? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Less than five? More than twenty? 
 
A: Well, I saw--I don't know the number, I saw--I can't give a 
number. Three, four, just went "Oh. " and I took my step and I 
went outside. 
 
Q: All right. Were there quite a few or were there not quite a few? 
Is three or four quite a few? 
 
A: I watched my step-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You don't have to characterize it. He told 
you-- 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Pardon? 
 
A: I was watching my step, so I 
 
Q: Okay. And that's where you saw the blood, and that was the 
only place you saw the blood, was in the foyer? 
 
A: I thought there was blood, and I thought there might have been 
blood outside, too. I don't know exactly what point I saw the blood 
outside. 
 
Q: Well, so that I'm clear on this, and I know that's not the test-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: We agree on that. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: --when you left the kitchen area to 
go out to the street and wait to be escorted to the police station-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --you went out the kitchen door. Correct? 
 
A: The front door. Not the nook door, the-- 
 
Q: Right. You went out the kitchen. into the foyer-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --and out the front door. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: All right. And when you did that, you went out one occasion, 
walked out through the entrance where the benches are, onto the 
driveway and out to the street. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you made one trip after you left the kitchen area on 6-13, 
1994. True? In other words. you didn't walk back and forth in that 
area at all, did you? 
 
A: No. No. No. 
 
Q: And the only time that the police anyone in the police 
department directed you to the blood was when you were exiting 
from the kitchen out to the foyer and then out to the entrance. 
Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: All right. Now, after you got through the front door, did 
anybody tell you there was more blood spots? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Who told you there was blood spots when you were going out 
to the foyer? 
 
A: Well, I was walking when they said. "Watch the blood spots." 
So I thought I noticed them, and then I thought I noticed one 
outside. too. 
 
Q: Who is the mythical "they," though? Which detective? 
 
A: I think it was Vannatter and Lange. 
 
Q: Okay. You think both of them told you? 
 
A: Well, I thought that both walked with me, but I thought only 
Vannatter was the one talking. I--okay. 
 
Q: All right. And you believe you saw one blood drop in the 
entrance. Correct? 
 
A: On the outside? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: I thought so. 
 
Q: All right. And do you have a recollection as to approximately 
how far out the front door that was? 
 
A: I thought it was almost right out of the front door. 
 
Q: Right out within six inches? 
 
A: No. By a--two feet. 
 
Q: All right. And was it as you -- Strike that. Did they have any 
markings on the blood drops in the foyer? 
 
A: I don't know. I don't know if they did or not. 
 
Q: Did they have any markings, like pieces of tape, to direct your 
attention to it, or did you just look down and see a spot that you 
associated with their remark that "Look out for the blood spots"? 
 
A: I thought there was a marking outside. In my memory, I thought 
there was a tape. 
 
Q: You didn't see any tapes in the foyer when you exited. Correct? 
 
A: I don't think so, no. 
 
Q: All right. Now, that's an area you--Strike that. The blood spot 
that you saw approximately two feet out the entrance. how big was 
it? 
 
A: In my mind, I think it was like a nickel. 
 
Q: Okay. And did you say anything about the blood spot that you 
believed you saw outside of the entrance to the police? 
 
A: No, I didn't talk--I was "Ah, ah, ah." and then walked out. 
 
Q: And when you walked out, you had both Vannatter and Lange 
with you? 
 
A: I believe they walked me to the doorway, and then I walked 
outside the gate, and there was police outside. 
 
Q: Now, where was Arnelle when you were walking outside? 
 
A: I think in the kitchen. I don't know for sure. 
 
Q: Now, in your discussion with Detective Vannatter, had you said 
anything about the whereabouts of Arnelle? 
 
A: I think I said that "I heard footsteps when I was trying to go to 
bed last night, and I figured that was her that I heard." 
 
Q: So you had associated to the police the footsteps that you heard 
at 1:30 with Arnelle coming home. Correct? 
 
A: Right, but I did not know her whereabouts. 
 
Q: And did you see who was interrogating, if anybody was 
interrogating, Arnelle at anytime between 5:30 and 7:30? 
 
A: I didn't see it, no, but I imagine the other two with her. 
 
Q: And when you say "the other two," who was with you? 
 
A: Well, if Lange and Vannatter were walking me out, I imagine 
the other two were with Arnelle. I didn't see it, though. 
 
Q: All right. Now. Vannatter as with you at the bar. 
 
A: At the bar. 
 
Q: And when you went into the kitchen area, was Phillips in there? 
 
A: I don't know. When I was with Vannatter, I was at the bar, 
facing the bar. He was there, and I thought someone was behind 
me at one point and came back in and out, but I don t know who it 
was behind, but I think he motioned, because the stools could 
move (Indicating). 
 
Q: And when you say somebody had gone "in and out," there is the 
door that goes down to your bungalow. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Directly in the door that would have been behind you where 
you were sitting at the bar. 
 
A: No. Into the kitchen. From the kitchen, back to the kitchen. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, did you hear anybody go in and out the door 
behind you during the time that you were being interviewed by 
Vannatter? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did you indicate to Vannatter or Fuhrman about how to get 
unto your house through the area where the pool table is? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when did you do that? Did you do that early in the 
evening? 
 
A: I think when Fuhrman first came in, I think I said, "That's a 
door that can go into the house," I believe I told him. 
 
Q: All right. And that door was essentially a door that could be 
locked from the pool room so that you couldn't get in from the 
office. Isn't that true? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And so all Fuhrman would have had to do if he'd have wanted 
to use that was to go by the pool table, go down the steps, unlock 
the door, and he's in the office. Correct? 
 
A: Yeah. I don't know if he did or not. I don't remember. 
 
Q: Now, the--you were then escorted down to the police station 
and a statement was taken. Correct? 
 
A: I was in a room with two detectives, two different guys at a 
certain point. I waited and waited and waited. A statement-- they 
were taking notes. 
 
Q: Did they at any time turn on a tape recorder? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did they at any time indicate to you either of those detectives, 
that you were a suspect in Nicole's murder? 
 
A: No, 
 
Q: Now. how long were you at LAPD? 
 
A: I was at the one I believe in Santa Monica I don t know the 
address, and I was there I think from about 8:00 to 4:00. 
 
Q: That s the one on Purdue and Santa Monica Boulevard? 
 
A: I don't know the address. 
 
Q: You didn't go downtown. You were at the one up here, were 
you not? 
 
A: Right. I didn't go downtown. 
 
Q: Do you remember the name of the people who interviewed you? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Who was it? 
 
A: It was Carr and Tippin. 
 
Q: Did you have a recollection of asking them why you were there 
for eight hours? 
 
A: Well, it wasn't so much they were ever around. I was in a room, 
and then they had questioned me, and then they would leave, and it 
seemed like an hour. and come back. 
 
Q: And after you-- 
 
A: But--oh, I'm sorry. But I was at the police station even before 
they arrived it seemed like two or three hours that I was just in a 
room like this, in the conference room with other police officers. 
 
Q: Okay. What time. approximately, did you arrive at the police 
station? 
 
A: I guess between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m. 
 
Q: All right. And when you were in a room. you say 'a room like 
this" with a lot of police officers-- 
 
A: Not a lot. 
 
Q: How many? 
 
A: Well, they had to have one with me, they said, and that was one 
with me, and this seemed like it was their break room. So they 
came in and out, but at times there was probably three and myself 
at the most. 
 
Q: Who staved with you? 
 
A: An officer. 
 
Q: You don't know his name? 
 
A: No. It was a female, Lisa Brickhouse. I remember the name 
Brickhouse . 
 
Q: And did Lisa ask--Brickhouse ask you any questions about your 
where abouts or the events of the previous evening? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When was the first time you started talking to a detective about 
the events of the previous evening? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: At the police station? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: At the police station. Sorry. Thank you. 
 
THE WITNESS: They brought me into a room. It seemed like it 
was two or three hours I waited, I think. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: How long did the interview go 
relative to the events of the previous evening when you were in the 
police station? 
 
A: How did they go? 
 
Q: How long? 
 
A: Well, it would be broken up. They might be in the room with 
me for 20 minutes and then leave. and then come back an hour 
later and do like another 20. 
 
Q: Did they tell you why they were breaking it up into 20 minutes? 
 
A: Oh, no. 
 
Q: Did you notice a change of subject matter when it would be 
broken up after 20 minutes? 
 
A: No. Just questions. 
 
Q: And as I understand your testimony, after you had given your 
statement to the police, they took you back to Grant Cramer's 
house because they told you you shouldn't go back to Rockingham. 
Correct? 
 
A: They asked me if I wanted to be dropped off at a place. They 
thought it might be a good idea, because it was a media event. So I 
said "Okay." 
 
Q: You don't have any aversion to media events, do you? 
 
A: Meaning? 
 
Q: Meaning why would you not want to go to a media event? 
 
A: I stay away. You mean--you're making a joke-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He's joking. 
 
THE WITNESS: Okay, he is joking. Okay. 
 
MR. KELLY: You know that Mr. 
 
Baker. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yeah, just hilarious. 
 
Q: Now I want to go back to June 12th, 1994. On June 12th after 
Mr. Simpson got back from the recital you had a conversation with 
him before the events took place where you got in the Bentley and 
went to the McDonald's. Correct? 
 
A: Before that, correct. 
 
Q: And you had had conversation with O.J., earlier in the 
afternoon, had you not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And the conversation you had with him earlier in the afternoon 
commenced at approximately 3:00 o'clock. Isn't that true? 
 
A: Yeah. Like I remember certain conversations. Time, I can't pin 
down a time, but yeah, we had conversations that afternoon. 
 
Q: Pre-recital you had conversations. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And those conversations, you talked about the Knicks-Rocket 
game that was on television? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: This is the earlier conversation? Talking 
about-- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Pre-recital. 
 
THE WITNESS: Pre-recital. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Pre-recital. Okay. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: And you mentioned the name, I 
believe, of [Name Deleted], did you not, at that point in time? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: [Name Deleted]? 
 
THE WITNESS: [Name Deleted]. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: I'm sorry. 
 
A: She came up in our conversation, yes. 
 
Q: And you had suggested to O.J. that this would be a girl that he 
might be interested in because he used her brains to forward her 
career and not just her sex appeal, words to that effect. Isn't that 
true? 
 
A: He said that, yes. 
 
Q: And this was a friend of yours, was it not? 
 
A: Somewhat, yes. 
 
Q: To your knowledge O.J. Simpson didn't know even the name 
[Name Deleted] before you had brought it up that afternoon, June 
12, 1994. Correct? 
 
A: No. Saturday he knew. 
 
Q: You had brought it up on Saturday in your conversation with 
him. Correct? 
 
A: [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: All right. And you thought that she was a was a pretty smart 
woman, did you not? 
 
A: Somewhat. 
 
Q: And she had a career outside of basically using her sex appeal 
to attract a man. Isn't that true? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that's what you told Mr. Simpson. Isn't that correct? 
 
A: No. I didn't say that. 
 
Q: Was the conversation something that--, about she has brains in 
addition to being an attractive woman? 
 
A: She was a smart girl. She told me she wanted to be an 
entrepreneur. 
 
Q: She was running her own business at the time, was she not? 
 
A: I don't know what that business was. 
 
Q: Okay. In any event, you had that conversation on the 11th and 
the 12th, did you not-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --about Tracy Ardell? 
 
A: [Name Deleted], yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: [Name Deleted]. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: [Name Deleted]. I'll get it right Ardel is 
where I bought my boat. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Now, when we were on the 12th pre-recital. 
you just mentioned the 11th as well. Is that right? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yeah. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: It's a Petrocelli technique. I think. 
 
Q: Now - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Learned it from you. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yeah, right. 
 
Q: Now, in any event, did you suggest that O.J. should call [Name 
Deleted] on the 11th? 
 
A: I don't know who suggested it, 
 
But there was a call made. I think that could have been me. 
 
Q: When was that call made to the best of your recollection? 
 
A: On the Saturday. 
 
Q: All right. And did her name come up again on--that is, [Name 
Deleted] 's name again come up after the recital? 
 
A: After the recital? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: I don't know if it came up after recital. I'm not sure you were 
talking to O.J. Simpson before you went and got in the jacuzzi, and 
you were talking about [Name Deleted], and he said that he had 
talked to her and that she was a smart person? 
 
A: I don't remember the exact time. I know they had talked. Their 
conversation. I don't know exactly what was said. 
 
Q: Well, regardless of what their conversation was, he suggested to 
you that he thought she was a smart woman. Isn't that correct? 
 
A: I don't remember. He could have, 
 
But I don't remember him saying it. 
 
Q: All right. Isn't it true, Mr. Kaelin, that what happened was that 
after the recital Mr. Simpson suggested that [Name Deleted] could 
use her brains to further her career, not just sex appeal? 
 
A: That's possible. 
 
Q: And isn't it also true that it's in that conversation and the context 
of that conversation that Mr. Simpson discussed the fact that 
Nicole and her friends dressed in very tight dresses, and he didn't 
know what they were going to do after they became grandmas 
because they didn't have anything but sex appeal to woo men? 
 
A: You're saying he said that to her or to me? 
 
Q: The context-- let me rephrase the question. Was it not in the 
context of talking to [Name Deleted] and her brains that Mr. 
Simpson brought up the fact that Nicole and her friends used sex 
appeal to attract men, and he didn't know what they were going to 
do after they became grandmas? 
 
A: I don't remember--I remember that statement about being 
grandmas, but I don't remember it involving [Name Deleted], to 
the best of my recollection. 
 
Q: Now, when Mr. Simpson was talking about--Well, strike that. 
Was it your impression that Nicole had worn something tight to the 
recital? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you ever see the pictures of Mr. Simpson and Nicole and 
others at the recital? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And is it your collection she was in a tight dress at that point in 
time? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: All right. And your recollection of the evening conversation 
was also that the tight dress conversation occurred about Nicole's 
apparel at the recital. True ? 
 
A: About the recital, it happened-- you're right. The conversation 
was after the recital, correct. 
 
Q: Now, Mr. Simpson wasn't agitated or upset or irritated when he 
was, regardless of the reason, speaking about Nicole wearing a 
tight dress, was he? 
 
A: Well, it was--there was--he was annoyed, but I thought the 
annoyance came more from the Sydney statement, but they were 
all, you know, in parallel to each other. It was-- they followed each 
other, the statement. 
 
Q: So let me see if I have this correct 
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: He was talking about Sydney and then tight dresses and Nicole? 
 
A: It was about Nicole playing hard- 
 
Ball, not letting O.J. see the kids, and it was, "She's playing 
hardball with me . These are my kids, too . " And then it was into 
the statement of, "And what are they wearing these dresses--I 
mean, what, are they gonna be grandmas when they wear these 
dresses? It's a recital. They're wearing something for a club." 
 
Q: Well, when he asked about demeanor-- Strike that. Okay. When 
he asked about Sydney --or you asked--Strike that again. I'll start 
from scratch here. He gives me something. I'm reading. My alleged 
mind is going sideways. When you asked him about the recital in 
your conversation after the recital. can you describe his demeanor? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: At what point in the conversation? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: When he's asking about Sydney. 
 
THE WITNESS: About Sydney-- 
 
MR. BREWER: You just did. It's asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: Oh, it was about Sydney. I asked how Sydney 
was, and he had said, "Oh, she was great," and then it 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: He was very happy when he was 
discussing Sydney, was he not? 
 
A: Yes. The question that you asked me, was he happy with 
Sydney. Yes. I thought that brought him on being angry about not 
being able to have her. 
 
Q: Now, overall Mr. Simpson's demeanor on the evening of the 
12th was normal, was it not? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It's vague and ambiguous. He has described 
specifically what his demeanor was in response to particular 
comments. I object on the grounds it's vague and ambiguous and 
overbroad. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: I'm sorry. The question was about the evening of 
the 12th. Do you have a particular time? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He said "overall." I don't know what that 
means. 
 
 THE WITNESS: There were shifts. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: There were shifts in his demeanor 
on the evening of-- 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Just let me finish. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Hold on. One at a time here. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: It's your testimony that there were 
shifts in his demeanor after he got back on June 12th around 7:00 
o'clock from the recital until he left at approximately 11:00. 
Correct? 
 
A: Well, yeah. If the phone-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me, Mr. 
 
Baker. He didn't say anything about seeing Mr. Simpson until 
11:00 o'clock. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: The tape's out. We've got to take a break.

EXAMINATION (Resumed) 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Mr. Kaelin, now, when you went 
to Mr. Simpson's office on the 14th and gave the statement where 
Mr. Shapiro and Mr. Taft were present--do you recall that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you were asked, were you not, about Mr. Simpson's mood 
when he had talked about Sydney and the recital. Correct? 
 
A: I believe so. yes. 
 
Q: And you indicated at that time that he wasn't angry. True? 
 
A: Yeah, I think it was the word "angry.' 
 
Q: And that was true at the time you said it, your recollection? 
 
A: My definition of angry was true, yes. 
 
Q: What's your definition of angry? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am objecting as to the time reference in 
your question. You can answer. 
 
THE WITNESS: I picture angry as someone going berserk and 
shouting and yelling. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: And so a lesser degree of being 
upset would be agitated, in your own vernacular? 
 
A: Annoyed. Annoyed. 
 
Q: And he wasn't agitated at the time you were talking about 
Nicole and hard-balling it with Sydney? 
 
A: It was annoyed, not agitated. 
 
Q: Now, in terms of your movements on the night of June 12th, as 
I understand it, after you and O.J. were in his den and you had been 
watching television -- this is post-recital. You were in his den 
watching television. Is that right? 
 
A: This is on the Sunday? 
 
Q: Sunday after the recital. 
 
A: No. I was in the nook area. 
 
Q: All right, in the nook area. And you were in the nook area 
approximately how long? 
 
A: It was different events of that day. It wasn't a set sitting. After 
that statement, the Sydney and Nicole statement, I'm pretty sure it 
made me go into the jacuzzi. That was my prompting to go, I didn't 
go back in there. But TV I think was on during that period in the 
afternoon. 
 
Q: All night. Now, you had asked him for the first time since you 
had lived there to use the jacuzzi. Isn't that 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And was it the first time you had sat in -I the nook and watched 
television on June 12th, 1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: On the previous day, June 11th had you sat in the nook or the 
den when you were in the main house. 
 
A: The den. 
 
Q: All right. And earlier that day when you were watching the 
Knick-Rockets game, you were also in the den, were you not? 
 
A: I believe I was in my room watching that game. 
 
Q: When you talked to Mr. Simpson pre-recital between 3:00 and 
5:00 o'clock on June 12th, 1995, were you in the den or were you 
in the nook. 
 
A: I think all conversations were in the nook that day. 
 
Q: All right. Now, you then went out. Left the nook. Did you go 
out to the driveway after you had requested to use the jacuzzi? 
 
A: I don't remember if I went through that or through the bar area. I 
don t remember. 
 
Q: In any event, you had to change clothes because you didn't have 
a bathing suit on? 
 
A: No. I wore my--the shorts that I had from basketball. 
 
Q: So you went from the nook area into the jacuzzi. Didn't go into 
your room? 
 
A: I might have gone into my room, 
 
Because I thought I got a towel. 
 
Q: Okay. How long were you in the jacuzzi? 
 
A: Probably a half hour from--it was becoming nightfall. 
 
Q: When you entered the jacuzzi it was light out, and then it started 
into nightfall. Is that it? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And then you got out of the jacuzzi, and the next time you saw 
Mr. Simpson was when he came at the perch area, as you've called 
it, above your door and said, "Kato, you didn't turn off the 
blowers"? 
 
A: Yeah, it was at the door. The screen door. 
 
Q: He had come down the steps and 
 
A: Yeah. it was down. 
 
Q: Okay. Come down the steps and was at the screen door when 
you talked to him about turning off the blower? 
 
A: Yeah. I don't know if he had come down the steps or was 
coming from the walkway, but he was at my doorway. 
 
Q: All right. And, you had the dialogue where he said you hadn't 
turned off the blower, and you apologized, and he said, "Next time 
just turn off the blower." Isn't that right? 
 
A: The jacuzzi jets, correct. 
 
Q: And after that he went back up the stairs? 
 
A: I--I think so. I don't know. I went back in my room. 
 
Q: How long was it before he was back at your door asking to 
borrow $5? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's not what he testified to. Object on that 
basis. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know minutes, the time-wise, but it 
seemed like it happened somewhat soon. I don't know the exact 
minutes, though. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: All right. But obviously you don't 
have a-- 
 
A: It was during a phone call. 
 
Q: Who were you on the phone with at that time? 
 
A: Well, I made two. I was either on the phone with Tom O'Brian 
or possibly Susan Wilkinsen. I don't know which one exactly. 
 
Q: And were you also--during that period of time did you talk to 
Rachel Ferrara at that time? 
 
A: I don't think I talked to Rachel yet. 
 
Q: All right. Now. did you--was it more than a half hour elapsed 
between the time you saw Mr. Simpson at the door and the time 
Mr. Simpson came back and asked you to borrow -- asked to 
borrow some money from you? 
 
A: I don't think so. I can't be specific on time, but I don't think it 
was. 
 
Q: Now, at that point in time he asked you for $5. Is that correct? 
 
A: This is the second trip? 
 
Q: After he had asked you to remember to turn off the blowers next 
time, or the jets. 
 
A: Right, on the second trip, yes, he asked me for $5. 
 
Q: When he asked for $5, was he standing on the perch. or was he 
down at the front door of your bedroom? 
 
A: I think he was at the front door of my bedroom. 
 
Q: And you were on the phone at that time. True? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you hang up the phone and go talk to Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: I think I got off the phone and went to the door, and then when 
he asked me what he wanted, I think I got on the phone and said 
that I'd call back. I believe. 
 
Q: Okay. After you had given him the $5, what next occurred that 
you recall relative to Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: After giving him the money? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: I believe that's when he said he was going to get something to 
eat, and that's when I invited myself. 
 
Q: Okay. So you gave him a S20 bill. Is that true? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And he said he was going to go to McDonald's or go get 
something to eat, whether or not he said it was McDonald's. True? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: Now, you then said. "May I go along with you?" Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, you didn't have any problems feeling uncomfortable 
about asking Mr. Simpson if you could go along with him to 
McDonald's, I take it. True? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: And that was the first time you had ever asked him if you could 
go to McDonald's with him. Isn't that correct? 
 
A: Well, to go out to get something to eat, yeah. 
 
Q: And you had lived there a total of just a little over five months 
at that time, five and a half months? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: All right. So basically in the five and a half months you lived 
there, every time you did something with Mr. Simpson was a first, 
wasn't it? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Well, it was the first time you 
were in his den or the first time you went to ride in the Bentley or 
the first time you did anything. Right? 
 
A: No. I was in the Bentley at the Jenners' party before. 
 
Q: Okay. So you have one previous occasion being in the Bentley. 
Right; 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, in terms of after you had given him the $20 and 
asked if you could go with him to get something to eat, did you go 
through the house to get to the car? 
 
A: Yes, by the bar area. 
 
Q: And you went through the same door that you went through the 
next morning to get unto the house. Correct? 
 
A: Went through the nook door. Correct. 
 
Q: The nook door--we're on the other end of the house. terms of 
after you were down here at your area where-- 
 
A: Right here (Indicating). 
 
Q: --and you went up the stairs, did you go in the door that goes 
through the den? 
 
A: Yes, this door (Indicating). 
 
Q: Okay. And then went straight out through the nook area. Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Okay. There were lights on at that time in the downstairs? 
 
A: I believe so. I think there was--I don't know if the bar area was 
lit or not. The nook might have been. I don't remember if it was lit 
up or not. 
 
Q: Do you have any recollection of Mr. Simpson turning off any 
lights? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Simpson have his keys with him? Did you walk 
straight out the nook area, out onto the driveway and get into the 
Bentley? 
 
A: I believe he had his keys with him. 
 
Q: And it was the first time you had been in the front seat of the 
Bentley. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: First time you had been in the right front seat of the Bentley. 
Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when you got into the Bentley. it was dark, was it not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you drove out the gate on Rockingham. True? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you did not check to see if there was a Bronco to your 
right. You just never looked. Isn't that true? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Compound. 
 
THE WITNESS: I probably would have looked to there. I don't 
remember seeing a Bronco. but I would have given a check. I 
believe. checking traffic. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Okay. Did you ever testify that 
you didn't look to see if there were any cars parked on Rockingham 
in any of the testimony that you've given in this case? 
 
A: I could have. If it's in there. I could have said, "I don't 
remember for sure." 
 
Q: You wouldn't have said, as you sit here now, you know because 
you know you may have checked traffic --you wouldn't have said. 
"I didn't look to see if there were any cars parked on Rockingham." 
That wouldn't have been your testimony, would it? 
 
A: Right now I don't remember if it is. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The question is vague. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Now. had you left the house at all 
in your car since you had come in from playing basketball that 
afternoon? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: And your car was a Nissan 300 ZX, or whatever it's called? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: All right. And that was parked on the Ashford side? 
 
A: On the Ashford side, correct. 
 
Q: Which side of the street was it parked on? Do you have a 
recollection? 
 
A: It was parked on--can I show you? 
 
Q: Sure. 
 
A: Right there(Indicating). 
 
Q: Across the street from Mr. Simpson's property? 
 
A: Yeah. It was on the street. It was 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Same side of the street. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, it was right-- 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Was it parked with its right side 
next to Mr. Simpson's property or the property across the street? 
 
A: It was next to Simpson's property. 
 
Q: Which way was it facing? 
 
A: Headlights were facing in the east direction. 
 
Q: Down towards Bristol Circle? 
 
A: If that's the name of the street, yes. That way (Indicating). 
 
Q: Okay. And. approximately, can you put a ''300" on there where 
the car was parked? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: This is Exhibit 85. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yes. Thank you. 
 
(witness complies.) 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Okay. Now, as I understand it, 
you could reach through and take the right gate of the Ashford gate 
off of the hinge, as it were, and then get in the property that way, 
could you not? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: All right. Let me just go back and see if I can refresh your 
recollection, to page 19843 of your testimony on March 22nd, 
1995. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: One second. What lines? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: 26 through line I of the following page. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Quote. "As you exited the 
Rockingham gate, did you look to see whether there were any other 
cars parked on the curb?" 
 
"Answer: No, I didn't look." Does that refresh your recollection at 
all that you didn't even check to see if the bronco was on 
Rockingham? 
 
A: It refreshes the recollection hearing it, but I'm thinking I would 
always look, anyways, to see if a car was coming, so I think I 
would have looked. 
 
Q: The fact that you said you didn't look is irrelevant because you 
think you would have looked. Right? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Argumentative. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Stipulated. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: First time ever. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Now, when you entered after your 
basketball game the property, did you go through the gate, that is, 
the Ashford gate, the one that you can disengage, if you will? 
 
A: Probably did. 
 
Q: And you normally would go through that gate and then go down 
the path that goes around the north side of the house. Correct? 
 
A: The path here (Indicating). If I was coming in? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Yeah. I normally would go here to my room (Indicating). 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Could you tell us again? 
 
THE WITNESS: Oh would normally go through the gate and 
normally go right here into my room, follow the path (Indicating). 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Okay. Why don't you just draw in 
red-- I've given you a red pen--just draw in red on Exhibit 85 your 
normal path to get to your house--to your bungalow, rather. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Start it from the gate. 
 
(Witness complies.) 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Okay. Now, as I understand it, 
then, you hadn't looked at your car until sometime on the 13th after 
you arrived after your basketball game on the 12th? 
 
A: I hadn't looked at my car since-- 
 
Q: I'll be happy to rephrase it. 
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: You got back from the basketball game on the 12th 
approximately sometime in the afternoon, around 3:00? 
 
A: I don't know the time, but. yeah. I played basketball. I don't 
know what time I exactly got in. I think it was later than that, but I 
can't be exact on time . 
 
Q: In any event, you parked it where we have the "300" written on 
Exhibit 85. Correct? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Yes? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you see that car at any time between the time that you 
parked it there on the 12th and sometime on the 14th? 
 
A: I mean, I think I did. I imagine, yes. 
 
Q: Did you go out the Ashford side or the Rockingham side when 
the police escorted you out of Mr. Simpson's property the morning 
of the 13th? 
 
A: I went out this side right here (Indicating) where the police took 
me out. 
 
Q: The Ashford side? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you wait there on the Ashford side? 
 
A: Yes, I waited right here (Indicating). 
 
Q: Across the street from Mr. Simpson's property? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you have any recollection of seeing your car there? 
 
A: Yes. I saw my car there. 
 
Q: All right. And from where you were when you were waiting for 
the police, did you have a view of the Bronco on Rockingham? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you saw the Bronco on Rockingham at that time? 
 
A: From this street (Indicating)? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Yes. I did. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Would you make a notation where you were 
standing when you saw the Bronco on Rockingham? 
 
THE WITNESS: Okay. Well, this street was--I was--there's a 
police car here (Indicating), so I could walk back and forth on this. 
I wasn't just standing still. I could walk back and forth. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: All right. Just put an arrow about 
the parameters of where you were walking. 
 
(Witness complies.) 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: And there 's police cars. I was talking to them. 
 
Q: Okay. Fair enough. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It's got arrows on either end. Okay. Thank 
you. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Now I want to go back, if I may, 
for a moment. You recall getting in the Bentley, and you recall 
exiting Rockingham. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you believe that you would have looked to see if there was 
traffic and looked to the right to see if the Bronco was there, see if 
there were any parked cars there. Correct? 
 
A: I think I would have, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And then you drove down Rockingham to 26th Street. Is 
that correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you have any problems getting across Sunset? 
 
A: I don't think so. It goes--in trying to go over the route, it goes 
Sunset, and you go back down Rockingham to San Vicente, to 
26th. 
 
Q: Okay. So you turned right onto Sunset and left back onto 
Rockingham, or do you remember? 
 
A: I think I have to have a map, but it goes down and then the 
street connects, and then you go back. 
 
Q: Okay. And the question was: Did you have any problem getting 
on Sunset? Do you recall or have no recollection? 
 
A: I have no recollection. 
 
Q: Okay. Went over to 26th Street turned left on 26th Street and 
took that all the way down. Is that correct? 
 
A: 26th Street, right, and you cross over San Vicente, correct. 
 
Q: And down to the McDonald's on Santa Monica? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: On Santa Monica do you go left or right off of 26th Street? 
 
A: I believe you go left on Santa Monica, and then it's right away. 
 
Q: And then you went through the drive-through. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you paid for the meal that was purchased? 
 
A: I had a 20. 
 
Q: So that was the second 20 you'd come up with on Mr. 
Simpson's behalf in the last half hour, 45 minutes. Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, he was driving, so he handed the money to the 
person at McDonald's? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did he hand you back the change? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, he started eating his hamburger immediately upon 
getting it. True? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: And it's your testimony that he had completely finished his 
hamburger before he got out of the driveway. Is that right? 
 
A: I think it was just about finished, yes. 
 
Q: And from the time where he got the hamburger to the driveway 
is about 20 feet. Right? 
 
A: I think so. Yes 
 
Q: And as soon as he had handed you your 20 change, he started 
eating the hamburger. Right? 
 
A: I think it was the food came, and then the change came late--
second. I thought he went right to the bag. 
 
But I just remember it was, wow. he wolfed that down. Well, in my 
head I was thinking, because it was like immediate. 
 
Q: Okay. And so he had finished eating before you got out on 
Santa Monica. Right? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And so he didn't eat anything the rest of the way home. 
True? 
 
A: I don't know if he had his drink or not, if there was a drink. 
There might have been a drink. 
 
Q: And did you go home by the same route that you had come? 
 
A: I think so. If I remember. I think we did. 
 
Q: So you went back from Santa Monica, turned right on 26th 
Street. crossed San Vicente and took it to Rockingham. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And took Rockingham to Sunset? 
 
A: Took Rockingham to Sunset. correct, back to Rockingham. 
 
Q: And then went across Sunset and Rockingham down, Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you don't have a recollection of whether you entered the 
Rockingham gate or the Ashford gate, do you? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: On the return from McDonald's? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: On the return. 
 
THE WITNESS: On the return I believe he went through Ashford, 
and the car was parked back in the spot where the car would be 
parked in normally. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What car? 
 
THE WITNESS: The Bentley. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Did you tell--did you testify in the 
Grand Jury proceeding that you did not have a recollection of 
whether you entered Rockingham or Ashford? 
 
A: Well, they asked me that and I said, "I imagine that we went 
through the Ashford gate. It was normal." 
 
Q: All right. Now, the Bentley was usually parked in that cutout 
that we've seen on the Exhibit 85. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And there is shrubbery in next to that to cutout, is there not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that impedes or hinders the door being opened from the 
right side. Correct? 
 
A: Yeah. If it gets too close, you cannot , open it-- 
 
Q: Now-- 
 
A: --if I was boxed in. 
 
Q: Now, did Mr. Simpson let you out before he put the car in that 
little cutout area in the driveway? 
 
A: No. It was parked. 
 
Q: So you drove all the way in and parked before he let you out? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, when you got out, did you tell O.J., "I'm going to eat this 
in my room"? 
 
A: No. I went out of the door of the Bentley and walked towards 
the kitchen nook area, and then I looked behind, thinking that O.J. 
was with me, and then I kinda motioned, no, I'll go to my room. I 
don't know if I said it verbally or not. I might have. I said, "Nah, 
I'll go to my room." 
 
Q: Okay. Now, had you started eating your sandwich before you 
got to your room? 
 
A: No. I believe I ate it in my room. 
 
Q: Did OJ. look like he was walking back into the house? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you assume that O.J. went back the into the house? 
 
A: I didn't see any movement, and I just know that I turned around, 
he was at the door of the car, and I walked back to my room. I 
didn't see movement. 
 
Q: I want you to read an answer that you gave to Mr. Shapiro on 
June 14th. 1994 and--relating to your movements after you 
returned from the McDonald's burger trip, and tell me what in that 
answer is false. 
 
A: Where am I looking at? 
 
Q: This is the question - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The question is argumentative. Where are we, 
Mr. Baker? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: We are on page 13 of that document. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 13? Okay. Thank you. I object to the question 
as compound and argumentative. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: What is it you want him to read? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: The answer where he indicates that he 
started to eat his sandwich and Mr. Simpson was walking towards 
the house. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It's not on page 13. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Of the Shapiro transcript? 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: You are looking at a different-- I believe you have 
a different transcript. I don't recall ever seeing this. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I have the D.A. transcript. Which one is this? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: It may have been--it's probably the same 
one. just transcribed differently, because yours is paginated in 
terms of the lines. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Is it after the question, "Did he seem to be in 
a hurry?" 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay, let me just fund that question, please. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Fair enough. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Bear in mind that what you're looking 
at may or may not be an accurate transcription. Anyway, my 
question is different than your question, Mr. Baker. I'm looking at 
the D.A. version. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Undoubtedly it's false if it came from 
Garcetti's office. 
 
MR. BREWER: Well-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's one less vote for Mr. Garcetti. 
 
MR. KELLY: Sound-bite. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Bombshell. 
 
MR. BREWER: Boy, that's outrageous. 
 
Better be careful what you say. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Oh, I figure you'll produce it on some 
television show. 
 
Q: Did you review that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Hurry, Mike. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Now, did you in fact say that-- did 
you in fact tell Mr. Simpson, "I'm going to eat this in my room, on 
June 12th, 1994? 
 
A: What I remember is I went to the door of the nook, and I just 
turned around. I saw he hadn't moved; he was at the door. and I 
just said, "Ah, I'll go to my room." That's what happened. 
 
Q: So if you saw he hadn't moved, he certainly couldn't have been 
walking back to the house. Correct? 
 
A: He wasn't walking back to the house. 
 
Q: And when you said to Mr. Shapiro "O.J. looks like he was 
walking back into the house," that would be incorrect. You 
wouldn't have said that because it never appeared that he was 
walking back unto the house. Is that correct? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The next sentence says. "I assumed he went 
back into the house." 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I understand what the next sentence says. 
Would you please let me ask my questions? I gave you latitude for 
two days. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let him read it in context. 
 
THE WITNESS: He didn't go into the house. He was at the door of 
the car. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: It is incorrect that Mr. Simpson 
was walking towards his house after you got back from the burger 
run and you were going towards the nook. Correct? 
 
A: Correct, that is incorrect. 
 
Q: All right. And so when you testified to the Grand Jury, did you 
testify that it appeared he was walking towards the house? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Let me read you page 91, lines 13 to 15: Question: So it 
appeared he was walking towards the house? 
 
"Answer: Yes." I am putting the transcript in front of you. And 
that's what you said to the Grand Jury in June of 1994, is it not. sir? 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: May I see it? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I would ask that the witness be able to read 
the sentences before and after as well, particularly starting at line 3. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Is this an argument, or is this an 
objection? You can ask him to read anything you want. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: Those lines don't appear. This starts at line 11. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I'll have to read it to you when I 
 
THE WITNESS: I think in the context, because he was out of his 
car. I can assume that he was going to go to the house until I turned 
around and saw that he hadn't moved, and that's what happened. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: So it never appeared to you, that 
is, visually appeared to you that Mr. Simpson was walking towards 
the house. Is that correct? 
 
A: He wasn't walking towards the house, correct. 
 
Q: It never visually appeared to you that Mr. Simpson was walking 
towards the house on the night of June 12th, after you returned 
from the hamburgers. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And so if you stated under penalty of perjury that it appeared 
that he was walking towards the house, you were misrepresenting 
the truth to the Grand Jury. Isn't that true? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It's argumentative. 
 
MR. KELLY: Object. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't believe so. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Now, you saw Mr. Simpson at his 
car. Is that correct? 
 
A: Yes. I did. 
 
Q: And you walked towards the nook and then walked down the 
driveway, past the entrance, into the path, around to your 
bungalow. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you ate your--Thanks very much. You ate your-- 
 
A: Chicken 
 
Q: What was it? 
 
A: Chicken. 
 
Q: Chicken sandwich? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: A chicken sandwich. 
 
THE WITNESS: A grilled chicken. I believe. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Now. describe the mood of .Mr. 
Simpson during the trip that--to and from the McDonald's 
hamburgers. 
 
A: It was quiet. It was just--there was a sense of me not wanting to 
talk. It was a very quiet ride, and I was forcing conversation. 
 
Q: He didn't seem upset. did he? 
 
A: In thought. 
 
Q: Did he seem upset? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he seem depressed? 
 
A: It could be. Could be depressed. Lonely. 
 
Q: Let me read to you what you told the Grand Jury. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What page, please? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: 63. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Just give us a second, Mr. Baker, to find it 
Okay. What line? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Line 7. 
 
Q: "Question: During your drive to get food, can you describe how 
Mr. Simpson was behaving? 
 
"Answer: Quiet. I asked him a question about the airline he was 
going to fly out and what time the flight was, but he was, you 
know-- he seemed very tired. 
 
"Question: Did he seem upset? 
 
"Answer: No. 
 
"Question: Or depressed? 
 
"No. Tired. 
 
"Question: Tired? 
 
"Answer: Tired. I said to him about possibly getting a nap or 
anything if there was time before the flight because he was very 
tired." Do you recall that testimony, Mr. Kaelin? 
 
A: Yes. I do. 
 
Q: All right. He wasn't depressed, was he? 
 
A: No. I think what I'm saying by "tired" is no talking, and you can 
interpret that as however. The word I used there was "tired." 
 
Q: All right. And--but you did answer the question depressed that 
he wasn't depressed. did you not? 
 
A: In that testimony? 
 
Q: Yes, sir. 
 
A: I don't know how to read another person's mind if they're 
depressed. It was quiet and seemed in deep thought. 
 
Q: All right. And when you responded to the Grand Jury Mr. 
Kaelin, you answered their questions truthfully, did you not? 
 
A: The best I could then, yes. 
 
Q: All right. And that was the first sworn testimony you had given 
following the incidents of June 12th. 1994. Isn't that true? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, in terms of your being back unto your bungalow on June 
12th. 1994, you then remained there until after you had heard the 
thumps that you have described innumerable times. Isn't that true? 
 
A: That's true. 
 
Q: And when you heard those thumps, you went out of your room 
within a minute or two and went the , reverse of the red line that 
you've drawn on 85, except that you went back down the driveway 
and towards the garage, did you not? 
 
A: I did. 
 
Q: Then you went around the garage and to the south side of the 
property where there is a concrete pathway. 
 
 Isn't that true? 
 
A: I didn't make it that far. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you get to the corner of the garage? 
 
A: I got to the corner, yes. 
 
Q: And you looked down the area on the south side of the property. 
Correct? 
 
A: I picked up the gate. There's a loose gate there, and I picked it 
up-- 
 
Q: Now, how far is the gate? Can you draw the first gate? Just put 
a line across there. 
 
A: I believe it's right about here (Indicating). 
 
Q: Okay. And can you put number I and a circle on that? 
 
 (Witness complies.) 
 
Q: And that is the first gate that you encounter along that particular 
walkway. Is that correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Now, was that gate in a hinge at the time that you encountered 
it? 
 
A: Well. I had to pick it up to move it. It's a broken gate. I picked 
up and moved it and leaned it against the tree. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, normally. if the gate had not been broken, does it 
sit in a hinge? 
 
A: I believe it would. 
 
Q: All right. And so you picked it up and moved it out of the way? 
 
A: You can just kind of scoot it just a little bit and go through. It's 
like that (Indicating) and go through. 
 
Q: Chain-link fence gate? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And so you got around on the first trip around the garage to the 
south side of the house far enough to move the gate. True? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then you picked the gate out of the way, leaned it against 
the tree on the south side of the property. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And looked back down the area towards where your bungalow 
would be located. True? 
 
A: Yeah. Looked that way, yes. that direction. 
 
Q: Now, were there any lights back there on that evening? 
 
A: I don't think so, none at all. 
 
Q: Did you see anything back in that area? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Had you been in that area previously? 
 
A: No, 
 
Q: Had you ever walked down that concrete area at all? 
 
A: In my life living there? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And had you gone from the garage area all the way back 
down to where at least on Exhibit 85 Arnelle 's room is located? 
 
A: I don't know if I ever made it as far as Arnelle's room going that 
way, 
 
But I think I got to my room. 
 
Q: Okay. And how long before this particular night had that event 
occurred when you had walked down the south side of the house? 
 
A: Probably when I was getting my phone put in in the beginning. 
 
Q: All right. Had you ever gone past the area where the air 
conditioner was when you were walking from a westerly direction 
to an easterly direction? 
 
A: I might have, but I don't know right now, no. I just don't know. 
 
Q: Okay. All right. Now, after you had gone around the edge of the 
garage into the south side of the property, you came back and saw 
Mr. Simpson walking towards the entrance. Is that right? 
 
A: Say the question again. 
 
Q: You came back around the garage onto the west side or in front 
of the garage and saw Mr. Simpson walking from an area where 
there is lawn towards the entrance to his house. 
 
A: Now you're talking about my first trip? 
 
Q: Yes, sir. 
 
A: Okay. This is--at some point I saw O.J. outside. The first trip or 
the second trip, I don't know. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: But I saw him outside. 
 
Q: All right. Now, you were afraid at the time that you went out 
here because you had heard these noises. You had never heard 
them before, and you were kind of afraid. were you not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: All right. And at that time when you had gone on your first trip 
around the garage, you had noticed that there was a limo outside 
the gate on Ashford. Is that correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Now, in June of 1994 from outside the gate on Ashford, if you 
were parked either with your vehicle pointing at the gate or you 
had to look through the right window or, indeed, the left window, 
you can--there was nothing in your knowledge that would impede 
one's vision from the Ashford gate looking all the way through the 
driveway. Is that correct? 
 
MR. BREWER: I am going to object. It's vague as to time, night- 
or daytime conditions. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I am just talking about something--an 
impediment to seeing anything between the Ashford Street and the 
shrubbery that's on the south side of the property. 
 
MR. BREWER: Same objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, I guess. unless there was cars parked here. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Okay. But like there is now, there 
was nothing in the gates that impeded somebody looking through 
the gates. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: All right. And had--in your entering the property from the 
Ashford side, as it wascustomary for you to do, you could certainly 
see the garage area of the house when you were outside the 
Ashford gate if it was daylight, could you not? 
 
A: I could see the outer garage, correct. 
 
Q: And you could see all the way over to the shrubs that were 
beyond the garage, could you not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Allright. And did you ever come in at night and look into that 
same area? 
 
A: Just at any night look at it? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: My eyes might, you know, look at that, but it wouldn't be 
everything. I'd just go to my path and just go to my room. It's not 
something I would look at. 
 
Q: Where is the street light that exists? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Do you know if there is more than one that illuminates into Mr. 
Simpson's property? 
 
A: I can't be positive on that. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, when you came out on your first trip, you looked 
through the gate and saw the limo sitting there, did you not? 
 
A: I saw a limo there, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, you were concerned, I take it, at that time with 
whether or not there was somebody back on the path that you had 
been to at least once prior. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And was there a second gate down that path? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And draw a line again in red and put a 2 by the second gate. 
 
A: I think it would be about here (Indicating). 
 
Q: Okay. Now, you didn't go to the second gate on the first trip. 
Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: All right. You then, after you had removed the broken gate, you 
went back towards the driveway, did you not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you went all the way out and let the limo in. Is that true? 
 
A: Yes, I did. 
 
Q: And you pushed the button and opened one side and then hand 
opened the other side? 
 
A: No. I just pushed the button. I think they both opened up. 
 
Q: They both opened. And at that time Chachi was where? 
 
A: Chachi was here (Indicating). and he started cutting in front. 
 
Q: Of the vehicle? 
 
A: Of the vehicle. 
 
Q: Now, when you say the vehicle was outside and you opened the 
gate to let it in, was the front of the vehicle pointing down the 
driveway? 
 
A: Pointing like it was coming in the driveway? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when you first saw it, was the front of the limousine in the 
gate area so that the rest of the limousine was sticking out on 
Ashford Street? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: All right. Now, when you let the driver in, you were standing 
over by the control box, were you not? 
 
A: When I let him in. Then I moved when he started pulling in. 
 
Q: Okay. Where did you move to? 
 
A: I think I just started backing up like that (Indicating), and 
Chachi was walking across, and I was Like. "Dog," and then going 
like that (Indicating), and the dog went in the spot. 
 
Q: And the Limousine then pulled up next to the entranceway? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: And on your first trip, as I understand it. you had walked in a 
fairly direct path between your pathway and over to the garage 
area. Correct? 
 
A: Now we're going to the first trip again? 
 
Q: Yeah. before you let the limo in. 
 
A: Yes. I walked like that. 
 
Q: And from the garage to the back of the Bentley is 
approximately what. 20. 30 feet? 
 
A: The garage to the back of the Bentley? 
 
Q: From the front of the garage to the back of the Bentley. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Don t speculate. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, I don't know exact distance. but I don't 
think it's as much as 30 feet. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: If the little cutout area is 
approximately 20 feet -- well, I don't guess this is drawn to scale, is 
it. Okay. Strike that. okay. In any event. when you first went out. 
you didn't look behind the Bentley to see if there was any knapsack 
or anything else there, did you? 
 
A: On my first trip? 
 
Q: Yeah 
 
A: No, I didn't. 
 
Q: It wasn't of any concern to you whether there was anything 
behind the Bentley, was there? 
 
A: No. I didn't see. I just walked and-- 
 
Q: By the way, you have certainly seen Mr. Simpson, even though 
you didn't monitor his comings and goings, you had certainly seen 
him swinging golf clubs before out in the front yard, had you not? 
 
A: Only during the video I saw that. 
 
Q: Okay. What video? 
 
A: I think it was for Playboy, an exercise video. 
 
Q: Okay. You had never been in the front yard and seen him swing 
golf clubs, ever? 
 
A: I didn't see him that much, but I never saw that, swinging clubs. 
 
Q: Now, did you ever testify that you saw him swinging golf clubs 
a lot? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Where, Mr. Baker? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Anywhere. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Anywhere in or outside the house? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Anywhere. 
 
THE WITNESS: O.J. used to take -- swing a club without a club. 
You know, he used to do that (Indicating) Like he was always 
golfing. So I don't know. It was like swinging an imaginary club; I 
saw that a lot, but not swinging an actual club until that video. 
That's the first time I had actually seen him hitting balls on the 
property: During the video shoot. BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: 
Okay. Then so I am clear, your testimony is that you never saw 
him until the video shoot ever swing a golf club. Correct? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: A real golf club. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yeah. A golf club. That's a device that 
has a grip and a shaft. and it has a head on it, and it propels a golf 
club hopefully in a forward motion. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What kind of flex? 
 
THE WITNESS: He might have, but I can't remember right now if 
he ever swang it, but I know for sure in the video he was hitting a 
club--swinging a club. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Did you ever testify that you saw 
 
MR. Simpson swinging a golf club a lot prior to June 12th, 1994? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, after the--Well strike that. When you had moved 
the gate, did you go directly from the--as you put on Exhibit 84, 
did you go directly from the area towards the--of the southwest 
corner of the garage kind of 
 
A: No. I went right over here (Indicating). I went from the control 
box watching Chachi to be safe there, and then I kind of, I think, 
stood here (Indicating) so he knew where to stop. 
 
Q: All right. Did you go back by the entranceway before you went 
to the control box, as it's drawn on this particular-- 
 
A: Yeah. I believe I walked by this way again (Indicating) and 
went to the control box. 
 
Q: Is that the first time you saw the golf clubs out there? 
 
A: I don't know for sure. The golf clubs I saw at one point. The 
time, I don't know. It could have been then. 
 
Q: Were the coach lights on when you went back the first time to 
go allow the limo driver in? 
 
A: I believe the coach--I believe I saw the bedroom light on and 
the lights were dark and when I had come back on one of my trips. 
the lights were on. I don't know which trip, but the lights were on 
at one point. 
 
Q: Okay. So you went past the entrance the first time, and you 
didn't recollect seeing any golf clubs. Don't know one way or the 
other. Correct? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Golf clubs? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Clubs. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Oh, you mean in the bag. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: In the bag. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't recollect on the first trip. no. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: And you obviously don't have any 
recollection of seeing any blood spot the first time you went past 
the entrance. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And when you came back and the golf clubs may or may not 
have been there, you don't have any recollection of seeing any 
blood spot on that 
 
occasion, do you? 
 
A: No. 
 
 q: Okay. And then you came back to the entranceway and picked 
up the golf clubs, did you not? 
 
A: Yes, I put them in the car. 
 
Q: And on that occasion the coach lights were on. Isn't that true? 
 
A: I don t know exact trip. but they were on at one point. I just 
don't remember when. 
 
Q: And you didn't see any blood spot when you picked up the golf 
clubs and put them into the limo. did you? MR. PETROCELLI: 
Blood spots where? 
 
 MR. ROBERT BAKER: Anyplace. 
 
THE WITNESS: I didn't see blood spots, no. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It's a trick question. Mr. Baker. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: All right. So when you saw the 
golf clubs, were the golf clubs lying parallel to the benches? 
 
A: No. I believe they were lying north to south. 
 
Q: Okay. And kind of blocking--if you wanted to go to the 
entrance, they would block the entrance. would they not? 
 
A: I believe. That is the way I remember it. I believe. 
 
Q: And after you picked the golf clubs up and put them into the 
limo. you had, I take it. a conversation with the limo driver. did 
you hot? 
 
A: Well. I put the golf bags in the limo. don t know if the 
conversation with the driver was first or me loading it. I think 
before I would have picked it up I would have said hi to the driver.  
 
Because he popped the trunk. So there had to be some kind of 
dialogue. 
 
Q: Okay. You don't have a clear 1 recollection as you sit here now 
as to what occurred first. Is that correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And I take it that you equally don t have a clear recollection if 
the coach lights were on when you were having this dialogue or 
whatever dialogue you were having with the limo driver. True? 
 
, A: I thought they might have been on by then. but I don't 
remember the coach lights being on the first trip. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, you walked up and picked up the golf bag which 
was between the benches? Or was it closer to the front door? 
 
A: No. it was closer here to the driveway (Indicating), I thought. 
 
Q: Closer to the driveway? All right. You picked them up and put 
those golf clubs in the back of the car. Right? 
 
A: Back of the limo, correct. 
 
Q: And do you recall what color the golf bag was? 
 
A: I believe it was a dark color. 
 
Q: Do you remember whether it had a bag cover on it? 
 
A: Yeah. I remember a Swiss Army on it. 
 
Q: Okay. And later you put the bag into the limo, you then made 
another trip over to the south side of the house? 
 
A: At one point I did. yes. 
 
Q: Do you know how long you were out in front of the vehicle--
strike that--in front of the house before you made the second trip 
over to the l south side of the house. the south side of the garage? 
 
A: I can't give you minutes, no. I know it was in between that time 
of --by 11:15. 
 
Q: Okay. Now. after you went from the limo back over to the south 
side of the garage. you then went around to within five feet of the 
second gate. Is that true? 
 
A: No. I think I made it all the way up to the second gate. 
 
Q: All right. 
 
A: I didn't open it, though. 
 
Q: Okay. And were there any lights on in that area of the house? 
 
A: I don't remember any lights. 
 
Q: Do you remember any illumination coming from the kitchen or 
laundry room area? 
 
A: I don't remember that. I just don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay. And do you know whether there was any foliage on the 
ground from the bushes that are adjacent to the concrete walkway? 
 
MR. BREWER: The question is vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: Leaves-- 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Did you see any leaves. any 
berries, anything on the ground? 
 
A: I think where I was walking there was already Like leaves and 
dirt, so I 
 
Believe so. 
 
Q: And did you look down towards the air conditioner? 
 
A: I couldn't tell because the flashlight was so dim. 
 
Q: Okay. And what you had was one of those little-bitty 
flashlights? 
 
A: It was a pen light, but not one of those--the ones you've got to 
turn, but it still r wasn't as good as one of those heavy metal ones. 
It was a cheap plastic one, but I--I can't give you exactly how much 
distance I could see with the light, but it wasn't very bright . 
 
Q: All right. Now, the--when you went down the second time, the 
gate was still obviously where you left it. Correct? 
 
A: No. I probably put it back and then did it again. I think I would 
have done something like that. 
 
Q: Do you have a specific recollection of doing that? 
 
A: No. I'm just thinking I would-- the kind of thing I would have 
done and then going back and did it. 
 
Q: And then removed the gate again a second time? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: And then put it back a second time? Yes? 
 
A: I think I would have done that. 
 
Q: Do you have a recollection when you put it back you just leaned 
it up against the area where it used to be, or did you try to put it on 
hinges, or do you have any recollection whatsoever? 
 
A: I think I just leaned it against the tree. 
 
Q: Okay. After your second trip did you then see Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Yeah. I had seen him outside at one point. I think it was the 
second trip, but I wasn't positive. I had seen him outside. 
 
Q: And as I recall, before you put the squiggly line on Exhibit 84, 
you indicated that you saw him walk in an area towards the 
entrance which is depicted by the squiggly line. Is that correct, sir? 
 
A: Yeah, I remember him right around here (Indicating). 
 
Q: And you didn't talk to him. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So-- 
 
A: The conversation-- 
 
Q: Let me see if I got this straight. You were scared on the first 
trip, and I take it you were still frightened on the second trip. 
Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you had heard these noises that you had never heard 
before, and you had lived at Mr. Simpson s house about five and a 
half months. True? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: He had obviously lived there a much longer period of time. 
Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And he was the only other person that was home that night. 
Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Didn't say a word to him. 
 
A: Well, he was in this mood-- 
 
Q: You didn't say word to him, did you? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: During what point in time? 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: At the time you saw him for the 
first time in the driveway as he was walking towards the entrance, 
did not say one word to him. did you? 
 
A: Well, that's what I'm saying. I don't know exactly where I had 
seen him first. That's where I'm confused. I had seen him outside, 
and there was a movement that he had gone by fast, and I didn't 
have a second to say it to him. 
 
 I don't know where I was. I was either turning this gate on my first 
or second trip. I don't know. I saw the image of O.J. Simpson right 
there walking in a dark suit. That's what I'm saying. So it was 
walking by fast that I didn't--he went by -that fast, and then I had 
seen him again, and we started a conversation. I can't pinpoint this 
exact time. 
 
Q: Now, he went by fast? Is that your testimony now, sir? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: Well, walking--  
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: You can answer that question. 
 
A: Walking hurried. 
 
Q: So you have a recollection as you sit here now that Mr. 
Simpson on June 12, 1994 on either the first or second trip was 
walking hurried, and you don't remember if you spent last week or 
the week before with Mr. Petrocelli. Is that it? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: You can answer that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It's argumentative. It'scompound. and your 
tone of voice is inappropriate. 
 
THE WITNESS: I--I mean, I'm telling you what I remember right 
now. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: The tone objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: I'm telling you what I remember right now. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Okay. So when you saw Mr. 
Simpson for the first time after you had gone into your bungalow 
to eat your chicken sandwich was where you have started the 
squiggly line. Is that right? 
 
A: I'm confused on that one. 
 
MR. BREWER: Would you reread that question?  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, hold on. 
 
 (Pending question read.) 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Asked and answered a number of times 
already. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: You can answer that, sir. 
 
A: It's--I just saw O.J. outside. My first or second trip. I'm not 
positive on, but he was j outside, and I had a dialogue with him at 
some time, yes. 
 
Q: Well, you didn't have a dialogue with him at that time, did you? 
 
A: Well, I had a dialogue-- 
 
Q: When he walked across the driveway. 
 
A: I had a dialogue With him outside. Whether it was that time or 
not--it could have been me coming back there and saying, "Hey, 
O.J." I don't know the exact-- it was a dialogue outside, though. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, you have previously testified from the time you 
heard the noises until the time you saw O.J. Simpson was three to 
five minutes. Correct? 
 
A: I don't remember, but that's--I would have gone outside. It could 
have been that, yes. MR. PETROCELLI: Don't assume anything 
from the question. Just listen to the question and answer it. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: You don't have to take legal advice from 
Mr. Petrocelli, I can assure you. 
 
MR. BREWER: It's good advice. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: There is a sense 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:-- time will tell. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:--to your confident tone of voice, Mr. Baker, 
that because you say it so, it must be so. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: By the way, you can listen to all this dialogue 
with interest. You don't have to listento any of it. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's the best-- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: That's the best-- 
MR. BREWER: Advice. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Okay. Let me read to you what 
you told Mr. Shapiro on June 14th, 1994. 
 
A: Okay. MR. PLOTKIN: Before you do that. may I ask that you 
do me a favor and repeat the last question. please. (Record read as 
follows: "Q: Okay. Now, you have previously testified from the 
time you heard the noises until the time you saw O.J. Simpson was 
three to five minutes. Correct? 
 
A I don't remember, but that's -- I would have gone to outside. It 
could have been that. yes.") 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He didn't testify. He was interviewed. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: We've already established, I think, that all 
of this was true. At least he told usthat. 
 
Q: Let me read you the question and your answeR: "Question: 
How much time elapsed 
between hearing the noise and seeing O.J.?" 
 
 ''Answer: About three minutes, three to five minutes, because 
that's when I ran out and saw this limo, 
 
Because I had told her immediately that--I told her, 'I got to check 
out this noise.' I talked to her for maybe another minute or so, 
convincing myself that I was gonna go out there." Okay? Does that 
refresh your recollection it was about three or three to five minutes 
till you saw Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: It does refresh my recollection, 
 
But right now I just don't know times. I just don't know times. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, when you saw O.J. and after you saw him move 
past you from the grassy area across the driveway--or actually in 
the driveway towards the entrance, how long was it before you had 
aconversation with him? 
 
A: I don't know the minutes. It could have been soon. I just don't 
know. 
 
Q: Okay. And then you went back to the area where the limo was 
and where O.J. Simpson was. Correct? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The question is vague when you say "then." 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: After you saw Mr. Simpson move 
from the area that is depicted by the squiggly line and go back to 
the entrance, you then went back to the entrance yourself, did you 
not? 
 
A: At some point I did, yes. 
 
Q: And you walked in the entrance and towards the kitchen, did 
you not, after you had a conversation with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: I talked to the limo driver. I talked to O.J. outside. That's when I 
told him about these noises, asked for a better flashlight at some 
point, and that was after he had said, "You go one way. I'll go the 
other way." And I said, "This is the only flashlight I have. It's 
lousy. Do you have a better one? " Then he walked unto the house, 
andfollowed behind him to a point, and he went into the kitchen, 
correct. 
 
Q: Okay. And when you followed him into the entranceway into 
the foyer and towards the kitchen door off the foyer, you didn't see 
any blood spots then either, did you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, when Mr. Simpson told you. ''You go one way and I'll go 
the other way," he told you to go around the south side of the 
house, didn't he? 
 
A: He was at the-- 
 
Q: Entrance. 
 
A: -- driveway, like right here (Indicating). I was here by the limo 
driver (Indicating). I told him about the noise I had heard, and then 
he was facing me at the limo. He said. "I'll go that way. You go 
that way" (Indicating). 
 
Q: And that way where he was directing you was to the south side 
of the property, wasn't it? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Where the bloody glove was ultimately found or alleged to be 
found. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Lack of foundation. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Isn't that true? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He doesn't have any knowledge of this. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Well, it was he directed you, at 
that time when you were both going to search the property, to go 
around the side of the house to where the air conditioner was by 
your room, did he not? 
 
A: He said that. 
 
Q: Okay. And he said he was going to go the other way, that is, to 
the north side of the property. True? 
 
A: He said he was, yes. 
 
Q: All right. Now, when you went into the entrance to the house 
and into the foyer, is it your testimony that you did not actually set 
foot in the kitchen? 
 
A: I didn't go into the kitchen. 
 
Q: Now, you testified on Thursday last, if my memory serves, that 
you saw Mr. Simpson at a sink in the kitchen on--when you went 
back in looking for a flashlight. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I don't believe that was his testimony. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, I don't remember that. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Did you--when you went back 
into the house, did you continue to observe O.J. Simpson, who was 
in front of you? 
 
A: He said he was getting a flashlight. I was behind, waiting for the 
flashlight, because I knew everything was in a rush to go, and then 
he never got it, and that was it. 
 
Q: Well, did you see him in the kitchen? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where did you see him? 
 
A: I was at the entranceway to the kitchen. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: And he walked in, and he walked right in (Indicating)-- 
 
Q: When you say "walked right in" and you draw a line, did he go 
to the right where the stove is? 
 
A: No. He went past the stove, he went where the clock would be, 
and he kinda just did a circle and went, "Oh, my God, is that the 
time?" and that was it. 
 
Q: Okay. So he went past the stove? 
 
A: Past the stove, past the refrigerator, and--you've been inside the 
house? 
 
Q: Many times. 
 
A: Okay. So it was right at the -- where the phone would be, the 
kitchen phone. 
 
Q: All right. 
 
A: Like right around that area (Indicating). straight back out in the 
same pathway,- Correct? 
 
A: Yeah. I think it was U-turn. I mean, came back out. 
 
Q: And it's your testimony he neither went by either sink? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you had a clear view of him the entire time. Correct? 
 
A: From the kitchen? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, when you say he went straight past the stove, the stove is 
on the right as you enter from that door, is it not? 
 
A: Oh, no, no. no. The refrigerator. not the stove. He didn't go by 
the stove. 
 
Q: you just testified he went past the stove. 
 
A: Right. I was thinking the stove. Thestove is right in the front. 
Here's-- like I need a diagram, because the stove's here 
(Indicating). I'm thinking of the refrigerators. And he went to the 
kitchen phone, I said, that pathway. Stoves are here (Indicating). 
So he walked by like that (Indicating). 
 
Q: Never went to a closet? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You never went in there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Never went to a closet? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. And how long did all that take? 
 
A: Not very long at all. Just I think within 60 seconds, I believe. 
 
Q: Okay. And did he at that time indicate to you that he was 
running late? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then he went straight out the door, out the foyer and into 
the limousine. Correct? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What did you recall that he did? 
 
A: That I recalled? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: I recall that he went out then, we didn't get the flashlight, and 
we stood at the opening of thedoor-- 
 
Q: The opening of the entrance door 
 
A: Opening of the entrance door to the limo. So we're outside--
we're on the foyer ready to go outside, and he mentioned about 
setting the alarm. 
 
Q: Okay. So that I'm clear. You were right at the entrance door of 
the house when you were having this conversation? 
 
A: Right about here (Indicating). at the "E." 
 
Q: And the door is open? 
 
A: Door is open. 
 
Q: And both the coach lights are on? 
 
A: I believe, yes, they were. 
 
Q: And there is a bloody spot the size of a nickel within two feet of 
that entranceway that was pointed out to you by the police or that 
you saw the next morning that you didn't see at all that night. Is 
that true? 
 
A: Yes. I believe so. 
 
Q: Didn't see it all. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, when -- and was there light illuminating from the 
coach lamps into the foyer at that time? 
 
A: I don't know. I thought the foyer lights might have been on. 
 
Q: In any event, there was good illumination at the time that you 
and Mr. Simpson were chatting at the entrance door. Correct' 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: Didn't see any of the blood spots that , were shown to you the 
following morning by the police on the evening of June 12, 1994. 
Correct? 
 
A: I did not. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, did you and Mr. Simpson discuss the fact that you 
were going to continue looking to see if there was any untoward 
intruder or any cause for the noise thumps that you had heard, 
previously? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What did you discuss relative to the burglar alarm? 
 
A: "Oh, you got to catch your flight," so he was in a hurry to catch 
his flight, and then that came right to the alarm. 
 
Q: And what did he tell you about the alarm, if anything? 
 
A: "Kato, set the alarm." 
 
Q: Okay. And what did you say? 
 
A: "I don't know the alarm code. I'd rather not do it." 
 
Q: And what happened? 
 
A: And so I thought he was setting the alarm, and I walked back 
outside to the driver, and then I saw that duffel bag, and I thought 
he had not packed it yet, so I started walking towards it. 
 
Q: So where was this duffel bag now, Mr. Kaelin? 
 
A: Duffel bag was right here (Indicating). 
 
Q: Okay. Put a D where the duffel bag was. 
 
A: There was a jetty of grass there. It was at the grass, the jetty of 
grass. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Is that a D, Mr.-- 
 
THE WITNESS: Oh. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Now, was that the first time you 
saw that duffel bag? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You saw that duffel bag on the second trip around? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: And on the second trip around it was sitting behind the Bentley. 
Right? 
 
A: Well, the Bentley's parked here (Indicating). It was at the 
taillight, right about here (Indicating). 
 
Q: Okay. Put where the taillight of the Bentley is. Just draw a 
straight line at the back of the Bentley automobile. 
 
A: I was drawing it. 
 
Q: Okay. Draw the whole vehicle. 
 
A: I remember it being kinda like this (Indicating). 
 
Q: Okay. Well, as a matter of fact, the Bentley was all the way into 
the notched area, wasn't it? 
 
A: No. Just like that (Indicating). 
 
Q: It was just sitting right in the middle of the driveway? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He has not drawn it in the middle of the 
driveway. It's not fair. He is not drawing-- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I don't need your charactetizations. Just 
make an objection, if you will, and be quiet. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It's not accurate, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, I think it's very accurate. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He doesn't have the car in the middle of the 
driveway. It's inappropriate to say that. I object on that Basis. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, your objection is duly noted and 
wrong. 
 
Q: Now, draw the rest of the--just connect the lines, Mr. Kaelin, as 
to where the vehicle was. Just connect that. Yeah, just this back 
here from the back line to the vehicle. 
 
A: What am I drawing here? 
 
Q: Well, you've left off--there is a gap of a line. 
 
(witness complies.) 
 
Q: Okay. Now, that vehicle, the Bentley, then, would have been in 
an area where nobody could get by it--isn't that true?--the way 
you've drawn  
 
A: No. I'm making it bigger. No, it's in there (Indicating). This is 
why I'm drawing it like that. No. The car got through--the limo got 
through, but I' m showing it that I still got out here (Indicating) 
with the hedge room. 
 
Q: Okay. As a matter of fact, the vehicle was totally in the cutout 
area that's depicted on Exhibit 85. True or untrue? 
 
A: It wasn't a perfect fit, but it was in most of this area, yes. 
 
Q: As a matter of fact, the back behind-- Strike that. 
 
 Behind the Bentley was an area of grass that kind of sloped down 
to the concrete in the driveway. Isn't that correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And so if you were standing over in an area in the front of the 
entrance way, you couldn't have seen anything, that is, a duffel, 
behind the Bentley. You'd agree with that? 
 
A: I'm not following. I saw the duffel bag when I walked out. 
 
Q: Okay. You walked out of the entrance. 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: The area between the driveway and the cutout where the 
Bentley is is raised as contrasted to the driveway, is it not? 
 
A: I'm sorry. I'm not following this question. 
 
Q: Okay, fine. I'll be happy to re- phrase it. It's your testimony you 
walked out of the entranceway, and from an area in front of the 
entranceway you could see a duffel bag behind the Bentley. Is that 
correct, sir? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Let's take a break. We've been going, and he seems to be 
getting a little--you seem to be getting a little fatigued. I may be 
presumptuous in saying that, but let's take a 15-minute break. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the 
time is approximately 2:06. (Recess.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 2:27. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Did you see any other bags placed 
in the limousine besides the golf bag that you put in there, Mr. 
Kaelin? 
 
A: No, I did not. 
 
Q: Did you see Mr. Simpson enter the limousine with the bag? 
 
A: I didn't. 
 
Q: When you were standing at the entranceway, did he have any 
sort of piece of luggage with him? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: And you didn't see any bag inside the back seat of the limo. Is 
that correct? 
 
A: Don't remember seeing one. 
 
Q: All right. And, now, this bag that you say Mr. Simpson told you 
that he would pick up--you recall which one I'm speaking of, the 
one where you put a "D" for duffel bag out there? 
 
A: Not to pick up, he said. He didn't tell me--yeah, the one I was 
going to pick up. 
 
Q: So describe that bag again for me, please, sir. 
 
A: I thought it was a knapsack, like a college knapsack, that had 
that shape to it. 
 
Q: Like a book bag? 
 
A: I guess a book bag. It's the shape that would look like that 
(Indicating), and it came to a-- 
 
Q: Kind of a peak at the top? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did it have a couple of straps on it, shoulder straps? 
 
A: No, but it had the shape of the knapsack, like I just drew, and I 
remember like a small patch I thought of brown leather. 
 
Q: And you have gone through the photos from the criminal trial, 
and you didn't see that particular piece of luggage. Is that correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Now-- 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: Excuse me. Do I assume that the photos you 
showed him the other day were the photos from the criminal trial? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Not all those photos were of the pieces of 
luggage that came into evidence. Some were for the Grand Jury. 
 
MR. PLOTKIN: I think he understood Mr. Baker's question to 
refer to the photos you showed him. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Yeah, the photos you showed him, 
you didn't see the bag that you say you saw on June 12. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: All right. And after the limo pulled out, it went out on the 
Rockingham side? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you then went back through the house or around the house, 
or what did you do? 
 
A: I opened the gate control box. I opened it for the limo from 
there, saw the car left; gate closed; I went back to my room. 
 
Q: Now, as I recall your testimony a little earlier, you said that the 
front door was open when Mr. Simpson walked out. Correct? 
 
A: When he walked-- 
 
Q: When you guys were standing there having your conversation, 
he walked out: the front door is open. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. The one conversation where he was getting into the 
limo? 
 
Q: Yes, sir, yes. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you close the front door or did he close the front door? 
 
A: I imagine he must have closed the front door. 
 
Q: Isn't it true that you had a conversation with him at the front 
door that you were going to continue searching for a prowler or 
whatever, and he would call you with the burglar alarm code? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Compound. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: That didn't happen. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever seen Mr. Simpson set the alarm? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How long does it take you to set the alarm? 
 
A: I've never done it before I did it that one time.-I done it. 
 
Q: 20 seconds? The first time you had ever done it, how long did it 
take? 20 seconds? 
 
A: Yeah. I pressed in the code and waited for it to turn the color 
and walked back to my room. 
 
Q: So as I understand it, you sad Mr. Simpson didn't have time to 
put on the alarm when he was leaving, getting in the limo. Is that 
right? 
 
MR. BREWER: Objection. Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: It wasn't set. That's all I know. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: All right. And then you went back 
to your bungalow and called Rachel. Is that correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Now I want to Bo back to the conversations that you had with 
Mr. Simpson on the 12th, and both pre- and post-recital. Okay? 
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: Now, in those conversations you were talking about many 
subjects. were you not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You were talking about the Lakers -- pardon me -- the Knick-
Rocket game? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You were talking about girls? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You were talking about life in general? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You were talking about sex? 
 
A: I think that might have been in the girl topic. 
 
Q: Okay. It's all-inclusive? 
 
A: (No audible response.) 
 
Q: Did you feel uncomfortable talking to Mr. Simpson about any 
of those subjects? 
 
A: I guess it's a degree of certain subjects. If it was about a certain 
girl, if it was--I mean, if it was like the dress situation, it wasn't 
sex, but it was about dressing sexy; that was, I guess, a little bit 
uncomforting. 
 
Q: And as I understood your testimony, you felt uncomfortable 
when you left the Bentley to ask Mr. Simpson for a straw. Is that 
right? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Left the Bentley. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yeah. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No. While he was in the Bentley, he asked for 
the straw. 
 
 THE WITNESS: I was--for the-- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: No. no, he didn't ask for the straw. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No. He did. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Okay. Let me-- 
 
THE WITNESS: I believe I asked for --I didn't want to push it, but 
I think I asked for my straw after I had the food in my lap. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Okay. It made you 
uncomfortable? 
 
A: Well, this, and I didn't think he wanted to talk anymore, so I 
was thinking, do I ask for the straw now or not, and so I did. 
 
Q: Okay. And was it your impression that that upset him in any 
way? 
 
A: Well, I don't know upset. It was just I felt uncomfortable 
saying, "I got to talk to you again now. I forgot to ask for the 
straw." but I had to bring it up. "I need the straw now." 
 
Q: To use your term, was he annoyed? 
 
A: It could have been a little annoyed with me. 
 
Q: I see. You didn't have any problem living there for free. but you 
had a little problem asking for a straw. Is that 
 
MR.BREWER: Objection. It's argumentative. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: And after you asked for the straw 
you asked for a typewriter, didn't you 
 
A: If I could use a--to use the typewriter, not 
 
Q: So that didn't make you uncomfortable, to ask to use the 
typewriter, did it? 
 
A: That was another part of the conversation. I was forcing 
conversation. and I said. "Hey, there's a typewriter in the office. 
Can I use that?" 
 
Q: All right. Now, on June llth, 1994, is it your testimony that Ron 
Fishman was in Mr. Simpson's house? 
 
A: I believe it was Ron Fishman. I had said there was someone that 
was in the nook area. I thought it was Ron Fishman. 
 
Q: Kind of raised his hands, said. "I don't understand women," or 
words to that effect? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He said that. Misstates his testimony. 
 
THE WITNESS: I said that O.J. said that. They were both in a 
discussion. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Now, it's your recollection that on 
June 11th Mr. Simpson had talked to you about the fact that Nicole 
might get--might have problems with the IRS by using his address? 
 
A: There was conversation about O.J. doing the change of address 
on the IRS. 
 
Q: And the fact that she shouldn't use his address. Correct? 
 
A: Something to that, yes. 
 
Q: Now, Mr. Simpson never told you he was trying to get Nicole 
into trouble. did he? 
 
A: I think it was like that. 
 
Q: Really? Didn't he tell you that he was trying to keep himself out 
of trouble, and if she didn't pay her taxes, she could get into 
trouble? 
 
A: I think it was relating to both those things, but it would be 
financially it would hurt her. 
 
Q: Well , when did Mr. Simpson tell you that the bracelet that he 
gave to Paula -- when that act was performed? Was that within a 
day or two of 6-10, 6-11? 
 
A: I cant be exact on that date, I think it was on Saturday. though. 
That incident happened on Saturday in the TV den. 
 
Q: Okay. Tell me what incident you're referring to when you say 
"that incident happened on Saturday," 6-11? 
 
A: I believe it was the--it happened during the conversation of just 
channel surfing, and it was watching TV and certain shows that 
were coming on, and it was that he was going to this ball, this 
benefit, I think it came in that conversation. I'm not positive, 
 
But I think it came in during that time. 
 
Q: Well, do you recall if he told you that l3 he had given her the 
bracelet or that he was going to give her the bracelet? 
 
A: I thought that he had given it to her, believe. 
 
Q: And when did you-- 
 
A: Not positive. 
 
Q: When did you think he had given it to her? 
 
A: I think that it was given to her during that week, I don't know 
the date, I don't know the date on that. 
 
Q: Okay. So it would be sometime in the week of June 5th to the 
12th? 
 
A: I don't know if it was before then or not. And June 6th was--I 
believe June 6th was an AIDS benefit. So I don't know if it 
happened yet or , not. 
 
Q: Now, as soon as you went back and ate your chicken sandwich, 
that's when you called Tom O'Brian? 
 
A: Yes 
 
Q: Who is Susan Wilkinsen? 
 
A: Who is she? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: She 's a friend of mine. Her and her sister are friends that live in 
Brentwood. 
 
Q: Have they played tennis at OJ.'s house prior to November--or 
strike November--June llth, 1994? 
 
A: No . 
 
Q: How many times before June 12th, 1994 had you attempted to 
fix up O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: You know, it was in conversation that I thought he was lonely, 
and I was not so much setting him up. I was just--I thought that 
Susan, to my opinion, was like a real quality girl. 
 
Q: You didn't think O.J. could take care of himself in the female 
department? 
 
A: No I knew he could take care of himself, but she was just a 
quality person. 
 
Q: And in times that you had seen him in a social setting, he didn't 
have any problems with females, did he? 
 
A: No. 
 
And he had gorgeous women over at his house, did he not? 
 
A: He did, yes. 
 
Q: Now, as I understand your testimony, from the time you met 
O.J. Simpson until the time that you I' moved into his house. 
Nicole Brown Simpson was attempting to get back in his life. Is 
that true? 
 
A: During those times they tried both getting back together. How 
many times, I don't know. 
 
Q: She made it clear to you that she was the one that wanted to get 
back into his life when you had these tea conversations while you 
lived at Gretna Green. Isn't that true? 
 
A: I think it was a conversation where she said that at one point she 
was falling in love with O.J., and then there could be another 
conversation where she said she didn't like O.J. So it was these 
different conversations that would happen like that. But definitely 
times when she was falling in love. and definitely times when she 
was fall ing out of love. 
 
Q: Well, tell me, was--let's try to put some dates on those in loves 
and out of loves. Between the time that you first met O.J. in 1993 
and May of 1993, was she falling in love or falling out of love? 
 
A: That's what I'm saying: It was--I can't put a date on it. There 
was times when it could be a weekend that would have gone great, 
and then next weekend they weren't seeing each other. I couldn't I 
figure it out. I didn't know what went on. And believe a lot of times 
O.J. was out of town. I didn't know his schedule. So I didn't know. 
 
Q: So you didn't know what the status of their relationship was. Is 
that correct? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Vague as to time. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I'm trying to mimic him. 
 
THE WITNESS: I can't give like specific dates. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: All right. 
 
A: I can't. 
 
Q: Now, after the murders, on June 13th when you were at OJ.'s 
house and Howard Weitzman had called you, do you recall that? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Misstates his testimony. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: All right. It does. I agree with you. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He was at Grant Cramer's house. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: You were at Grant Cramer's house 
when Howard Weitzman called you. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And then you were subsequently at OJ.'s house that evening. 
True? 
 
A: Later that evening, yes. 
 
Q: And at that point in time you knew you were going to have an 
interview the following day with some lawyers for Mr. Simpson, 
did you not? 
 
A: I believe so. I don't know if it was on that--was it that Monday--
or I think it might have happened on Tuesday morning I found out. 
That date, I don't know, but I knew I was going to meet Robert 
Shapiro and Skip Taft. 
 
Q: Didn't you testify that you were told to, quote, "Get your story 
straight because it's O.J. Simpson. on the night of the 13th? 
 
A: No. I said Mark Slotnik had said something, and I didn't know 
if it was on that Monday or that Tuesday, but he had said that to 
me, I said. 
 
Q: Well, when did you see Mark Slotnik on Tuesday? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Slotkin. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: He said -nik. 
 
THE WITNESS: Slot- -- that's what I'm saying, I said there--I was 
testifying there's so many people at different times, I couldn't give 
an exact date. The event that happened was that he said that. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: And O.J. said, "Just tell the truth." 
Isn't that correct? 
 
A: That was on the phone, yes. 
 
Q: That's all he wanted you to do, is tell the truth. Isn't that true? 
 
A: That's what he's said. yes. 
 
Q: And he's neverSo you don't have a recollection if Mark 
Slotkin told you to get your facts straight because it was O.J. 
Simpson on Monday, the 13th, or Tuesday, the 14th of June 1994. 
True? 
 
A: I can't give an exact date. I believe it was on that Tuesday, but I 
can't be precise. 
 
Q: And do you have a recollection of where you saw Mark Slotkin 
on Tuesday, the 14th? 
 
A: It was in the den area. 
 
Q: Did you spend the night--Oh, you did spend the night on the 
13th. did you not? 
 
A: That was another thing I was confused on, I didn't know exactly 
where I spent my night, if it was there at the house or if it was 
Tuesday I spent it there. I was going back and forth, and that's-- I'm 
confused in my head exactly what nights I spent there. 
 
Q: Well, as you sit here now, do you have a recollection that you 
spent the night at Mr. Simpson's house on the 13th? 
 
A: I don't. I don't know if I went to Cramer's or not. I just don't. 
 
Q: And do you have a recollection of coming back from Cramer's 
on the morning of the 14th? 
 
A: I think so. I think I might have spent the night there. 
 
Q: And you went from Cramer's back to Mr. Simpson's and then 
over to Mr. Simpson's office where the interview took place. Is that 
correct? 
 
A: I went from OJ.'s to his offices from his house: I know that, and 
I know Arnelle and Jonah Wilson drove me. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, it's obligatory that people give you questions to 
ask, so I am now taking advice from my son, which is a 
juxtaposition. In any event-- 
 
MR. BREWER: Here we go. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: --when you went back to set the 
alarm after you had gone to your bungalow, had been talking - to 
Rachel Ferrara and had been beeped in by Mr. Simpson did you go 
back around the outside of your house to the north side and to the 
front entrance? 
 
A: Well, the question. I think there was a mistake there. I went 
from letting in the limo driver. I went back to my room. Then got 
beeped in and went back out. 
 
Q: All right. And after you got beeped in and went back out, you 
went back out to the entrance and set the alarm at the entrance pad. 
Correct? 
 
A: Correct, in front. 
 
Q: Were there lights on when you went and set the pads, the alarm 
pads? 
 
MR. BREWER: Vague as to the term "lights," which lights you're 
talking about. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Any lights in the house at all 
stairs, downstairs, coach lights? 
 
A: I don't remember. The coach lights could have been. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you see any blood at that time, any nickel-size spots 
of blood in the entranceway? 
 
A: I did not. 
 
Q: And if the nickel-size spot of blood was two feet away from the 
entrance, you would have had to go right past it to get to the pad, 
would you not? 
 
A: If I was looking down, but I think I was focusing on just setting 
the alarm and leaving and getting back to my room. 
 
Q: Regardless of where you were focusing, you had to go right past 
that to get to the pad. did you not? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: All right. Now, at no time during the evening of the 12th was 
O.J. Simpson sweating or perspiring or in any way looking like he 
was--had been exercising. 
 
A: I don't remember that, no. 
 
Q: And he looked well-groomed? 
 
A: I thought so. 
 
Q: By the way, after your jacuzzi did you go in and take a shower? 
 
A: I thought I might have taken a shower. 
 
Q: And during the time when you usually took, a shower, that 
bathroom's kind of small, so you would open the window that goes 
to the south side of the property. 
 
A: I normally would crank it a little bit, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Now-- 
 
A: But I think also before night I used to crank it shut, and I 
remember it as far as when I would go to the bathroom, I would 
always have it shut, normally. 
 
Q: All right. Now, do you presently have any book deals with 
Dove Publishing? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Has Dove Publishing forwarded you any moneys whatsoever? 
 
A: Nothing, no. 
 
Q: Have they provided any legal counsel for to you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, you testified Thursday last that there was quite a bit of 
blood near the entrance to the kitchen. Do you recall that? 
 
A: When the detectives walked me out? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: There was drops. right. 
 
Q: What in your vernacular, Mr. Kaelin. is "quite a bit of blood"? 
 
A: Well, when they were walking me out, I think Vannatter had 
said, "Watch your step. Watch the -I blood," and I looked down 
and I saw droplets of blood, and I watched my step and I walked 
out. So I don't-- it was drops of blood. I don't know exactly--it 
wasn't gallons or anything, so I thought it was drops of blood. 
 
Q: Okay. Was it quite a bit? Was it not quite a bit? Was it a lot? 
Was it not a lot? 
 
A: It was enough for me to watch my step. 
 
Q: Okay. And you don't have a recollection of the number of blood 
drops in the foyer. Correct? 
 
A: I do not. no. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Anything else. Phil? 
 
MR. KELLY: What, hedging your own questions against your 
son? 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Did you see any blood near the 
kitchen door, the entrance from the foyer into the kitchen door? 
 
A: That's the foyer, yeah. That's-- the foyer had the blood going in 
the--as soon as you walk off from the kitchen the blood would 
have been right at those spots. Me walking and the bloodlets were 
there, and then I saw them by the door, and then I thought I saw 
one outside the door, and then I walked outside the Ashford gate. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Okay. I don't think I have anything 
further, do I, Phil? 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: No. 
 
MR. BREWER: Let's take some time and talk about this a second. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: I think we both have trial subpoenas for 
you, Mr. Kaelin. Surprise, surprise. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: One is enough. Ask him for a witness 
check. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Give me that subpoena back. 
 
THE WITNESS: I never did get that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I'll have just a few questions. That's all. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the 
time is approximately 2:49. (Recess.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 2:58. 
 
EXAMINATION: 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: A few more questions, Mr. Kaelin. 
Mr. Baker was asking you about whether you saw blood spots at 
night when you were inside the foyer on the evening of the 12th. 
Where were your eyes looking during the brief time you went in 
the foyer and came out again? 
 
A: On the Sunday? 
 
Q: Yeah. Sunday evening on the 12th. 
 
A: I was watching O.J. in the kitchen. That's it. 
 
Q: Did you ever look down on the ground? 
 
A: I did not. 
 
Q: And the next day when the cops were escorting you--or the 
detectives, I guess, were escorting you outside of the foyer and out 
to the property, did you notice the blood spots yourself, or did they 
point them out to you? 
 
A: They mentioned it. 
 
Q: They pointed them out? 
 
A: They said. "Watch the blood."

blood spots. Is that right?

Q: Now, you've talked to a lot of lawyers in this case, haven't you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: What do you mean by "this case"? Do 
you mean the civil case? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You've talked to a lot of lawyers in 
this whole proceeding involving --whole legal proceedings 
involving Nicole's and Ron's death. 
 
A: Yes.

A: Yes. I did. 
 
Q: You spoke to Mr. Shapiro and Mr. Taft at Mr. Shapiro's office. 
Right? 
 
A: No. Mr. Taft and Mr. Shapiro at OJ.'s office. 
 
Q: Oh, at OJ.'s office. And you gave 
 
A: I was at Shapiro's office also. 
 
Q: And you gave them a lengthy interview? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And they were the first lawyers to talk to you. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Well, in fact .Mr. Weitzman and OJ.'s -other lawyer had 
contacted you, and you spoke to him. Right? 
 
A: Yes, on the phone. 
 
Q: And Mr. Shapiro interviewed you again at some subsequent 
time didn't he? 
 
A: Yes, he did. 
 
Q: And Mr. Simpson s investigators, Mr. Pavelick and Mr. 
Hostetler, they also interviewed you, didn't they? 
 
A: Yes, they did. 
 
Q: And the prosecutors interviewed you also? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, when you and I met the past couple of weeks, your lawyer 
was present. Right?

Q: And I spent considerable amount of time talking to your lawyer, 
didn't I? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I object to leading the witness. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: I interviewed you about the facts of 
the case? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you do your best to give me truthful and accurate 
information?

Q: And did you do the same when you spoke to all the other 
lawyers on all the other occasions? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Leading.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: He meant no. 
 
THE WITNESS: Just telling the truth. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Telling the truth. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when Mr. Baker questioned you, you were trying to be 
helpful to him, too. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, Mr. Baker asked you about documents that you had read 
before coming to the deposition, and he mentioned the transcript of 
the Grand Jury proceeding, the preliminary hearing, the trial and 
some other proceedings as well. First of all, have you ever read any 
of those transcripts in their entirety? 
 
A: Not really. I have them, but I didn't really make an effort to read 
them. 
 
Q: You don't have the entire trial transcript, do you? 
 
A: The--which one? 
 
Q: You mean just your testimony. 
 
A: My testimony, yes.

A: Correct. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: When you were at Gretna Green 
during the incident on October 25 and you came in, you saw

Q: And you had not seen those splinters on the ground before. 
Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Those splinters came from where? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: From the French doors at Gretna Green. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI 
 
Q: And how do you know that? 
 
A: Because I lived there, and I saw the doors open, and it was 
Nicole-- and the police said, "Would you fix the doors when we're 
gone?" I said, Yes. 
 
Q: And you could see an area in the door from which the broken

MR. PETROCELLI: I have no further questions. 
 
EXAMINATION: 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Did you remain in the room when 
we took a break with the lawyers for the plaintiffs? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you talk to them at all I during that period of time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you have any book deals, forget whether it's a Dove 
Publishing or not? 
 
A: Nothing. 
 
Q: Okay. And have you attempted to sell your story to any entity, 
whether it be NBC, CBS, ABC or anything? 
 
A: I get offers all the time. We just turn them down. 
 
Q: So you have not made any pitches to sell your story. 
 
A: Nothing. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, when you went to Grant Cramer's on the 13th and 
then moved essentially to Grant Cramer's the week of the 13th, did 
you still have clothes and belongings at Rockingham? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When did you ultimately get those? 
 
A: I--two buddies of mine got it, and the detectives said I couldn't 
get my stuff for a long time. 
 
Q: O.J. hasn't got his clubs back yet either. 
 
MR. KELLY: Nor is he going to. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Did you ever get your clothes 
back? 
 
A: They got some of my stuff. It was all piled in a pile in the 
garage, and this is a month or so later. But they just kept putting it 
off. and that was-- 
 
Q: What do you mean. "they kept putting it off'? 
 
A: Well, Bill Genego was making phone calls, because I said, 
"Bill, I have to get my stuff." and he'd call and they would, you 
kno, not return a call, then return a call and make a date and then 
break it. 
 
Q: And this is the LAPD? 
 
A: No. I think it was the--Pavelick. I think it was him that was in 
the garage when they picked up the stuff. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: But William Genego would know for sure, I believe, but I think 
it's him. Pavelick. 
 
Q: When you went to OJ.'s house on the evening of the 13th, was 
that to pick up clothes, or was that because Howard Weitzman had 
suggested you come there that evening? 
 
A: Well, I remember talking to--the one I was kinda talking to at 
the house was a Terry Baker, and that was a relative of OJ.'s, and I 
was doing most of the talking to her. And I believe Howard 
Weitzrnan asked me to come by there, and I think that's the person 
I talked to on the phone, was Terry, saying, "I'm coming by," but I 
think I got clothes also. 
 
Q: Let me see if I understand this. When you were at Grant 
Cramer's-- 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: --and you got the telephone call from Howard Weitzman and 
O.J. was it during that telephone call that you were requested to be 
at OJ.'s house that night? 
 
A: Well, I don't know if it was a command, but I thought he said. 
"Stop by the house." And I said. "Sure." 
 
Q: You didn't take that that you were going to have any meeting 
with O.J. or anybody else when you were-- the suggestion was 
made to you to stop by the house. True? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: All right. Now. at that point in time did you have another 
conversation with Terry Baker? 
 
A: I don't know the times when I talked to Terry Baker, but I know 
Terry was the one I talked to I think on the phone. That was the 
person that I talked to. I don't know the times and how many, but I 
thought Terry is the one that picked up the phone. 
 
Q: Well, then you called back to Rockingham at some point on the 
13th, did you not? 
 
A: I think. I don't know a hundred percent. I think I did. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you have a recollection of calling before you talked to 
Howard Weitzman and O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: I don't have a recollection. I don't remember. 
 
Q: Well, didn't you come over really to get clothes and a 
toothbrush when you went over to Simpson's house on the night of 
the 13th? 
 
A: Boy, I just don't remember. 
 
Q: Did you take clothes and toothbrush and leave and go stay at 
Grant Cramer's house? 
 
A: I might have. I don't know for sure. 
 
Q: And you don't have any recollection of sleeping there the next 
night. on Tuesday, the 11th? 
 
A: At--at-- 
 
MR. BREWER: 'There" being Rockingham? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yeah. thank you. 
 
THE WITNESS: I think I might have. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: Q: Did you sleep there at any time 
after June 14th? 
 
A: I think I might have. I think I slept-- I think I slept there the day 
before the wake, I think. 
 
Q: And then there-in-after you never were there to reside again. 
Correct? 
 
A: There might have been a day or two more. I just don't know. I'm 
not a hundred percent and-- if I still stayed a night or not. 
 
Q: Did you ever sleep there after Mr. Simpson was arrested? 
 
A: I think I did. When was the date? 
 
Q: Well, did you--the 17th? 
 
A: I don't know. I don't know for sure, I might not have. 
 
Q: Well, after Friday of the week of the murders. In other words. 
the murders were Sunday, the 12 th. Friday the 17th, did you stay 
there at any time thereafter?

A: No. 
 
Q: And they identified themselves as LAPD detectives. Right? 
 
A: I think they said "Police."

<P>Faye Resnick describes O.J. Simpson as a drug-abusing wife beater in the first day of her three-day deposition. He played the part of star athlete in public. But when he got angry with his wife, "His jaw would protrude, his teeth would clench, sweat would come pouring from his head," she said. "The only way to describe it is animalistic."</P>

and Nicole and I had met briefly in Cabo San Lucas. She was

immediate. It was the kind of friendship I felt was kindred.

MR. PETROCELLI: Withdrawn.

and a fuller flavor of your relationship with Nicole, in your own 
words, the kinds of things that you and she did together? 
 
A. Nicole and I used to take our children to the movies, we used to 
have coffee together, we used to have dinners together, we used to 
go shopping at, you know, grocery stores together, and it was a 
typical friendship. We went out for evenings out on the town 
together. I used to stop by her house whenever I was in the area, 
which was only four or five blocks from my house, and vice versa. 
We were just very close friends. 
 
Q. Did you take vacations together? 
 
A. Yes, we did. Many. 
 
Q. On the average, how many times a week would you actually see 
Nicole during this time period, and so that my questions are clear, I 
am referring to the time period July 1992 until the time of Nicole's 
death in June of 1994, and just to reframe the question for you, 
generally speaking, how often would you see Nicole? 
 
A. Four times, five times a week. 
 
Q. Continuously through that time period? 
 
A. Continuously, and that was on the low, five times a week is on 
the low - 
 
Q. That is an average? 
 
A. Yeah, an average. 
 
Q. So sometimes it could be higher than five?

Q. Do you believe that you were Nicole's best friend? 
 
MR . LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. Yes, I do. 
 
Q. On what do you base that belief? 
 
A. She told me, number one - 
 
Q. What did she tell you? 
 
A. That she had never had a friend, a friendship like mine as far as 
trust, and that she had never - she just said that I was her best 
friend many times, that she could always count on me. 
 
Q. Did the two of you ever have arguments or disagreements? 
 
A. Yes, we did. 
 
Q. Were you able to air those out? 
 
A. We were never able to air the one disagreement that we always 
had. 
 
Q. What was that? 
 
A. I didn't want her to see Marcus Allen. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Excuse me. We did not hear that answer. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: She said I did not want her to see Marcus 
Allen. 
 
Q. You are referring to some points in time when Nicole was 
dating Marcus Allen? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And you had reasons why you were opposed to that? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
Q. Is that what you are saying? 
 
A. Yes. I was afraid if she saw Marcus Allen, O.J. would assault 
her. 
 
Q. Did you ever express that to Nicole? 
 
A. Over and over again. 
 
Q. We will get back to that later on in the deposition. Were there 
other arguments or disagreements that you would have with Nicole 
from time to time? 
 
A. Yes, there was. 
 
Q. Were you able to resolve them between you? 
 
A. Always. 
 
Q. You were able to talk openly with her? 
 
A. Always. 
 
Q. And she with you? 
 
A. Always. 
 
Q. Did -- before, you said that you and she shared confidences and 
secrets together; is that right? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. What kind of personal matters did you and Nicole talk about? 
 
A. We discussed our children, we discussed our relationships. 
 
Q. With other people?

discuss.

Q . And you in her presence? 
 
A Yes, I did. 
 
Q. During this time period - again, July of 1992 through Nicole's 
death in June of 1994 - Nicole was unmarried that entire time; is 
that right? 
 
A. Yes.

A. Yes. 
 
Q. And then, when the divorce was final, she never remarried

MR. LEONARD: I didn't hear that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He's known as Marcello in the book, yes. 
 
Q. What did you call him?

Zlomsowich and that was brief, very brief, more of a friendship. 
She also saw Joseph [Name Deleted], she saw Brett [Name 
Deleted], she saw Grant [Name Deleted] briefly, Marcus Allen, 
and then O.J. Simpson. 
 
Q. To your knowledge, did Nicole date these men prior to 
resuming her relationship with Mr. Simpson in April of 1993? 
 
A. Yes. They formed a reconciliation. 
 
Q. And Marcus Allen, did she date Marcus Allen before the 
attempted reconciliation with Mr. Simpson in - 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered . 
 
Q. - in April of 1993? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me, Mr. Leonard, you are absolutely 
free to object. Please let me finish my question. Also, that's not an 
appropriate objection. Let me restate the question. 
 
Q. Did Nicole date Marcus Allen before April 1993? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did she date Marcus Allen after 1993 - excuse me, did she date 
Marcus Allen, in addition, after April of 1993?

Q. Okay. Do you know if she dated any of the other persons you 
identified, after April of 1993? 
 
A. Not to my knowledge.

you wrote a book following Nicole's death; is that right? 
 
A. Yes, I did.

A. Yes. 
 
Q. I would like to mark for identification, but because of the bulk, I

Q. I am going to mark as plaintiffs' next exhibit in order - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Which is Exhibit 78, Mr. Brewer? 
 
MR. BREWER: Yes. 
 
Q. - Exhibit 78, the book I just described you wrote, Nicole Brown 
Simpson: The Private Diary of a Life Interrupted. As I said, we 
will be referring to that from time to time. And when you 
mentioned previously the book, you were talking about this book, 
right? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. You also wrote another book; is that right? 
 
A. Yes. I co-wrote two books, actually. That was my point. 
 
Q. The book, Exhibit 78, was co-written with Mike Walker? 
 
A. Yes. That's what I was trying to say. 
 
Q. And the other book that you wrote which we will mark as 
Exhibit 79 is entitled what? 
 
A. It's Shattered, In the Eye of the Storm, and that was written by 
myself and Jeanne V. Bell. 
 
Q. We have both those books here and we will be looking at them. 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 79, book entitled Shattered, In the Eye of the 
Storm, marked for identification, as of this date.) 
 
Q. Can you share with us your - can you tell us - describe Nicole 
for us, is what I am trying to say. What kind of person was she? I 
would like you to talk a little bit about the kind of person she was 
as she presented herself to you. 
 
A. Nicole was a very gracious friend. She was a - she was a very 
simple girl with great motherly qualities and she was just sweet, 
she was strong, she was - she had lived a painful life, so she was 
guarded. At the same time - she was the most wonderful woman I 
have ever met. 
 
Q. Was she fun-loving? 
 
A. She was very fun-loving. She was - she loved to play with her 
children. I mean, she just - she had a lot of spirit in her. She was a 
lively mother, a lively friend. She was unlike the typical person 
that you meet in Los Angeles, very down to earth, not a superficial 
girl. She wasn't - she wasn't a real social girl, as far as the industry, 
parties. She was kind of a beach girl. 
 
Q. Did you observe her with her children? 
 
A. Yeah. 
 
Q. Often? 
 
A. Often. 
 
Q. And what kind of mother did she appear, to you, to be? 
 
A. Nicole was by far the best mother that I had ever met. I had 
never seen a mother put as much time and care, and effort, and true 
protection of her children. She spent - her life was her kids. 
 
Q. And by "her kids," we are referring to Sydney and Justin? 
 
A. Sydney and Justin. She used to read to them for hours upon 
hours, she played games with them. She did everything that a 
mother and a nanny would do. I mean, she was - she was incredible 
as a mother, yes. 
 
Q. She took them to all their functions and -- 
 
A. Everything, karate to painting, to the ballet, to jazz classes, to 
tutoring, kept them in the best schools for their - she worked with 
them with homework, she used to say prayers with them every 
night. She was an amazing mother. 
 
Q. Did she have primary care and custody of the children during 
this time period that you knew Nicole? 
 
A. Yes, she did. She had primary care of the children. 
 
Q. Do you - and the children's natural  father was whom? 
 
A. O.J. Simpson. 
 
Q. And during this time period, did you observe whether or not Mr. 
Simpson spent time with his children? 
 
A. Yes. I observed them together. 
 
Q. And how often, based on your observations, did Mr. Simpson 
spend time with the children? 
 
A. When he was in town he would free his schedule briefly. He 
didn't - 
 
Q. Was he out of town often? 
 
A. He was out of town often. He didn't - he didn't spend a lot of 
time with his children unless Nicole was around. 
 
Q. Would the children, on weekends, for example, stay with Mr. 
Simpson and not with Nicole? 
 
A. Rarely. 
 
Q. So based on your relationship with Nicole, you observed that 
she had the children virtually every day? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
A. Nicole - 
 
Q. What was your observations [sic] as far as how often Nicole had 
the children? 
 
A. My observation was that I felt Nicole had the responsibility of 
both mother and father because she often had the children every 
weekend. I mean, it was rare that O.J. actually took them and kept 
them for more than a day. 
 
Q. When you say "every weekend," did she also have them during 
the week? 
 
A. Yes, she did. She had them all the time, essentially. I used to 
tell her, it was as if she didn't have an ex-husband. 
 
Q. Did Nicole and you ever have conversations about Mr. 
Simpson's time with the children or lack of time? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Could you relate those discussions? 
 
A. Nicole always felt that she could never make weekend plans 
unless she had a babysitter because she could never count on O.J. 
to keep his word and keep the children on their committed - on his 
committed time. As much as Nicole adored her children and she - 
she didn't mind the fact that he would bring them back - everybody 
needs their free time - and Nicole felt it was unfair. 
 
Q. Did Nicole, during this period July 1992 until her death in June 
of 1994, always appear, to you, to be a fit mother? 
 
A. Absolutely. 
 
Q. Stable? 
 
A. Extremely. 
 
Q. In the last six months of her life, from January 1994 until June 
of 1994, did you ever observe a time when Nicole, to you, 
appeared not to be able to care for her children? 
 
A. Never. I never observed a time for Nicole - I never saw her ever 
not be able to care and want to care for her children. 
 
Q. During the last six months, did you observe that Nicole spent - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Withdrawn. 
 
Q. During the last six months of Nicole's life, January through June 
of 1994, did you observe whether or not Nicole spent less time 
with her children? 
 
A. No. That was not my observation. 
 
Q. What was your observation? 
 
A. She spent just as much time with her children as she ever did. 
 
Q. Did you observe any signs, during these last six months, that 
she was having a nervous breakdown? 
 
A. Absolutely not. 
 
Q. That she was physically unable to care for her children? 
 
A. Absolutely not. 
 
Q. Or mentally or emotionally unable to care for her children? 
 
A. Absolutely not. 
 
Q. Are you aware of whether Mr. Simpson began taking 
responsibility for the children to a much greater degree than before, 
during the last six months of Nicole's life? 
 
A. I'm not aware of that at all. 
 
Q. And you were in regular contact with Nicole during her, the last 
six months of her life? 
 
A. Yes, I was. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
Q. Were you in regular contact with her? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. Yes, I was. Regular. 
 
Q. When you and Nicole began to develop your friendship, did she 
describe to you her relationship with O.J. Simpson? 
 
A. Not really. 
 
Q. In time, did you and she have discussions about her relationship 
with O.J. Simpson? 
 
A. Yes, we did. 
 
Q. And did you have discussions with Nicole about her 
relationship with Mr. Simpson before she and Mr. Simpson began 
their reconciliation in April of 1993? 
 
A. Yes, we did. 
 
Q. Can you describe those discussions to us? 
 
A. The discussions were, I felt, incomplete discussions. She had 
left out very important information to me at that time regarding the 
abusive nature of their relationship. She - we were in therapy 
together, group therapy together, and right before Nicole went, 
asked O.J. to reconcile, and she had said that all of the problems 
that they had had, she didn't really want to discuss because they 
were now in a new phase: O.J. had turned a new leaf in his life, 
O.J. had said he was going to be monogamous, O.J. had said that 
he was not going to do drugs, O.J. had said he was going to change 
his behavior, and she believed him so she didn't really discuss all 
of, anything that was really happening before. 
 
Q. Before April of 1993, had Nicole talked to you about the subject 
of abuse in her marriage to Mr. Simpson? 
 
A. Before - pardon me, before 1993? 
 
Q. April of 1993, before Nicole and Mr. Simpson reconciled. 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. And what did she say about that? 
 
A. She briefly - we discussed two incidents. One incident was the 
1989 meeting, because I brought it up. 
 
Q. And what was the other incident? 
 
A. The other incident was when he used to beat her when she was 
pregnant. 
 
Q. With - 
 
A. With Justin and Sydney. To my recollection, he beat her with 
both. 
 
Q. Is it your recollection, Ms. Resnick, that Nicole told you of 
these incidents before April of 1993? 
 
A. Yes, it is. 
 
Q. Do you recall the reasons - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Withdrawn. 
 
Q. Did Nicole ever tell you why she divorced Mr. Simpson? 
 
A. Yes, she did. Q. And did she tell you why she divorced Mr. 
Simpson, before April of 1993? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. What did she say to you about that? 
 
A. She said that O.J. was incapable of being - of not being 
aggressive and she said that he used to have girlfriends for three 
years at a time. 
 
Q. While he was married to Nicole? 
 
A. While he was married to her. 
 
Q. You are now relating to us, Ms. Resnick, what Nicole told you; 
is that right? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And when you said that Nicole said that O.J. was capable of - 
excuse me, that O.J. was incapable of not being aggressive, what 
did you mean by that? 
 
A. Well, this was during the time where she really didn't want to 
admit to the abuse so she would sugar coat it and say he was 
aggressive, he couldn't not be aggressive. 
 
Q. By "aggressive," did she say physically aggressive? 
 
A. Physically aggressive. 
 
Q. And she also said, as you just related, that Mr. Simpson was not 
faithful? 
 
A. Not at all. She said he couldn't be faithful. 
 
Q. Nicole told you that Mr. Simpson could not be faithful to her? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did she say how many girlfriends that he had during their 
marriage or affairs that he had during their marriage? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Just so I understand, this is all prior to April? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: We are now focusing on discussions she had 
before April of 1994. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Okay. 
 
A. Yes. That she had had - he had had two long-term relationships. 
 
Q. During his marriage to Nicole? 
 
A. During his marriage to Nicole. And that he had had numerous, 
too numerous to count, one-night affairs. 
 
Q. Did she identify the women with whom Mr. Simpson had these 
two relationships? A. She identified one of them. 
 
Q. Who was that? 
 
A. [Name Deleted] and - 
 
Q. Nicole told you O.J. had a relationship with [Name Deleted] 
during O.J. and Nicole's marriage? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. A long-term relationship? 
 
A. A three-year relationship. 
 
Q. Between whom? 
 
A. Between the time they were married. 
 
Q. Three years that Mr. Simpson went out with [Name Deleted]? 
 
A. Yes. And that he supported her. 
 
Q. Financially? 
 
A. Financially. 
 
Q. This is what Nicole told you? 
 
A. That's what Nicole told me. 
 
Q. And what did Nicole tell you about the other long-term 
relationship? 
 
A. She had mentioned a name to me and I don't recall it. 
 
Q. Did Nicole tell you that the subject - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Withdrawn. 
 
Q. Did Nicole tell you that Mr. Simpson's infidelity was a subject 
of friction between her and Mr. Simpson? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 
 
A. Nicole told me that O.J.'s infidelity was the reason that she 
would be beaten. And - 
 
Q. Let me ask it to you this way: Did Nicole describe to you 
whether there was any issue between Mr. Simpson and her during 
their marriage that was a source of conflict between them? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Just for clarification, we are continuing to talk 
about before April of 1993? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. During the first eight, nine months of 
Ms. Resnick's relationship with Nicole Brown Simpson. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Okay. 
 
Q. And what were the sources of conflict between Mr. Simpson 
and Nicole that Nicole related to you? 
 
A. The sources of conflict. Well, she - before 1993, she kept it very 
vague, her statements of what happened in their relationship. 
 
Q. About physical abuse? 
 
A. About physical abuse. It was only when I questioned her that 
she ever answered anything, so I can just say, before 1993, during 
that first period, there wasn't a lot of serious conversation over it, it 
was very brief and very vague. 
 
Q. Over physical abuse? 
 
A. Over physical abuse. Except she did say that he did beat her 
when she was pregnant and that there was a, you know, the 1990 - 
the 1989 beatings over [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q. And Miss - 
 
MR. LEONARD: Can I just hear that last answer back, please? 
 
(Record read.) 
 
Q. Again talking about the conflict that existed in her marriage that 
she related to you, sticking with that, she was vague about physical 
abuse, you told us about that. 
 
A. Right. 
 
Q. And what did she say to you on the subject of Mr. Simpson 
being unfaithful? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 
 
A. She - Nicole said that O.J. could not be faithful, he just couldn't, 
and that that was the cause of their problems. 
 
Q. And then she described these relationships that he had? 
 
A. Yes. She went on to say that he was always with the [Name 
Deleted] Tropic girls because - 
 
Q. What did that mean? 
 
A. That he would have sexual relations with the [Name Deleted] 
Tropic girls. 
 
Q. What did she mean by [Name Deleted] Tropic girls? 
 
A. There's a group of girls that [Name Deleted] Tropics hires to do 
their modeling for them and O.J. was dating them all, I guess, all 
the time. A new crew would come in, he would start dating the 
new crew. 
 
Q. Did Nicole tell you whether or not she was faithful to Mr. 
Simpson during the marriage? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. And what did she say? 
 
A. That she had never had an extra-marital affair. 
 
Q. What did Nicole tell you - again, referring to this time period 
prior to April of '93, what did Nicole tell you about the 1989 
incident? 
 
A. Nicole said that it was horrific, that O.J. was animalistic, that he 
beat her and that Michelle denied it. 
 
Q. And who was Michelle? 
 
A. The housekeeper at the time. And that it was one of the many 
beatings. Excuse me, in 1993 - before 1994, she did not say it was 
one of the many beatings. 
 
Q. But she had told you about this incident in 1989? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did she tell you how she had been beaten ? 
 
A. She said he choked her, punched her, slapped her, kicked her. 
Kicking was his favorite, she said. 
 
Q. Did she tell you what was the cause of that incident? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. What did she say to you? 
 
A. She said that O.J. had had a lot to drink at a party and that 
somehow he was angry and he was seeing two other girls at the 
time and Nicole confronted her - confronted him about it. 
 
Q. And that's what led to the fight? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did the name [Name Deleted] come up in this discussion that 
you had with Nicole? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. [Name Deleted] was the source of many beatings and, yes, it did 
come up in this discussion. 
 
Q. That's what Nicole told you, that [Name Deleted] was the 
source of many beatings? 
 
A. Yes, that [Name Deleted] was the source of many beatings, but 
this is after 1993 that she told me how many beatings Tony was. 
 
Q. Getting back to the after 1993 time period, so we get back to 
this segments in time - 
 
A. I know, it is - 
 
Q. And I appreciate the difficulty. And, by the way, if you are not 
able to separate the time periods out, just tell me, but if you can, it 
would be helpful. Did she - can you describe whether Nicole more 
specifically told you exactly what Mr. Simpson did to her in, say, 
the 1989 incident? Did he punch her, scratch her, pull her hair? 
You know, physical acts, can you just tell us if Nicole described 
them to you? 
 
A. Yes, she did. I think I already answered that. 
 
Q. Okay. You can't be more specific than that, is that right? 
 
A. No, I can't be. Q. Did Nicole tell you whether she sought 
medical treatment? 
 
A. No, she did not. Not during that time. 
 
Q. Did Nicole say anything else to you about that incident at that 
time? 
 
A. Only that he got away with it. 
 
Q. She said O.J. Simpson got away with it? 
 
A. Mm-hmm. 
 
Q. You have to answer audibly. 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did she describe to you what she meant by that? 
 
A. She said that he always got away with everything he's ever done 
in his life and that she felt unprotected, she felt that he just did 
some community service, which he really got out of. That was a 
very sore point for Nicole, was the sentence that he received. 
 
Q. Did Nicole tell you whether or not she pressed charges or 
whether or not charges were pressed against Mr. Simpson as a 
result of that incident? 
 
A. Nicole - Nicole told me that she - that O.J. had threatened her, 
that if she pressed charges or if she said anything, that it would be 
worse. Nicole said that O.J. begged and pleaded with her to call 
Hertz, say it was no big deal. 
 
Q. Hertz was an employer of Mr. Simpson? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did Nicole tell you whether she did those things? 
 
A. Nicole basically said she did everything O.J. asked of her to 
cover up for him. 
 
Q. Did she tell you why she did that? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. What did she say? 
 
A. She was in love with him, she was afraid she would lose her 
children to him. He always threatened her that he would take her 
children away. 
 
Q. Nicole told you that she loved Mr. Simpson? 
 
A. Yes, she did. She was very much in love with him. 
 
Q. Did Nicole tell you about any agreement that Mr. Simpson 
signed regarding this 1989 incident? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
MR. BREWER: Are you still pre-'93 in this question? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I assume that all of these answers have been 
discussions prior to - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: They all have. They all have, okay? 
 
MR. LEONARD: As long as we understand that. But I object to 
the leading as well in the last question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: First of all, I don't think your objection to 
leading is well-founded. In any event, let's get back to where we 
were. 
 
Q. When Nicole was relating to you this 1989 incident, did she tell 
you anything about an agreement between Mr. Simpson and her? 
 
A. No, she did not. 
 
Q. Now, you also said that Nicole told you again, before April of 
1993, that she had been beaten by Mr. Simpson during her 
pregnancies. Do you remember that? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Can you tell us what Nicole told you about those beatings? 
 
A. Nicole said that he used to call her a fat pig and how dare she 
gain weight and that - Nicole said she made - that O.J. made her 
pregnancies unbearable, that he used to always go out and be with 
other women when she was pregnant, flaunt it; that he used to beat 
her whenever she confronted him with the affairs. That's what she 
said. 
 
Q. Did she tell you - again, before April of '93 - how she was 
beaten during her pregnancies with Justin and Sydney? 
 
A. No, she did not. 
 
Q. Like, did she describe the blows that were delivered? 
 
A. No, she did not. 
 
Q. Did Nicole - again, same time frame - tell you that she feared 
Mr. Simpson? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. What did she say about that? 
 
A. She always said that she was - she felt that their relationship 
was too volatile and that he would hurt her. She was always in fear 
of that. 
 
Q. Did you ever ask her, during this time period, well, if you were 
in fear of him, why did you stay with him, why didn't you leave 
sooner? Did you ever ask her questions like that? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection to the leading. 
 
A. Yes, I did but I didn't ask her those questions until after '93. 
 
Q. I see. Prior to April of 1993, did Nicole ever discuss with you 
why she had not left Mr. Simpson sooner, given her fear of him? 
 
A. Prior to '93? 
 
Q. Yes. 
 
A. She - prior to '93, she just said she loved him and, you know, 
she was afraid of losing her children. 
 
Q. Now, earlier in your testimony, when you first mentioned Mr. 
[Name Deleted], I believe you were telling us about a discussion 
that you and Nicole had about her relationship with Mr. [Name 
Deleted]. Do you remember that? 
 
A. Mm-hmm. 
 
Q. Did - were you and Nicole discussing whether she should 
continue or discontinue her relationship with Mr. [Name Deleted]? 
 
A. No, we weren't. We were discussing - we were discussing - I'm 
sorry, this is very, this conversation was really funny, actually - 
why he didn't want to be with her and then it later turned into that 
we found out that he was afraid of seeing her- 
 
Q. Did Nicole tell you that? 
 
A. Mm-hmm. 
 
Q. You have to answer audibly. 
 
A. Yes, yes, she did. 
 
Q. Did Nicole tell you why Mr. [Name Deleted] was afraid of 
continuing to see her? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. What did she say to you? 
 
A. This was later in the day. 
 
Q. This is July of 1992. 
 
A. Okay. We are not talking about one specific day. 
 
Q. Did the conversation - when did the conversation occur, the one 
that you are relating? 
 
A. The conversation occurred July 4th, 1992, and there were two 
parts to the conversation. The first part was me explaining to her 
just, you know, how to, how to get him back. I knew him for a 
long time. And then he came to the party, he joined the Fourth of 
July party, and he had discussed that he was nervous about seeing 
her because of O.J. Simpson. 
 
Q. Now, who told you that, Nicole? 
 
A. Ron. Ron, Nicole and Joseph and I had a conversation about it. 
 
Q. You and Joseph had a conversation? 
 
A. Joseph and I maintained a very nice friendship. 
 
Q. Are you saying that Joseph told you that he was afraid to see 
Nicole because of O.J. Simpson? 
 
A. He said he felt that it was better, that O.J. was too much in love 
with Nicole and had not let go of her yet. 
 
Q. Joseph told that you? 
 
A. Mm-hmm. 
 
Q. You have to answer audibly. 
 
A. Yes, he did. He said that. 
 
Q. Did Joseph tell you whether Mr. Simpson did anything to make 
him afraid of Mr. Simpson? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
A. No, he did not. And Joseph did not tell me that O.J. did 
anything to him to make him afraid. He was just afraid. 
 
Q. Did Joseph tell you why he felt Mr. Simpson was still in love 
with Nicole? 
 
A. Oh, yeah. 
 
Q. What did Joseph say? 
 
A. That he had heard about the stalkings, he had heard about what 
happened, you know, with Alessandro, the threats to Alessandro. 
O.J. made it very clear to everybody around that Nicole was, even 
though she was separated, she was not single, and the men that 
were around at that time were very well aware of it. It was as if 
enter at your own risk, you know. They all were very aware that 
O.J. Simpson was volatile, that he was angry, and that he felt that 
he owned Nicole and that they had no place. 
 
Q. Did Nicole share those feelings with you also? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Starting around the time that you got to know her in July of 
1992? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did you ever, yourself, observe, from July of '92 to April of '93, 
Mr. Simpson during that time period? 
 
MR. MARKS: Observe him doing what? 
 
Q. Did you see him at all? 
 
A. No, I did not. No, I did not. During that time, I just didn't. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Can - that's the same period we have been 
talking about? 
 
MR PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
Q. When Nicole was dating Marcello or Alessandro, was that 
before you and Nicole were friends? 
 
A. Yes, it was. 
 
Q. And was it later in time that she told you about this 
relationship? 
 
A. They both told me about the relationship. Alessandro was also a 
friend of mine. 
 
Q. I see. What did Alessandro do? 
 
A. What did he do? 
 
MR. MARKS: In terms of work, you mean? 
 
A. Oh, I am sorry. He is a hairdresser for Christophe salon in 
Beverly Hills. 
 
Q. Did you ever have a conversation with Nicole in which she 
discussed the reasons why she and Marcello, or Alessandro, broke 
up? 
 
A Yes, we did. 
 
Q. When did that occur, generally speaking? 
 
A. It occurred right after they broke up. It would have occurred 
right in the time frame of, you know, right after we really became 
friends. 
 
Q. Sometime after July of '92? 
 
A. Probably July 5th. 
 
Q. What did Nicole tell you about the breakup of her relationship 
with, and let's call him Marcello, since that's how he's referred to in 
your book? 
 
A. She said that O.J. had threatened him, called him at Christophe's 
and threatened that he would beat him up if he didn't stop seeing 
his wife. 
 
Q. Nicole told you that? 
 
A. And Alessandro told me that. 
 
Q. You had conversations with both Alessandro and Nicole where 
you were told that? 
 
A. Yes. At different times. Can I take a break, please? 
 
Q. Sure.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q. Ms. Resnick, did Nicole ever discuss with you the reasons for 
her breakup with Keith [Name Deleted]? And I am focusing on this 
pre-April 1993 time period. 
 
A. Yes, she did.  
 
Q. What did she say? A. I need to clarify - 
 
Q. Please. 
 
A. - before I answer. Nicole - there wasn't really a breakup because 
there wasn't a relationship established. It was essentially a 
friendship that manifested physically, but there wasn't a romantic 
relationship, but I will say what she had said was that during the 
time that she was - that she had a physical relationship with Keith, 
O.J. had entered her home uninvited on one occasion and tried to 
intimidate Keith and on another occasion that he had told Nicole 
and Keith that he was watching them through the window of her 
house while they were having a romantic interlude. 
 
Q. And that's what Nicole told you? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did she tell you how Mr. Simpson tried to intimidate Keith 
[Name Deleted]? 
 
A. He said he would basically stalk them and made sure that Keith 
was very aware that he was watching them at all times and that he 
would follow them and made it so uncomfortable for them that 
Keith felt nervous. 
 
Q. Did you ever discuss this with Keith? 
 
A. No, I did not. 
 
Q. Nicole had a relationship with Brett [Name Deleted], correct? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And they broke up at some point, correct? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did that break up have anything to do with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A. Not to my knowledge. 
 
Q. Nicole eventually broke off her relationship with Grant [Name 
Deleted], I take it? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did that have anything to do with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A. Grant - 
 
Q. Can you answer that yes or no? 
 
A. No, I can't answer that yes or no. 
 
Q. Okay. Then answer it in any way you can. 
 
A. Grant was very fascinated by the relationship between Nicole 
and O.J. He would constantly question Nicole regarding their 
relationship. Grant felt, because he was also in therapy with us, in 
group therapy that I had mentioned earlier, that he was aware of 
the abuse and Grant felt he wanted no part of the situation, that it 
was intimidating for him. 
 
Q. Is that what Grant told you? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. You mentioned several times about group therapy. Where did 
this occur? 
 
A. It occurred in West Hollywood, on Larrabee Avenue, above 
Sunset Plaza. 
 
MR. MARKS: I don't - just to be clear on the record, I do not want 
to go into questions, detailed questions about group therapy 
sessions and so forth, that's privileged. If she had a conversation 
with Mr. [Name Deleted], that's fine, but I am not going to get into 
any conversations with any therapists and so forth. 
 
Q. Who was the therapist? 
 
A. I don't know his last name. I know his first name is Carl. 
 
Q. Did you attend any sessions with Nicole? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. How many? 
 
A. Three sessions. 
 
Q. And without getting into what was said were who were at these 
sessions, besides Nicole and you? 
 
A. On one occasion it was Nicole, Grant, myself, other people that 
I am not aware of their names, the facilitate tore or the therapist, 
Carl. On another occasion, I believe that I brought Christian 
Reichardt to one of the therapy groups with us. 
 
Q. Did the three sessions you attended with Nicole all occur before 
Nicole's reconciliation with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A. Yes, they did. 
 
Q. Did Nicole - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Withdrawn. 
 
Q. Did Nicole discuss the reasons for her break up with Marcus 
Allen? Again, this is the first time that they were seeing each other. 
 
MR. MARKS: Are you talking about - 
 
MR. LEONARD: Are you referring to after- 
 
MR. MARKS: You are talking about conversations between 
Nicole and Faye? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I guess the question was unclear. Let me ask 
it again. 
 
Q. You said that Nicole and Marcus Allen had a relationship before 
April of 1993? 
 
A. Yes, they did. 
 
Q. And that relationship came to an end at some point before then, 
right? 
 
A. Yes, it did. 
 
Q. Did Nicole ever discuss with you the reasons why that 
relationship ended? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. Did those reasons have anything to do with O.J. Simpson? 
 
A. Yes, they did. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the form. 
 
Q. Excuse me? 
 
A. Yes, they did. 
 
Q. What reasons did Nicole relate to you? 
 
A. O.J. - Nicole had told me that due to the reconciliation, she was 
not going to see anyone else. Nicole's relationship with Marcus 
was right before the reconciliation and it was a relationship that 
had to be hidden because it was so volatile. They, yes, indeed, 
went out publicly, but rarely. It was a relationship that was 
secretive, due to the friendship between Marcus and O.J. She cared 
for Marcus very much, very much. Marcus was engaged and she 
felt that due to the relationship, there could be no future in it for the 
both of them. 
 
Q. These are things that Nicole told you? 
 
A. Mm-hmm. Yes. 
 
Q. Did you ever go out with Nicole and Marcus Allen? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. On numerous occasions? 
 
A. Not many. I would say three different occasions. 
 
Q. Did you ever discuss with Marcus Allen his feelings towards 
Nicole? 
 
A. On one occasion. I discouraged the relationship. 
 
Q. Tell - was that right around the time when Nicole was deciding 
whether to go back with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A. No. That was when she started seeing - when she was - the 
conversation that I am going to be talking about occurred at Nicole 
Simpson's home on Gretna Green; Marcus was in her home, I 
walked in her home and I saw her sitting on Marcus's lap. 
 
Q. Tell us what you and Marcus discussed. 
 
A. I had said that I felt it was dangerous that they were together 
and Marcus said that they never make it obvious, and I said that 
O.J. peeks in windows and Marcus just - they both looked at me 
and laughed and acted as if I was - 
 
MR. MARKS: May I ask what they said? Not how they acted but 
what they said, if anything? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's what she's relating, I believe. 
 
A. They both knew - they both expressed to me that they knew it 
wasn't the right thing to do. 
 
Q. When did this conversation occur, in Gretna Green? 
 
A. Before the reconciliation. 
 
Q. Is that the only time that you had a conversation with Marcus 
about his relationship with Nicole? 
 
A. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. 
 
Q. Now, in April 1993, as you previously testified, Nicole 
attempted a reconciliation with Mr. Simpson, correct? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did Nicole discuss with you her reasons for doing so? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. What did Nicole say to you? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Can we have a date for this conversation? 
 
A. The conversation was - 
 
MR. MARKS: Approximately. 
 
A. - I would say, it was during the time we were in therapy, so that 
would have been early April. 
 
Q. 1993? 
 
A. 1993. 
 
Q. Okay, so in early April 1993, tell us what Nicole said to you 
about her reasons for attempting a reconciliation with Mr. 
Simpson. 
 
A. She said that in - that Candace Garvey had told her that O.J. had 
promised to be faithful and that he had learned his lessons of 
infidelities through the divorce of Nicole, and that he had told 
Candace that he would be monogamous to whichever woman he 
was with from now on and then Nicole, in therapy, felt due to the 
fact that she had a better understanding of herself in therapy, that 
she could keep their relationship intact, since there was not going 
to be any infidelities any longer and she felt that that was their - 
she said that that was their biggest problem and that he wouldn't be 
there anymore. 
 
Q. He would not - 
 
A. He would not beat her anymore. 
 
Q. Nicole told you that she felt she believed there would no longer 
be a problem about Mr. Simpson's infidelity, that she also believed 
there would be no more beatings? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Now, is what you are saying is Candace Garvey told - 
 
A. Nicole. 
 
Q. - Nicole, about a conversation Candace Garvey had with Mr. 
Simpson, in which Mr. Simpson said he intended to be 
monogamous in his relationships? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And that's the basis on which Nicole began to hold out some 
hope that he and Mr. - excuse me, that she and Mr. Simpson could 
reconcile? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did you have a number of conversations with Nicole about this 
before she contacted Mr. Simpson to discuss this? 
 
A. No, I did not. 
 
Q . Did you say anything to her one way or the other? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. What did you say? 
 
A. I said that men don't change, that I would support her decision. 
 
Q. Did she then initiate a reconciliation with Mr. Simpson, to your 
knowledge? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. And did that occur roughly in April of 1993? 
 
A. Yes, it did. 
 
Q. Did she tell you what Mr. Simpson's response or reaction to her 
asking him to reconcile was? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. What did she say? 
 
A. She said that initially he had said that he was happy with Paula. 
 
Q. And who is Paula, for the record? 
 
A. Paula Barbieri, a woman that he was dating at the time, and that 
she called me and said that it was not - that he was not responsive, 
but she felt good for trying to put her family back together. 
 
Q. Before you go on, on Paula Barbieri for a moment, during the 
period of time before this April 1993 conversation, did Nicole and 
you discuss Paula Barbieri from time to time? 
 
A. Yes, we did. 
 
Q. So Nicole knew that Mr. Simpson was dating Miss Barbieri? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. Did Nicole express any feelings about that relationship? 
 
A. Not really. 
 
Q. Did she - was she jealous? 
 
A. No. She - the one or two times we discussed Paula, Nicole felt 
sorry for her. 
 
Q. Is that what Nicole said to you? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Why did she - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Withdrawn. 
 
Q. Did she say to you why she felt sorry for Paula? 
 
A. No, she did not. 
 
Q. Did you understand what she meant by that? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. What did you understand her to mean? 
 
A. I understood it to be that he was an aggressive man. 
 
Q. Physically? 
 
A. Physically. 
 
Q. Now getting back to where we were, Nicole told you that the 
first time she called Mr. Simpson, he was not responsive? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And did she tell you about another conversation that she had 
with him? 
 
A. Yes. She called me a half hour later and said that Nicole - said 
that O.J. had just left her house, and I said, a half hour ago you said 
he wanted nothing to do with it, with the relationship. She said he 
had changed his mind and he had called her a couple of times 
between then, between that time, and said he wanted to come over 
and discuss it, and Nicole said to him, we have plenty of time, let's 
take this slow, let's do this right. And - 
 
Q. That's what she told you? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did she ever tell you later on that day or the next day whether 
Mr. Simpson came over to her house? 
 
A. Yes. She told me he had come over, in that conversation. 
 
Q. He had already been over? 
 
A. He had already been over. And that he - she expressed 
hesitation because he was starting again already. 
 
Q. Starting what? 
 
A. He was becoming - now that it was in his head, he was calling 
her, coming over, the day that she initiated the reconciliation, I 
guess she had talked to - she said she had talked to O.J. five times 
and he had appeared at her house and she became nervous already. 
 
Q. Did you and she discuss whether she should call it off at that 
point in time? 
 
A. No. She discussed with me that she felt that he hadn't changed 
in his obsessive ways. 
 
Q. Did she indicate to you that she was going to therefore not 
proceed with the reconciliation? 
 
A. No. She did not indicate she was not going to proceed. She 
indicated that she had informed him to just slow down, that she 
wanted to have a sane relationship, this time could only be a sane 
relationship. 
 
Q. And thereafter, did Nicole proceed to enter into this phase of 
reconciliation with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. And do you know whether they began to see each other or talk 
to each other on a frequent basis after that point in time? 
 
A. Yes, they did. 
 
Q. Can you give me the best of your recollection, when this initial 
discussion between Mr. Simpson and Nicole occurred, in April of 
1993? Do you remember what day it was? 
 
A. I think it was in mid-April. 
 
Q. Mid-April? 
 
A. Yes. To the best of my recollection it was in mid-April. 
 
Q. Did Nicole tell you about any ground rules or that she and O.J. 
agreed to? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
Q. What did Nicole tell you about whether there were any ground 
rules in their attempted reconciliation? 
 
A. When Nicole saw O.J.'s behavior to be similar to the behavior 
when she was married to him, she had said to him there were - that 
she would keep her friends; she said to him that he was not able to 
choose her friends, that they would be faithful to each other, that - 
she asked him to stay away from drugs, she asked him to calm 
down on his drinking. She asked him to - she said she was not 
willing to put up with any physical abuse. 
 
Q. These are things that Nicole said that she told O.J. Simpson? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did she tell you what O.J. Simpson's reaction was? 
 
A. He was responsive, at first. 
 
Q. Meaning he would attempt to abide by these rules? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Now, thereafter, did you start seeing less of Nicole because she 
started seeing Mr. Simpson? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Who at this time, April of '93, were Nicole's close friends? 
 
A. Cici Shahian. 
 
Q. In addition to yourself, of course. 
 
A. Cici Shahian, Cora Fishman, Kris Jenner, Robin Greer. 
 
Q. Did Nicole tell you whether or not she intended to be 
monogamous with Mr. Simpson during this relationship? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. During this attempted reconciliation'? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And the answer was, she was going to be monogamous ? 
 
A. Absolutely. 
 
Q. And did she tell you that Mr. Simpson also said he would be 
monogamous ? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. Now, is this around the period of time that you began to know 
O.J. Simpson? 
 
A. Yes, it is. 
 
Q. During this period of time now - now we are into a new period 
of time, April of 1993, all the way through the rest of that year and 
into '94, until Nicole's death, that will be the time period we will be 
focusing on for the most part, okay? You began to go out with 
Nicole and O.J.? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. Did you ever spend any time alone with O.J. Simpson? 
 
A. Not much. 
 
Q. Did you ever go out alone with him? 
 
A. Not to my - I can't recall. 
 
MR. MARKS: Is your question spending time together? Would 
that be telephone conversations or - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No, I was not talking about telephone 
conversations. 
 
Q . Just the two of you going someplace together, being alone 
together. 
 
A. Only in Cabo San Lucas, that I can recall. 
 
Q. When others were with you, but not present at that time, you 
mean? 
 
A. Right, others were with us but not - there was plenty of times 
when we were together having conversations, but for O.J. and I to 
go and have dinner together alone, that's something that we never 
did. 
 
Q. Okay. You had conversations alone with him, right, in person? 
 
A. Too many times. 
 
Q. And you had telephone conversations with him as well? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. Now, there came a period of time, jumping ahead for a moment, 
when this attempted reconciliation came to an end; is that right? 
 
A. There was a couple of times when it came to an end. 
 
Q. There came a period of time when it came to be a end [sic] for 
the last time; is that right? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. When did that occur? 
 
A. The last time? 
 
Q. Yes. 
 
A. The very last time, the reconciliation? It's a difficult question to 
ask, only because in the last month and a half there had been three 
different times where he kept, even though she tried to end it, he 
kept coming back. 
 
Q. Okay. Well, we will get back to that later on. Let me tell you 
why I am asking this question now. Now, during that last month 
and a half of Nicole's life, you and Mr. Simpson - did you and Mr. 
Simpson have a number of telephone conversations ? 
 
A Yes, we did. 
 
Q. Okay. Now, before that last month and a half, so generally 
speaking, April of '93 to early May of '94 - 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. - did you and Mr. Simpson speak frequently on the telephone 
together? 
 
A. Yes, we did. 
 
Q. Even during that period of time? 
 
A. Yes, we did. 
 
Q. In these various and numerous telephone and personal 
conversations you had with Mr. Simpson, before the last month 
and a half, did he ever discuss with you his feelings about Nicole? 
 
A. Yes, he did. 
 
Q. Was that pretty much the subject matter of the conversations? 
 
A. Always. 
 
Q. Can you tell us what he would say about Nicole, what feelings 
he would express to you about Nicole? 
 
A. Yes He had a way of saying the same thing over and over and 
over and over again. It's very - his - he admitted to being obsessed 
with Nicole. He admitted to being so in love with her that he didn't 
know how to handle it. He felt that he no longer had control over 
Nicole during their reconciliation as he had when they were 
married. He felt that - he said that he would do everything in his 
power to keep their relationship intact. He said that he had never 
loved any woman like he loved Nicole. He said that Nicole makes 
him crazy. He said that he has - there were so many things that he 
said. We can go on and on and on, but he was - to sum it up, I 
would say that the majority of the time he felt that he didn't possess 
Nicole during the reconciliation. He felt he didn't, he wasn't able to 
control her. 
 
Q. And did he say that he wanted to? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Now, these are all things that O.J. Simpson said to you? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. In numerous conversations, in 1993 and 1994? 
 
A. Numerous. 
 
Q. In these conversations, when he would talk about how much he 
wanted to control Nicole and how he loved her and so forth, did 
you ever ask him about his infidelity? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. What did you ask him? 
 
A. When he would tell me - when he said to me - and when I say 
"tell me," because it was the same phone calls over and over again, 
and the same line of answers, I would say to him, you say you will 
do anything to keep the relationship together. At the same time you 
are continuing to see Paula Barbieri and you expect Nicole to 
believe you and she's aware of the fact that you are still seeing 
Paula. His response was that he had to see Paula every now and 
then because he had left her so abruptly to go back to Nicole and 
that she kept calling him and she said that - I mean, he said  that it 
really had nothing to do with his relationship with Nic. 
 
Q. Nic, meaning Nicole? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did you ask him about infidelity before his divorce from 
Nicole, in these various conversations? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. And relate to us what you asked him and what he said to you in 
those discussions or in the discussion of his infidelity during the 
marriage. 
 
A. He said that Nicole didn't like the things that he liked, that 
Nicole didn't go places with him, that Nicole didn't travel with him, 
so how was he supposed to be faithful. He said that it was - that he 
was unfaithful, because that's what he did. He didn't justify it other 
than to say, you know, it was Nicole's fault because she wouldn't 
travel with him. 
 
Q. Did you discuss with Mr. Simpson specific names of women he 
had dated during his marriage to Nicole? 
 
A. Paula Barbieri, I - 
 
Q. No, during his marriage, if you recall. 
 
A. No, I don't believe I had any conversations with him as far as 
names. 
 
Q. Now, how did you know that he was seeing Paula Barbieri 
during this attempted reconciliation with Nicole? 
 
A. We had heard that he had been seen by one of the tabloid 
magazines, with Paula. Nicole confronted O.J. with it and he lied, 
he denied it. 
 
Q. Nicole told you she confronted O.J. with it? 
 
A. Yes, she told me he - 
 
Q. Did Nicole tell you what O.J. said? 
 
A. She said he denied it. 
 
Q. Did he deny it to you on the telephone when he talked about 
Paula? 
 
A. No, he did not. 
 
Q. Did Nicole at any time ever break off the relationship during 
this approximate one-year period because Mr. Simpson was seeing 
Paula Barbieri again? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
A. I wouldn't say she didn't - I wouldn't say she broke it off. I 
would say she did confront him and spent maybe a week without 
him and they would talk it out and get back and try to continue 
with the reconciliation. 
 
Q. Are you aware of any other relationships that Mr. Simpson had 
during this reconciliation period, other than Paula Barbieri? 
 
A. No, I am not. Q. Would Mr. Simpson, during this period of 
time, this one-year or so period of this attempted reconciliation, 
call you more than one time a day? 
 
A. Sometimes Mr. Simpson, O.J., would call me six and seven 
times a day, sometimes more, sometimes less. 
 
Q. And would he call at all hours of the day or night? 
 
A. All hours. He used to call at 2 o'clock in the morning, 3 o'clock 
in the morning. 
 
Q. While you were sleeping? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And did you ever confront him with the fact that it's 3:00 in the 
morning and you are sleeping and why is he calling you? 
 
A. Every single time he called and woke me up I confronted him 
with it. 
 
Q. What did he say? 
 
A. "I just have to talk, I can't take it, l can't take it." Sorry. 
 
Q. That's what he would say? 
 
A. He had to talk. He had to talk. He had to release his anger, he 
had to release his frustrations. 
 
Q. Would you hang up on him? 
 
A. At times, I would. 
 
Q. Would you, at times, talk to him? 
 
A. Most of the times I would talk to him. I felt he was - when I 
would hang up on him, he would just call back, so I tried to talk 
him through it. 
 
Q. Would you tell Nicole about these conversations that you and 
Mr. Simpson would have? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. Did Mr. Simpson, to your knowledge, know that you were 
relating the information to Nicole? 
 
A. No, he did not. 
 
Q. Did he ask you not to? 
 
A. Yes, he did. 
 
Q. Your loyalty was to Nicole? 
 
A. Yes, it was. He used code names when he called my house. 
 
Q. He did? 
 
A. Yes, he did. 
 
Q. What do you mean by that? 
 
A. Because [Name Deleted] and Sydney were good friends. He did 
not want [Name Deleted] saying to Sydney, oh, your daddy is 
calling so much, your daddy called 10 times or your daddy called 
five times. So he used to say his name was Charles or James when 
he would call. 
 
Q. For the record, Sydney is whom? 
 
A. Nicole's daughter. 
 
Q. O.J.'s daughter? 
 
A. Yes, O.J.'s daughter. 
 
Q. So he didn't want his own daughter to know that he was calling 
so often when Sydney was at your home with [Name Deleted]? 
 
A. Yes. And he also didn't want [Name Deleted] telling Sydney 
when [Name Deleted] was at their home, that her father was calling 
our house all the time. 
 
Q. So he would leave the name - 
 
A. James or Charles. 
 
Q. Are these names that he told you were designated code names 
for O.J. Simpson? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did you have a code name, too? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Did you tell Nicole about these code names? 
 
A. Yes, I did. She was furious. 
 
Q. Do you know whether Nicole - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Withdrawn. 
 
Q. Did you, during this period of time when Nicole and O.J. were 
seeing each other again, ever see them get into arguments together? 
 
A. Many. 
 
Q. You witnessed them? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did you ever see O.J. get really angry at Nicole? 
 
A. Yes, l have. 
 
Q. Did you ever see him up close get angry at Nicole ? 
 
A. Yes, l did. 
 
Q. More than once? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Many occasions? 
 
A. Three that really stick out in my mind. 
 
Q. That you personally witnessed? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did O.J. Simpson, in your opinion, have a quick temper? 
 
A. Yes, he did. He had a very volatile - he was very volatile. 
 
Q. You have seen him fly off the handle? 
 
A. Yes, I have. 
 
Q. Now during those occasions when you saw Mr. Simpson get 
very angry toward Nicole, describe what his face would look like 
when he would get angry. And for that matter his - you can 
describe, like, his whole body. You know what I mean? 
 
A. Yes, I know. O.J. would get very - his facial structure, his jaw 
would protrude, his teeth would clench, sweat would come pouring 
from his head. You could see that his body, that he would perspire 
through his clothing. His eyes would get narrow and black. He 
became - and the only way to describe it is animalistic when he 
would become angry at Nicole. 
 
Q. And would this happen suddenly? 
 
A. It would happen within minutes. 
 
Q. You could visibly see these changes in his face? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. What about his body? Was there any body language that also 
changed? 
 
A. He just became bigger than life. He just got big. 
 
Q. Dominant? 
 
A. Very - it was very aggressive, just, you - 
 
Q. Did it frighten you? 
 
A. Absolutely. 
 
Q. How did you feel when you saw O.J. Simpson get that way? 
How did it make you feel? 
 
A. I felt very small and insignificant. I felt afraid for myself also. 
 
Q. Would he yell? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. What tone of voice? Loud? 
 
A. He would be very deep but very loud. It was as if a different 
person just took over and it was like watching a possessed man. 
 
Q. Would he use profanity? 
 
A. Oh, yes, the worst. The worst. 
 
Q . Were any of these three occasions where you witnessed Mr. 
Simpson in this way in public places? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did he - and he did this even though he was in public? 
 
A. He had no control over it. Yes. 
 
Q. You are saying he would use loud profanity, yelling, in public? 
 
A. Yes, he did. And one particular, the first time I had seen it was 
in Hermosa Beach at a sushi restaurant. 
 
Q. California Sushi? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Describe that incident, please? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Can we get a date, please? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: If you don't, you have the- 
 
Q. Give us your best recollection. We also can refer to your book if 
you want to refresh your recollection. 
 
A. To the best of my recollection, it was after we came back from 
Cabo San Lucas in 1993. 
 
Q. Would you turn to page 7 of your book, please, Exhibit 78 - 
 
MR. BREWER: Yes. That is the first one, 78. 
 
Q. On page 7, there is a chapter, there is chapter 2. Do you see 
that? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. What is the title of that chapter? 
 
A. "Rage." 
 
Q. And underneath "Rage," it says "Hermosa Beach, California, 
May 1993." Do you see that? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And in the second paragraph, it refers to California Beach 
Sushi. 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Is this the incident you are now going to describe to us? 
 
A. Yes, it is. 
 
Q. Why did you entitle this chapter, describing this incident 
"Rage"? 
 
A. Because I had never seen anything like that in my life, and that's 
all you - that's all it was, it was rage, it was rageful, it was 
frightening, it was frightening beyond belief for me. 
 
Q. Rage by O.J. Simpson? 
 
A. Rage by O.J. Simpson. I had never experienced seeing anyone 
like that in my life and it's the only way to describe it. 
 
Q. Okay. Tell us about the incident. 
 
A. We had - it was - that evening, O.J. had invited Nicole, 
Christian and myself to meet him in Long Beach at a taping, at an 
NBC taping where he was commentating. We met him, he finished 
his taping, and he said, let's go to this restaurant that I really like. 
So we did. It started out nice. Christian and O.J. had essentially 
just - we all, essentially Christian and myself, had just established 
a new friendship with O.J. and we were just - people were sending 
drinks to him and we were having a nice time, a really nice time, 
actually. 
 
Q. Christian got to know O.J. during this time of attempted 
reconciliation? 
 
A. This was essentially a month after they had reconciled. 
 
Q. Had Christian known Mr. Simpson before? 
 
A. No, never met him before. 
 
Q. Continue. Christian was your fianc then, right? 
 
A. Yes, he was. Nicole had mentioned, under her breath, the name 
Joseph and - to me. 
 
Q. Not to O.J. Simpson? 
 
A. No. To me. And O.J. overheard it. 
 
Q. Before you go on, Joseph is whom? 
 
A. Joseph [Name Deleted] is a man she had dated when she was 
single. 
 
Q. But all Nicole said was "Joseph"? 
 
A. All she said was "Joseph." 
 
Q. In reference to this matter. Continue. 
 
A. When she said it, O.J. became rageful, he went through all of 
these bodily contortions that I just described. He was - he just 
wouldn't stop and it was right at the sushi restaurant, we were at 
the sushi bar. I had not been used to this man's behavior, it was the 
first time I had ever seen that, and I said to Nicole, get him under 
control, and I went downstairs to the ladies room and O.J. followed 
me down and kept screaming in the bathroom, fucking bitch, how 
could she say that name? Why does she ruin everything? I mean, 
he called her every name under the sun, every name you could call 
a woman that was degrading, he called her, to me, while we were 
in the rest room. 
 
Q. Let me stop right there for a moment, Ms. Resnick. Did Mr. 
Simpson use loud profanity at the table before you went downstairs 
to the rest room and before he followed you? 
 
A. Yes, he did. He followed me down with the same routine, as I 
had just left. 
 
Q. So at the table, when he became rageful- 
 
A. It wasn't a table, it was a sushi bar, so there were many people 
witnessing it, yes. 
 
Q. So before he went downstairs, when he became rageful, as you 
described it, at the sushi bar, he began using loud profanity? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. That other people could hear? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. What did he say at that time? 
 
A. The same thing he said downstairs, That fucking bitch, why 
does she make me get like that, why does she mention that word? 
He- 
 
Q. Where was Nicole when Mr. Simpson said this? 
 
A. Nicole was sitting right next to him and she was making herself 
small and just trying to, you know, Stop, O.J., stop. I haven't - you 
know, it's not that big of a deal. Nicole just sat there and I tried to 
get her to apologize, you know, but - the only reason I tried to get 
her to apologize was to calm him down. 
 
Q. You went down into the ladies room? 
 
A. Mm-hmm. I went to the ladies room. He followed me down 
there. 
 
Q. Into the ladies room? 
 
A. He bypassed three women who were waiting in line and went 
into the ladies room and started urinating in front of me and he was 
screaming and he just wouldn't stop and I just said, I don't like this, 
I am not used to this, this is what you guys do, that's fine. I don't 
like this. And I left. 
 
Q. When he entered the ladies room, were you already in the ladies 
room? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did you see how he came through the door? Did he open it? Did 
he kick it? How did he come through ? 
 
A. He just pushed it open. It was a really flimsy lock, it wasn't 
even like a little lock. It was one of those small things that 
obviously I hadn't attached very well, not knowing somebody was 
going to try to get in, and he just bashed in the door, and I was 
washing my hands, which the door - and I was right here, the door 
was here, and he went and he started going to the bathroom in front 
of me and screaming. I left the ladies room and a couple of people 
had commented on how dare he, and I went upstairs, he followed 
me very brief, he was just briefly in there, and I said, I have to go, I 
can't be around this. I said - you know, I asked - I just wanted to 
go, so we all started leaving and we went downstairs - and I was 
really glad, as I was leaving, the manager was standing there, and I 
could see him, like, cringing for us, and we went downstairs and he 
started screaming again, continuing his screaming, his car was 
right in front. He grabbed Nicole, he said, Get in the car, you 
fucking cunt. And he grabbed her arm and - Nicole was saying to 
him, Please, O.J., calm down, I don't - I am too afraid to go with 
you right now, you are making me nervous, please, you're drunk. I 
didn't know what to do. I tried to calm him down. Christian was 
stunned. All of a sudden, the police - we saw a police pull up and I 
was so glad, and he asked us if we were okay. Nicole would not get 
in the car. He said, um, what's going on. O.J. started going into his 
loud, obnoxious continuation of, you know, it's all her fault, you 
know, she is this, she is that, she is this, degrading her, and the 
police officer asked him to get - to leave her alone, to calm down, 
to get in his car and to drive home, and we had made some 
comment that he was drunk, and he just didn't even respond to that, 
which upset me. The police officer had Nicole go home with 
Christian and I because Nicole had told him she was too afraid that 
he would beat her up, and that's how the evening ended. 
 
Q. Did Mr. Simpson appear to be drunk, to you? 
 
A. Oh, yes. He was very drunk. 
 
Q. You drove Nicole home that evening? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. To Rockingham - no, excuse me, to Gretna Green? 
 
A. I believe it was Rockingham. 
 
Q. This was May of 1993, when Nicole was living at Gretna 
Green? 
 
A. I believe so. 
 
Q. But you drove her back to Rockingham? 
 
A. No, pardon me, did I say Rockingham? I meant Gretna Green. 
He wouldn't have taken her to Rockingham in that condition. 
 
Q. So you drove her back to her own house? 
 
A. To her own house. 
 
Q. That's the first time you saw O.J. Simpson in a rageful 
condition? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Is that one of the reasons it sticks out  in your mind? 
 
A. Yes. And I will never forget that. 
 
Q. Now, you said there were some other incidents in which you 
also saw him exhibit the same kind of rage. When did they occur? 
When was the next one? 
 
A. The next one was in Toscana restaurant. 
 
Q. Before we go on into Toscana's, we are five minutes from a tape 
break, so I would rather just break it here, okay? So why don't we 
take a short break, you can stretch your legs. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 3:08. This is the end of the 
tape 1 in the deposition of Faye Resnick. 
 
(Recess taken .) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Is it is 4:15. We are back on the record. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q. Now that we have changed to a new tape, let's go back to where 
we were. You were going to tell us about the other two incidents in 
which you saw O.J. Simpson act in a rageful manner. One of them 
is an incident at Toscana's, and what is the other one, so we can get 
them in order? 
 
A. After an evening of being at the Harley Davidson Cafe in New 
York - 
 
Q. Which one occurred first? 
 
A. The Toscana incident occurred first, and the Harley Davidson 
incident occurred on October 16th. 
 
Q. In 1993? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Why don't you tell us about the Toscana's incident. 
 
A. Toscana - this was after July 4th, spending a long weekend in 
Laguna. 
 
Q. In 1993? 
 
A. In 1993, with O.J. and Nicole. We went to - Nic had called and 
said, Let's go to dinner. We had had a bad experience in Laguna 
Beach on July 4th with O.J. controlling us women - and this has - I 
am trying to be brief but I just want to make you understand 
quickly. I had, at that point, after the Laguna beach conversation 
over dinner at Las Brisas restaurant, said I had to question whether 
or not I wanted to be around O.J. in the future because he started 
interfering in my life that night by telling us girls that we, you 
know, we shouldn't smoke cigarettes and that we shouldn't - you 
know, we should be more attentive to our mates and - 
 
Q. I see you are trying to put this in the proper context, right? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Before you get to Toscana's, do you think it would be helpful to 
relate an incident that occurred at Las Brisas, right? 
 
A. Yes. Q. That occurred shortly after July 4th, 1993, when you 
and O.J. and others had gone to Laguna Beach, right? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And there was an incident at Las Brisas that you are now going 
to relate to us that you personally observed? 
 
A. Yes. I just briefly wanted to say one last thing about that 
incident - 
 
Q. At Las Brisas? 
 
A. At Las Brisas. I had told O.J. that if this is how he planned on 
having a friendship, I wasn't interested in being told how to 
behave. 
 
Q. Was O.J. complaining about people smoking? 
 
A. He was complaining about people smoking and he was 
complaining about the fact that we would go out to dinner. He was 
complaining that we had gone out dancing. 
 
Q. "We," being whom? 
 
A. Nicole, Cora and Cici and me. 
 
Q. So O.J. was complaining to you about you, Nicole, Cora and 
others all going out dancing, going out eating and smoking and 
things like that? Is that right? 
 
A. Yes. Yes. 
 
Q. Okay. 
 
A. And he was complaining to the men to control their women. 
 
Q. He was saying that? 
 
A. He was saying to the men, can't you control these - you know, 
can't you get them to behave, essentially. 
 
Q. You heard him say that? 
 
A. Yes. He said it to all of us, the entire table. And I had said that I 
didn't think our behavior was bad and I didn't think it was any of 
his business what I do in my personal life. 
 
Q. Okay. 
 
A. I had a problem with going the next night, the next time they 
asked me because I wasn't sure what he was going to do next. You 
know, I became nervous to go out with them because I never knew 
what was going to happen and I did agree because Nicole had said 
that, you know, he understood what I had said to him. I agreed to 
go that night, and I'm sorry I did. 
 
Q. What night? 
 
A. The night of Toscana. This is the next - 
 
Q. Now, who was present at Toscana's? 
 
A. Ron Fishman, Cora Fishman, Cynthia Shahian, Nicole, 
Christian Reichardt and O.J. Simpson. 
 
Q. And yourself? 
 
A. And me, yes. 
 
Q. Describe what happened. 
 
A. We were talking about golf, golfing, and it was okay, and then 
suddenly it - and then, Alessandro walked into the restaurant. 
 
Q. Marcello? 
 
A. Marcello walked in - 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Correcting the witness. 
 
Q . Is Alessandro the same person you referred to in the book as 
Marcello? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Okay. Please continue. 
 
MR. MARKS: May we just make it clear as to what the real name 
of the person was? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I had said earlier we would refer to him 
throughout as Marcello. If the witness is more comfortable - 
 
MR. MARKS: Just so the record will be clear as to what the real 
name of the person is. 
 
Q. What is his real name? 
 
A. Alessandro. 
 
Q. What did you call him? 
 
A. Alessandro.  Q. And what did Nicole call him? 
 
A. Alessandro. 
 
Q. Well, let's call him Alessandro, then. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Is there any difficulty with that, Mr. Leonard? 
Are you clear that Alessandro is one and the same as Marcello? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
Q. Let's go. 
 
A. Alessandro walked with us into Toscana, as he had many times 
before because that's where he used to eat all the time. But this 
time we were sitting there. And it was uncomfortable for me, 
because Alessandro was a good friend of mine, he was a good 
friend of Christian's, he introduced Christian and I together, 
initially, and he had also dated Nicole, and I was aware of the 
threat. So it was very uncomfortable, O.J. told everybody at the 
table not to turn around, not to - not to validate his presence, to 
look at him. 
 
Q. He said that? 
 
A. Uh-huh. And he started perspiring and he started going to his, 
his mood. It wasn't as bad as the sushi restaurant, it was not nearly 
as bad. But Nic had to hold him down on one side and I had to 
hold him down on the other side because he said he was going to 
beat him up. He said that he had threatened him before, that if he 
ever saw him again, he would beat him up. And there he was. 
 
Q. You are talking about what O.J. Simpson said? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. To you? 
 
A. To me. 
 
Q. And he said he was going to beat Alessandro? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And he said he had threatened him before? 
 
A. Yes. And I said to him - Nicole and I tried to keep him under 
control and we essentially pleaded with him to compose himself 
and he sat there, I would say, for 10 minutes in, just like this, 
shaking. The maitre d' noticed it. I got up, I went to the rest room. 
Alessandro was sitting at the counter where he was having, where 
he was dining, and I briefly said to him, Alessandro, you should 
leave, O.J. is threatening to beat you up. Toncredi, the maitre d', 
also noticed O.J.'s behavior, and he said to Alessandro, You should 
go. When I came out of the restroom, Alessandro was gone. O.J. 
was, at that point - he was calming down. He - I had never heard 
him, face-to-face, physically threaten somebody. That was 
threatening to me to watch. It was threatening to all of us to see his 
behavior. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Can I just interject? Was there a name of the 
maitre d'? I didn't catch that. 
 
THE WITNESS: Toncredi. 
 
Q. Let me ask you a question about smoking. Is O.J. Simpson a 
smoker? 
 
A. No, he is not. 
 
Q. Was he antismoking? 
 
A. Yes, he was. 
 
Q. Did he express that view to you and others? 
 
A. Over and over again. 
 
Q. Did he encourage Nicole to smoke? 
 
A. No. He put up a sign - 
 
Q. Excuse me? 
 
A. He put up a sign in the bathroom telling her that she couldn't, no 
smoking. 
 
Q . Do you know if O.J. Simpson ever gave Nicole a gold cigarette 
lighter? 
 
A. I have never heard of him giving her a gold cigarette lighter. 
 
Q. Do you know whether O.J. Simpson bought a gold cigarette 
lighter and had his children, Sydney and Justin, give it to Nicole as 
a birthday present in May of 1994? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. Absolutely not. Why would he do that? He hated her smoking. 
He would never do such a thing. 
 
Q. Did you ever hear O.J. Simpson say, complain to Nicole about 
smoking, in your presence? 
 
A. Yes. Many times. 
 
Q. And what did O.J. Simpson say on those occasions, to Nicole? 
 
A. He said that it was bad for her health and he didn't like the 
smell. He didn't think it was good for her image publicly. He felt - 
he said that he was an athlete and he didn't want her, his wife or 
future wife, to be ruining his image. 
 
Q. Did O.J. Simpson ever speak to you about his public image? 
 
A. Many times. 
 
Q. Could you tell us what O.J. Simpson said to you about his 
public image, and the importance of his public image? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I object. That's vague. At what point, at what 
time? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Just to attempt to cure your objections, which 
I don't think are valid, let me try to reframe the question again. 
 
Q. During the period of time from April of 1993 until Nicole's 
death, you testified that you had innumerable telephone 
conversations and personal conversations with O.J. Simpson? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And in any of those conversations did the subject of his public 
image ever come up? 
 
A. Many of them. 
 
Q. Okay. Do you remember each and every conversation or do 
they run together in your mind as all one? 
 
A. I have a very vivid memory. 
 
Q. So describe to us what he said to you in those conversations 
about his public image.  A. I will give you the best example that I 
can think of. 
 
Q. This is a good illustrative example? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Okay. 
 
A. We were in Cabo San Lucas in April of 1994. O.J. Simpson was 
driving a van and Bruce Jenner was in a seat - Bruce Jenner was in 
the car, Nicole was in the car, Christian was in the car, the children 
were in the car, there was probably 15 people in this van; it was 
jammed. We were going into town, and a car cut us off, and O.J. 
said, can you imagine if we had just been killed by that car. They 
would think we were in a van like a bunch of Mexicans, crammed 
in here, and Bruce, who do you think would get top billing, you or 
me? My comment to that was, our children were in the car, I think 
that would be the most important, if something happened. That was 
one incident where his image was all important. O.J. always said 
that we were to behave a certain way, Nicole in particular, because 
his image was very important to him. He told her that she could not 
leave him again because she had already ruined his public image 
when she called 911, then when she left him, and she felt - he felt 
that it was her fault that he - that she exposed it by calling 911, and 
then intensifying that by divorcing him, and these were all bruises 
to his public image. 
 
Q. Is this something that he said to you? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did O.J. Simpson, in these conversations with you about his 
image, make clear to you what kind of public image he wanted to 
project? 
 
A. Mm-hmm. Yes. 
 
Q. Tell us what O.J. Simpson said to you about the type of public 
image that he wanted to project. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Same objection as before. Without a foundation 
as to when, the time. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: We are referring to the same time period. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Just - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: We are talking about her conversations with 
Mr. Simpson in this time frame. 
 
MR. LEONARD: You are not talking about any particular 
conversation? 
 
Q. Did you have a number of conversations on this topic? 
 
A. A number of conversations. 
 
Q. Okay. In summarizing them, tell us what O.J. Simpson said to 
you on the type of public image that he wanted to project. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I object to the summarizing. 
 
Q. You may answer. If you can recall more specifically what he 
said, that's fine. As best you can recount. 
 
A. I think the smoking conversation, I'll go back to that, where he 
wanted to portray the clean, all-American athlete. Colorless. He 
didn't want to be - he just didn't want - he wanted to be - he wanted 
to be loved. 
 
Q . By whom ? 
 
A. By the public. 
 
Q. Is this what he said to you? 
 
A. Yes. He wanted to be loved and he enjoyed that. He said that he 
enjoyed the adoration that he gets from the public. I can understand 
that. 
 
Q. Did he say that to you? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did he try to avoid being seen in public? 
 
A. Never. 
 
Q. Did he use disguises to conceal his identity in public, the times 
that you were with him? 
 
A. No. Never. Au contraire. 
 
Q. Did he ever don a fake goatee or mustache in conceal his 
identity in public? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. O.J. Simpson wanted everybody to notice him. He liked - if 
people didn't notice him, he would raise his voice level for people 
to know he was there. 
 
Q. How do you know that? 
 
A. I was with him on many occasions when he wasn't getting 
enough attention, he would up the volume of his voice, so that 
people would realize that he was there. 
 
Q. And when - you mean, would he shun people who would come 
up to him in public? 
 
A. No. He was very gracious to people that came up to him in 
public. He was - I will say this: That from the plumber to the 
whoever, whatever, O.J. was very gracious, very charming, always 
took pictures with them, always made them feel important. 
 
Q. Just so I get an answer to this question, did you ever see him 
wear a fake goatee or mustache in public? 
 
A. Never. 
 
Q. Did you ever see him wear any disguise in public? 
 
A. Never. 
 
Q. Did he ever tell you that he was going to buy a disguise or use a 
disguise in order not to be recognized in public? 
 
A. He loved the public. He loved to be seen, he loved it. 
 
Q. So he - 
 
A. He never said that he ever would even - he never said that at all. 
 
Q. Did he ever tell you that when going out with the children to 
places like Disneyland or Knotts Berry Farm, that he would don a 
disguise to conceal his identity? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 
 
Q. Did he ever tell you that? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. He never told me that. I have been with O.J. Simpson in public 
numerous - too many times to count and he - I have been with him 
to all of these public places. He never - he enjoyed the attention. 
He never said he would ever not enjoy it. He didn't even like to go 
to other countries because he didn't get the attention in other 
countries . 
 
Q. Is that what he said to you? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Focusing on the children for a moment, did he ever discuss with 
you the subject of using a disguise when with the children in 
public? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
Q. Did he ever discuss that topic with you? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. O.J. Simpson never discussed ever using a disguise. As I said, I 
have been with him to a lot of different public places. I have been 
with him, with the Simpsons, to Disneyland. I have been with them 
to many public places. He never wore a disguise. 
 
Q. Did you ever go anyplace with O.J. Simpson and Sydney and 
Justin Simpson in public? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And did he ever wear a disguise? 
 
A. Absolutely not. 
 
Q. Did he ever try to avoid people or publicity on those occasions? 
 
A. Never. He loved it. 
 
Q. Did O.J. Simpson ever discuss with you whether Nicole's 
conduct was hurting or helping his public image? 
 
A. Yes, he did. 
 
Q. What did he say on that subject? 
 
A. O.J. had said, right before Nicole was murdered, in a 
conversation that I had with him over the phone, that Nicole had 
ruined his public image twice before and he was not about - not 
about ready to let her ruin it again by leaving him. 
 
Q. Tell me when that conversation occurred. 
 
A. The conversation occurred on May 2nd or May 3rd of 1994. 
 
Q. And tell me as best as you can recall, what else O.J. Simpson 
said on that occasion. 
 
A. That was the phone call that O.J. said he would kill Nicole. 
 
Q. Tell us everything that was said in that telephone conversation 
by O.J. Simpson and by you. 
 
A. O.J. was - there was a - their relationship at that point was very 
volatile and Nicole had told him she never wanted to see him 
again, and due to the fact that he had just - we had just gotten back 
from Cabo San Lucas and he had blatantly, in front of all of - in 
front of the Jenners, in front of myself, in front of Christian, in 
front of all of us, flirted with a blonde woman at the table that we 
were at, and then - 
 
Q. In Cabo - 
 
A. In Cabo San Lucas. And then O.J. that night or the next night 
had said, was making jokes about being a frogman, telling us about 
how he was learning all of these techniques with, you know, 
underwater night - you know. He was telling us about his filming 
of The Frogman episode and talking about the wet suit and talking 
about how his wife's biggest fear is frogs and he was now The 
Frogman, and saying, What do you think of this, and Nicole 
responded in a way, I don't think that's funny, O.J., I don't think it's 
funny at all. Nicole, from those two incidences, went from willing 
and ready to actually marry this man, in Cabo San Lucas, when we 
were there, to, I never want to see him again, I know he is going to 
kill me, I know this is all - that I cannot be with him anymore. 
 
Q. Let me stop you right there. What you just described occurred 
in Cabo San Lucas? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And you were present? 
 
A. Yes, I was. 
 
Q. And you witnessed those statements by O.J. Simpson? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. And by Nicole Brown Simpson? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. And this was in late April 1994? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I'm going to object to your characterization of 
the statements. There was a rambling answer. It wasn't clear to me 
at all there were statements - there might have been some 
statements in there. Some of them were thought processes and so 
forth, so - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Leonard, I don't believe you were 
listening to the testimony. Because I believe the witness described 
all kinds of statements by O.J. Simpson. In any event, the record 
will speak for itself. 
 
Q. You said that Nicole Brown Simpson had a fear of frogs? 
 
A. She had a phobia of frogs. 
 
Q. Did she ever tell you that? 
 
A. Oh, yeah. 
 
Q. Describe what she said to you about her fear of frogs? 
 
A. She said that - she said that she wasn't afraid of anything. This 
was - she didn't have phobias, she wasn't a girl that used to go in 
for - she was - let me just keep it brief. She said that she had a 
phobia against frogs. In fact, my ex-fiance had a frog collection, a 
ceramic collection, that she didn't even go close to. She was 
phobic. She was afraid of frogs and she - she was afraid of frogs. 
 
Q. Did she ever tell you what it was about frogs that frightened 
her? 
 
A. No, she never did. 
 
Q. Who was this ex-fiance that had the frog collection? 
 
A. Christian Reichardt. 
 
Q. Now, back to Cabo. Did O.J. Simpson say anything to Nicole 
on the subject of frogs or the frogman? 
 
A. He said - he explained to us the frogman episode. He explained 
that he loved the episode, that he felt like it was - it was exciting, 
and then he went on to make jokes about how Nicole feared frogs 
more than anything in the world and he was now the frogman. 
 
Q. Did he say that? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. What did he say? 
 
A. He said - 
 
MR. MARKS: Didn't you just ask her that? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I want to make sure I am understanding. 
 
Q. Just tell me, as best you remember, what did he say about being 
the frogman? 
 
A. He said, Isn't it interesting or isn't it funny that my wife's 
biggest fear is frogs and I'm the frogman. 
 
Q. You heard him say that? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And you saw Nicole's reaction? 
 
A. Oh, yes. 
 
Q. And what was it? 
 
A. She said, That's not funny at all; I'm afraid of this. She - Nicole 
went - I think maybe Nicole was - he had just at that point, from 
that moment, Nicole stopped blocking any of the - she stopped 
fantasizing that the relationship could work. 
 
Q. Now on this same trip in Cabo - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Withdrawn. 
 
Q. How did - did you see Mr. Simpson's reaction to Nicole's 
reaction to the frogman comment? 
 
A. I didn't really notice his reaction. 
 
Q. Okay. During this same trip, you said you saw, with your own 
eyes, Mr. Simpson flirting with another woman'? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Was Nicole present when Mr. Simpson did that? 
 
A. Yes, she was. 
 
Q. Did she see Mr. Simpson do that? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. Did she say anything to you about it? 
 
A. She just - at the time, she didn't respond. She just looked like, in 
disgust. 
 
Q. Did you see Mr. Simpson - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Withdrawn. 
 
Q. Did Mr. Simpson say anything to you or you to him, about this 
flirting episode? 
 
A. Yes, I did. I had a conversation with he and Kris Jenner about it 
afterwards. 
 
Q. And tell me what you said and what Mr. Simpson said in that 
conversation. 
 
A. Nicole had went to the restroom and Kris and I had said, why 
are you doing this so blatantly, so openly? You are not only 
embarrassing us, you are embarrassing Nicole. Why are you doing 
this? I'm not doing anything. I'm just a little flirting. Our children 
are here, your wife is here. It's not funny. 
 
Q. Were the children present at the restaurant when Mr. Simpson 
was doing the flirting? 
 
A. Yes, they were. Yes, they were. 
 
Q. And who were the children? 
 
A. Sydney and Justin and I believe a couple of the Jenners' 
children. 
 
Q. Can you describe the flirtatious activity that you saw Mr. 
Simpson do? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Please do so. 
 
A. We were sitting at the very edge of the restaurant at the wall and 
O.J. and Nicole were sitting on this side, and the bar was here. I 
had my back to the bar, facing the Simpsons, and I could see, O.J.'s 
face started doing the - you know, he started flirting and I -you 
know, what is he looking at, so I turned around and looked, and 
there was this blonde girl that was flirting back with him. And they 
were waving, they were smiling and they were winking. It was 
disgusting. It was - it was blatant. And that was it. 
 
Q. Okay. Did you - I think you said previously that when Nicole 
went on this trip to Cabo, she was prepared to remarry Mr. 
Simpson? 
 
A. Oh, they were this close. They were both so ready to remarry. 
 
Q. How long were the Simpsons in Cabo, during this trip? 
 
A. We had stayed longer, Nicole and I. O.J., I believe, was there 
for three days, three or four days. 
 
Q. And he left? 
 
A. And he left to go to Puerto Rico to continue the filming of the 
frogman. He was strictly on break. 
 
Q. And by the way, going back to the frogman incident, did Mr. 
Simpson describe to you and the others that were present, the - any 
particular episode or sequence in the frogman movie that he was 
filming? 
 
A. Only that he loved the filming of it, that he got to - only what I 
had said earlier. 
 
Q. Did he describe any scene, any - 
 
A. No, he did not. 
 
Q. -- any action by him? 
 
A. No, he did not. 
 
Q. Did he mention anything about using a knife? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection, leading. 
 
A. No, he did not. 
 
Q. Did the subject of a knife come up? 
 
A. No, it did not. 
 
Q. Okay. Do you know whether Nicole told O.J. about her change 
of heart before Mr. Simpson left to go to Puerto Rico? 
 
A. No, she did not. 
 
Q. Do you know that she did not tell him - 
 
A. Yes, I know that she did not. 
 
Q. And how do you know that? 
 
A. Because I had asked her. 
 
Q. You asked her what? 
 
A. I asked her if she had told him. She said, no, I'm not going to 
tell him yet. 
 
Q. Now, you said that after these two incidents, namely the flirting 
incident and the frogman incident, that Nicole expressed to you her 
feeling that she was finished with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A. She expressed to me that she felt that all of the thoughts that she 
had had in the past all of the threats that he had made to her in the 
past of killing her, would some day come true and she wanted 
nothing more to do with him, nothing. 
 
Q. She said that to you? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did she - 
 
A. She said it was over. 
 
Q. She said it was over? 
 
A. Mm-hmm. 
 
Q. Between her and Mr. Simpson? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And what did she say to you about the subject of threats? What 
did she say specifically about that, to you? 
 
A. This is when Nicole - the next day, that O.J. left, this is when 
Nicole told me about all of the abuse, and she also told me about 
all of the threats and she also told me about - from that night on, 
Nicole was a different person. Nicole was no longer in a fantasy 
world. She had realized that all of the threats, she remembered all 
of the abuse. She had broken through that pearl that she had 
formed around the abuse and was now having a catharsis by telling 
me about it. 
 
Q. The two of you were alone? 
 
A. Yes, we were. 
 
Q. Where were you? 
 
A. We were at the Palmilla restaurant in Cabo San Lucas. 
 
Q. Was this a long conversation over dinner? 
 
A. It was before dinner. We had left early and others had joined us 
after that for dinner. 
 
Q. And Nicole sort of poured all of this out? 
 
A. Everything. 
 
Q. How long did that conversation last before the others joined 
you? 
 
MR. MARKS: Approximately. 
 
Q. Approximately. An hour? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
Q. How long did it last? 
 
A. I couldn't tell you. I didn't - I - 
 
Q. Well, as best you can recall, what did Nicole say about abuse 
and threats? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I didn't hear the end of your question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: About abuse and threats. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Okay. 
 
Q. What did Nicole say to you in that conversation about abuse and 
threats? 
 
A. Nicole had said that - when I asked her, because - I knew she 
was afraid of frogs and I knew that there had been abuse, but it was 
such a dramatic change that she had made, and it was so quick, that 
I needed to talk with her about it, so I asked her, what is going on, 
explain to me the - you know, why you have suddenly changed 
your mind so abruptly when you knew all of this stuff in the past, 
this is the same man. And she said, it just all came pouring back to 
her the night he had talked of frogs, the night he was flirting, 
blatantly flirting, that he had threatened her life many a time, 
threatened to take her children away from her. He had beaten her 
too many times to count, he had locked her in a closet and beat her 
with wine bottles. He had bruised her, broken her ribs, sent her to 
the hospital, made her tell the doctor that she was - she had fallen 
off a bicycle; that on one particular occasion he had locked her in 
the closet and - he had locked her in the closet and he had beat her, 
kicked her, slapped her, pulled her hair, threw her in the closet and 
left her there for 15 minutes, and then she came back to - and he 
came back and opened the door and she thought he was going to let 
her out and he started beating her again and he continued doing 
that all night long to her; that every time she would think that he 
would come back he was going to kill her. She thought that he was 
going to beat her to death that night. And he would go and watch a 
football game between the times that she was left in the closet. And 
that was unbelievable to me. Nicole thought she was going to die 
that night. She had told - 
 
Q. The night of the beating? 
 
A. The night of that particular beating. 
 
Q. That was what she was telling you? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Okay. Please continue. 
 
A. She had told me about the pregnancy beatings, when he used to 
kick her in the stomach and tell her that she was worthless and he 
talked to her, he beat her. When she found the earrings that he had 
given to Tawny Kitaen, he - she had told me that she had had so 
many beatings over Tawny Kitaen that she couldn't even count 
them. And she said that - she said that Sydney saw some of them 
and, um - 
 
Q. Take your time. 
 
A. She - can I stop for a minute, please? 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Are we going off the record? 
 
MR. MARKS: Yes. Let's go off the record now. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 4:56. We are going off the 
record. 
 
(Discussion off the record.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 4:57. We are back on the 
record. 
 
Q. I realize this is very difficult for you, Miss Resnick, and I 
apologize. We will try to get through this as quickly as we can. 
You were telling us about the evening when, in Cabo, Nicole was 
relating to you, really for the first time, the history of abuse and 
threats at the hand of Mr. Simpson. Is that right? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection to the leading. 
 
Q. Is that what you - 
 
A. That is correct. 
 
Q. Now, did she mention anything to you about an incident in Las 
Vegas? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. Can you describe what Nicole said to you about that incident? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
A. Nicole said that she had been at a party with O.J. in Las Vegas 
and there was a lot of important people there and she had 
embarrassed him in some way in front of Dean Martin, people that 
were important to him, and he told her that he wanted her to go to 
the room until she was - until he had joined her, until he was ready 
to come, and she did. And when he came to the room, he - she was 
in her panties, getting undressed, and he just attacked her because 
he said that she embarrassed him, and he viciously beat her that 
night and he threw her outside in the corridor of the hotel and left 
her there. That's what she said. 
 
Q. In talking to you about the many beatings resulting from Mr. 
Simpson's relationship with Tawny Kitaen, did the subject of 
earrings ever come up? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. What did Nicole Brown Simpson say to you about that? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection to the leading. 
 
A. I had mentioned the earrings prior. She was walking - she was 
cleaning up around the house and she was putting something in his 
dresser drawer and she saw a little red box and she opened the box 
and there was a beautiful pair of earrings inside and she - 
 
Q. By "beautiful," do you mean expensive? 
 
A. Yeah. She said they were very big, very expensive. She thought 
they were very expensive. 
 
Q. More than a thousand dollars? 
 
A. She said something like $20,000. And she was thinking it was - 
they were coming to her as a present because her birthday was 
coming. 
 
Q. This is while she was married to Mr. Simpson? 
 
A. This is while she was married to Mr. Simpson. And she put 
them back, you know, wanted to be surprised with them. And her 
birthday rolled around and she never received the earrings. And 
she had found out through a friend that O.J. had given those 
earrings to [Name Deleted] and she was - and Tawny was walking 
around town, flaunting them, this is my present from O.J. And 
Nicole eventually heard all of this stuff back. I mean, she heard all 
of the gossip. O.J., you know, was a star at the time, I guess, when 
it happened. Nicole had heard, and also a friend had mentioned it 
to her. And she got really upset about it and she asked him about it 
and he beat her up viciously that night because - 
 
Q. That's what Nicole told you? 
 
A. Yes. Because she was not supposed to ask questions about his 
private life and he - she said that he made it her fault, like he makes 
everything her fault. She told me that he had been beating her since 
she was 17. And that's all I can recall. 
 
Q. This is the evening, and the conversation in Cabo when Nicole 
told you that she had had it with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A. Mm-hmm. Yes, it is. 
 
MR. MARKS: May we adjourn? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Sure. 
 
MR. MARKS: Are you finished with this area, at the current point? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: We can adjourn here, if you would like. 
 
MR. MARKS: Okay. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 5:03. This is the end of tape 
number 2 of the deposition of Ms. Resnick and we are adjourned 
for today.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Good morning. Today 
is February 11th, 1996. The time is 10:33 a.m. 
This is tape number 3 of the continued videotape of 
Faye Resnick. 
 
CONTINUED EXAMINATION 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q. Good morning, Ms. Resnick. 
 
A. Good morning. 
 
Q. If at any time you want to take a break, let us know. Feel free to 
stop at any time if you need to, okay? I would like to go back to 
sort of where we were yesterday at the end of the day. You were 
telling us about your conversation with Nicole before dinner at the 
Palmilla restaurant in Cabo San Lucas. Do you remember that? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. In that conversation, did Nicole say, one way or the other, 
whether she thought that O.J. Simpson might kill her? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
Q. Did she discuss the subject of whether - 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. - of whether O.J. Simpson might or might not kill her? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. What did she say on that subject? 
 
A. She said that O.J. had always threatened to kill her in the past 
and that she believes now that that could be a possibility. That's it. 
 
Q . Did she indicate why she thought that that might now be a 
possibility? 
 
A. She said that once reliving all of the beatings that she had just 
relived in the past day, that she was able to see it clearly for what it 
was. 
 
Q. Did Nicole express any concern to you about O.J. - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Withdrawn. 
 
Q. Did Nicole say anything to you about how O.J. Simpson might 
react when Nicole told him about her plan to end the relationship? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. What did she say about that? 
 
A. That was her biggest fear. She felt and she said to me that one 
of the reasons she had waited so long to end their relationship 
before asking for a divorce was that she was afraid he would 
follow through on the threats that he had made to her of killing her, 
if she left him, or if - she also said that she was very afraid of 
losing her children to him because he was, he had threatened to 
take her kids away. That's what she said. 
 
Q. Did she say these things - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Withdrawn. 
 
Q. Did she say she feared these things now or in the past? 
 
A. She said she had feared them in the past, that's why she didn't 
leave earlier, and she also said that she felt that they would come to 
fruition if she left him again. 
 
Q. During this Cabo trip, did you ever hear O.J. Simpson discuss 
or talk about the subject of the agreements or ground rules that 
Nicole and he had set up for their reconciliation a year before? 
 
A. Not during this particular trip to Cabo San Lucas, that was not 
discussed. 
 
Q. And did you ever talk to O.J. Simpson about that at any time? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. When? 
 
A. It was on a trip to Cabo San Lucas that Nicole and I had 
planned for Mother's Day. We took our children to Cabo by 
ourselves. 
 
Q. I assume that's Mother's Day 1993? 
 
A. 1993. 
 
Q. Okay. 
 
A. She had just initiated the reconciliation and O.J. - she told O.J. 
that she was going on a trip, we were taking our children, he asked 
her where, she said to Cabo San Lucas, and he asked if he could 
join us in Cabo. She asked me because it was my ex-husband's 
villa that we were staying in, and, of course, I said, if that's what 
you want, Nicole. O.J. stayed in my villa for - at that time it was 
my ex-husband's villa, since I had now divorced him - for five 
days, he stayed with us. And during that time the reconciliation 
almost fell apart and I had a conversation with O.J. after Nicole 
and he had a very large dispute, I asked him the - 
 
Q. One moment, Ms. Resnick. Where were you with Mr. Simpson 
when you had this conversation? 
 
A. We were outside the pool area, under the palapa. 
 
Q. Just the two of you alone? 
 
A. Just the two of us alone. Nicole was with the children in the 
pool upstairs in our villa. 
 
Q. Tell me what Mr. Simpson said to you. 
 
A. He said that Nicole would not talk to him, that she had called 
off the reconciliation, that - and I asked him why. I was downstairs 
already, so he came storming out of the villa after they had had this 
fight. So that's when I said, let's sit down, let's talk about what 
happened, and he said that he had told her what the boundaries 
were for their new relationship, their reestablished relationship and 
that she wasn't willing to meet his demands, and I asked him what - 
 
Q. And he was not willing to - 
 
A. She was not willing to meet his demands. 
 
Q. Okay. 
 
A. And I asked him at that time what they were and he had said 
that she did not want him interfering with her friendships, she did 
not want him controlling her, she did not want him to do drugs and 
she did not want him to beat her and she did not want him to have 
extramarital affairs. He disagreed with that and I had said to him 
that these are the same ground rules that you went into the 
relationship. 
 
Q. When you say that O.J. Simpson disagreed with that, are you 
saying that he told you he disagreed with that? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. What did he say to you after he told you that he disagreed with 
those ground rules? 
 
A. That they were ridiculous. He said that she wants to - if she 
wants to have a relationship, she has to abide by the rules, and I 
said to him that those were not the ground rules - that those were 
the rules Nicole had set up originally when you two first started 
talking about the reconciliation. And he said he started telling her 
his ground rules and she also disagreed with those. 
 
Q. What were his ground rules that he told you? 
 
A. He told me that he didn't want her being, spending too much 
time with her friends, he didn't want her having male friendships, 
any males coming to their home. He wanted her to understand that 
she was now going to be in a relationship with him and that she 
would put him first, that he wanted to have her tell him about all of 
the different affairs that she had while they were separated, while 
she was a single woman. 
 
Q. Did he tell you anything in this conversation about whether he 
was willing to be monogamous? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
A. Yes, he did. 
 
Q. What did he say on that subject? 
 
A. He said that he was willing to do whatever it took to keep their 
marriage - to keep their marriage on the right track. 
 
Q. Did O.J. Simpson say anything to you about this conversation 
with Nicole that you just mentioned wherein Nicole and he 
discussed their former or other romantic relationships? 
 
A. Excuse me, did - the question is had I spoken to him about this 
before or after? 
 
Q. Well, what I am trying to find out, Ms. Resnick, is whether you 
and Mr. Simpson had any conversations about Nicole and O.J. 
talking about their other relationships. 
 
A. Yes, we did. 
 
MR. LEONARD: May I interject for a minute? Because I think I 
am confused. These were all discussions that were had at the same 
time at Cabo, is that - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I don't know when this - 
 
MR. LEONARD: Can we find out? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, that's what I'm going to find out, if such 
discussions even occurred, and if they did, then I will find out 
when. 
 
MR. LEONARD: But the discussions we have just been talking 
about did occur at Cabo? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Everything so far she has been describing is 
the one at Cabo in Mother's Day of '93, okay? 
 
Q. Now, my next question of you is whether you and O.J. Simpson 
ever have a conversation about O.J. and Nicole discussing their 
other relationships. 
 
A. Yes, we did. 
 
Q. When did you have that conversation with O.J. Simpson? 
 
A. About a month later. 
 
Q. A month later than Mother's Day of '93 ? 
 
A . Yes. 
 
Q. Where were you and he? 
 
A. To my best recollection, it was over the telephone. 
 
Q. Relate that conversation, please. 
 
A. O.J. had invited Nicole for dinner at Georgio's restaurant and 
they were to work out their details, work out all of the problems. 
O.J. asked Nicole to tell him about every single man that she had 
ever been with while she was single, during the separation. And 
Nicole - O.J. told me she did not want to go into that, but O.J. 
insisted and he said he did. He said it was very important for them 
to air all of their dirty laundry, to work all of the details out, to 
know everything; if they were going to have a relationship, they 
must have everything on the table. Nicole felt that that was - 
Nicole had told him in Cabo San Lucas that that was a bad idea, 
she did not want to do that. But he had insisted and at the Georgio 
dinner she had told him everybody she had been with. She left out 
one name and, until he badgered her over it, and that was the name 
of Marcus Allen, because she was afraid to tell him. 
 
Q. You are now - you are continuing to relate everything that O.J. 
Simpson said to you? 
 
A. I am relating everything that O.J. Simpson said to me. 
 
Q. In this telephone conversation? 
 
A. In this telephone conversation, yes. 
 
Q. Please continue. 
 
A. I am only supposed to relate what he said to me; is that correct? 
 
Q. You can also indicate what you said to him, in the same 
conversation. 
 
MR. LEONARD: But the witness is representing that everything 
she said was things that O.J. represented to her, up until this point, 
is that right? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Not represented to her, said to her. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Said to her, okay. 
 
A. Said to me. I asked him why he wanted to know those things. I 
told him that that was not part of the reconciliation, that was 
harmful, that they had agreed in Cabo San Lucas that they would 
not do that. That's one of the reasons why they continued to try to 
reconcile because they had come to an agreement in Cabo that they 
needed to compromise on their boundaries and that was against the 
agreement, and I also said to him that I didn't appreciate being put 
in that position, and he told me that she had told him that she was 
with Marcus Allen, against her will and that he just lost it. He felt - 
he said that he told Nicole that that was the one thing she should 
have never done, that if he ever saw her with Marcus again, he 
didn't know what he would do. 
 
Q. That's what O.J. Simpson told you? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did you have any knowledge of what the relationship between 
O.J. Simpson and Marcus Allen was? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. Yes, I do. 
 
Q. Please tell us. 
 
A. They were - they had been friends for many, many years. They - 
besides A.C. Cowlings, probably his second best friend. 
 
Q. And how do you know that? 
 
A. O.J. had said that when he said to me that, how could she be 
with one of my best friends. And I was familiar with their 
relationship because I was around. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Did we get a date on that one? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
MR. LEONARD: What date? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: One month after Mother's Day 1993. 
 
MR. LEONARD: We don't have a location, or a telephone call - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: A telephone call. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Okay. 
 
Q . Did - yesterday, you said that there was an incident in which 
you saw O.J. Simpson act rageful that occurred at the Harley 
Davidson Cafe? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Could you describe that incident, please? 
 
A. Nicole and I had flown to meet O.J. in New York in October the 
16th, 1993, for the opening of his friend Mark Packer's restaurant 
in New York. We were told to pick up The Enquirer before we 
came, by O.J., Nicole was, so we did. And on the plane we were 
reading the article about Nicole and O.J.'s reconciliation. 
 
Q. What's the time frame here? 
 
A. October 16th. 
 
Q. 19-what? 
 
A. 1993. 
 
Q. Please continue. 
 
A. So we had read this article and it was about their reconciliation 
and then it went into the battering of 1989, and we landed in New 
York. Nicole was nervous because the article had restated the 
battering and she was nervous that O.J. would be upset. At first he 
wasn't; he was in a grand mood, he was very gracious and seemed 
to be very happy that we were there. We all got ready to - pardon 
me. We must have flown in on the 15th, because Christian 
Reichardt joined us on the 16th, joined us in New York. We had 
flown in a little earlier. And we all went to the Harley Davidson 
opening, which was fine. Then the next day we were still staying at 
their - with O.J. Christian had left that morning, so it was the three 
of us. We went out to dinner, once again at the Harley Davidson 
Cafe with Mark Packer and that was the day O.J. Simpson pulled 
out a vial of cocaine at the table. He became- 
 
Q. What did he do with that cocaine? 
 
A. He snorted it. He - 
 
Q. Did you see him snort the cocaine? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. He did it in your presence? 
 
A. He did it in everybody's presence. 
 
Q. But you saw him do it? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. This is October 1993? 
 
A. Yes, it is. 
 
Q. O.J. Simpson denied using cocaine at all in 1993. Would that be 
a lie? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. That would be a lie. 
 
MR. MARKS: Would you care to ask the witness whether there 
was ever any other occasion on which you had seen O.J. do it? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I plan to. 
 
Q. O.J. Simpson has testified in his deposition, under oath, that he 
never used cocaine or any other illegal drug during the year 1993 
and 1994, and I was not permitted to inquire in earlier years. Did 
you ever see O.J. Simpson take drugs, illegal drugs, other than on 
this occasion? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. How many other occasions? 
 
A. One other occasion. 
 
Q. When was that? 
 
A. It was on the 23rd of December, 1993, at a Christmas party that 
Nicole and O.J. had had, a very intimate, just close friends. I 
arrived early and A.C. Cowlings was there, Nicole was there. 
 
Q. Where was this? 
 
A. At O.J.'s house on Rockingham. 
 
Q. Please continue. 
 
A. And O.J. was using cocaine that night. 
 
Q. You saw him? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. Do you remember where he was when he was using the 
cocaine? 
 
A. He was sitting on the - we were in the living room and the 
cocaine he had taken from the bar area, where A.C. was standing, 
and Nicole and he were - Nicole was sitting at O.J.'s feet wrapping 
presents, and I saw him toot cocaine. 
 
Q. Can you describe the visible effect that cocaine had on O.J. 
Simpson? 
 
A. Yes, I can. 
 
Q. Please do so. 
 
A. O.J.'s face became very distorted. His jaw locked up. I can only 
say that he could hardly talk. He - it was weird, it was really weird. 
There was a physical change in him. 
 
Q. At the Harley Davidson Cafe, did - where was he when you saw 
him take the cocaine, or use the cocaine? 
 
A. I was situated - the table was a booth. Cocaine - oh, cocaine. 
O.J., pardon me, was sitting in the middle of the booth, I was 
sitting on this side, Nicole was sitting next to me, O.J. was here, 
Mark Packer was here. 
 
Q. There in the restaurant? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did you ever have any conversations with O.J. Simpson on the 
subject of his use of drugs? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. How many conversations?

Q. A number of them? 
 
A. I would say so. 
 
Q. In these conversations, Ms. Resnick, did O.J. Simpson admit or 
deny the use of drugs? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. O.J. admitted to using drugs. It's no secret. 
 
Q. Tell us what O.J. Simpson said to you in these conversations on 
the subject of drugs. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague. Which conversation? 
 
Q. On the number of conversations that you have witnessed - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: She just said she had with O.J. Simpson on 
the subject of drugs. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. You are asking the witness did O.J. 
say the same thing in each conversation? Is that what you are 
asking her? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am asking her to relate to us her recollection 
of her conversations with O.J. Simpson on the subject of drugs. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Just in general, is that what you are asking? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: As generally or as specifically as she can 
recall. 
 
MR. LEONARD: You don't care? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I don't care about what? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Whether it is general or specific? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I just want her to give me best recollection. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I object. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You object to her giving her best 
recollection? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Without specifying date, time and place, yes. 
 
Q. If you can do so, specify date, time and place. If you can't, just 
give your best recollection. That's all we are entitled to have at a 
deposition or in court. 
 
A. Okay. I had two conversations that stick out in my mind.

Brown and myself. 
 
Q. Where did this conversation occur?

Q. What did O.J. Simpson say on the subject of drugs? 
 
A. I had just one week before or six days before had an operation 
and my doctor had prescribed medication, pain medication for this 
operation, and we were at the dinner table and I went to take my 
pain medication with my meal, because that's when you take it, and 
O.J. said to me at that time, be careful, you know, I used to be 
addicted to co - to pills, and I said, I have been taking a pill to 
relieve some pain after a medication - I mean, after an operation, is 
a little bit different than an addiction to taking pills on a daily 
basis, and he - and that was that conversation. 
 
Q. Did he say what pills he used to be addicted to taking? 
 
A. He never told me the pills that he was addicted to.

MR. MARKS: That's what she just said. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Okay. I am sorry, I was just writing.

when he was a football star, that he became addicted to every pill 
there was, to uppers to downers, she said he had a Christmas tree 
jar full of every kind of pill, and they called it their - he called it his 
Christmas tree because it was every color of the lights that we 
would see on a Christmas tree. She said that they were - that he 
needed to have pills to go to sleep, he needed to have pills to wake 
up, he needed to have pills for pain, he needed to have a lot of 
speed during the time that he was playing pro ball. She had 
essentially said that he was addicted to his - to every kind of pill 
there was.

Q. You may answer. 
 
A. Nicole said that there were times when O.J. would use drugs 
heavily. 
 
Q. During that time frame?

times that he wouldn't. You know, he was a periodic user and it 
was very well known to everybody. It was certainly well known to

Q. At page 262 of his deposition, O.J. said that in January 1994

That is at page 263, excuse me.

Q. At page 1,204 or thereabouts in Mr. Simpson's deposition, O.J. 
Simpson testifies that, or testified, that Nicole was having a 
breakdown after the trip, after Mr. Simpson's trip to Puerto Rico. 
Let me see if I can find that for you. At page 1,204 of Mr. 
Simpson's deposition: 
 
"Question: What happened after Puerto Rico to set you back with 
Nicole? 
 
"Answer: Well, while I was in Puerto Rico, something was going 
on with Nicole. She was, like, she even said to me on two 
occasions she felt like she was having a nervous breakdown, but 
she couldn't explain why or what it was, it was just - I would talk 
to her one minute, she was the Nicole I knew. And then if I talked 
to her the next day, she was somebody I didn't know. 
 
"I expressed my concern to her mother while I was in Puerto Rico. 
I tried to get a hold of Cora, but she was going through her 
problems. I talked to Faye, who blamed it on Cora, and when I 
came home, I just - it was just something I did not want to have to 
deal with in my life. I just didn't want to deal with it anymore." 
 
End of quotes. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Is there a question? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, if you would permit me time to ask it, I 
will do so now, Mr. Leonard. 
 
Q. Having now read that testimony to you, do you know whether 
or not Nicole was manifesting signs of a nervous breakdown in or 
around April or May of 1994? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I object to the form of the question, to the 
preamble. It's leading. Go ahead, answer. 
 
Q. You may answer the question. 
 
A. I have no knowledge of Nicole ever having anywhere close to a 
nervous breakdown. I - she was very stressed at the end of her life, 
due to the fact that her life was threatened. 
 
Q By whom? 
 
A. By O.J. Simpson. But at that particular time that you are talking 
about, Nicole just didn't want to talk to O.J. He would call her 
constantly and she would tell him, stop calling me. 
 
Q. Now, the particular time is when O.J. Simpson went to Puerto 
Rico after Cabo. 
 
A. Right. 
 
Q. And this is April 1994? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Now, O.J. Simpson testified, as you just heard me read from his 
transcript, that he talked to you about his concern over Nicole and 
that you blamed it on Cora. Did you and O.J. Simpson have a 
conversation, while O.J. Simpson was in Puerto Rico? 
 
A. Yes, we did. 
 
Q. How many such conversations did you have? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Withdrawn. 
 
Q. Did you have more than one conversation? 
 
A. Yes, we did. 
 
Q. Now, Mr. Simpson was in Puerto Rico and you were where, 
during these conversations? 
 
A. In my - at my home during one of the conversations, and the 
other one was in my office. 
 
Q. Did you ever have a conversation with Mr. Simpson when he 
was in Puerto Rico and you were still in Cabo? 
 
A. No, I did not. 
 
Q. Okay. So after Cabo, you went back to Los Angeles? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And while you were in Los Angeles, you received calls from 
Mr. Simpson, who was then in Puerto Rico filming Frogman? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. How many calls do you remember having, two? 
 
A. To my best recollection, two. 
 
Q. In those calls did O.J. Simpson express to you his concern about 
Nicole having a nervous breakdown? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
A. No, he did not. 
 
Q. Did he discuss with you the subject of Nicole having a nervous 
breakdown? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. No, he did not. 
 
Q. Did he talk to you at all about the physical or emotional or 
mental condition of Nicole in those conversations? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
A. Yes, he did. 
 
Q. And what did he say? 
 
A. He said that Nicole had not called him, she was not returning 
his faxes, that he was afraid she was leaving him but she would not 
tell him that for sure, that Nicole was not acting as the dutiful wife, 
that - because she wasn't having her children call him either. He 
just - he couldn't understand why Nicole didn't want to talk to him. 
 
Q. Was that the thrust of what he was saying to you in those 
conversations? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I object. Vague. 
 
Q. In other words, was he - was this the main topic that he 
discussed with you or did he discuss other topics? 
 
A. We discussed other topics but that was the main topic, that he 
wanted to know from me why she was not responding to him. 
 
Q. Did he say anything, though, about whether Nicole was having 
any problems mentally or physically? 
 
A. He never mentioned that once. 
 
Q. Did he express any concern in that regard? 
 
A. For her health? 
 
Q. Yes. 
 
A. Never. 
 
Q. Okay. And did he say anything to you to which you blamed on 
Cora? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
A. Absolutely not. 
 
Q. Did Cora come up in these conversations, Cora being Cora 
Fishman? 
 
A. She could have come up in these conversations. I - I am not sure 
which conversation over the phone it was. We did discuss Cora 
over the phone, yes, we did, but I cannot say that it was during this 
particular, one of these conversations. 
 
Q. Now, in these conversations with Mr. Simpson, did you blame 
anything on Cora? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. You said Mr. Simpson was talking to you about why Nicole 
wasn't returning calls and faxes'? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. What did you tell Mr. Simpson? 
 
A. That she needed some time, that she felt overwhelmed by him 
and that she just needed some time by herself from him. 
 
Q. Did you tell Mr. Simpson that Nicole had related to you her 
history of abuse and threats at the hands of O.J. Simpson? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
A. Not at that time, I did not. 
 
Q. By that - by the time of these two conversations, you had 
already had your conversations with Nicole that you related 
yesterday concerning abuse and threats by O.J. Simpson. 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. Did you tell Mr. Simpson, in these two telephone conversations, 
about that? 
 
A. No, I did not, intentionally. 
 
Q. Did you tell Mr. Simpson that you would try to mediate 
between Nicole and him? 
 
A. I told O.J. that I would - that I would - I just tried to get him to 
calm down, that's all I wanted him to do. I didn't want to give him 
any information. I was afraid to tell him that Nicole was going to 
leave him. I just wanted him to calm down. 
 
Q. You knew in those conversations, from Nicole, that she had 
made the decision to leave Mr. Simpson? 
 
A. Absolutely. 
 
Q. And you did not tell that to him? 
 
A. No, I did not. 
 
Q. What was your reason for not telling him? 
 
A. I was afraid. 
 
Q. Did you think it was - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Withdrawn. 
 
Q. Could you tell from your conversations with Mr. Simpson, 
these two conversations, that Nicole had not yet told him? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. Absolutely. He said she had not communicated with him at all 
except to answer the phone. She just didn't want to talk to him, she 
told him. 
 
Q. And Mr. Simpson wanted to know what was going on? 
 
A. Yes, he did. 
 
Q. And you didn't tell him? 
 
A. Absolutely not. 
 
Q. Now, you said you tried to calm him down. Did - what could 
you make of his mental or emotional state from the telephone 
conversation? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague. 
 
A. Why don't I just - 
 
Q. In other words, did he appear calm, did he appear agitated? 
How did he appear to you, over the telephone? 
 
A. Very agitated, very nervous. 
 
Q. Did he say anything about his plans in terms of Nicole? 
 
A. He wanted me to tell him whether Nicole was planning on 
leaving him or not because he said that he needed to know because 
if she was going to leave him, he didn't want to come back because 
he didn't know what he would do. He would just go to Florida, and 
he begged me to tell him. If she was -  
 
Q. Did he - 
 
A. Sorry. I needed to finish this. 
 
Q. Please. 
 
A. He felt she must be seeing another man at the time because she 
was not responding. 
 
Q. That's what he said to you? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. He said that if he found out she was not going to continue the 
relationship with him that he would go to where? 
 
A. Florida. 
 
Q. Did he tell you what he would do in Florida? 
 
A. I can't remember that. 
 
Q. Do you know what Florida had to do with anything? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. Yes, I do. 
 
Q. What? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. Paula Barbieri lived in Florida. 
 
Q. So you understood, when he said, I'll go to Florida, that he 
would go to see Ms. Barbieri? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection to the leading. 
 
A. Yes. That's why I didn't even ask the question. I knew exactly 
what he was saying. 
 
Q. Did you report these two conversations to Nicole? 
 
A. I certainly did. 
 
Q . What did Nicole say to you after you told her about these 
conversations? 
 
A. She said that he had been calling and she was not wanting to 
deal with it. She felt - one of the conversations that I had with 
Nicole was when we were sitting on the sofa at my home watching 
Entertainment Tonight, and O.J. was in Puerto Rico filming The 
Frogman, and he was on the screen in front of us and I said, I asked 
her, how did she feel seeing him, knowing that she wanted to end 
their relationship, and she said, those arms - he had his arms 
exposed in this frogman outfit. She said, I'm afraid those arms will 
kill me one day. And she said that she did not want to - she needed 
some time before telling him that she was not going to see him 
because she was in fear, that if she told him, he would do 
something harmful to her. 
 
Q. Did she tell you when she planned to tell Mr. Simpson that she 
had decided to end the relationship? 
 
A. Well, yes, she did. She was going to tell him immediately - she 
was going to tell him before he came back but she just wasn't able 
to that day and I asked her not to tell him until after Christian's 
party because, to be quite honest with you, I was afraid what would 
happen. I was - and I didn't know what he would do. I knew what 
mood he was in, I knew that he was absolutely hostile in the 
conversations. I was nervous and I asked her not to say anything 
until two days after he got back because I had planned and catered 
a party for my ex-fiance at the time, for his birthday, and O.J. 
insisted that he be there and that I, in fact, rearrange the schedule 
of the birthday until he was there on the 30th, which I had it 
arranged for the 28th. 
 
Q. April? 
 
A. Yes, April 28th. 
 
Q. So you were back in Los Angeles before the 30th of April, I 
take it? 
 
A. Yes, we were. 
 
Q. In your conversations with Mr. Simpson on the telephone, was 
there any discussion of the subject of womanizing? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
A. On which - the last conversations - you mean, at all? 
 
Q. No. When Mr. Simpson phoned you one or more occasions 
from Puerto Rico, did you and he ever discuss the subject of 
womanizing? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
A. I - not to my best recollection. I can't recall that right now. 
 
Q. Did you ever discuss - did you discuss that subject with Nicole 
during this time? The answer is - 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Relate that discussion. 
 
A. My discussions with Nicole over womanizing were so many, it 
is hard to keep them - 
 
Q. What about the subject of womanizing by O.J. Simpson in 
Puerto Rico? Did you ever have a discussion with Nicole about 
that? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. Tell us about that. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. Nicole and I had heard reports that O.J. was radar tracking in 
Puerto Rico and that was that he was seeing - you know, he was 
openly flirtatious. Anyway, this is what we had heard. 
 
Q. Did O.J. Simpson ever say anything to you on whether he could 
have other women besides Nicole? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
A. Many times. 
 
Q. What did he say to you about that? 
 
A. He said that Nicole should be lucky that he was in love with her 
because he had 50 million women who would love to be with him, 
that he had his pick and that he has picked her and that she should 
just feel very fortunate. 
 
Q. Who said that to you? 
 
A. O.J. Simpson. 
 
Q. More than once? 
 
A. Many times. 
 
Q. During this time when Mr. Simpson was in Puerto Rico and you 
and Nicole were in Los Angeles, did you ever have a discussion 
with Nicole about seeing a therapist or an attorney? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. What did you say to Nicole in that regard? 
 
A. I said she needed to talk to an attorney, she needed to call the 
police, she needed to see a therapist, she needed to go into - she 
needed as much protection as possible. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Are we talking about a single conversation? 
 
THE WITNESS: There was quite a few conversations. 
 
Q. We are talking about the time period after Cabo, late April, 
early May 1994? 
 
A. I did not have that conversation with her until after O.J. 
Simpson had threatened her life, to me, and then to her. 
 
Q. So the chronology - 
 
A. So that would be after May 3rd. 
 
Q. So the chronology is that at some point you had a conversation 
with O.J. Simpson in which he threatened Nicole's life? 
 
A. Yes. It alarmed me and I wanted to protect her as much as I 
could. 
 
Q. After you had that alarming conversation with O.J. Simpson, 
what did you say to Nicole? 
 
A. I told her the exact nature of the conversation. I told her that I 
felt it was serious. I told her that I had told Christian Reichardt 
about it, I asked her if I could call 911. I asked her what I should 
do. And she asked me not to do anything. She asked me not to talk 
to anyone about it, that she was afraid that if she exposed it or if 
we exposed it, that he would do it for sure, that he had threatened 
her life many times in the past. I asked her - I pleaded with her to 
call her attorney, call her therapist, call his therapist, and let the 
police know. I wanted her to document it, I wanted her to - I 
wanted her to save her life. 
 
Q. When you had that conversation with O.J. Simpson that you just 
mentioned, where he threatened to kill Nicole and you were very 
alarmed, where were you? 
 
A. I was on my sofa in my home. 
 
Q. Where was O.J. Simpson? 
 
A. O.J. Simpson had just come back from Puerto Rico. He was in 
Los Angeles. I believe he was in his home. I don't - 
 
Q. This was on the telephone? 
 
A. It was a telephone call. 
 
Q. All right. So you don't know exactly where he was. 
 
A. I don't know exactly where he was. 
 
Q. Did he call you? 
 
A. Yes, he did. 
 
Q. Now, at the time of this call, do you know whether Nicole had 
told O.J. that the relationship was over? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. Do you know how long before this call - excuse me, do you 
know how long before this telephone call that you had Nicole had 
told O.J. the relationship was over? 
 
A. Within minutes. 
 
Q. Your understanding is that Nicole told O.J. it was over and then 
O.J. called you? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Let me back up. How did you find out how and when Nicole 
had told O.J. the relationship was over? 
 
A. Nicole had told me over the phone that she was planning on 
telling him. I asked her if she had followed through on everything 
that I asked her to do. She said she had taken care of things. She 
said she had asked him to go and see his therapist, that she had 
found out the therapist - she asked O.J. if he talked about abuse and 
the threats to the therapist, and O.J. said no, he did not. And Nicole 
at that point could not hold back and she said, you're not trying to 
get help, you're not being honest, you're not telling the therapist 
about how you beat me, you're not telling the therapist the truth, so 
how can we continue this? I cannot be with you anymore And O.J. 
had called me and told me the same conversation. 
 
Q. Okay. Let me back up a minute to see if I get the sequence of 
events correct. Had the - 
 
A. Excuse me, may I take a break, please? 
 
Q. Yes. 
 
A. Thank you. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 11:33 and we are going off 
the record. 
 
(Recess taken.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 11:55 and we are back on the 
record. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q. Just to get our bearings back, Ms. Resnick, right before we 
broke you were relating the conversation that you had with Nicole 
in which she told you that she had just told O.J. Simpson about the 
breakup of their relationship, and that conversation was then 
followed by one that you had with O.J. Simpson about the same 
subject. Is that right? 
 
A. She had said that she was alluding to the fact that she was 
breaking up with O.J., in the conversation that I had with her. 
 
Q. The telephone conversation? 
 
A. No. I was - I had talked to her that day, we had coffee. 
 
Q. Okay, well, let me back up, then, let me see if I can get this 
clear in my mind. I am going to ask you a couple of other questions 
first. Just bear with me. Did Nicole accede to your request to not 
tell Mr. Simpson about the breakup until Christian's party? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. Did the party go forward as planned? 
 
A. Yes, it did. 
 
Q. Did Nicole attend? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. Did O.J. Simpson attend? 
 
A. Yes, he did. 
 
Q. And do you know whether - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Withdrawn. 
 
Q. O.J. had just come back from Puerto Rico? 
 
A. That day she had picked him up from the airport, yes. 
 
Q. And your understanding, based on your conversations with 
Nicole, was that she would not tell Mr. Simpson about the breakup 
before the Christian party, right? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And based on your observations of O.J. and Nicole at the party, 
did that seem to be true? 
 
A. Oh, yes, it was. 
 
Q. They both attended the party, right? 
 
A. Yes, they did. 
 
Q. How did they behave? 
 
A. Very loving. 
 
Q. And soon after the party, like the next day or so, did you have a 
conversation with Nicole about what her plans were? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. And relate - well, when did the conversation occur? 
 
A. The next day, after the party, I said to her- 
 
Q. On the telephone? 
 
A. - on the telephone, that you two had looked very happy, and I 
asked if she was going to follow through on breaking up with him, 
and she said that indeed she was. 
 
Q. When did you next talk to her about that? 
 
A. The next day. 
 
Q. In person? 
 
A. In person. 
 
Q. Over coffee? Is that - 
 
A. This is the conversation that we had over coffee. 
 
Q. Where? 
 
A. Starbucks. 
 
Q. In Brentwood? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Now, relate that conversation, please. 
 
MR. LEONARD: This is two days after the party? 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
Q. I guess it is about May 2, 1994, at Starbucks, in Brentwood, 
California. 
 
A. On San Vincente Boulevard. 
 
Q. Please relate that conversation. 
 
A. I wanted to - she had told me that she and O.J. went to the 
House of Blues because she had called me - O.J. had actually 
called me, pardon me, to ask if I could get him a good table 
because a friend of mine was the owner of the R&B Live, and he 
was, that night they were having their different jazz musicians, 
rhythm and blues musicians performing, and he asked me if I could 
get him a good table. Of course, I said that I would call my friend, 
and I did. I was confused, so I asked Nicole, are you planning on 
attending with O.J. the rhythm and blues tonight, and she said that 
they were, and I asked her once again if she was going to break up 
with him, and she said yes, she was. She said that O.J. was seeing a 
shrink that day and that she had hoped that the shrink could calm 
him down and that it would be easier. And that's what the 
conversation consisted of. Then I received a phone call from O.J. 
telling me that he had seen his psychologist and that - 
 
Q. One second, Ms. Resnick. This conversation that you had with 
O.J. occurred after the Starbucks Coffee with Nicole? 
 
A. Yes, it did. 
 
Q. On the same day? 
 
A. Yes, it did. 
 
Q. Tell me what O.J. Simpson said - was this a telephone 
conversation? 
 
A. Mm-hmm, yes. 
 
Q. Tell me what O.J. Simpson said to you in this telephone 
conversation. 
 
A. That he had seen his psychiatrist or psychologist - I am not sure 
which one it was, I believe it was psychologist - and that he 
assured him, that O.J. - O.J. had said that his psychologist said that 
he was overwhelming Nicole and this was the reason why she had 
backed off in the last few weeks and why she wasn't returning his 
phone calls, that he had felt that he should calm down and take it 
slow and not be so obsessive about the relationship, that Nicole 
would - the gist of it was that he was overwhelming Nicole and 
that he needed to calm down and give her time. He seemed very 
pleased. And now there was quite a few conversations the same 
day, on this particular day. It was back and forth. 
 
Q. Between whom? 
 
A. Between myself, O.J. and Nicole. There was many of them. 
 
Q. They were both calling you? 
 
A. They were both calling me. So then O.J. had called back and he 
said that Nicole had called him and told him that she never wanted 
to see him again and that the relationship was over, that he was too 
much of a man for her and that she was afraid of him. And he went 
on ranting and raving that it was my fault, why - 
 
Q. Whose fault? 
 
A. My fault. 
 
Q. Faye Resnick's fault? 
 
A. Yes. Why hadn't I told him that she was planning on leaving 
him, when he was in Puerto Rico, why did I let him go this long 
without telling him. He said he knew that I knew exactly what 
Nicole was planning on doing and he was blaming me for not 
telling him and he was becoming very aggressive with me on the 
phone in this conversation. And I said to him that - I tried to calm 
him down because at this point I was now afraid that he was going 
to harm me also, and since he was blaming me and since he was 
screaming at me over this telephone conversation, I just asked him 
if he went to see his psych - what else happened in his session. He 
said that he didn't understand why Nicole had wanted to leave him, 
and I said at that time, I couldn't keep it back any longer, I said, 
because you have beaten her in the past, you have threatened her. 
She's afraid of you. And that's when he said, You lied to me, I 
know she is seeing another man, and if I catch her with another 
man before August, I will kill her; that she was supposed to play 
the dutiful wife, because she had humiliated him in the past, that he 
would not let her humiliate him again in the public by leaving him, 
especially because she begged him to come back; that he couldn't 
take it and that he would have to kill her. 
 
Q. O.J. Simpson said all of that to you? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And this was a telephone conversation that occurred on or about 
May 2? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. 1994? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Excuse me, I am just going to object to that. I 
think it misstates her testimony. I thought she said it did happen on 
May 2nd. Isn't that what she said? 
 
THE WITNESS: I said initially that it happened May 2nd or May 
3rd. 
 
Q. Okay, that's fine. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Okay. 
 
Q. That's fine, Ms. Resnick. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You will get your chance, Mr. Leonard. 
 
A. To my best recollection, it was on May 2nd. 
 
Q. Now, in this telephone conversation that you just described, Ms. 
Resnick, was this the first time you had ever disclosed to O.J. 
Simpson your knowledge of his prior abuse? 
 
A. Yes, it was. 
 
Q. Did he say anything to you about the abuse when you brought it 
up in the conversation? 
 
A. Yes, he did. 
 
Q. What did he say? 
 
A. He said that he doesn't beat her anymore. 
 
Q. He used the words "anymore"? 
 
A. Mm-hmm. Yes, he did. 
 
Q. Did he say anything else? 
 
A. He said that - when I asked him why he didn't talk to his 
therapist about it, that's when he said it's, there's nothing to discuss, 
I don't beat her anymore. And he said that he just - he didn't like 
talking about it. He wanted to - I told him that he was skirting the 
issues, that they were deep and they were serious, and I reminded 
him that he had just told me that he would kill Nicole, and he 
reiterated that he had no option, essentially, that she was bringing it 
on herself. 
 
Q. At any time did he deny ever hitting Nicole? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection to the leading. 
 
A. He never denied hitting Nicole. He admitted to hitting Nicole 
when I said to him, You have beaten her before, and he said, I have 
not beaten her. I don't beat her anymore. 
 
Q. Did you take the threats seriously? 
 
A. I took them very seriously. 
 
Q. Did you think he was kidding? 
 
A. Under the circumstances, absolutely not. 
 
Q. When he was saying these things to you about how he was 
going to kill Nicole and how he was being humiliated and shamed 
by her and all of those things you described, was he laughing? 
 
A. He was aggressive, he was out of control, he was spewing with 
anger. It was frightening for me to be on the other end of the 
phone, having even the distance of our homes. I was afraid. 
 
Q. When you got off the phone, what did you do? 
 
A. I had talked - Nicole had broken in and told me the same thing, 
that she had talked to him, and I said to her, I'll be right over, and I 
went over to Nicole's house. 
 
Q. Before you get into that, Ms. Resnick, did you tell anyone in 
your home what had just happened? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. Who did you tell? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
A. I told Christian Reichardt, my then fiance. 
 
Q. What did you tell Christian? 
 
A. I told Christian that O.J. had told me that he would kill Nicole 
and that I was nervous for Nicole and Christian - and I told him 
that he was very angry and I was afraid he would do it. 
 
Q. How did the call with O.J. Simpson end, before you told Nicole 
that you would be right over to her house? 
 
A. Nicole, I believe, broke through the line and she had called me 
at the end of that, and I said, I have to go to take this call, and that's 
when I talked to Nicole, told her I would be right over. 
 
Q. Were you afraid for Nicole at that time? 
 
A. Extremely afraid for Nicole. 
 
Q. By the way, was there any kind of friendship or relationship 
between Christian Reichardt and O.J. Simpson? 
 
A. Yes, there was. 
 
Q. Was there any business association? 
 
A. Indeed there was. 
 
Q. Could you just describe for us what their relationship, 
friendship, businesswise or any other wise, was between Christian 
and O.J. Simpson? 
 
A. Christian - I had introduced Christian to O.J. when Nicole and 
O.J. reconciled, and that was, they - due to the fact we were always 
going out, having dinners together, they became acquainted. 
During, I would say, from the time in Laguna Beach, which was 
July, they had become fairly well acquainted and Christian was 
now, had now considered O.J. his friend. He was very protective of 
O.J. and he admired O.J. 
 
Q. What was their business connection? 
 
A. Their business connection was O.J. had called Christian during 
the time that Nicole and O.J. were having troubles, in the very end, 
right after our trip to - it was right - pardon me, it was right before 
or right after our trip to Cabo San Lucas - and asked Christian if he 
wanted to go into business with him. Christian agreed, happily. 
 
Q. What was Christian's occupation? 
 
A. Christian was a chiropractor. 
 
Q. What was Christian's reaction when you told him what O.J. 
Simpson had just said to you, after you got off the telephone with 
him? 
 
A. Christian said that people don't tell you they are going to kill 
somebody and then kill somebody. They don't - that people, that 
men say that all the time. And I said I had never heard anyone say 
that before, especially under these circumstances. He didn't take it - 
he didn't seem to put much credence in it. 
 
Q. Did he get on the phone at any time and listen in or participate 
in your call with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A. He answered the phone many times when O.J. Simpson called 
and he was there many times when I had conversations with him. 
Due to the fact that O.J. Simpson used to call me at 1 or 2 o'clock 
in the morning, Christian typically used to answer the phone and 
hand it to me. 
 
Q. Just staying with that for the moment, were there ever any 
occasions when O.J. Simpson might call you as many as 20 or 30 
times in a day? 
 
A. I cannot say that he called me 20 or 30 times in a day. I can 
recall feeling, knowing that and saying to him that I had been 
talking to him all day long on and off and all night long, that I 
needed to get some sleep, I was a mother, I had a business, I had 
my own life. 
 
Q. Was this particularly true in this May 1994 time frame? 
 
A. Yes, it was. 
 
Q. Now, getting back to my question a moment ago, did Christian 
listen in or participate in on any part of this call with O.J. Simpson 
when he made the threats to kill Nicole? 
 
A. No, he did not. 
 
Q. Do you know whether he picked up the phone and then called 
O.J. Simpson after you got off the phone with him? 
 
A. Not to my knowledge. 
 
Q. And it was your observation that Mr. Reichardt was not taking 
this seriously? 
 
A. Yes. He did not take it seriously. 
 
Q. What did you then do? You went to Nicole's? 
 
A. I went to Nicole's, I told her - 
 
Q. Where, at Bundy? 
 
A. At Bundy. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Excuse me, this is right after the calls, we are 
talking about? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Correct. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Okay. 
 
Q. Keep going. 
 
A. I went to Nicole's house and tried to make a plan to save her 
life. 
 
Q. Tried to what? 
 
A. Make a plan to save her life. 
 
Q. What plan did you try to make? 
 
A. I wanted Nicole to leave, to get away. I wanted her, before that, 
to call the police. We argued over that. I felt it was essential she 
did. I wanted her to prove to me that she was taking, was taking the 
right steps to saving herself. I told her that O.J.'s biggest concern 
was that she was seeing another man and that he didn't want to be 
humiliated, and she promised me she wouldn't see anybody else. 
She promised that she would try and keep him calm because she 
wouldn't leave. She wouldn't - she said that Sydney had her 
communion coming up and that she wasn't - 
 
Q. Communion? 
 
A. Communion. 
 
Q. Religious communion? 
 
A. Yes. The holy communion. And that she wasn't willing to 
uproot her children and that she wasn't willing to let her children 
be affected by his behavior. 
 
Q. When you went to Nicole's, did you tell Nicole what O.J. said 
on the phone to you? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. You repeated what O.J. said? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. And what was Nicole's reaction? 
 
A. She said he had said the same thing, he had told her the same 
thing that day and that he had said it many times before, that he 
had - 
 
Q. Who? 
 
A. - that O.J. had told her many times before he would kill her, and 
I asked her what August meant and she said that's when he leaves 
for New York to do his broadcasting. 
 
Q. Did Nicole explain to you what, why Mr. Simpson had said she 
should not see anyone until August? 
 
A. Nicole had said that, he wants me to play his wife and I can't 
live my life for O.J. Simpson. If he is going to kill me, let him get 
it over with. Because she was living in a nightmare. 
 
Q. She wanted - excuse me, Nicole told you that O.J. wanted her to 
play the role of his wife while he was still in town?  A. Yes. 
 
Q. Now, based on your observations of Nicole in this conversation, 
did you believe that she was taking Mr. Simpson's threats to kill 
her seriously ? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. Yes, she was. 
 
Q. How did you observe how Nicole was responding to the threats 
of Mr. Simpson? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. My observation of Nicole was that she was used to them. She 
was mad. She was angry at it. She didn't - she was furious at him. 
 
Q. In this conversation with you? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. She expressed that? 
 
A. Yes, she did. She was used to it. 
 
Q. Where were the two of you sitting when you had - where were 
the two of you? 
 
A. In the living room of her home on Bundy. 
 
Q. Were the two of you alone? 
 
A. Yes, we were. 
 
Q. Did you and she discuss whether she would talk to anyone 
about this? 
 
A. She said that she had - that she would not call the police, that 
she would talk to her therapist. I asked her if she would talk to his 
therapist also. She assured me that she had taken, that she was 
going to take the right steps in order to protect herself. 
 
Q. Did she tell you what those steps were? 
 
A. She said that she had written them for her - that she was going 
to talk with her attorney and she was going to give him all the 
information. 
 
Q. Did she tell you why she would not tell the police? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. What did she say? 
 
A. She said that if she went to the - that the police had never 
helped her in the past, that she had told them over and over, they 
had even seen her when she was being beaten, why would they 
take her seriously now, she had no bruises on her. She said that she 
didn't feel that the police had ever protected her before, why should 
they protect her now. And then she also went on to say that she felt 
that it could only add to the situation by infuriating O.J. Simpson 
because the press would find out about it and his fans would find 
out about it and - she was afraid that it would really happen then. 
 
Q. She was afraid - 
 
A. And she was afraid that if she made it public, that there would 
be no, that she would definitely die. 
 
Q. That's what she told you? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Now, did you - what was your reaction? Did you agree, did you 
argue with her about it? What was your reaction? 
 
A. I argued with her about it. That's what our arguments were 
about. I felt that, as I still feel, that if there's a problem, you bring it 
out in the open. I feel - I felt at that time and I told her that I 
disagreed with her decision, that her safety would be that the 
public was aware of it, the police were aware of it, that if everyone 
knew of these threats that she was not - that he wouldn't be able to. 
Then she said, He will kill me and he will get away with it. And I 
said, What are you talking about? And she said, He has gotten 
away with everything in his life and he will make it my fault. 
 
Q. Did you ever call the police on your own? 
 
A. I wasn't allowed to, and I should have. 
 
Q . Yet you did not? 
 
A. I did not. 
 
Q. Why didn't you? 
 
A. I promised Nicole I wouldn't. I promised her I wouldn't. 
 
Q. Let me step back for a minute. Did Nicole - was Nicole dating 
anyone during this period of time, early May 1994, to your 
knowledge? 
 
MR. MARKS: Please repeat the question. And perhaps we should 
take a short break. 
 
THE WITNESS: I'll be okay. 
 
Q. In this time frame, early May 1994, and in particular during the 
time of this conversation when Nicole told you that she would not 
see anyone until August, do you know whether she was, in fact, 
seeing anyone at that time? 
 
A. Yes, I do. 
 
Q. You now know, right? 
 
A. I knew then, too. 
 
Q. You knew even then? You have to answer audibly. Yes? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. And who was Nicole then seeing? 
 
A. Nicole started seeing Marcus Allen in the end, right before she 
died, again. 
 
Q. Right at the end. And how did you find that out? 
 
A. I was told by Cynthia Shahian, by Cora Fishman, and one day I 
was driving past Nicole's house and I saw Marcus's car parked in 
front of her house. 
 
Q. How did you know that was Marcus Allen's car? 
 
A. I had seen his cars many times. 
 
Q. Can you remember the make of the car that you saw, that you 
believe was Marcus Allen's car? 
 
A. It was a black car. 
 
Q. Did you ever discuss with Nicole that you believe that she was 
now seeing Marcus Allen? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. What did you say to her? First of all, did you talk to her in 
person or was that on the telephone, or both? 
 
A. I called her on the telephone from my office and - 
 
Q. And what did you say to her? 
 
A. I saw the cars, I was on my way to the office, and I called her 
and I asked her if that was his car, and she said it was, reluctantly. 
And I told her that she had broken her deal and that I felt that she 
was setting herself up for murder. 
 
Q. You told her that? You have to answer audibly. 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. Did she acknowledge seeing Marcus Allen? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. Did she tell you why she was seeing him? 
 
A. She said that she was no longer seeing O.J. and that she loved 
him. 
 
Q. She loved whom? 
 
A. Marcus. 
 
Q. Was Marcus married at that time? 
 
A. Yes, he was. 
 
Q. Did you ever see Nicole and Marcus together during this time 
frame? 
 
A. No, I did not. 
 
Q. Do you know whether anyone else saw them together during 
this time frame? 
 
A. I don't - I don't know. 
 
Q. As best as you can recall, when was this conversation with 
Nicole in which you and she discussed her seeing Marcus Allen 
again? 
 
A. It was right before Nicole was murdered, it was the last two 
weeks of her life. 
 
Q. Now, at some point did you spend some days at Nicole's condo 
with her during this time frame? 
 
A. Yes, l did. 
 
Q. How many days did you spend there? Where you slept over, I 
mean. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Which time frame are you talking about? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: This time frame, which is the last two weeks 
of Nicole's life. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Okay. 
 
A. In May, in the end of May I spent two days at her house, 
because Christian and I were having a fight. And right before 
Nicole died, on June 2nd or 3rd, I had, I was spending, I would 
say, three days, I had spent three days at Nicole's house. 
 
Q. And then you, after those three days, went where? 
 
A. I went and stayed at my girlfriend Kathy Harouche's house. 
 
Q. And then, from there, you went - 
 
A. I went back to Christian's house. 
 
Q. And then, from there, you went - 
 
A. To Exodus Recovery Center. 
 
Q. Do you remember the date you entered Exodus? 
 
A. June 9, 1994. 
 
Q. When you slept over at Nicole's in early June and in late May, 
where did you sleep? 
 
A. I slept on the sofa. 
 
Q. In what room? 
 
A. In the den. 
 
Q. Is that on the downstairs floor, where the kitchen is? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. During that time did Nicole give you a key to her condo so that 
you could get in and out, or a garage door opener or both ? 
 
A. No, she did not because - no, she did not. 
 
Q. Did she attempt to do so? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. Tell me what happened. 
 
A. When I first came - when I first arrived, she asked me if I 
needed a key, and I said I didn't need one because I was spending, 
wherever we would go places, we would go together, so it wasn't 
necessary. 
 
Q. What time frame was this? Was this the two times, the two 
nights you spent over in late May when you had the fight with 
Christian - 
 
A. No, the last time. 
 
Q. The part in early June? 
 
A. Yeah. 
 
Q. And by the way, what was the reason you went to stay with 
Nicole during these three days in early June? 
 
A. Christian and I had broken off our - I had broken my 
engagement off with Christian. He was becoming very aggressive 
and very volatile. He was upset that I had broken our engagement 
and I - 
 
Q. That's the reason? 
 
A. And we were fighting. 
 
Q. Okay. So getting back to Nicole's going to give you a key 
and/or garage door opener, tell me about that. 
 
A. Nicole - when I asked Nicole - I felt very - I had felt and Nicole 
had felt that we were being followed and I had said to Nicole that I 
was nervous that we were going to be killed by O.J. and that I 
would appreciate it if she, if we could go away until he calmed 
down and now Nicole had the excuse of Sydney's recital and she 
could not leave. I said to her that I felt like I was trapped in this 
hellish relationship with her and I was afraid for both of our lives 
at that point because I knew that O.J. was angry at me, too, for 
lying to him. I wanted to leave that house because I felt it was 
dangerous, and Nicole would not go with me so - she wanted to 
give me the key to her house in case I changed my mind. So we 
went downstairs and she went through the drawer in the kitchen to 
give me her running set of keys. 
 
Q. What did that look like? 
 
A. It was a very small - the key chain she used to run with, it was 
very small, had a couple of keys on it with some, a bear or 
something on it. 
 
Q. A bear on it? A bear on the key chain? 
 
A. A bear on the ring. 
 
Q. There was a ring which she would wear, which had a key chain 
with two keys attached to it? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And on the ring there was a little bear? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And you say that she would wear this ring when she ran? You 
mean when she would jog and take runs? 
 
A. When she would jog. 
 
Q. What is the reason she would wear it instead of put it in her 
pockets? 
 
A. She didn't have pockets. She was running. Nicole used to run 
nine miles. She was - she didn't have any pockets. 
 
Q. I see. So Nicole would run nine miles a day in running clothing 
that did not have pockets? 
 
A. Right. 
 
Q. And as a result, she would wear her keys on this bear ring, 
right? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And had you seen this bear ring before? 
 
A. Yes, I had. 
 
Q. And this was the ring she was looking for? 
 
A. Yes, it was. 
 
Q. And what happened? 
 
A. She - it wasn't there. The keys weren't there. 
 
Q. Where she usually keeps it? 
 
A. And the remote wasn't there. They were not in the drawer in the 
kitchen. 
 
Q. What did she say to you when she could not find them there? 
 
A. She said, Oh, my God. O.J. must have taken my keys last week 
when he was here. And I said, That's what I mean, Nicole. He has 
your keys. Please understand, he's been threatening you, he's 
threatening me. Please come with me. I am sure Kathy wouldn't 
mind if you stayed with her for, you know, a couple of days and 
then we could, you know, arrange to go someplace else. And she 
would not. So I left. 
 
Q. When you left Nicole's condo at this time in early June and 
went to Kathy Harouche's and went back to Christian and so forth, 
did you ever talk to O.J. Simpson during that time frame, or did 
you see him at all? 
 
A. No, I did not. When I was at Kathy Harouche's? 
 
Q. Yes. 
 
A. No, I did not. I wanted nothing to do with them. 
 
Q. Before Nicole's death, do you remember the last time that you 
saw O.J. Simpson? 
 
A. Yes, I do. 
 
Q. And when was that? 
 
A. It was one week prior to her death. 
 
Q. Was this while you were staying at Nicole's? 
 
A. It was while I was staying at Nicole's. It was on a Sunday. 
 
Q. So the Sunday would be June 5? 
 
A. June 5. 
 
Q. And tell me about your encounter with O.J. Simpson on June 5, 
1994. 
 
A. O.J. called and said he was on his way to pick something up, he 
had Justin with him. He wanted something for Justin, I believe. 
And Nicole and he were in a fight so she wouldn't go downstairs to 
fix it, to give, you know - she didn't want to see O.J. because they 
had been fighting terribly that night and that morning, on the 
phone. So she asked me to go down and open the garage door and 
hand Justin, I think it was his running shoes or his ball and his 
running shoes. She asked me to do that. So I went down and I 
opened the garage door, pushed the button, and Kato, the dog, went 
bolting out of the garage door. So Justin - said hello to Justin, said 
hello to O.J., and I said I have to go get Nicole's dog, this is a very 
busy area, I didn't want him to get killed. So I started going after 
Kato and O.J. joined me running through, I would say, four or five 
blocks, chasing Kato. That's that time. 
 
Q. Now, do you remember the car O.J. Simpson drove up in? 
 
A.Yes, I do. 
 
Q. Which was it? 
 
A. The Bentley. 
 
Q. And do you know where he pulled up? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. Where was that? 
 
A. In the back alley. 
 
Q. He did not park in the front on Bundy? 
 
A. Not at all. 
 
Q. And do you know whether at any time during this visit, did O.J. 
Simpson enter the side alleyway to the condo? 
 
A. No, he did not. 
 
Q. Do you know what I am talking about, the alleyway? 
 
A. Yes, I do. 
 
Q. The front door of Nicole's house opens up into this alleyway, 
right? 
 
A. Yes, it does. 
 
Q. And you can either go back out towards the back gate or out 
towards the front gate, right? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. It's kind of a long alleyway? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Now at any time during this visit did Mr. Simpson enter or go 
into that alleyway? 
 
A. No, he did not. 
 
Q. When he pulled up in the back, where did he park? 
 
A. He maintained his position in the middle of the alley so he was 
in the middle of - his car was blocking, essentially, the alley. 
 
Q. Was he parked perpendicular or parallel? 
 
A. He was parked parallel to the alley. 
 
Q. Now, Nicole had a garage there, right? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. What car did she park in that garage? 
 
A. She parked the Ferrari in the garage. 
 
Q. And Nicole had another car, right? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. What was that car? 
 
A . That was a Jeep. 
 
Q. Where did Nicole typically park the Jeep? 
 
A. She left the Jeep parked directly behind the Ferrari outside of 
the garage door. 
 
Q. On the driveway surface? 
 
A. On the driveway surface. 
 
Q. And when Mr. Simpson parked there on this occasion, did he 
park right next to - 
 
A. No, he did not. 
 
Q. Where did he park relative to the driveway and to the Jeep of 
Nicole Brown? 
 
A. He pulled behind the Jeep. 
 
Q. So parallel, again, to the garage? 
 
A. Parallel to the garage. 
 
Q. But close to the Jeep? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did you ever have a conversation with O.J. Simpson about any 
tax problems involving Nicole? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. When - how many such conversations did you have? 
 
A. One. 
 
Q. When did it occur? 
 
A. It occurred on the Friday, the Friday before, it was - right before 
he sent her the letter on Friday, he called me up and he said he had 
just finished drafting a letter, writing a letter to Nicole, his attorney 
was going to tell Nicole that he was going to inform the IRS that 
she had defrauded them. 
 
Q. That Nicole had? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And this occurred generally around the same period of time you 
have been talking about, the last week in Nicole's life? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q . When is your best estimate of when you had this telephone 
conversation with O.J. Simpson about the IRS letter? 
 
A. I would say it was right before the dog - 
 
Q. Incident? 
 
A. - incident. It was the Friday before the dog incident. 
 
Q. Which might put it on June 3 or thereabouts? 
 
A. Right. 
 
Q. What did you say to Mr. Simpson when he told you that? 
 
A. I said that she was not trying to defraud anyone. She had bought 
the condominium, thinking that she was going to move into 
Rockingham and she needed to - she needed to buy something so 
as not to pay capital gains. I tried to explain - I don't know why I 
did but I did. I tried to explain that what his - what he was doing 
was attacking his children now. I said that Nicole would not 
respond very well to that. 
 
Q. Did O.J. Simpson say why he was doing this? 
 
A. Yes, he did. 
 
Q. In this telephone conversation with you? 
 
A. Yes, he did. 
 
Q. And tell us what O.J. Simpson said about why he was sending 
Nicole this letter about the IRS. 
 
A. O.J. had said that he wanted to cause her as much pain as 
possible, that he wanted to make her live in reality so that she 
would see how lucky she had it, being with him, and that - that he 
wanted to teach her a lesson. 
 
Q. Do you know whether O.J. Simpson ever sent that letter? 
 
A. Yes, I do. 
 
Q. How do you know that? 
 
A. I was told by Nicole. 
 
Q. In a telephone conversation or a personal conversation? 
 
A. In a telephone conversation at first and then a personal 
conversation. 
 
Q. What did Nicole say to you about the letter, and describe her 
state, whether she was calm, agitated, upset, angry, in so doing? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
Q. Let me make sure you understand. Let's talk about the telephone 
conversation. Did she tell you about the letter in the telephone 
conversation? 
 
A. She briefly mentioned it. 
 
Q. And then - 
 
A. And then we talked in person. 
 
Q. Now, when she told you about the letter in the telephone 
conversation, what was her state, so far as you could discern over 
the telephone? 
 
A. She was angry, she was - she said that, if this is what he plans to 
do to get me back, he's wrong, that it - that she would - now he was 
attacking her children, that he had attacked her many times, but 
now he was putting her kids in jeopardy and she wanted nothing to 
do with him. She was devastated by the letter, devastated. 
 
Q. And you talked with her in person about this as well? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And what, when you talked with her in person about the IRS 
letter, what was her state, so far as you could observe? 
 
A. She was very angry and very - she was - that was it. 
 
Q. And what did she say in this personal conversation when she 
was so angry? 
 
A. I had just that. 
 
Q. Basically the same thing as the telephone conversation? 
 
A. This is the personal conversation that I had just recalled. 
 
Q. I see. And it was in this personal conversation that Nicole was 
very angry, that she told you she was devastated? 
 
A. Devastated. 
 
Q. And that Mr. Simpson was attacking the children? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And did she explain what she meant by that? 
 
A. She said that he was putting his children out on the streets. 
 
Q. Because Nicole would have to sell the condominium? 
 
A. Mm-hmm. 
 
Q. You have to - 
 
A. She just - because Nicole would have to sell the condominium, 
because she had just moved the children again, that she just - she 
was - she just couldn't believe that he would do that to her children, 
to their children. 
 
Q. And did Nicole describe to you in words or through her anger, 
how she felt about Mr. Simpson attacking the children? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. Nicole - I don't think I had ever seen Nicole more angry. That 
was the one thing you did not do, was attack her children or do 
anything to her children. That was the last and final blow. 
 
Q. Did - now, during this - well, let me back up. What was the last 
and final blow? 
 
A. The fact that he was willing to put her children through another, 
to relocation, to maybe changing schools, and it all had an effect 
on Nicole, and her children. 
 
Q. Did she indicate one way or the other what this letter would do 
in terms of her relationship with Mr. Simpson? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection to the leading.

to get her back and that it only drove her away further, that she 
would never - she didn't even want to talk to him again after that. 
 
Q. And do you know whether she did talk to him again after her 
receipt of that letter'? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.

Nicole's receipt of that letter? 
 
A. No, I did not. Except when we chased the dog.

she received that letter where she described to you any 
conversations that she had with O.J. Simpson? 
 
A. She just - yes. 
 
Q. What things did she tell you about Mr. Simpson in those last 
conversations that you had with Nicole? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague. 
 
A. Nicole had said that she told O.J. that, the same thing she told 
me, that it was over, that he was now attacking her children, that he 
didn't care about her children, that he didn't care about her, that his 
plan would not work, that she was never coming back to him, that 
it was over. Leave her alone.

Q. Over the telephone? 
 
A. And she came to visit me once at Exodus. 
 
Q. She did? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. When she visited you in Exodus, did she discuss Mr. Simpson 
at all? 
 
A. Briefly. 
 
Q. What did she say'? 
 
A. She was looking for a house. She had put her house on the 
market to lease, that she was free of him, that she wasn't 
responding to him. As much as possible, she wouldn't talk to him. 
She was - we talked about our - we talked about going into - what 
kind of coffee house we were going to open. We talked about 
poetry readings, we talked about - we talked about positive things. 
 
Q. Did you ever find out, prior to Nicole's death, whether O.J. 
Simpson found out that Nicole was seeing Marcus Allen again? 
 
A. No, I do not know that. 
 
Q. Did you ever discuss that with Nicole, whether O.J. knew about 
Marcus? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. And what did Nicole tell you? 
 
A. She - I asked Nicole if - I told her that she had been - we had 
been, she had been followed by O.J., and she knew. And that what 
if he had spotted them together. And she said she could not live her 
life for O.J. Simpson anymore and that she - you know, if he was 
going to kill her, to get it over with.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Good afternoon. The time is 1:54, and 
this is tape number 4 of the continued deposition of Faye Resnick. 
 
CONTINUED EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q. Ms. Resnick, earlier today we were talking about an incident in 
which O.J. Simpson acted in a rageful way at the Harley Davidson 
Cafe and I never did have you relate the entire incident. We got off 
on a different track. So why don't we go back to that, if that's okay. 
I think you said there was a time during the evening when Mr. 
Simpson was using cocaine at the table in the restaurant, right? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And when did you see Mr. Simpson go into a rage? 
 
A. It wasn't until we got home to his condominium. 
 
Q. In New York City? 
 
A. In New York City. I think it was Bristol something. Nicole and 
he were not getting along in the car ride home from the hotel, due 
to the fact that O.J. had wanted to, had asked me if I would go and 
play backgammon with his friend Mark Packer after dinner that 
evening. I had said to him that I was not interested in going and 
playing backgammon with Mark, that I wanted to go home and go 
to sleep, and he kept bringing it up and it upset Nicole because she 
said that she didn't understand why he pretended to be Christian's 
friend one day and the very next day tried to set me up with one of 
his friends. So this was in the car on the way to the apartment. 
They started fighting. I really, I just said, look, you guys, it's over, 
it's done with, you know, let's just go to sleep. And they continued 
fighting. I went into my room. And Mark Packer called - as they 
were in the kitchen fighting, he called and interrupted them and 
O.J. answered the phone and he came knocking on my door - and 
you could hear everything. This condominium, the walls were 
really thin, I could hear everything that was being said. 
 
I went out and I said to Mark that I wanted to go to sleep and that I 
had told him exactly that I did not have any intention of going and 
playing backgammon at his house. The - Nicole was really upset 
about it because O.J. had tried to - he said to me, why don't you go 
over there, you know, he's a nice guy, he's, you know, as wealthy 
as your ex-husband, and Christian doesn't make very much money, 
and dada, dada, da, da. And they got in a big fight over it, and they 
continued to fight and it got worse. 
 
And Nicole was very upset with O.J. for doing that. She felt that he 
was just being O.J. and it just really made her mad and so the fight 
intensified and I saw O.J. with his animalistic ways and I said, 
look, I feel like I should - you know, this is getting out of hand, 
please calm down, you guys, and tried to calm the situation, and I 
knew that there was nothing I could do, and I said, I am going to 
go to sleep. I went into my room and until 4 o'clock in the morning 
I heard the two of them fighting. I heard - I was nervous that 
Nicole was going to be hurt and I didn't want to go to sleep 
because I wanted to be able to call the police, if necessary, and it 
was just one of those rageful, vindictive fights that O.J. turned on 
Nicole, said it was all her fault. 
 
And they also fought that night about the Enquirer article that came 
out that weekend. O.J. said, you know, if it wasn't for Nicole, 
nobody would have found out about that, if she hadn't called 911 
that the press wouldn't have got wind about it. And Nicole said, I'm 
sorry, it just appeared. I didn't give any interviews, it's not my fault 
the article was written. Well, they are bringing up all the beating 
and - and they were just - it was a night, it was one of those fright 
nights that I was too afraid for Nicole to even go to sleep until 
finally they calmed down. 
 
Q. And you heard all of this? 
 
A. I heard everything that was said. 
 
Q. Was there an occasion when O.J. and Nicole had an argument 
about some man's number being in the speed dial and photographs 
of another man being in Nicole's home? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
Q. You may - is this something that you had a conversation with 
O.J. Simpson about? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. When did that conversation occur? 
 
A. It occurred on, in November sometime, I believe, in 1993. 
 
Q. Who was present? 
 
A. O.J. and I. He called me. 
 
Q. Telephone call? 
 
A. Telephone call. He called me at my office. 
 
Q. Tell me about this November 1993 telephone call with O.J. 
Simpson. 
 
A. O.J. called me to tell me that he had just been to Nicole's and 
that he saw - he was going through the photo albums, having a 
good time, and everything was going great and thumbing through 
one of the albums he saw a photograph of Keith Zlomsowich, and 
it really upset him that Nicole hadn't taken that picture out and it 
really upset him that one of his children was sitting on Keith's lap 
in the photograph, and that he went to use the phone and he saw 
Joseph Perrulli's name had not been taken off of the speed dial, and 
he saw the name Joseph. And he approached Nicole about it and he 
said, why didn't you take the photographs out of the book and she 
said, I just really haven't had time to, this was - I just hadn't 
thought about it. 
 
Q. Are you telling us what O.J. had related to you? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Because I want to you stick with the conversation with O.J. 
Simpson. 
 
A. I am. 
 
Q. Thank you. 
 
A. And he said that he had taken - I had asked him, actually, well, 
you know, have you taken all the photographs down of Paula, do 
you - you know, do you not have photographs of any of your ex-
girlfriends? He said that was different, that, you know, his children 
were living at her house and that he would take them down or he 
told Nicole that he had or something like that. And I said, O.J., I 
think you are making a bigger deal out of this; all you have to do is 
just nicely and calmly ask Nicole to - tell her it hurts your feelings 
and see if she will, you know, take them out of the book and I am 
sure she will take Joseph's name off speed dial and I just - I am 
sure it's just an oversight. And that was the - so he seemed to think, 
you know, okay, all right. So we hung up and he called back and 
he said, she's upset, she says I'm controlling her life that I have to 
take all of her ex's photographs out of the book. And that was the 
last time I spoke with him about it that day. I talked with Nicole 
about it. 
 
Q. Did you have further conversations with O.J. Simpson about 
this? 
 
A. The next day, I did. 
 
Q. Tell us about that conversation. 
 
A. I had found out that that night he had broken the door down and 
- 
 
Q. The door to what? 
 
A. Nicole's house. 
 
Q. At - 
 
A. Gretna Green. 
 
Q. Continue. 
 
A. And I asked him why he had done that, and he just made it 
sound like it was all Nicole's fault, that she wasn't - that she was 
fighting with him about the fact that she had to - she couldn't have 
a life previous to being with him again. She didn't like the fact that 
she had to, you know, take all of the photographs. That was her big 
issue. She felt, you know, Keith was her friend, you know, most 
importantly, and to throw away his picture was unrealistic of him 
and unreasonable. And she wouldn't - he wouldn't get what he 
wanted and he just said, She wouldn't do what I wanted. And I 
said, So, that's the reason you beat in the door? And he said, No, 
that's not. She wouldn't talk to me and she wouldn't take my phone 
calls. And I said - 
 
Q. Is that something that would infuriate O.J. Simpson, if Nicole 
didn't take his phone calls? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. Oh - 
 
Q. Do you know if that was something that would make him 
upset? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. That is something that - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me, can I finish my question before - 
 
MR. LEONARD: As long as the witness hesitates a little bit so I 
can get my objection in. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Sure. I just want to get my question out, 
okay, before you interrupt me. 
 
Q. Do you have any knowledge of whether, of O.J. Simpson's 
reaction if Nicole did not accept his phone calls? 
 
MR. LEONARD Objection. 
 
Q. You may answer. 
 
A.Yes, I do. 
 
Q. And is that based - what is that based on? 
 
A. It's based on my experience with him on the telephone when he 
would say, when she would not accept his phone calls, that's when 
he would call me and go crazy with me because he didn't get the 
satisfaction that he wanted from her and he felt that she was tuning 
him out and he would just be - that's when he started the endless 
phone calls to me. 
 
Q. And what emotional state do you believe O.J. Simpson would 
communicate to you when Nicole would not take his phone calls? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. Well - 
 
Q. What kinds of emotions would he communicate to you? 
 
A. Hostility, anger - just aggressiveness. 
 
Q. Going back to this early November or late October incident, I 
guess it was the day after the Gretna Green incident? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And O.J. Simpson and you are talking and he is telling you that 
Nicole would not, the night before, would not take his calls or 
would not talk to him, right? 
 
A. Right. 
 
Q. And you were explaining that that's what he was telling you as 
to why this incident occurred ? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Okay. Was there anything more that he said to you in that 
conversation? 
 
A. Not that I recall, of importance. 
 
Q. Did he mention to you that Nicole had called the police and the 
police came out to the house? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. No, he did not. I mentioned it to him. 
 
Q. Do you know how many times that police had come out to the 
house - 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
Q. - involving - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am not finished with my question. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I am sorry. 
 
Q. Do you know how many times the police had come out to the 
Simpsons' residence, wherever that might be, to deal with a 
domestic dispute? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. Nicole had told me she had called 911 around 30 times. 
 
Q. That's what Nicole said to you? 
 
MR. BREWER: How many times? 
 
THE WITNESS: 30. 
 
Q. Did she say how many times police had actually come out to the 
house? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. No, she did not. 
 
Q. Did you see O.J. Simpson at the Jenners' Christmas party in 
December of 1993? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. Can you explain the occasion when you saw him there? 
 
A. We were entering my - [name deleted], my daughter, Christian 
Reichardt, my ex-fiance and - we were entering the Jenners' home, 
and as we were entering, I saw Kato Kaelin come out of the door 
and then I saw the children follow him and then Nicole and then 
O.J. in one of his moods, and I said, what's going on? And O.J. 
said - and Nicole was very - she wasn't talking, she was just - she 
wasn't. He said Joseph Perrulli had shown up at the Christmas 
party and ruined everything and that he felt he was set up and he 
felt that Nicole had known about it and he was upset at Kris Jenner 
for inviting him and he didn't want to do anything strange, so he 
was - he was just going to get out of there. 
 
Q . That's what he said to you? 
 
A. Mm-hmm. 
 
Q. Can you recall anything else? 
 
A. I asked Nicole if she was okay, and she said, I'll calm him 
down. 
 
Q. Can you describe O.J. Simpson's emotional state when he was 
talking to you on that occasion? 
 
A. He was more composed than he had been in the other times that 
I described, much more composed. He was - he was quite upset but 
he wasn't, you know, his face looked the same. 
 
Q. He wasn't out of control? 
 
A. He wasn't as out of control as I have seen him. 
 
Q. Did you know Ron Goldman? 
 
A. I had met Ron Goldman a couple of times. 
 
Q. When did you first meet Mr. Goldman? 
 
A. I met him with Nicole. It was - she was coming back from - I 
was meeting Nicole for lunch at Starbucks. I was just coming back 
from my office and she was sitting there with - we were going to 
go to Rosti's but we met at Toscana and she was sitting there with 
Ron Goldman and a couple of his friends. That was the first time I 
had met him. 
 
Q. Did she introduce you to Ron? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. And did you stay there for the lunch? 
 
A. No. We only stayed there to have - I was just going to pick her 
up there because she had been running or something and I was 
picking her up. 
 
Q. So when you arrived there, you were introduced to Ron and 
then you and Nicole shortly left? Is that right? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Is that the first time you had ever even heard of Ron Goldman is 
when Nicole introduced him to you? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And when is the next time that you saw or spoke to Ron 
Goldman? 
 
A. We were sitting at Starbucks and Ron was - all of the tables 
were typically taken . We used to sit on the very low wall in front. 
And there wasn't a lot of seats and Ron was sitting - Nicole was on 
the wall, sitting on the wall, and I was sitting on the wall, and O.J. 
was - excuse me, Ron was sitting down with a couple of friends, 
his gym friends, and O.J. came and got out of the car. 
 
Q. He pulled up in his car? 
 
A. He pulled up in the Bentley. 
 
Q. He parked the car? 
 
A. Parked the car. 
 
Q. And got out, and did what? 
 
A. He just said to him, This is my wife, you know, I want to talk to 
you, Nicole. And she went over to the car and talked to him. 
 
Q. No introductions, just came out and said what you just testified 
to? 
 
A. To my best recollection, yeah. 
 
Q. Was he upset? 
 
A. He seemed upset. And I - you know, we just did - O.J. used to 
get upset whenever Nicole was around any guys, so it was normal 
to us. 
 
Q. In your experience with O.J. Simpson, would you describe him 
as not a jealous person or a jealous person? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
Q. How would you describe him in terms of his attitude towards 
Nicole? 
 
A. I would describe O.J. as an extremely jealous person. I would 
describe him as - I don't know what he is like with other women, 
but with Nicole, he was very obsessed and very jealous of her. 
 
Q. Was he possessive? 
 
A. Highly. 
 
Q. Was he controlling? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. Yes, he was. 
 
Q. On this occasion when O.J. Simpson came up to you, Nicole, 
and Ron and some of Ron's friends and he said, this is my wife, 
what did you say? 
 
A. He addressed the people there, This is my wife and he said, I 
want to talk to her. 
 
Q. And did Nicole go off and talk? 
 
A. Nicole went off and talked. 
 
Q. Did you hear what they were saying? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Did Nicole come back? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. Did she say what had just happened with O.J.? 
 
A. Yes, she did. She just said, he thinks I must be doing one of 
these guys. Just typical O.J., and she ignored it. It was not a big 
deal at all. She was used to it. 
 
Q. Is that the last time you ever saw Ron Goldman? 
 
A. No. There was one other time. Right before the weekend I was 
staying with Nic we all went dancing one night at Roxbury and 
Ron was there with his friend Mike and - no, that was his friend 
Doug, I think his name was. I had only met them once before, once 
or twice before, so I didn't really- 
 
Q. And you were there? 
 
A. Uh-huh. 
 
Q. And Nicole was there? A. Yes, and they were there at the same 
time. It just - I guess they had asked - 
 
Q. You were not there together? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Was Nicole with Ron, were they together that night? 
 
A. No. To my knowledge, she was never with Ron physically. 
 
Q. What you are saying is that to your knowledge, Nicole never 
had a romantic involvement with Ron Goldman? 
 
A. To my knowledge, not at all. 
 
Q. They were just friends? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. What's the time frame when you saw Ron Goldman at 
Starbucks and when you saw him at this dance club? I think you 
just told me the dance club time frame. What about when you saw 
Ron at Starbucks? 
 
A. This is after we came back from Mexico. 
 
Q. So sometime in May 1994? 
 
A. Mm-hmm, early May. 
 
Q. Did you and Nicole ever have a conversation about whether 
Nicole would take a long yacht trip with O.J. Simpson? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Excuse me? 
 
A. Yes, we did. 
 
Q. Did you ever discuss that subject with O.J. Simpson? 
 
A. Mm-hmm. Yes. 
 
Q. Tell me about your conversation with O.J. Simpson on that 
subject. First tell us when you think it occurred, to the best of your 
recollection. 
 
A. In Cabo San Lucas, when he first arrived, O.J. had mentioned 
that he was thinking about surprising Nicole for her birthday and 
renting a yacht to take all, Nicole and myself and Ron and Cora 
and Cici and, you know, for a trip for Nicole's birthday. 
 
Q. This is Cabo 1994, April, right? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And it would be the birthday of Nicole in May of 1994, right? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Please continue 
 
A. And I thought it sounded great and I wanted, you know, to - this 
was when they were getting along real well and I thought they 
were going to get married again, and I asked Nicole about it and 
she said, yeah, it sounds great, interesting, and he had planned a 
trip on another yacht they had taken together. And when we 
discussed it later, she said, Absolutely no way am I going to go on 
a yacht with O.J. you know, I can't get away from him if he starts 
getting crazy, so she put the kabosh on the trip and told him that 
she wouldn't be going.  Q. Did you and O.J. ever discuss Nicole's 
refusal to go on this yacht trip with him? 
 
A. I don't recall having any great conversation over it that sticks 
out in my mind. 
 
Q. During the Northridge earthquake in January 1994, you were 
living where? 
 
A. I was living in Brentwood with Christian Reichardt. 
 
Q. And Nicole was living where? 
 
A. In Brentwood, on Bundy. 
 
Q. And you felt the earthquake? 
 
A. Oh, yes. 
 
Q. Very severely? 
 
A. Yes, we did. 
 
Q. Do you know if Nicole did? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. Now, she was at the Bundy condo with the children, Justin and 
Sydney, right? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Was O.J. Simpson there? 
 
A. No, he wasn't - no, pardon me. She was not with Justin and 
Sydney. Justin and Sydney had spent that weekend with Nicole's 
parents, so she was in the condo by herself. 
 
Q. I see. This is January 17, 1994? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And was O.J. Simpson in town? 
 
A. No. He was in Atlanta. 
 
Q. Do you know whether he came back immediately after the 
earthquake? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. A. No. No, he did not. Nicole - he did 
not come back, he actually - no, he did not come back. 
 
Q. Did you ever discuss with Nicole why O.J. did not come back 
after the earthquake? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. What did Nicole say about O.J.'s not coming back after the 
earthquake? 
 
A. She felt he was - she didn't feel protected by him. She felt that 
that was a very horrific time for all of us and that she was - she just 
felt that he should be back with his family. 
 
Q. And to your knowledge, he did not come back? 
 
A. No, he did not come back. She joined him in Atlanta, actually. 
 
Q. How long afterwards? 
 
A. A week or so after. 
 
Q. That was for the Super Bowl ? 
 
A. Yes, for the Super Bowl. 
 
Q. So that would have been in late January? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Do you know anything about an expensive bracelet that Nicole 
received from O.J. Simpson in the middle of May 1994? 
 
A. Yes, I do. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the form. 
 
Q. What do you know about that bracelet and Nicole's receipt of it? 
 
A. That was Nicole's birthday present. 
 
Q. From whom? 
 
A. From O.J. 
 
Q. Do you know, did Nicole tell you that? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Was this a time when Nicole had already told O.J. they had split 
up, right? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Had they reconciled again? 
 
A. No, they hadn't. O.J. had been coming over. This was during the 
time where he had - Nicole had double pneumonia and she was 
bedridden for a while and he was - and Nicole had said that she 
was too weak to fight with him about the split-up, that she didn't 
have the energy and that he was, you know, sending her flowers, 
sending her soup and breakfast. He was being - he was really being 
the charming O.J. and taking care of her, and she had - she had said 
to me that she made it clear to him that she was just weak and I - 
and she said that she didn't believe that he - she thought he was 
coming back into her life. She thought he thought she was coming 
back into her life. 
 
Q. Did you ever find out what Nicole did with that bracelet? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. What did she do? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. Nicole told O.J., not only the bracelet, but she also gave him the 
diamond earrings that he had given her for Christmas, to take them, 
she couldn't be bought, she didn't want him - to take them back, 
she didn't want them, that she wanted him to leave her alone, that - 
she gave the bracelet back to him and she gave the diamond 
earrings back to him shortly after he had given them to her because 
he was now coming on a daily basis and it was as if she - he felt 
she owed it to him to be with her. 
 
Q. Did you ever talk to O.J. Simpson about his giving that bracelet 
or Nicole's returning of that bracelet to him? 
 
A. No, he did not. 
 
Q. Now, you had a number of telephone conversations with O.J. 
Simpson in May of 1994 about Nicole's decision to end the 
relationship? 
 
A. Mm-hmm. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. Did O.J. Simpson express to you at any time his willingness to 
accept that decision? 
 
A. Accept - 
 
Q. Nicole's decision to end the relationship. 
 
A. No, he never did. 
 
Q. Did he indicate to you an unwillingness to accept the decision? 
 
A. Yes, he did. 
 
Q. What did he say to you to indicate that unwillingness? 
 
A. He said that she was obviously overwhelmed by him and that, 
you know, she - he just felt, he just said she was going to, you 
know, come back to him. 
 
Q. He told you he wanted her to come back? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. What did he tell you, Ms. Resnick, in these telephone 
conversations about whether or not - 
 
MR. MARKS: May I just say, you already asked many questions 
about this whole area and you have many responses from the 
witness. I think repeating the same, you know, questions, I don't 
know that that's appropriate. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I certainly don't intend to do that. I just have a 
question or two. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Is there a question? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am going to ask a new question. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Okay. 
 
Q. In your telephone conversations with Mr. Simpson in May of 
1994, did he tell you that he wanted to stay in a relationship with 
Nicole? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. Yes, he did. Many times. 
 
Q. Now, you spoke to Nicole on June 12th by telephone; is that 
right? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. Before that conversation, had you had any conversations with 
Nicole about the recital for Sydney? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. And in those conversations, was there any discussion about 
whether O.J. Simpson would be attending the recital? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague and leading. 
 
A. Yes, there was. 
 
Q. When did these conversations occur? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. 9 o'clock the night - the night she was killed. 
 
Q. Before the 9 o'clock conversation on June 12th, the night she 
was killed, did you speak to Nicole at all about whether O.J. 
Simpson would be going to the recital? 
 
A. Not that day, I did not have a chance to talk to her. 
 
Q. What about the day before or any days before? 
 
A. No. She - I knew the recital was - you know, we talked about 
the recital. She said that he would probably be in town. It wasn't a 
big conversation. 
 
Q. Okay. And who called whom on June 12 at around 9 o'clock 
p.m.? 
 
A. I called Nicole. I returned her phone calls. 
 
Q. Did you call Nicole because you thought that's when she might 
be home from the recital? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did you know that she had also gone out to dinner after the 
recital? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 
 
Q. How did you know that? 
 
A. Because she had told me that her family was in town, when she 
came to visit me, her family was coming into town and it was 
going to be a weekend of family and that they were going to dinner 
after the recital and we talked about what Sydney was going to 
wear at the recital and we talked about, you know, the fact that - 
she briefly mentioned that she didn't want to see O.J. there, but he 
probably would be. And, you know, we had talked about that when 
she - when I saw her. 
 
Q. Now turning to the 9 o'clock phone call, tell me what you and 
Nicole discussed at the 9 o'clock phone call on the evening of June 
12th. 
 
A. I asked her how the recital went and she said it was great. She 
focused on the kids the most, and the recital, the conversation 
regarding the recital. I asked her if she - if O.J. showed up and she 
said she did - he did. I asked her how she, what did she say to him 
and she said she told him to leave her alone, that he was not 
welcome in her family any longer, that he was not welcome to join 
them for dinner. She said he was in a deep, dark mood and she said 
that he had been trying to get a hold of her and she wasn't returning 
his phone calls, or that she wasn't talking to him. And she was - the 
rest of the conversation was just brilliant. She was just the happiest 
girl I had ever talked to. She was free. She said she was free. And 
she was. She was free of him for a very short period of time. 
 
Q. When did Nicole - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI. Withdrawn. 
 
Q. Nicole told you, as you have just said, that O.J. Simpson had 
been trying to call her but she would not take his calls or return his 
calls? 
 
A. She said she didn't want to talk to him and she wasn't taking his 
calls. She wasn't having conversations with him. 
 
Q. Did she tell you that O.J. Simpson was calling her that evening? 
 
A. He had been trying to call. He had been calling. 
 
Q. Did Nicole say how many times he had called on the evening of 
June 12th? 
 
A. No, she did not. 
 
Q. Was that the last time you spoke to Nicole? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did you attend Nicole's funeral? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. Did you see O.J. Simpson there? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. Did he say anything to you? 
 
A. Yes, he did. 
 
Q. What did he say? 
 
A. I asked him what happened and he said that, out of everyone, 
that I should know that he loved her too much. 
 
Q. And you had known Nicole Simpson or Nicole Brown Simpson 
since July 1992 in - 
 
MR. MARKS: May we take a break at this point for about five 
minutes? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. I am almost finished. 
 
MR. MARKS: I understand, for five minutes, we are going to take 
a break. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 2:33 and we are going off the

A. Yes, we did.

A. No. 
 
Q. Did you or Nicole consult anyone regarding the opening of the 
coffee shop? 
 
A. Nicole had checked into Starbucks, we were thinking about 
opening a franchise. She found out that they didn't sell franchises. 
Then we were looking for locations sometimes to see different 
places to open, to just open our own coffee - we were going to 
have like a java-poetry bar with coffee and teas and such. 
 
Q. Did you and Nicole discuss how much money it would cost to 
open up the coffee shop? 
 
A. Yes. We thought that we could each put $40,000 into it. 
 
Q. Do you know whether Nicole had that money? 
 
A. She said she did. 
 
Q. Did you have that money? 
 
A. Yes, I did. And also my ex-husband was willing to finance any 
monies that I needed. 
 
Q. Who was that? 
 
A. Paul Resnick. 
 
Q. You have told us that your relationship with Nicole began in 
July of 1992? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And you were extremely close friends with her until she died in 
June of 1994?

Exodus treatment center? 
 
A. No. June 8th. 
 
Q. June 8, 1994? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. So it was only during the last couple of weeks of Nicole's life 
that you had a problem with this relapse? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Now, when you say you relapsed during the last couple of 
weeks of Nicole's life, what do you mean by that? 
 
A. That means that I had - what do I mean by "relapsed"? 
 
Q. Yes. 
 
A. That means that I had gone into treatment in 1992 and due to a 
very stressful time in my life, at that time my father had died - 
excuse me, my sister had died, my father had gone into a coma for 
eight months, and I was going through a divorce, and I relapsed in 
1992, went into treatment. 
 
Q. When was that in 1992? 
 
A. I believe the date was February 20th. And from 1992 until - 
from February 20th until 1990 - until the late part of May 1994, I 
was sober, off of cocaine. 
 
Q. And sober from any other drug use, correct? 
 
A. Yes. Although I had taken medication for my operation, for my 
operation. But that was prescribed. And I was socially drinking. 
But that was - that's not drugs. 
 
Q. Were you abusing alcohol from July of 1992 until the time 
Nicole died? 
 
A. I was never an alcohol abuser. I was a social drinker. 
 
Q. What kind of - when you relapsed in the end of May, early June 
1994, what drug did you start using? 
 
A. I started using - I had taken some Valium to calm my nerves. 
Around May 3rd or 4th, I had taken two Valiums, I believe. And 
then the last week in May, I relapsed on cocaine. 
 
Q. What quantity of cocaine were you taking when you relapsed in 
June of 1994? 
 
A. I used to do $20 a day when I would do cocaine. 
 
Q. What kind, what quantity of cocaine did $20 buy? 
 
A. A quarter of a gram. 
 
Q. What was the total dollar amount of cocaine that you used 
during this relapse in June 1994, until you went into the treatment 
center? 
 
A. I think, at most, $200. 
 
Q. Did you pay for the cocaine? 
 
A. Yes, l did. 
 
Q. Where did you obtain this $200 worth of cocaine over the 
period of a week or two? 
 
A. From my friend. 
 
Q. What is the name of that friend? 
 
A. His name - the name I had given to Christopher Darden a long 
time ago, [Name Deleted]. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I didn't hear the last name. 
 
Q. How do you spell that? What is his last name? 
 
A. [Name Deleted].. 
 
Q. [Name Deleted]., something like that? 
 
A. I believe so. 
 
Q. What was [Name Deleted].'s occupation, if you know, at the 
time you purchased these small quantities of cocaine from him? 
 
A. He was a real estate investor and a real estate man, I guess. He 
had been a friend of mine for quite a while. 
 
Q. Did - and you said you gave his name to Christopher Darden? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. And that's in the course of your discussing the facts and 
circumstances of this case with the Los Angeles prosecutor's 
office? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Do you know if [Name Deleted] is a Colombian drug dealer? 
 
A. [Name Deleted]. is a friend of mine. He is a businessman. He is 
a normal person who - no, he is not Colombian. I don't even know 
if he is a drug dealer. 
 
Q. Do you know if he has ties to Colombian drug dealers? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
Q. Do you know if he has any? 
 
A. I - I know he has - no, I am sure he doesn't. 
 
Q. Do you know if he has ties to organized crime? 
 
A. I wouldn't think so. I - I didn't, I never discussed things like that 
with him. He's a businessman, a nice man, and a friend of mine. I 
never thought to ask a question like that. That would be - I don't 
think in those terms. I don't ask questions in those terms, of that 
nature. 
 
Q. There was an intervention of your family and friends? 
 
A. No. Not of my family. Only of my friends. 
 
Q. Where was that intervention? 
 
A. It was at my ex-fiance's home, in Brentwood. 
 
Q. Christian Reichardt? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Who attended? 
 
A. Christian Reichardt, Kathy Harouche, Bruce and Kris Jenner, 
my ex-husband Paul Resnick, and Nicole. 
 
Q. Was there a leader at this intervention? 
 
A. Nicole had called for the intervention. 
 
Q. Do you know why Nicole had called for the intervention? 
 
A. Yes, I do. 
 
Q. Why? 
 
A. Because I had told Nicole that I had had a problem in the past, 
before I had met her, when I had went to Betty Ford and that when 
times get stressful for me, I am not really good at handling stressful 
situations, and that if she had ever seen me lapse back and start 
using cocaine, that she was to call my husband and make sure that 
that didn't go any further than necessary. 
 
Q. Why was Nicole the leader of the session, this intervention 
session? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. Nicole was the only one that knew that I was doing drugs. 
Nicole was the only one that - Nicole felt that - why was she the 
leader? Excuse me. 
 
Q . Nicole was your best friend at the time, right? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection, leading. 
 
A. Yes, she was my best friend. 
 
Q. Was she your best friend? 
 
A. Yes, indeed, she was my best friend. 
 
Q. At the time of the intervention? 
 
A. Yes. At the time of the intervention. 
 
Q. Did Nicole ever discuss with you whether Sydney or Justin ever 
said anything to her about abuse by O.J. Simpson? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. What did Nicole say to you about that? Let me sharpen my 
question a little bit. In the months of May and June of 1994, 
obviously before Nicole's death, did Nicole ever discuss with you 
her children's reaction to the issue of abuse? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection to the leading. 
 
A. No, she did not. 
 
Q. Did you discuss it at an earlier time frame? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. When? 
 
A. Actually, I had the discussion with - I witnessed the discussion 
that Sydney had with her mother. 
 
Q. Where was that discussion? 
 
A. It was on Gretna Green and it was - 
 
Q. When did it take place? 
 
A. It was right before Nicole had - right before we had gone to - 
May, Nicole had told Sydney we were going to Mexico and her 
daddy would probably join us, and Sydney was unclear as to why 
O.J. was starting to come around again. 
 
Q. So this would be in May of 1993? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. When the reconciliation began? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And you were present during this conversation between Nicole 
and Sydney? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Okay. Can you continue to relate that conversation, please. 
 
A. Sydney had said that Nicole - Sydney had said that she didn't - 
she actually begged her mommy not to do it. Her words were, 
mommy, please, I don't want all the fighting to start again. And 
that was the conversation that I had. 
 
Q. Do you know whether either Justin or Sydney ever saw any 
physical abuse by O.J. Simpson against Nicole? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object. Leading. Vague. 
 
Q. The question is do you know. 
 
A. Do I know and - 
 
Q. And then I will ask you how you know. 
 
A. Not firsthand knowledge. 
 
Q. Did you have secondhand knowledge of that? 
 
A. That Sydney was very aware because that her room was next to 
theirs. She had heard a lot of the beatings and Nicole had once 
alluded to the fact that Sydney had witnessed - 
 
Q. Witnessed what? 
 
A. - something that she shouldn't have seen. 
 
Q. Some act of abuse? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection to the leading. 
 
A. That's how I took it. 
 
Q. Some what? 
 
A. Something she shouldn't have witnessed. 
 
Q. From the sense of the conversation, how did you take it? 
 
A. I took it - 
 
MR. LEONARD Objection. 
 
A. I took it as to that Sydney had witnessed some of the abuse. 
 
Q. And when did - 
 
MR. MARKS: Can we just be clear on whether there was, that Ms. 
Resnick was told there had been physical abuse? I want to be clear 
on this. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I was just going to ask that question, Mr. 
Marks. 
 
Q. What you just related to us is what Nicole told you? 
 
A. Let me make it very clear. 
 
Q. Please. 
 
A. When Nicole had told me about the abuse, she also said that 
Sydney had overheard a lot of the fightings, a lot of the beatings, 
and she had at that time mentioned to me that she was afraid that 
Sydney had seen some of the abuse and - 
 
Q. And this was at the Palmilla restaurant in Cabo, in April of 
1994? 
 
A. Yes. And I did not question her further on that. 
 
Q. But in an earlier time, in May of 1993, at Gretna Green, you 
were present with Sydney, Nicole - 
 
A. When Sydney made the statement. 
 
Q. That - when Sydney said, mommy, don't go back with daddy? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
Q. What did Sydney say? Tell us again. 
 
A. Sydney said, Mommy, please, don't. I don't want daddy and you 
- I don't want all of the fighting to begin. She was opposed to the 
reconciliation, absolutely. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you very much. 
 
THE WITNESS: Thank you. 
 
MR. MARKS: May Mr. Daniel Leonard take his examination? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I don't know about Mr. Brewer. 
 
MR. BREWER: I have some questions, I probably have a half hour 
or an hour. In light of your representation it's going to take you a 
day, let's get you started. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: May we go off the record to readjust the 
microphones, please? The time is 3:14 and we are going off the 
record. 
 
(Recess taken.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 3:20 and we are back on the 
record. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q. Ms. Resnick, I have an additional question I neglected to ask 
you earlier. Why did you resume taking cocaine in late May or 
early June of l994? 
 
A. At that time it was a horrific time in my life. I was nervous for 
Nicole's well-being, due to the threats that were made by O.J. I was 
nervous for myself because O.J. had told me that I had betrayed 
him by not telling him that Nicole was planning on leaving him. I 
was also, at that time, I had just broken my engagement with 
Christian Reichardt, due to some financial difficulties that he had 
put me in, amongst other reasons. I had been working for Christian 
for a year and he was to pay me $2,000 a month, which he did not. 
The entire year, he paid me $2,500. I had loaned him $20,000 in 
the month of March that he and his friend were to pay me back, 
that he said he could not and it was very stressful for me in every 
way at that time. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you. 
 
EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD: 
 
Q. Good afternoon, Ms. Resnick. 
 
A. Good afternoon. 
 
Q. If you have any problem understanding my questions, please let 
me know and if you need to break at any time, just let us know and 
we will accommodate you. 
 
A. Thank you. 
 
Q. You were having severe financial difficulties in May of 1994? 
 
A. I wouldn't call them severe. 
 
Q. How would you characterize them? 
 
A. I was used to living a very wealthy life for most of my life, and 
I no longer had the capabilities of continuing that. 
 
Q. Would you say you were broke at that time in, let's say, June of 
1994? 
 
A. I would say, in comparison to my life - 
 
MR. MARKS: Well, I think, I would like your question to be 
whether she had any money at the time or something like that or - I 
don't like the term. You should ask her what her finances were or 
something like that. 
 
MR. LEONARD: What is your objection? 
 
MR. MARKS: Objection to the phrase, not to the - 
 
Q. Would you say that you were broke in June of 1994? 
 
A. I would say that, to my estimation of living, you could say that. 
 
Q. You thought you were broke, right? 
 
MR. MARKS: How about asking her what money she had at the 
time, instead of just asking for some kind of general description. 
You can ask her about whether she had any losses. I mean - 
 
MR. LEONARD: Is that an objection? 
 
MR. MARKS: I want the question to be clear about what her 
finances were. I have no problem with that. 
 
Q. Did you have any difficulty understanding my question? 
 
A. To answer your question, I had money in the - I had money. I 
was - certainly didn't have what I used to have. 
 
Q. So you wouldn't have characterized yourself as being broke in 
1994, is that correct, in June of 1994? 
 
A. I believe I characterized myself as not having the monies that I 
used to have in the past and broke, to me, might be different than 
broke to someone else. 
 
Q. Did you represent to anyone in 1994, in June, that you were 
broke? 
 
A. I could have. 
 
Q. Who would that have been? 
 
A. I couldn't say. I don't know where the question's coming from. 
 
Q. But it's possible that you could have told someone in June of 
1994 that you were broke? 
 
A. It's possible. 
 
Q. Were you having, at that time, multiple financial setbacks? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: June '94? 
 
Q. Let's say May and June of '94. 
 
A. Multiple financial setbacks? 
 
MR. MARKS: Can you talk about specifics? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I think it would be helpful if you object - 
 
MR. MARKS: My objection is only to the phrase that you are 
using, multiple financial setbacks. If you want to ask something 
specific about what was going on in her financial life, I have no 
objection. 
 
Q. Can you answer the question? 
 
A. I don't really know how to answer that question. I would also 
like for you to be a little more specific, if you could. 
 
Q. Did you have anything that you would characterize as a 
financial setback in June or May of 1994? 
 
A. I don't know what you are referring to. 
 
Q. You mentioned earlier something about a $20,000 loan - 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. - to Christian? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. That was actually a loan for a woman friend of Christian's; is 
that right? 
 
A. That's what I was told. 
 
Q. Did you know the woman? 
 
A. Yes. It was a friend of Christian's. 
 
Q. Did you speak to this woman about why she needed the money? 
 
A. I spoke essentially with Christian about it since it was 
Christian's friend. Christian asked me to loan his friend and he this 
money, Christian guaranteeing the loan. But this was in March. 
 
Q. And was that something that was bothering you in May of 1994, 
the fact that you had loaned this money? 
 
A. It certainly did bother me. 
 
Q. And why was that? 
 
A. Because they didn't pay me back. 
 
Q. You also mentioned that Christian was supposed to pay you 
$2,000 a month? 
 
A. Yes, he was. 
 
Q. And he never paid you that amount? 
 
A. He paid me $2,500 altogether for the year. 
 
Q. Anything else, let's say, in March, April, May or June of 1994, 
in the financial realm, that was causing you a problem? 
 
A. Not - no. 
 
Q. Okay. Just those two items that you have talked about? 
 
A. That's all I can think of. 
 
Q. What happened in the exact - tell me exactly what happened 
with regard to the $20,000. When did you learn that there was 
going to be a problem with that? 
 
A. Christian had promised me that this woman would pay me back 
within one month. I had learned of that when she didn't pay me, 
one month later. 
 
Q. And what kind of effect was this having on you on, let's say, 
your day-to-day life at this time, your ability to pay for things, the 
fact that you didn't get the $20,000 back? Was that affecting you? 
 
A. My life continued. My credit rating was perfect. I had money in 
my savings. It's something that I certainly anticipated was, added 
stress to my life, but my life continued. 
 
Q. Were you feeling insecure about your finances in June of 1994? 
 
A. Yes, I was. 
 
Q. I want to go back through briefly some of the areas you 
discussed with Mr. Petrocelli. You talked about a conversation that 
you overheard that Sydney had with Nicole, and you said that was 
in May of 1993? 
 
A. It was before leaving to - yes, it was in May of '93. 
 
Q. Where did that discussion take place? 
 
A. In Gretna Green, in the den. 
 
Q. Other than Nicole - well, was Nicole there? Obviously, she was 
there. She was talking to Sydney, right? 
 
A. Yes, she was. 
 
Q. Okay. Other than Nicole and Sydney, was anyone else present 
for that? 
 
A. Not that I can remember. 
 
Q. Do you remember what time of day it was? 
 
A. No, I don't. 
 
Q. Do you remember how long - it was before you went to Cabo? 
 
A Yes, it was. 
 
Q. How long before? 
 
A. Oh, within a couple of weeks. 
 
Q. Do you remember the dates that you went to Cabo that year? 
 
A. We were there over Mother's Day. 
 
Q. With regard to the intervention, was there any discussion at the 
intervention of the amount of drugs that you were doing? Did that 
come up at all? 
 
A. No, it did not. 
 
Q. It wasn't mentioned at all? 
 
A. Not that I can remember. 
 
Q. Was there any discussion at the intervention that you recall 
about whether you were free-basing cocaine? 
 
A. Yes, there was. 
 
Q. Tell me what you remember about that discussion. 
 
A. They asked me if I had been. 
 
Q. And what did you reply? 
 
A. I denied it. 
 
Q. Was that true? 
 
A. It was not true. 
 
Q. You had been free-basing? 
 
A. I had free-based for - I had relapsed and I admitted it, 
eventually. 
 
Q. You had free-based at the Bundy townhouse at some point? 
 
A. Once or twice. 
 
Q. And you free-based before, shortly before you went on a trip to 
Cabo? Is that right? 
 
A. No. That is not true. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What time frame, Mr. Leonard? 
 
Q. When - how many trips to Cabo did you take in April and May 
of '94? 
 
A. Two trips. 
 
Q. You went the very early part of April, correct, and then you 
went again at the very early part of May? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Do you remember the dates of the second trip? 
 
A. I believe it was the 20 - it was the last, it was the last part. 
 
Q. It was the weekend before you went to stay with Nicole, 
correct? 
 
A. Close to that time, yes, I believe so. 
 
Q. You went to stay with Nicole, you said, on the 2nd or 3rd of 
June? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. So it was that weekend before? 
 
A. Yes. Around that time. 
 
Q. Excuse me? 
 
A. Around that time. 
 
Q. Well, do you recall going on a weekend in May to Cabo? 
 
A. I do believe I already said I did. 
 
Q. And it was that weekend, that last weekend in May, before you 
went to Nicole's, that you went to Cabo? 
 
A. I'm not quite sure if it was that weekend before, or the weekend 
before that. We didn't make reservations, we went on a private jet 
of my friends. 
 
Q. Who were your friends? 
 
A. The Harouches. 
 
Q. Who else went on that trip? 
 
A. Christian Reichardt. That's when I broke up with him. 
 
Q. When did you start - when was the first time you free-based 
cocaine in May or June of 1994? 
 
A. The very last weekend of May. 
 
Q. Do you recall where you were when you did that? 
 
A. Yes, I do. 
 
Q. Where were you? 
 
A. I was in my home. 
 
Q. Was anyone else present? 
 
A. No, they were not. 
 
Q. When was the next time you free-based cocaine in either May 
or June? 
 
A. It was, I believe, the day after. Not the following day. The day 
after. 
 
Q. Again, this is the last weekend in May, you said? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. How are you so sure about the date on that? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The question is argumentative. 
 
Q . You know for sure that it was the last weekend in May? 
 
A. I know exactly that I relapsed for two weeks. 
 
Q. And you are sure that you free-based on that last weekend in 
May? 
 
A. To my knowledge, to the best of my knowledge. That's my 
recall of it. 
 
Q. And on both occasions, you were at your house? 
 
A. Yes, I was. 
 
Q. And by yourself? 
 
A. Yes, I was. 
 
Q. Did you see Nicole that weekend? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. The weekend that you were free-basing. 
 
A. I believe so. 
 
Q. Do you recall where you saw her? 
 
A. I am not quite sure as to - as exactly, that weekend, where 
Nicole was. 
 
Q. You had savings, did you say, in 1994? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. How much did you have in your savings? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Vague as to time. 
 
Q. Let's say in June of 1994. 
 
A. I had $20,000. And I also had money with my sister. 
 
Q. And your sister's name? 
 
A. Patricia Elizabeth Hutchison. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What was the first name? 
 
THE WITNESS: Patricia. 
 
Q. The incident at the funeral where you say O.J. said to you, out 
of everyone, she should know that I loved her too much - 
 
A. No, that is not - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No, that is not what the witness said. 
Mischaracterizes her testimony. 
 
Q. Okay. Just tell me what he said. 
 
A. "Out of everyone, you know that l loved her too much." 
 
Q. Okay. And that occurred at the funeral? 
 
A. Yes. At the gravesite. 
 
Q. Who was present when O.J. said that? 
 
A. I was. 
 
Q. You were alone? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Where was O.J.? 
 
A. Sitting across from Nicole's coffin. 
 
Q. And where you were in relation to him when he said this? 
 
A. Sitting right next to him across from the closed coffin. 
 
Q. What did you do immediately after O.J. said this to you? 
 
A. I left. 
 
Q. You left the area? Where did you go? 
 
A. I went and I had a cigarette. 
 
Q. You did nothing in between? 
 
A. I could have. 
 
Q. You don't - you don't recall doing anything in between? 
 
A. I don't recall anything of importance. 
 
Q. The telephone call at 9 o'clock on the 12th of June, where did 
you make that call from? 
 
A. I made that call from a phone booth in Exodus Recovery 
Center. 
 
Q. It was a phone booth? 
 
A. Yes, it was. Q. Do you remember which one it was or where it 
was in relation to your room? 
 
A. I believe it was the middle phone. There was three phones; I 
believe it was the middle one. 
 
Q. How long did that telephone conversation last? 
 
A. Approximately 30 minutes, I would think. 
 
Q. With regard to O.J. Simpson, Nicole said - you asked Nicole if 
O.J. had shown up, right? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And she said yes and then she told him to leave, to leave her 
alone, correct? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And that he was not welcome? 
 
A. In her family any longer. 
 
Q. In her family. Did she tell you that she said anything else to 
O.J.? 
 
MR. MARKS: You mean, apart from what she's already testified 
about? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Yes, apart from that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No, she testified - 
 
MR. MARKS: She gave more, I think she made some more points 
on, she said a little bit more, when she was asked the same 
question by Mr. Petrocelli. 
 
Q. Tell me again, what did he say? 
 
A. What did he say? 
 
Q. What did she say that he said? 
 
A. She said that - she told me what she said, what she said to him. 
 
Q. Okay. And what was that? 
 
A. Which was that he was not welcome in the family, in her family 
any longer, and that she wanted him to leave her alone. He was not 
welcome at dinner. 
 
Q. Did she tell you anything else about the conversation other than 
that? 
 
A. She said he was in a dark, deep mood. I'm sure there could have 
been other things but that was the most important thing. 
 
Q. Did she tell you where she was when she had this conversation 
with O.J. ? 
 
A. No, she did not. 
 
Q. She gave you no detail on that? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Did she tell you who else was around when she had this 
conversation? 
 
A. I wasn't questioning her. 
 
Q. Did she tell you that? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. When was it exactly that you say that O.J. came into Starbucks, 
when Ron Goldman was there? 
 
A. It was when he returned from Mexico. Pardon me, when he 
returned from Puerto Rico. 
 
Q. And you say he was driving the Bentley? 
 
A. Mm-hmm. 
 
Q. Who else was there when this exchange took place, other than 
Ron Goldman? 
 
A. I have already answered that question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: She answered that. 
 
MR. MARKS: It's already been asked. She set out the names of the 
people that she recalled. 
 
Q. Can you give me the names, please? 
 
A. I have done that, sir. 
 
Q. Can you provide them to me again, please? 
 
A. Is that necessary? 
 
Q. Yes. 
 
MR. MARKS: I am going to allow her to do this, but please, don't 
ask her the same questions again, with the same information. You 
can follow up and ask follow-up questions, no problem. Please 
answer the question. 
 
A. It was Ron's friends. 
 
Q. Do you know their names? 
 
A. I think there was Doug and I am not sure if Mike was there or 
not. 
 
Q. Do you know their last names? 
 
A. No, I don't. I didn't really know them. 
 
Q. What did you do to prepare to testify today and yesterday? 
 
MR. MARKS: With respect to any conversations that Ms. Resnick 
had with me or Mark Lafayette, her attorneys, I am going to object 
and instruct the witness not to answer any conversations that she 
had with her attorneys. If there is some other question you have for 
her, please do so. 
 
Q. Other than that, what did you do to prepare, other than speaking 
with your attorneys? 
 
A. Yoga. A lot of yoga. 
 
Q. Did you have any discussions with Mr. Petrocelli? 
 
A. Brief, yes. 
 
Q. Did you review any documents? 
 
A. I went over my books. 
 
Q. And you are referring to the two exhibits that have been put into 
evidence so far? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Anything else? 
 
A. I had a conversation with John Kelly. 
 
Q. Anything else? 
 
A. This had nothing to do with it, I guess, but I was interviewed by 
John Kelly in Los Angeles. 
 
Q. When did that interview take place? 
 
A. Three weeks ago, I would think. I believe. 
 
Q. Were you - you weren't a witness at the criminal trial; is that 
correct? 
 
A. No, I was not. 
 
Q. When was the first time that you spoke to the police about any 
information that you had about O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown? 
 
A. I spoke with the DA. I didn't speak with the police. 
 
Q. When was that, the first time? 
 
A. After I had gotten out of the recovery center. 
 
Q. Did you tell the district attorney essentially what you've been 
testifying to here today? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I object. The question is vague, ambiguous, 
overbroad, lacks foundation. We don't know what the district 
attorney asked her. 
 
Q. Did you tell the district attorney anything about the relationship 
between Nicole Brown and O.J. Simpson? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Vague, ambiguous, overbroad. 
You have the interviews; why don't you show them to her? 
 
Q. When was the first interview? What was the date? 
 
A. I don't know the date. 
 
Q. Was it in July of 1994? 
 
A. I am not sure, sir. If you have the date, I would like to see it. 
 
Q. When did you leave for Vermont? 
 
A. Sometime in August. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You are skipping around. 
 
A. That, I am a little unclear on also. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I don't know how you are doing this, because 
it is very difficult for me to keep track of going from one topic to 
another in random order. I am having trouble. 
 
THE WITNESS: It's difficult. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Wait a second before answering so I can have 
a chance to think where he is going and can object accordingly. 
 
Q. When did you first give a recorded statement to the police or to 
the district attorney? 
 
MR. MARKS: I am sorry, when you mean recorded, you mean 
tape recorded? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I guess we are back from Vermont. 
 
A. I don't know if they tape recorded my first interview, so I can't 
quite answer that question. Recorded, meaning swearing under 
oath ? 
 
Q. No, not swearing under oath, but where you knew there was a 
tape-recording being made. 
 
A. I didn't ask him if they were making a tape-recording of the first 
interview, so I can't say that for sure. 
 
Q. Was it before or after your first book was published? 
 
MR . KELLY: Objection. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The first - 
 
MR. KELLY: What was before or after her first book? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Her first interview. 
 
MR. KELLY: With the tape-recorded aspect of that thrown in there 
too, or not? 
 
Q. The first tape-recorded interview. 
 
A. As I said, I don't know if they recorded the first interview, so - 
 
MR. MARKS: Just to be clear, is your question was her first 
interview with the prosecution before or after her book? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Yes. 
 
MR MARKS: Okay. 
 
A. It was before. 
 
MR. KELLY: And will you just ask her once and for all whether 
she knows whether or not any of her interviews were tape-recorded 
or not? 
 
Q. Do you know that? 
 
A . No, I don't. That's what I am trying to say. 
 
Q. You have never seen a transcript of any interview? 
 
A. No. Tape-recorded, no. 
 
Q. You decided to write a book when? When did you make that 
decision? 
 
A. I made that decision in my - it's hard to say when the decision 
was made. It was brought up to me by my attorney when I went to 
him for protection. Right after I got out of Exodus, I went straight 
to my attorney's office. 
 
Q. You decided you would write a book for protection? Is that your 
testimony? 
 
 MR. KELLY: Objection. That is mischaracterization. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That is argumentative. That's not what she 
said. 
 
A. I - I am sorry, I will let you - 
 
Q. Let me just be sure I get the sequence here. You got out of 
rehab and then you went to see your attorney? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And did you make any recordings at your attorney's office? 
 
A. Yes, I - I handed him a tape that I had made and, of what had 
happened, just in case I was killed by somebody from O.J.'s side. 
 
Q. You said that you made the tape because you thought you were 
going to be killed by somebody from O.J.'s side? 
 
MR. MARKS: She didn't say that. That wasn't her testimony. 
 
Q. Do you have that tape-recording? 
 
A. No, I do not. 
 
Q. Does your attorney have that? 
 
A. I'm not aware of that. I haven't asked him. 
 
Q. What did the - how did you make that tape-recording? Did you 
utilize any documents in order to make that? 
 
A. No. The documents that I had were stolen from my home. 
 
Q. So you didn't use any diaries to make that tape-recording? 
 
A. I didn't have diaries left. They were taken from my home. 
 
Q. How many diaries did you have at your home? 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection. Do you have a time frame? 
 
Q. At the time that they were stolen, how many diaries did you 
have? 
 
A. I have diaries from when I was pretty young, so, a lot. 
 
Q. Were you someone that kept - were you keeping a diary in 
1994? 
 
A. Yes, I was. 
 
Q. Would you keep that on a daily basis? 
 
A. My diary was my calendar also, so, yes, I went through and 
when times were important, I would enter the important times. I 
am not saying it was daily. It was importance. 
 
Q. When you say they were your calendar, can you describe that 
for me? 
 
A. I use a calendar on a daily basis to tell me where I am going and 
I just always buy enough where there is a lot of room every day so 
that it's my form of therapy, and I write down things that I am 
supposed to do and I write down things that are, that have affected 
me. 
 
Q. And the calendar was something that you would make notations 
in pretty much every day? Is that right? 
 
A. Yes. Notations of what I was doing on a daily basis, notations 
of stressful situations at stressful times, or good situations at good 
times. 
 
Q. Was this something that you were trying to keep a secret or was 
this well known to your friends and family, that you were keeping 
a diary? 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection. Time frame. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Let's get - yes. 
 
Q. In 1994 - 
 
A. Yes? 
 
Q. - were you keeping this calendar diary openly? 
 
A. Yes, I didn't - no, I didn't hide it. There was nothing secretive 
about, about my calendars, my diaries. 
 
Q. When did you notice the diaries were missing? 
 
A. After - between the time - well, after I left treatment, and I 
really didn't go to the calendars and notice it until shortly after, 
after I got out of treatment. I believe it was when Christian 
Reichardt had left for some motorcycle trip with his motorcycle 
gang. 
 
Q. Christian Reichardt was in a motorcycle gang? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. How long had he been in a motorcycle gang? 
 
A. I think five or six years - I, for a long time. 
 
Q. Was that something that bothered you, that he was in a 
motorcycle gang? 
 
A. No, it didn't. 
 
Q. Where did you keep the diaries? 
 
A. In my desk. 
 
Q. Did you utilize information from the diaries in making the tape-
recording that you have talked about? 
 
A. I just took a recording and made the information - put the 
information very briefly, it was very short: the major information, 
the death threats, the fear of Nicole. I briefly gave this information 
that I was in fear for my life, a very short recording, to my attorney 
so there wasn't - 
 
Q. But you didn't use the diaries because they weren't - you didn't 
have them, right? 
 
A. I at that point didn't even go to look for them. But eventually, 
when I went to find them, I didn't have them. They were gone. 
 
Q. So you didn't use the diaries? 
 
A. The diaries were from my calendar. I didn't need to use the 
diaries, you know, the memory was very short. 
 
Q. My question is, you did not use the diaries to create the 
recording? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: She has answered that several times. 
 
Q. Just yes or no. 
 
MR. KELLY: I don't think she can answer that yes or no. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Really? 
 
A. I don't think I can. 
 
MR. KELLY: She agrees. I think it is two different issues here. Is 
she using the subject matter she said was contained in the diary to 
make the tape-recording or did she physically use the diaries in 
making the recordings? 
 
Q. You didn't physically use the diaries? 
 
A. I physically used my diaries on a daily basis, and I can say that. 
 
Q . How did you - where were you - 
 
MR. LEONARD: I will strike the question. 
 
Q. Where were you when you made the tape-recording? 
 
A. I'm not sure if my attorney recorded our conversation the night 
that I went to his house, but part of my tape, the tape that I made, I 
was driving in my car, the initial brief tape with the death threats 
on it. I was driving in my car to my attorney's office. 
 
Q. So on that tape you described these death threats that you claim 
O.J. made, right? 
 
A. On the tape I described the death threats that O.J. made. 
 
Q. Okay. Anything else on the tape that you recall? 
 
A. That was the most important. 
 
Q. Anything else that related to the events that transpired, let's say, 
from January 1st until Nicole's death between O.J. and Nicole? 
Anything else on the tape that you can remember? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Are you talking about the initial tape in the 
car on the way to the attorney's office? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Yeah. 
 
A. That I was in fear for my life, that I had told my counselors that 
he had threatened, that I had told Christian I wanted the tape to be 
known that there were people that knew of this. That was the 
substance - that was the information that was, that my attorney 
needed to know. 
 
Q. So one of the things you said on the tape-recording was that you 
had told your counselors in - and do you mean the counselors at the 
rehab center? Is that what you are talking about? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Okay. You told them about the death threats? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. No question about that in your mind? 
 
A. No question at all. 
 
Q. Which counselor? 
 
MR. KELLY: Well, objection. Can we put this, once again, in a 
time frame? 
 
MR. MARKS: I think that's not an unreasonable question. Please 
answer the question. Fair question . 
 
A. Can I answer the question? 
 
Q. Yes, sure. 
 
A. I had told the two counselors and one of the administrative staff 
at the time that they had told me that Nicole was murdered, I just - 
it just came out of my mouth that he had said that he would murder 
them, murder him - her. God. At the time that I was told that 
Nicole was killed, I had no control over what came out of my 
mouth. I had immediately uttered that he said he would kill her. 
 
Q. And who was it that you uttered that to? 
 
A. There was Lori, I am not quite sure of her name, she is one of 
the head counselors at Exodus; Albert Torres, who was the 
administrator of Exodus. The two of them were the people who 
told me that Nicole was murdered. And there was Leslie Mirsch, 
who was also - 
 
MR. KELLY: I am sorry, what was the name? 
 
THE WITNESS: Mirsch. 
 
MR. KELLY: No, the first name. 
 
THE WITNESS: Leslie. 
 
A. - who was also in the room. 
 
Q. Do you know how to spell her last name? 
 
A. No, I am sorry, I do not. 
 
Q. And this is something you said to these three individuals, they 
were all in the same room with you? 
 
A. I said it to the two counselors who told me that Nicole died, but 
Leslie was also right there and I remember feeling nervous that 
somebody would tell somebody and I would be killed next. 
 
Q. Now, was that the first time that you told anyone at the rehab of 
the situation, that you felt fearful of O.J.? 
 
A. Yes, it was. 
 
Q. You didn't tell them, when you were admitted, that that was one 
of the problems that you were having, one of the reasons that you 
relapsed? 
 
A. I had promised Nicole I wouldn't tell anyone . 
 
Q. So you didn't tell them? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. In fact, what you told them was that you were broke, right? 
 
A. I don't recall what I told them at the time. 
 
Q. You have no memory of what you told them the reason was that 
you relapsed into cocaine? Is that your testimony? 
 
A. My testimony is that when I checked in to Exodus, I wasn't in a 
very good mood and I certainly, you know, I told them that I had 
been to Betty Ford and that I don't deal with stress very well and - I 
am not sure. You tell me. 
 
Q. Well, I am trying to get your best memory at this point. 
 
A. I understand. 
 
Q. You had been in a rehab center before? 
 
A. Yes, I have. 
 
Q. And one of the things they do is they - there is an initial 
interview when you first arrive, right? 
 
A. Yes, there is. 
 
Q. And they ask you at that initial interview, the counselor or 
somebody like that, they ask you why, why do you think that you 
relapsed, right? 
 
A. Mm-hmm. 
 
Q. Right? Isn't that right? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did you tell them that one of the reasons you relapsed is that 
you were fearful for your life? 
 
A. To tell them? 
 
Q. Did you tell them that at that time? 
 
A. I am sure I did not. 
 
Q. You did not? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Did you tell them, even in general terms, that you were fearful 
of something happening to you? 
 
A. I don't believe so. You need to ask the counselor. 
 
Q. But you don't have any memory of that? 
 
A. No, I do not. 
 
Q. Did you, on the other hand, tell them that you were having 
financial difficulties? 
 
A. I could have. 
 
Q. Did you tell them that that was the reason that you went into 
relapse? 
 
A. I think, if anything, I probably told them that I had broken up 
with my fiance and that I was having financial difficulties. 
 
Q. And of course, you were having financial difficulties? 
 
A. I believe we have already covered that. 
 
Q. You had been receiving alimony up until, what, June of '93, 
from Paul Resnick? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And you were getting $12,000 a month? 
 
A. I was getting - it depended on the time frame. It was sometimes 
less than that, yes. And also lump settlements. 
 
Q. And that alimony stopped in June of '93? 
 
A. Yes, it did. 
 
Q. Other than the $2,500 that you say Christian paid you for, what, 
1994, for all of 1994, what other source of income did you have in 
1994? 
 
A. I had a business with a friend and we used to sell accessories. 
 
Q. Who was that friend? 
 
A. Kathy Harouche. 
 
Q. How much money did you make in 1994 from that business? 
 
A. I am not exactly sure. I invested the monies in the inventory and 
I certainly made back my investment. I believe I invested $20,000 
into it and I'm not exactly sure how much money there was made 
out of it. 
 
Q. Do you think you - 
 
A. I am not the best businesswoman. 
 
Q. Do you think you got significantly more than your investment 
back, let's put it that way, or did you sort of break even? 
 
A. I am not quite sure, to be honest with you. I would like to know 
that answer. 
 
Q. Other than that, what other source of income - other than that 
and the $2,500, what other source of income did you have in 1994? 
 
A. Child support from my ex-husband. 
 
Q. In what amount? 
 
A. With the private school, it totaled up to, I guess, $1,000 a 
month. 
 
Q. You said earlier that you had some type of operation in, you 
said, March of '93 - or February of '93? 
 
A. I said March, I believe. 
 
Q. Of '93? Well, that's what you testified to. That actually occurred 
in March of '94, correct? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me, excuse me, she said March of '94 
in her testimony. 
 
A. Of '94. 
 
MR. LEONARD: She did? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
MR. MARKS: Let's get it straight. When is the correct date? 
 
THE WITNESS: The correct date is March of 1994. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's the way I remembered it. 
 
A. There was a lot of dates yesterday. 
 
Q. So if you did say 1993, that was a mistake and it was March of 
1994? 
 
A. I don't believe I said March of '93. If I did, it was a mistake. 
 
Q. And that was a woman's operation, right? 
 
A. Yes, it was. 
 
Q. How did you pay for that? 
 
A. I paid for it with monies that I had. 
 
Q. Did you sell a fur coat to Kathy Harouche to pay for that? 
 
A. I did not sell a fur coat to Kathy Harouche to pay for it. 
 
Q. You did not. Did you own a black mink coat? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. You never sold that to Kathy Harouche? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. And when was that? 
 
A. It was a month prior. I didn't use it anymore. 
 
Q. A month prior to the operation? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And how much did you get for it? 
 
A. I don't know, $6,500, something like that. 
 
Q. And so you paid for - you didn't have health insurance, right, at 
that time? 
 
A. I am not sure if my COBRA, my insurance policy was still 
there. But it didn't cover this type of operation. 
 
Q. So you used funds that you had available from some other 
source? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And you didn't finance it through the sale of the coat? 
 
MR. KELLY: Well, objection. I don't think she can characterize 
the commingling of the funds there that paid for it. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I think she's already testified that she did not 
sell the coat to pay for the operation. In any event, I must at this 
point object that this is entirely irrelevant. - 
 
THE WITNESS: Irrelevant. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: - to the issues at hand, which are the murders 
are Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown. I can't see how this 
conceivably relates and I think this is harassing. I would ask that 
you move on to a topic of relevance. 
 
MR. MARKS: Again, as I said in the beginning of this deposition 
to counsel of both sides, questions have to be material, necessary, 
relate to the allegations of both sides in their pleadings and not be 
argumentative. Please follow those rules, because those are the 
rules that govern here. I don't know what they govern in California. 
 
MR. BREWER: Something like that. 
 
Q. Did you pay for your treatment at Exodus? 
 
A. I paid for part of my treatment at Exodus, yes. 
 
Q. And what part - first of all, do you know what was the entire 
amount, how much it cost? 
 
A. I believe it was $5,700 in total, because I paid cash. 
 
Q. And which portion - how much did you pay? 
 
A. I paid, I believe, 2,500 of that. 
 
Q. Who paid the rest? 
 
A. Christian Reichardt paid from the money that he owed me. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: So you in effect paid for all of it, then. 
 
THE WITNESS: I paid for all of it. Thank you. 
 
Q. At what point did you decide to write a book about your 
experience with O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson? 
 
A. I - the point - at what point? When I was told that my testimony 
would be given to the defense team immediately after I gave it to 
the prosecution, I had decided - I had been told also that I would 
more than likely not be able to testify due to my drug treatment, 
and that's when I decided to get the book to the public, just in case 
I was not able to live long enough to talk about it. 
 
Q. So your - are you saying that your only motivation in writing 
the book was to get the story out in time, something like that? 
 
A. I'm saying that I wanted to save my life. I am a mother. And 
that I was afraid that the public would not get to the public due to 
that. 
 
Q. So you weren't interested in the financial aspect of the book? 
You didn't - 
 
MR. MARKS: She didn't say that. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Okay. 
 
Q. Did you think that you were going to make some money out of 
the book? 
 
A. I think that whenever you write a book, there is money to be 
made, yes. 
 
Q. And you were interested in making money? 
 
A. I was - 
 
MR. KELLY: I object. Can we put that in a time frame also? 
 
A. I was interested in getting the information to the public and I 
was interested in saving my life. 
 
Q. Did you think that, at least as a residual effect, if you will, that 
you would make some money in the process of writing the book? 
 
A. I was - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I think she has already answered that. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I don't think she has. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: She said she understood she would make 
money. 
 
Q. Did you have any idea of how much money you would make? 
 
A. I didn't have any idea. 
 
Q. Did you consult with any - other than attorneys, did you consult 
with anyone else about how to go about writing this book? 
 
A. No, I did not. And I only consulted with my one attorney, my 
private - my PI attorney. 
 
Q. Who was that? 
 
A. Arthur Barens. 
 
MR. MARKS: Obviously, no questions with respect to 
conversations she had with her attorney. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Other than those that have been waived in the 
book here? 
 
MR. MARKS: If it is specific questions with respect to aspects in 
the book, that would be different. 
 
MR. KELLY: It would also be improper, if she consulted with her 
current attorneys, whether that constitutes as a waiver also. 
 
Q. How did you find your way to Mr. Walker, who co-authored the 
book? How did that happen? 
 
A. I didn't find my way to Mr. Walker. My publisher, once I was in 
Vermont, brought him to Vermont to co-write the book with me. 
Excuse me, can we take a break? 
 
MR. MARKS: Let's take a break, because I gather we are going to 
go off, the video is about to go off in a few minutes, so let's take a 
short break. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 4:17, and this is the end of 
tape number 4 of the deposition. 
 
(Recess taken.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 4:38 and this is tape number 
5 of the deposition of Faye Resnick. 
 
BY MR. LEONARD: 
 
Q. Let me just ask you another question about the diaries. Did you 
file a police report when you discovered that they were missing? 
 
A. No. I was too afraid to. 
 
Q. Did you report that they were stolen, to anyone else? 
 
A. Yes. I told my friends. 
 
Q. Who did you tell? 
 
A. I told Kris Jenner. She was who I was staying with at the time. 
 
Q. Anyone else? 
 
A. I told the prosecution. 
 
Q. Who in particular on the prosecution? 
 
A. Marcia Clark. Oh, pardon me, Patty Fairbanks. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Instead of Marcia? 
 
THE WITNESS: Every time I talked to Patty, I felt I was talking to 
Marcia, because she relayed everything. 
 
Q. Other than Kris Jenner and Patty Fairbanks, did you report this 
to anyone else, the fact that the diaries were missing? 
 
A. To my attorney. 
 
Q. Was that Arthur Barens? 
 
A. Mm-hmm. 
 
Q. Anyone else that you can think of? 
 
A. Not that I can recall. 
 
Q. When you went about actually writing the book, tell me how 
you did that. First tell me in general terms how you wrote the 
book, and I am talking about the first book you wrote, the private 
diary. 
 
A. Mike Walker and I sat down with transcribers and transcribed 
the information that I gave him and then we would sit down and 
write the chapters from that. 
 
Q. So you would sit with Mike Walker while you were dictating? 
Is that what was going on? 
 
A. While the transcribers and the - yeah. 
 
Q. Was there ever a time when Mike Walker wasn't present when 
you were with the transcribers and actually dictating portions of 
the book? Was he always present? 
 
A. Mike was always present - I would say he was always present. 
 
Q. Then the transcribers would create some type of a manuscript or 
draft? Would you then review it? 
 
A. No. We would refer back to it if there was any questions. 
 
Q. Did you have questions? 
 
A. I questioned - I wanted to make sure everything was as accurate 
as possible. 
 
Q. You wanted to make sure that The Private Diary was basically a 
full and complete and accurate record of what you had 
experienced, right? 
 
MR. MARKS: I don't think that's what her testimony was. 
 
Q. You wanted it to be as accurate as possible? 
 
A. I wanted The Private Diary to reflect what was happening 
during the last two years of Nicole's life. 
 
Q. And you wanted it to be as accurate as possible? 
 
A. I would say that, yes. 
 
Q. And were you trying to describe as accurately as you could the 
important incidents that occurred in that period? 
 
A. Under the stressful circumstance that it was, yes, I was. 
 
Q. And do you feel that you succeeded in doing that? 
 
A. I feel that The Private Diary - 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection. 
 
MR. MARKS: I - 
 
MR. KELLY: I am going to ask - 
 
MR. LEONARD: I will withdraw the question. 
 
MR. KELLY: I would ask the witness to give yes or no answers to 
the questions that call for yes or no answers, rather than injecting 
feelings and thoughts and things. 
 
Q. Did you ever have to get help with some details on, in writing 
the book? Did you ever have to consult with other people who had 
been involved in some of these events? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. You did not? Did you ever call Christian Reichardt during, 
while you were writing the book, to find out any information about 
anything that happened, that you were writing about in the book? 
 
A. Not to my recollection. 
 
Q. Did you ever call Cora Fishman to ask her about any 
information that you were writing about in the book? 
 
A. Absolutely not. 
 
Q. You did not. Do you recall - 
 
MR. BREWER: Can we get a verbal response? You were just 
shaking her head like this. It has to be yes or no. 
 
MR. MARKS: I thought she said "absolutely not." 
 
MR. BREWER: Well, I didn't hear it. Okay. 
 
Q. So your testimony is you didn't consult with anyone else that 
was involved with any of these incidents while you were writing 
the book in order to check the accuracy of what you were writing? 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection. I think that that is a mischaracterization. 
You asked her just about a couple of specific people. You didn't 
ask her if she consulted with anybody. You just asked her- 
 
Q. Did you consult with anybody else? 
 
A. The question "consulting," no. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Okay, I will withdraw that. 
 
Q. Did you - did you have any questions about any of the 
information that you were writing about; for instance, dates or 
events that occurred or how the events occurred, while you were 
writing? Did you have questions? 
 
A. No, I did not have any questions about the, what I was writing. I 
talked to friends to authenticate the book after it was written . 
 
Q. After it was written? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. But not before, not during? 
 
A. Not to my best recollection. 
 
Q. And who were those friends? 
 
A. Robin Greer, Cynthia Shahian, Kris Jenner and Candace 
Garvey. 
 
Q. Do you recall specifically any of the areas that you had 
questions about or that you - excuse me, that you wanted to get 
authentication from, from any of these people? Do you recall any 
of the areas that you needed to get authenticated? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Mischaracterizes the testimony. 
 
Q. Did you call these people for, to authenticate certain 
information that you had already written about in the book? Is that 
what you said? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Okay. Do you recall, for instance, what you were seeking to get 
authenticated by Robin Greer? 
 
A. Not one particular event that I was - nothing in particular. Just 
wanted her to authenticate the book, anything she recalled. 
 
MR. MARKS: Can you just define your reference to say 
authentication? Did she just get information about it, is that what 
you mean? 
 
Q. What did you mean by that, when you used that term? 
 
A. Authenticate meant to corroborate the information after it was 
already written . 
 
Q. And again, this was after the book was already written? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. At some point after the book was written, did you or did 
someone at your request create a correction sheet? 
 
A. Edited changes. 
 
Q. Edited changes? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Was there - were those changes ever actually made into any 
publication of the book? 
 
A. Minor - the corrections of - some of them were, yes. There was 
some that were not able to. 
 
Q. And were these - these edit - did you call them editing 
corrections? Is that what you called them? 
 
A. Mm-hmm, yes. 
 
Q. Did you make those as a result of discussions you had with 
other individuals, when you went to get the authentication? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. You did not? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Do you recall one of the editing corrections was changing the 
name Marcello to Alessandro? Do you remember that? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Was that a mistake that you made? 
 
A. No, it was not. 
 
Q. Why did you change the name? 
 
A. I was told by the publisher that we should call him Marcello. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You said change Marcello to Alessandro; is 
that what you said? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: She is talking about changing Alessandro to 
Marcello, so you have it reversed. 
 
Q. There was an editing change from Marcello to Alessandro, 
wasn't there? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Okay. And - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: But it - okay. 
 
Q. But that never found its way into the book? 
 
A. I don't know if that, if in the second printing it was changed, to 
be quite honest with you. I know that in Shattered, in the audio 
version I used Alessandro. 
 
Q. Explain to me again, why did you use Marcello in the first 
edition? 
 
A. Alessandro was going around telling people he was being 
deported or something like that and he wasn't supposed to be in 
this country or whatever, and I was just trying to protect the 
innocent, that's all, and the publisher felt that that was the best 
thing to do. 
 
Q. Did you indicate in the book at any point that you were using 
names that were inaccurate? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The book speaks for itself. 
 
Q. Do you recall doing that in the book anywhere, having anyone 
do that in the book? 
 
A. I'm not quite sure. I think we did say that Marcello wasn't his 
real name in the book. 
 
Q. You did? 
 
A. I believe so. 
 
Q. When was the last time you spoke to Alessandro? 
 
A. I saw - I was walking, like, two weeks ago, said hello on the 
street briefly. No conversation, really. 
 
Q. Have you ever discussed with Alessandro the events that you 
described involving him in this book? 
 
A. No, I have not. 
 
Q. Let me go back to April of 1993. You testified that before April 
of 1993, you had a discussion with Nicole Brown Simpson where 
she described in some detail beatings or a beating that she had. Is 
that right? 
 
MR PETROCELLI: May I hear the question back, please? Hold 
on. (Record read.) 
 
A. I had a dis - yes. 
 
Q. When was that discussion? 
 
A. I believe we have already gone over that. 
 
Q. Do you have a date that it occurred? 
 
A. It was at Toscana restaurant and it was during the year of 1993. 
 
Q. And other than Nicole, was anyone else present? 
 
A. I believe it was just the two of us. It was definitely the two of 
us. 
 
Q. And she described in detail the beating that you say that she told 
you about, right? 
 
A. What I recall of my testimony was that she was very vague and 
it was over the pregnancies. 
 
Q. So your testimony is that she didn't describe in any detail the 19 
- 
 
MR. LEONARD: Let me strike that. 
 
Q. Did she describe in detail the 1989 911 alleged beating? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You are saying in detail? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Yeah. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: As opposed to generally? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Yeah. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Because the witness already testified about 
the 1989 and the pregnancy beatings in this conversation. I guess 
the question is in detail. 
 
A. Are you asking me the question - 
 
Q. You testified that she told you that Nicole was kicked, right, and 
punched, right? She told you - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me - hold on, Mr. Leonard. She 
testified that before April of '93, Nicole told her about two 
beatings, one the '89 beating and the other the pregnancy beatings. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Right. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's what her prior testimony is. Now 
which beating are you talking about? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I am talking about the alleged beating in 1989. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
A. The alleged beating in 1989, Nicole did not go into the detail at 
that time that she went into in the latter part. 
 
Q. She - 
 
A. She went into some detail but she did not go into the detail that 
she had in the latter conversation in May of '94. 
 
Q. Did she - but she told you, she gave you some details about that 
she was kicked, punched and all that, right? 
 
A. She gave me details, vague details of the nature of it, yes. 
 
Q. You next had a discussion with her - and that wasn't until, in 
Cabo, right, in 1993 - or 1994, correct? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: About beatings? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Yes. 
 
Q. You first met Nicole, though, in July of '92, right? 
 
MR. MARKS: I think her testimony was, if I am correct, she may 
have met her earlier but it wasn't until July of '92 that they became 
friends and started spending more time together. 
 
Q. You became close to her from July 4th, 1992, right? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And prior to that, you hadn't had any discussions with her about 
personal matters, correct? 
 
A. Correct. 
 
Q. And you weren't privy to any of her private affairs, right? 
 
A. That's not true. 
 
Q. Did you - had you had any discussions with O.J. Simpson prior 
to July of 1992? 
 
A. Only one. 
 
Q. And when was that? 
 
A. That was when I first met him and we were introduced by 
Susannah and it was brief. Strictly introduction. 
 
Q. When did you - when did you first meet Keith Zlomsowich? 
 
A. I first met Keith very early on in my friendship with Nicole, 
right around July or August. 
 
Q. Did you - were you friendly with Nicole when the incidents 
allegedly occurred where O.J. was hiding in the bushes and peering 
in the window? Were you friendly with her then? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Referring to when O.J. saw Nicole and Keith 
having sex? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Yes. 
 
Q. Were you friendly with Nicole then? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I think that is asked and answered already. 
 
MR. MARKS: Well, she can answer the question. 
 
A. Yes, I was a friend of hers. 
 
Q. Did you attempt to intercede at any point with O.J. about this 
incident ? 
 
A. Much later on. 
 
Q. When was that? 
 
A. When we were having - when I had a conversation with him 
about his behavior the night of the - that he knocked down the 
door, that he mentioned to me he had seen Keith's picture. 
 
Q. I want to go back to the incident that- 
 
MR. LEONARD: Let me strike that. 
 
Q. Let me ask you about the instances where you say O.J. was 
using cocaine. 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. He was - you described an incident on December 23rd, 1993? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And you said that he was - when he did the cocaine, he had 
some very obvious reaction? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Was Nicole there? 
 
A. Yes, she was. 
 
Q. How did she react? 
 
A. She thought it was normal. 
 
Q. She thought that was normal? 
 
A. She had been married to him forever. 
 
Q. Did she disapprove of his using cocaine? 
 
A. She didn't like it. 
 
Q. She didn't react to that? 
 
A. She just - not really. 
 
Q. Was she looking adoringly at him at that time? 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection as to the form of the question. I don't 
think she can answer as to Nicole's state of mind or appearances. 
Nicole was looking at someone. 
 
Q. Do you recall writing in your book that Nicole was looking at 
O.J. adoringly that night? Do you recall that? 
 
A. I recall that she was very much in love with him that night. 
 
Q. When you were at the Hermosa Beach sushi bar - was it the 
California Sushi Bar? 
 
A. Yes, it was. 
 
Q. O.J. was acting in what, I believe you said, was an animalistic 
rage; is that right? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Were there a lot of people around? 
 
A. Many. 
 
Q. And at the table - actually, you were at a sushi bar? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And Christian was there and Nicole was there? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. How many other people were right in that area, can you tell me, 
approximately? 
 
A. We were sitting at the very end of the bar and we had taken up 
the entire, this part of the bar, so we were somewhat secluded from 
the rest of the bar. The other bar went this way and the wall was 
this way. O.J. was exactly against the wall. 
 
Q. Then he at some point - you went down to the ladies room? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. And he went down and you say crashed the door in? 
 
A. Yes, he did. 
 
Q. How many people were outside when that happened? You said 
there were three women waiting in line? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Was there anyone else in that area? 
 
A. It was a lower bar area that was essentially empty. 
 
Q. And when he came back up, there was a - the manager was 
there, is that right? 
 
A. Mm-hmm. 
 
Q. Do you remember the manager's name? 
 
A. No, I do not. I didn't talk with him. 
 
Q. The manager - could you see whether the manager observed 
what O.J. was doing? 
 
A. Yes. The person that was standing at the maitre d' station, which 
I assume was the manager, observed O.J.'s behavior. 
 
Q. Did you see the manager react in any way? 
 
A. He just looked strange, he looked at O.J. and us very strangely. 
 
Q. Did the manager say anything? 
 
A. No, he did not. 
 
MR. MARKS: Excuse me, it's 5 o'clock, so if it's acceptable - 
 
MR. KELLY: Can we keep going for a little bit, maybe? 
 
MR. MARKS: Maybe for a little bit - 
 
MR. KELLY: As long as we could today. 
 
MR. MARKS: Only for a few minutes. It is a long tiring day, 
obviously. 
 
Q. At Toscana, you testified that O.J. was in an animal rage for 10 
minutes; is that right? 
 
A. I didn't say he was in an animal rage. I said that he was 
perspiring, I said that he was threatening Alessandro and I said that 
he was being aggressive. 
 
Q. And he was - you said he was leaning over the table and he was 
hunched up; is that right? 
 
A. Yes. He was like this. 
 
Q. And Christian was there with you? 
 
A. Yes, he was. 
 
Q. Who else was present? 
 
A. As I testified yesterday, Cynthia Shahian, Cora Fishman, Ron 
Fishman, Nicole and O.J. 
 
Q. Did the others in the party discuss O.J.'s behavior? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You mean, to her knowledge? 
 
MR. LEONARD Yes. 
 
MR. KELLY: And at what time, if at all? 
 
A. I would assume while I was in - 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection. I will ask the witness not to assume 
anything. 
 
A. I'm not sure. I went to the restroom. I had a conversation with 
Nicole about it. 
 
Q. Okay. Did you - are you aware of - so you are not aware of any 
discussion that occurred after that, amongst the parties there? 
 
A. My discussion - no, I am not aware of any other discussion at 
the table about it. It was kind of natural at that point for us to see 
him do things like that. 
 
MR. MARKS: Mr. Leonard, I don't want to interrupt you but if 
you would like to finish any more questions about that particular 
incident, I think that will close for today. 
 
MR. LEONARD: No, I am finished with that area. 
 
MR. MARKS: Thank you.

FAYE RESNICK, having been previously sworn, resumed the 
stand and testified further as follows: 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Good morning. Today is February 
12,1996. The time is 10:21 a.m. This is tape number 6 of the 
continued deposition of Faye Resnick. 
 
CONTINUED EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD: 
 
Q. Good morning, Ms. Resnick. 
 
A. Good morning. 
 
Q. In yesterday's testimony and testimony from the day before, 
have you told us every significant conversation that you had with 
O.J. Simpson regarding Nicole Brown Simpson? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Overbroad, lack of foundation. Requires the 
witness to recount each and every piece of testimony she has given 
over the last several days. I object on those grounds. 
 
MR. KELLY: I agree. 
 
Q. Can you answer the question? 
 
MR. MARKS: I think those objections are appropriate. If you have 
a specific question about a particular conversation with her, there is 
no objection whatsoever. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Are you instructing her not to answer? 
 
MR. MARKS: I think the question is improper, but I am not 
instructing her not to answer any questions you ask about 
conversations that she had with O.J. Simpson. 
 
MR. LEONARD: You are instructing her not to answer that 
question? 
 
MR. MARKS: The form of the question. If you have any question 
you want to ask about conversations with O.J. Simpson, I have no 
objection whatsoever. 
 
Q. Have you told us every significant conversation you have had 
with O.J. Simpson regarding Nicole Brown Simpson? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. 
 
MR.KELLY: Objection. I think if you are going to ask her about 
conversations, can you ask her about specific times, places or dates 
or reference, any other conversation is just not - 
 
MR. LEONARD: I will put in a time frame. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I also have an objection, Mr. Leonard. No 
one has a clue what you mean by "significant." What does 
"significant" mean in this context? 
 
Q. Have you told us about every conversation you had with O.J. 
Simpson regarding his relationship with Nicole Brown Simpson, 
let's say, for the last three months of Nicole's life? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Same objections. I think it is highly - 
 
MR. KELLY: That she can remember. 
 
MR. LEONARD: That she can remember. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I still think it is highly improper and I object. 
It lacks foundation, it is vague, ambiguous, it is overbroad. 
 
MR. KELLY: Frankly, she would have to review her entire 
testimony again, now, and start thinking and try to remind herself 
or think if she has been asked about every one, and if not, I mean, 
she could take the day to try and review, decide - 
 
Q. Can you answer the question? 
 
MR. MARKS: Again, I don't mind you asking her any questions 
about conversations, but she had so many conversations that she's 
indicated with Mr. Simpson, that if there is a particular area, a 
particular type of conversation, a particular area you consider is 
significant you want to question her about, I have no objection. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The question also lacks foundation. 
 
Q. Other than the - let me start over again. Do you recall how many 
conversations you had with O.J. Simpson in May of 1994, 
regarding Nicole Brown? 
 
A. No. I don't recall exactly how many conversations. 
 
Q. You have a - as you have testified, you have a significant 
recollection of one conversation in particular you had with him 
where you say that he threatened to kill Nicole. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I object on the ground that it mischaracterizes 
her testimony. She never said she had a significant recollection of 
one conversation in particular. She had a recollection of a number 
of conversations in response to specific questions. I object on that 
ground. 
 
MR. MARKS: I have no objection if you want her to go answer the 
question about that conversation or - that's okay. 
 
Q. Other than the conversation on, I think you testified somewhere, 
I think you said, on May 2nd, 1994, were there any other 
conversations that you recall where O.J. Simpson threatened to kill 
Nicole Brown Simpson, or he told you he was going to threaten 
her? 
 
A. Not to my best recollection. 
 
MR. KELLY: I would ask the witness once again just to answer 
yes or no to questions that ask for yes or no answers. 
 
MR. MARKS: I think she wanted to complete her answer. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I think she was in the middle of her answer. 
 
Q. I thought the answer was no, not to your recollection. 
 
A. Yes, although you are putting the date May 2nd and I said I 
believe it was May 2nd, it could have been May 3rd. 
 
Q. Okay, whether it was May 2nd or May 3rd, you don't recall any 
other conversations with O.J. regarding that? 
 
A. Not to my best recollection. 
 
Q. I want to ask you a few questions about your background. You 
were born in - what was the year you were born? 
 
A. 1957. 
 
Q. And how many siblings do you have? 
 
MR. MARKS: What's the relevance of this? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Well, this is a discovery deposition. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What is the pending question? 
 
(Record read.) 
 
MR. MARKS: I will let her answer that. 
 
A. I have - I now have five siblings. My sister died three years ago. 
Four years ago. 
 
DI Q. Can you just give me their names and ages, please? 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't want them exposed to this. 
 
MR. MARKS: The witness does not want her family exposed to 
this and we don't think this is relevant. 
 
MR. KELLY: I will object as to relevancy. 
 
MR. MARKS: I will object and instruct her not to answer. Your 
questions should focus on the period from July 1992, when she 
says that she became friendly with Nicole Brown Simpson and her 
conversations with Nicole and O.J. Simpson, from there all the 
way to the present. No problem. 
 
MR. LEONARD: You are going to restrict me from asking her 
background questions? Is that right? 
 
MR. MARKS: No. It depends on what the questions are. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Can you state the reason why you need to 
know the names of her siblings? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I think I have the right to probe the background 
of a witness. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Why? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Why not? This is a discovery deposition. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It doesn't mean that there is no limit, Dan. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I understand that. I didn't think that was such an 
onerous question. 
 
Q. How many times have you been married? 
 
A. Three times. 
 
Q. Can you give me the dates of your marriages and names of your 
husbands? 
 
A. Rick Barnett was my first husband, married on Labor Day, 
when I was 21 years old. Fadi Halabi was my the second husband. 
I was 21 years old when I married Rick Barnett. 
 
Q. And how long was that marriage? 
 
A. Eight months. 
 
Q. And when was your next marriage? 
 
A. To my second husband, Fadi Halabi, and that marriage was 
1986 or 1987. 
 
Q. So approximately one year - oh, I am sorry, that's when the - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's when she - 
 
Q. And how long did that last, that marriage? 
 
A. It lasted approximately one year. 
 
Q. And the first name for Mr. Halabi? 
 
MR. MARKS: You mean, spell it, in spelling? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Yes. 
 
A. F-a-d-i. 
 
Q. And after that, you were married to - 
 
A. To Paul Resnick. 
 
Q. And the date of that marriage and when it ended? 
 
A. That was 1987, I believe it was November 11th, I think. And 
that ended in 1991. 
 
Q. Approximately when in 1991? 
 
A. Excuse me, it could have been in 1988 that I was married to 
him. In '91, I am not sure exactly the date of the divorce. 
 
Q. And you indicated that you were having a relationship with 
Christian Reichardt during the period that you knew Nicole; is that 
right? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. When did that start, that relationship? 
 
A. It started in 1991. 
 
Q. When did you break up with Mr. Reichardt? 
 
A. I broke our engagement at the end of - the first time I broke up 
was the end of April and confirmed at the end of May. 
 
Q. Now, you say you broke up the engagement? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. Why did you do that? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's totally irrelevant. 
 
MR. MARKS: I am going to object to that. You are talking about 
1994? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Yes. You are instructing her not to answer? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It's irrelevant. 
 
MR.MARKS: Yes. It's irrelevant. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Okay. 
 
Q. You broke up with him down at Cabo? Is that where that 
happened? 
 
A. The first time, yes. 
 
Q. Do you remember approximately when that was? 
 
A. I broke up with him - actually, there were two Cabo trips. When 
I first - when we were all in Cabo San Lucas in April, I started 
telling him that this is not working and that I was considering 
calling off the engagement. 
 
Q. That was in the April trip? 
 
A. Mm-hmm. 
 
Q. And then? 
 
A. And then, when we went to Cabo again with my friends, I had 
given him back his engagement ring, told him that I could not 
continue to be his fiance. 
 
Q. And that was in - when was that? 
 
A. I have to say that, in this case, because we went, we didn't make 
travel plans or arrangements, I have to say that I'm not quite sure of 
the date of that. 
 
Q. Did you indicate in your book Private Diary that that - 
 
MR. LEONARD: Well, strike that. 
 
Q. You indicated in your book Private Diary that you were, on 
May 27th, in that weekend, that you were in Los Angeles and you 
did some things with Nicole. Do you remember that? 
 
A. Yes, I remember that. 
 
Q. And then you created or someone created at your behest, one of 
the others, some corrections to the book? 
 
A. Yes. There were corrections created. 
 
Q. And in the corrections you indicated that, in fact, you were not 
in Los Angeles, but you were in Cabo that weekend? 
 
A. As I said, that was the weekend that I was very unclear about. 
That was a time - I was unclear about that weekend. 
 
Q. But the correction indicates that you were in Cabo that 
weekend, that is, the weekend of May 27th, right? 
 
A. I would like to see the corrections - 
 
MR. KELLY: Why don't you ask her, if you are making reference 
to something specific, let's mark it and refer to it. 
 
(Defendant's Exhibit 80, Los Angeles County District Attorney 
Bureau of Investigation investigator's report, marked for 
identification, as of this date.) 
 
MR. LEONARD: It's been marked as Exhihit number 80. 
 
MR. MARKS: What is the page reference? 
 
MR. LEONARD: It would be - it looks like there are some Bates 
stamps at the top. It would be page 25 - hold on just a second. It 
would be 2522, at about the middle of the page. 
 
MR. MARKS: What page number is it? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Page 187. 
 
MR. MARKS: Okay, thank you. 
 
Q. Have you had a chance to review that? 
 
A. I need a minute, please. 
 
Q. Okay. 
 
A Yes, I have. 
 
Q. Okay. Now, does that refresh your recollection as to whether 
you were at Cabo on the weekend of May 27? 
 
A. It refreshes my recollection that obviously there was some 
question as to exactly where I was on that weekend and that's why 
there was an edited change in the first pass because I did not have 
any diaries with me. 
 
Q. Do you now remember where you were that weekend? 
 
A. To be quite honest with you, that weekend was when we went 
to Mexico with the Harouches. It is very unclear to me. As I said, I 
did not make travel plans, we went on their jet. It is very unclear to 
me. 
 
Q. How did you go about making this correction? How did that 
happen? 
 
A. That correction happened because that, it was - it actually said it 
was a very quiet weekend, but at the same time it said we went out 
dancing two nights. That's my best - that's what I was trying to 
correct. 
 
Q. Okay. 
 
A. Because that was edited out - it was edited wrongly. I know the 
difference between a quiet weekend and going dancing two nights 
of the weekend, so that was the change that I was looking for. In 
editing of a book, I had no - I did not have the ability to be there, 
so there was a lot of edited versions that were not actually specified 
to me until afterwards. 
 
Q. So you didn't have a chance to read the book before it was 
finally published? 
 
A. No, I did not. 
 
Q. So you haven't - is it fair to say you have no idea how that 
correction paragraph was created? You don't know? 
 
A. No. That's not - I didn't say that. 
 
Q. Did you have any input into that? 
 
A. Yes. My input was that the difference was we did not spend a 
quiet weekend if we went dancing two nights. That was the point I 
was trying to make. Thank you. 
 
Q. And from any source, do you have any knowledge as to how the 
information that's in the correction paragraph got there? Do you 
have any knowledge at all about that? 
 
A. Please repeat the question. 
 
Q. Yeah. Well, the correction paragraph says, in fact, that you were 
in Cabo that weekend, right? That's what it says, in essence. 
 
A. I have indicated in the last questions that that particular Cabo 
trip I am very unclear about because I did not make the travel 
arrangements, so to be quite honest with you, without my diaries, I 
could not keep that in proper order. 
 
Q. And you don't know who supplied this information for this last 
paragraph? 
 
A. Everything came through my publisher. 
 
Q. Everything came through your publisher? Was this one of the 
areas that you sought out any authentication from, and what else -- 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection. What area? 
 
Q. This area about where you were that weekend, did you speak 
any assistance from anyone else to try to determine that? 
 
A. Not that I can recall. I didn't think it was that significant. 
 
Q . You testified yesterday that you were using cocaine, you say, 
from towards the end of May, I guess the last week in May until 
the point that you went into the rehab center, right? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Were you using cocaine two to three times a day during that 
period? 
 
A. Yes, I was. 
 
Q. You were using it two to three times a day every day, is that 
right? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Every day? 
 
A. I did not say that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: During what period? Be real specific. 
 
Q. During the period, let's say, from the last week of May until you 
went into the rehab center. 
 
A. I did not say that I was using cocaine every single day for the 
last two weeks. 
 
Q. Were you using it occasionally two to three times a day? 
 
A. That's - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: "Occasionally" meaning not every day? 
 
Q. How many days did you use it, if you recall, two to three times? 
 
A. I would say seven days. 
 
Q. Were you using it two to three times a day on June 5th, if you 
know? 
 
A. On June 5th, I couldn't say exactly what day I was using it and 
what day I wasn't. 
 
Q. How about June 3rd? You don't know? 
 
A. I have testified that I used, in the last two weeks of Nicole's life, 
not on a daily basis. I cannot continue to go further with that. 
 
Q. You were using crack cocaine? 
 
A. No, I was not. 
 
Q. Do you remember telling Marcia Clark that you were using 
crack cocaine when she interviewed you? Do you remember that? 
 
A. I never said that. 
 
Q. Do you recall telling Marcia Clark - when she asked you this 
question: "Was it coke" - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What page are you on? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Page 41. 
 
MR. MARKS: Give us an indication of what you are reading from. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Page 41 of the transcript of the statement of 
Faye Resnick. 
 
MR. MARKS: What is the date? 
 
MR. LEONARD: October 20, 1994. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: When you say "the transcript," this was not a 
deposition, was it? 
 
MR. LEONARD: No, it was a tape-recording. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It was a - 
 
MR. LEONARD: It is called Reporter's Transcript. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Page 41, line what? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Line 17. 
 
Q. Starting at line 15: "And I was on drugs during this time, by the 
way, Marcia, to let you know." Do you see that? 
 
MR. MARKS: What line - 
 
MR. LEONARD: Line 15, page 41. 
 
MR. MARKS: What is the question? 
 
Q. Do you recall telling her that? 
 
MR. MARKS: What was the question and what was the answer? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Well, let's skip to the next question . 
 
Q. "Was it coke?" Do you remember being asked that by Marcia 
Clark? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And your answer "Coke and valium"? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And do you recall being asked, at line 25, "Were you smoking 
crack," and your answer "Never"? 
 
A. I - 
 
Q. "I never"? 
 
MR. LAFAYETTE: That's not what the transcript says. 
 
MR. KELLY: In all fairness, we have to continue with what the 
transcript says. 
 
MR. MARKS: Let the witness respond to your question. 
 
A. Please let me respond. 
 
Q. Go ahead. 
 
A. It says "I never," and then it's unclear what's said after - 
 
Q. Do you recall - 
 
MR. MARKS: There are some dashes right after that, a word with 
the letter S before the dashes. 
 
A. I have always said that I never smoked crack because I have 
been told crack is a combination of cocaine and heroin. 
 
Q . You were smoking cocaine, though ? 
 
A. Yes, I was. 
 
Q. Okay. What form of cocaine were you smoking, if you know? 
 
A. Just cocaine. 
 
Q. And how did you do that? Explain that to me. 
 
A. How did I smoke it? 
 
Q. Yes. 
 
A. I put it in a pipe and I inhaled it. 
 
Q. Was the pipe something that you had already or did you get that 
at this time? In other words, did you already have it, a cocaine pipe 
towards the end of May, in your possession? 
 
A. No. No. It's something that I purchased. 
 
Q. Where did you get it, do you remember? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He wants to know if you got it from a 
Colombian drug dealer. 
 
A. At a store. 
 
Q. Okay. And you were purchasing the cocaine from a friend of 
yours? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And would you purchase the cocaine on the days that you were 
using it or would you purchase an amount and then use it over a 
number of days? How did that work? 
 
MR. LAFAYETTE: Excuse me, there seems to be a problem with 
the video. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You need to put a sign on there to be quiet, 
because the sound is leaking through. 
 
MR. MARKS: Would you please repeat the question? 
 
Q. Would you buy a supply of cocaine that you were going to be 
using over a number of days or would you buy the cocaine each 
day on the day that you were going to use it? 
 
A. I will wait for the sound. Typically, I would buy the amount that 
I would use for that day. 
 
Q. And this was from a Mr. [Name Deleted], did you say? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And you would go to his house and purchase it? You purchased 
it at his house? Is that where you purchased it? 
 
MR. KELLY: I don't think that's what she testified. 
 
Q. Where did you purchase it? 
 
A. From my friend. 
 
Q. And where did you go to purchase it? 
 
THE WITNESS: May I talk with you for a second on this? 
 
MR. MARKS: May we take a short break? 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 10:46 and we are going off 
the record. 
 
(Discussion off the record.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 10:48 and we are back on the 
record. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I am sorry, I didn't hear the- 
 
MR. KELLY: Are you finished, Mr. Leonard? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I thought you were going to read the question 
back. That's why I was hesitating. 
 
MR. MARKS: That's all right. 
 
Q. Where did you purchase the cocaine? Where did you go to 
purchase it? 
 
A. I went to my friend's house. 
 
Q. And that's the only place you purchased cocaine during that 
time period? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did you purchase cocaine on the week of Nicole's death? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Give her a date. 
 
Q. Did you purchase cocaine on June 5th or June 6th? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Sunday or Monday. 
 
MR. KELLY: If you recall. 
 
A. My - to my best recollection, I wasn't keeping track of the days 
I was purchasing, so that's very difhcult to answer. 
 
Q. Did you purchase any cocaine within the week prior to Nicole's 
death? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. And did you use cocaine during that week? 
 
A. At times during that week, I did. 
 
Q. Were you using Valium at that time as well? 
 
A. Yes. I had used Valium at times during that week. 
 
Q. You wrote not just The Private Diary, but you also wrote 
another book, the Shattered In the Eye of the Storm; is that correct? 
 
A. Yes. I did. I co-wrote it with Jeanne V. Bell. 
 
Q . During what period did you write Shattered? 
 
A. Shattered was written during the entire time that I was watching 
this trial unfold, while I was working with domestic violence 
victims. 
 
Q. Where were you working with domestic violence victims? 
 
A. Out of my home through correspondence, also at the mission, in 
downtown LA, the Anne Douglas center. 
 
Q. I am sorry, what's that called? 
 
A. The Anne Douglas Center. 
 
Q. When you say out of your home with correspondence, what do 
you mean by that? 
 
A. When the Private Diary was released, I started receiving 
thousands of letters from women and men. Many of the letters 
were women who were in relationships similar to Nicole and O.J.'s 
and they were asking for help to try to get out of their 
relationships, so I was corresponding with them, I was finding 
shelters for them, I was trying to help them because I had felt I 
could not help Nicole. 
 
Q. And what were you doing at the center that you described? 
 
A. I was listening to their stories, I was giving them advice, I was 
going - when the homeless people came off the streets and - 
shedding some light and shedding some hope for them. 
 
Q. How often - 
 
MR. LEONARD: Strike that. 
 
Q. When did you begin your work at the center and do you still 
work there now from time to time? 
 
A. I started working - pardon me. I started working with the Anne 
Douglas mission four years ago and I continued that as soon as I 
was able to come back from Vermont and after I had established 
myself and set up my computer. 
 
Q. How often, let's say, in the last - well, from the time you got 
back to Vermont from the - until the end of the trial, how often on 
a weekly basis would you work at the Anne Douglas Center? 
 
A. I can't say how often. I worked with them weekly and if it 
wasn't over the phone, it was me going to the mission or going to 
their graduations. I worked with the women at my home also. They 
would attend, they would come to my home. That would be very - 
I couldn't answer that question exactly. There was too many times 
for me to be able to answer that. 
 
Q . So you can't give an estimate as to how often you were there on 
a weekly basis? 
 
A. No. I didn't keep track of that. That wasn't my purpose. 
 
Q. Prior to Nicole's death, how often - let's say, in the year prior to 
Nicole's death, how often were you working at the Anne Douglas 
Center? 
 
A. I would like to make something clear. I wasn't working at, for 
the Anne Douglas Center, I was working with the Anne Douglas 
Center. I was working as a volunteer. Whenever I was asked before 
that, I would come in. I would go in and -- there were many times I 
was there in the last four years. 
 
Q. In the one-year period prior to Nicole's death, can you give me 
an estimate of how many times you were actually there working at 
that center? 
 
A. Approximately six, seven times during a six-month period, I 
would say. They would know better than I. 
 
Q. In the one-year period prior to Nicole's death, were you 
involved in any other charity or social work? 
 
A Yes, I was. 
 
Q. Can you tell me what that was? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Before Nicole's death? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Yes, the one-year period. 
 
A. There were a few charities I was involved with. I have always 
worked for educational charities due to the fact that our particular - 
my daughter's particular school district was under financial 
difficulties, we were in the process of going bankrupt, her school 
district, so over the past seven years, I have donated hours upon 
hours upon hours to try to raise funds for the school district and to 
- to answer the question more specific, in the last year of Nicole's 
life, I had worked on charities for the school, I had worked through 
- at the mission and I had also worked on my - I had a friend, Joan 
Copeland's political campaign; she is running for an office, running 
for a seat on the board of education, for the board of education, 
pardon me of Beverly Hills. 
 
Q. When you say you worked at the mission are you referring to 
the Anne Douglas Center? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Do you recall any of the - when you say charities for the school, 
do you recall any of the - those are events; is that what you are 
talking about? 
 
A. Events. Some of them were events. 
 
Q. Okay. 
 
A. But mainly I was working as a fundraiser, and in whatever 
capacity they needed. Whether it be volunteering at the school, I 
was a room mother; I was an art person, I used to go in and help in 
the office many times, it was a commitment I made. Those are a 
few of the things that I, that I was working on. 
 
Q. Can you think of any other? 
 
A. I can think of many other. I think that's probably enough. 
 
Q. Well, can you tell me what the others are? 
 
A. Is that - is that necessary to go into all of those? 
 
MR. MARKS: Please give him your recollection. 
 
Q. We are talking about the one-year period before Nicole's death; 
I want you to keep that in mind. 
 
A. The one-year period. I think that was it. I think. 
 
Q. You can't recall of the many others - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I think she - 
 
MR. MARKS: She said over a seven-year period, and you asked in 
a one-year period. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: All you are required to do, Ms. Resnick, is to 
give us your best recollection as it comes to you now. 
 
THE WITNESS: All right. 
 
Q. You were - were you working in, let's say, in this one-year 
period prior to Nicole's death, were you working on a daily basis in 
Christian's office? 
 
A. I had worked on a - that's quite difficult to answer. I worked 
pretty much three, four, five times a week, depending upon how 
much I was needed. 
 
Q . And what were your duties there? 
 
A. He considered me his office manager. I was doing his billing. I 
was working with the staff. I redecorated his office. I worked on 
his IBM computer doing his - anything that was really necessary 
that he asked of me, I worked, I did for him. 
 
Q. And being more specific, in the last three months before 
Nicole's death, can you give me an estimate of how often you 
worked at Christian's office, on a weekly basis? 
 
A. That's very difficult to answer. During this time Christian and I 
were in the process of ending our relationship, so we were fighting 
constantly over issues that we had had. Although I was trying very 
much to work it out with him. So it - that would be a very hard 
question to answer, for me. 
 
Q. Was one of the issues you were fighting over your drug use? 
 
A. No, that's not one of the issues we were fighting over. 
 
Q. That was not an issue you fought over with Christian? 
 
MR. KELLY: Can you put this in a time frame? 
 
Q. Let's say in the three months prior to Nicole's death. 
 
A. Christian always assumed whenever I fought with him, that I 
was using drugs. He always blamed me, accused me; he was just 
like O.J. in that way. 
 
MR. BREWER: Can you repeat the answer? 
 
(Record read.) 
 
Q. You are saying he would wrongly accuse you of using drugs? 
 
A. Yes, he would. 
 
Q. Getting back to the second book, Shattered, did you - did you 
dictate to transcribers, as you did with the first book, Private 
Diary? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. And over what period of time did you do that, the actual 
dictation? 
 
A. Well, Shattered was - there was actually two books, the 
Shattered was originally a domestic violence book alone, which is 
what I contracted for. I started writing Shattered and dictating from 
the different research that I had done over a period of six, seven 
months. And then between - and then Jeanne, my co-writer, Jeanne 
V. Bell, and I, I went to her home in Washington, D.C. 
 
Q. And when was that? 
 
A. It was sometime late of last year. I believe it was around August 
or something like that. I didn't really keep a record of that. 
 
Q. And how long did you spend with her writing, working on the 
book? 
 
A. I spent with Jeanne, working on certain aspects of the book, six 
days, I believe. 
 
Q. Which aspects were those? 
 
A. Well there, were a lot of different - you know, we were trying to 
combine the domestic violence with watching, watching the lines 
of the trial, watching the insanity of the trial. That was the basic 
aspects, domestic violence and the insanity over the last two years. 
 
Q. And you were also relating - and ultimately in the book you did 
relate some facts relating to Nicole and O.J.'s relationship'? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. Did you utilize any materials to do that, to relate those facts in 
the book; in other words, any tapes or anything else, any other 
written materials? 
 
A. Can you be more specific, please? 
 
Q . Yes. When you were relating facts in Shattered, about Nicole 
and O.J.'s relationship when you were in the process of writing 
that, did you utilize any materials to do that, any written materials? 
 
A. I need to - I need for you to be more clear in this. I, for some 
reason, can't understand what you are saying and I would like to be 
able to answer your question properly. 
 
Q. Did you - did you look, for instance, at the drafts of the earlier 
book, Private Diary? 
 
A. No, I did not. The drafts were destroyed. 
 
Q. They were? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Do you know who destroyed them? 
 
A.Yes, I do. 
 
Q. Who did? 
 
A. The last day that the private diaries, that - the last day of it, we 
were being inundated by press and they were - we were nervous 
that they were going to steal the manuscript, so all traces of it were 
destroyed so that the press didn't - my publisher's concern was that 
they would have it in the media before the book came out. 
 
Q. And what about the - what about the tapes of the transcription; 
what happened to them? Were they destroyed as well? 
 
A. To my knowledge. I'm not quite sure. You need to talk with - 
I'm not quite sure where these tapes are. 
 
Q. When was the last time you saw them? 
 
A. On the last day, when they were destroying everything. 
 
Q. You saw the tapes when they were destroying everything? 
 
A. No. I saw the tapes on the last day, the day that they were 
destroying everything else. 
 
Q. And where were the tapes when you saw them? 
 
A. They were in a candy dish. 
 
Q. Where? 
 
A. In my publisher's house. 
 
Q. Were the other materials there that were going to be destroyed, 
were they in the same area? 
 
A. The materials were all over the - his country home. We had 
utilized the entire - the gym, we had utilized his bedroom, we had 
utilized the living room, the den, we had utilized my bedroom, we 
had utilized every single room, and it all had to be gone through 
before the press, because we were leaving. It all had to be gone 
through and my publisher insisted that every piece of information 
be protected, destroyed, whatever. That's - 
 
Q. How many drafts were there, do you remember? 
 
A No, I do not. 
 
Q. With regard to Shattered, how many drafts were there? 
 
A. There are so many writings that - I mean, I had written 
Shattered, and that was in a year period of time, a year and a half 
period of time, and there were so many drafts and redrafts and, you 
know, files, and I couldn't answer that properly, I'm sorry. 
 
Q. Do those drafts and redrafts, do they still exist? 
 
A. That would - the drafts would have to be with my - you would 
have to ask that question to my publisher and - 
 
Q. You don't know? 
 
A. No, I do not. 
 
Q. And how about the tapes of the transcription, do you know if 
they still exist, for Shattered? 
 
A. No, I do not. That's not my concern. 
 
Q . When you wrote Shattered, were you trying to make sure that 
everything in there was as accurate as possible? 
 
A. Of course. I was trying to be as accurate as possible. 
 
Q. Did you do anything in particular to make sure the facts were 
accurate in there? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I object to the question on the ground there is 
a hidden assumption that there is something special that needs to 
be done. She provided the information based on her experiences 
and her recollection and I don't know what the question is intended 
to suggest. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I wasn't trying to suggest anything. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, it suggests something, and I object on 
that basis. 
 
Q. Can you answer the question? 
 
MR. MARKS: Can you just clarify the question, a bit? 
 
Q. Did you attempt to authenticate facts in Shattered, as you did 
with The Private Diary? 
 
A. I didn't feel it necessary. I used the letters, I used some of the 
letters that I had received there in the back of the book. Those, I 
definitely used as materials. I didn't feel that Shattered was a book 
that needed authenticating. It was public knowledge what had gone 
on and we were all very aware of the insane time and I used the 
information on the domestic violence as far as the facts, the details 
of how many women and how many victims, you know, call the 
police and all of the different information I received from the 
Library of Congress. Yes, those were all used. Those were all 
something that were absolutely correct. 
 
Q. Were you careful in both of these books not to exaggerate 
anything that you had observed or heard? 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection to the form of the question, both careful 
and - what was the second - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Exaggerate. 
 
MR. KELLY: Exaggerate. If we can have clarification as to what 
he means by those words. 
 
Q. Do you understand what I mean? 
 
A. What I think you are trying to imply is that I exaggerated or had 
the intention of doing so. I did not try to exaggerate. I did not think 
that I would be a witness. I wanted to tell the story as honestly as 
possible. I did have a co-writer, so there was two different 
viewpoints in that area. 
 
Q. Okay. Did - 
 
A. Excuse me. 
 
Q. I am sorry, did you complete your question - or your answer? 
 
A. I would just like to take a break. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 11:11. We are going off the 
record. 
 
(Recess taken.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is l 1 :25. We are back on the 
record. 
 
BY MR. LEONARD: 
 
Q. Ms. Resnick, when we broke, I was asking you about whether 
you were - whether you were attempting to avoid exaggerating 
when you wrote these books. 
 
A. I believe I answered that question. 
 
Q. You said something in your answer about, there was a co-
writer? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. If you were describing a fact in the book about Nicole's 
relationship with O.J. or something that O.J. told you or something 
you observed, you had the last say about that, as far as what 
actually occurred in the book, as between you and the co-writer? Is 
that fair to say? 
 
A. That's - I did not have editing rights on Shattered at all. 
 
Q. You had no editing right on Shattered? 
 
A. I had no editing right on Shattered or The Private Diary. 
 
Q. Is there anything - okay. In the process of writing the book, did 
you and your co - in both books, did you and your co-writers 
sometimes discuss the particular events that you were describing, 
that you saw or witnessed, saw or heard? 
 
A. Yes, we did. 
 
Q. And was there ever a time that there was any disagreement 
about your description? 
 
A. Pardon me? 
 
Q. Was there any occasion where there was any disagreement 
about what you saw or what you heard, between you and your co-
writer? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Which book? 
 
MR. LEONARD: In either book. 
 
A. I would - to answer that question, they couldn't disagree; they 
weren't there. Although at first, when we were writing The Private 
Diary, as my co-writer was overwhelmed by the information, by 
the - so he asked me a lot of questions because it was an awful lot 
of information that I had disseminated to him. 
 
Q. So he would ask questions in an effort to clarify the things you 
were telling him? 
 
A. Right. 
 
Q. Including things about what you say that you heard O.J. 
Simpson tell you, right? 
 
A. I don't think there was any question about that. 
 
Q. Okay. And how about anything that you observed O.J. Simpson 
doing? Was there ever a question about that? 
 
A. Well, he continued to ask me if, exactly the nature of the 
conversations and I - that's my best answer. I am sorry, a little - it's 
a little confusing to me. 
 
Q. And were you - at the end, when you saw the final product, let's 
say, The Private Diary, were you satisfied that the descriptions of 
the events in there were accurate, what you saw and what you 
heard? 
 
A. In the end there were, as I said, 10,000 words that were edited 
out of The Private Diary, so there were some editing - and also 
Shattered - there were some editing discrepancies that I was not 
able to correct. But I believe the - I believe that it portrayed the 
situation in a very - it portrayed it as it was to - you know, with the 
fact that we only had six weeks to write it, and due to the editing 
and, you know, there was - it was the best that it could be for six 
weeks, I can say that. 
 
Q. You felt that it was accurate? 
 
A. I felt that there were some areas that I - editing areas that were 
inaccurate but I felt that it told the story fairly clearly. 
 
Q. Have you had a chance to review Exhibit 80? 
 
A. What is Exhibit 80? 
 
Q. I am sorry, it's sitting in front of you. 
 
A. I reviewed, in particular, the last question you asked me. 
 
Q. How was Exhibit 80 created, do you know? 
 
A. Yes, I do. Exhibit 80 had started when I - after The Private 
Diary came out, I said to my publisher that there were some editing 
errors and he said that there would not be the possibility of making 
big changes, due to printing and publishing standards. But that I 
could get a few points in and it would be taken care of, and it was 
created because I was trying - because I was trying very much to 
clear up anything that I could within the realm of not really 
changing anything, as that was a printing problem. 
 
Q. Did you dictate this, Exhibit 80? 
 
A. No. Exhibit 80, I believe, was from my original writings on my 
computer, and I think that it was gone over by a member of Dove 
to try to make sure that it could fit, to make the changes. 
 
Q. Is it fair to say Exhibit 80 contains the corrections that you 
thought should be made in Private Diary? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The entire book? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Yeah. 
 
A. I don't think that's fair to say, no, I don't. 
 
Q. Were there other corrections that you had identified that are not 
contained in this? 
 
A. There were a lot of corrections that I would like to - there was a 
lot of additions that I would like because due to the editing of the 
book that I was not able to do. I wanted to edit the book entirely, 
but that was not a possibility, so there were minor aspects, minor 
points that I was told that I could change. 
 
Q . Can you think of any of the other major -  
 
MR. LEONARD: Well, strike that. 
 
Q. Can you think of any of the other corrections that you would 
have wanted to make but couldn't make here? 
 
A. I would like to have edited a lot of things out of the book and 
used a lot of other things. I mean, I wanted to show Nicole as the 
person she was and I wanted to show O.J. as the person he was. 
There was a time factor and if you are saying, if I am pleased with 
The Private Diary; is that what you are asking me? 
 
Q. No. I was asking if you can recall any of the other corrections 
that aren't contained in this. If you can't, you can't. 
 
A. There's a lot of corrections that I would like to - and additions 
that I would like to have made, and to recall all of them would be 
very difficult. 
 
Q. Let me ask you this: Why did you include in The Private Diary 
the intimate scene involving you and Nicole? 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection. Relevance. 
 
MR. MARKS: I don't see what the relevance this is to anything. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I will withdraw that question. 
 
Q. Let me put it to you this way: In summary, you took whatever 
steps you could to make sure that the book was accurate, The 
Private Diary, correct? 
 
A. Pardon me? 
 
Q . You took whatever steps you felt you could to make sure that 
The Private Diary was accurate, what you were portraying in there, 
what you saw and what you heard? 
 
A. I wanted to recount to the best of my ability exactly what 
occurred. That was my intention, yes. 
 
Q. And the same with regard to Shattered? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And you were trying to avoid exaggeration? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And you were trying to avoid misstating anything? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. I want to ask you some questions about some events that you 
testified to yesterday. I will try and be as brief as possible. You 
testified yesterday that, with regard to this incident that you say 
happened at Toscana, when Alessandro came in - 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. You testified as to something that O.J. said, correct? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And you testified that O.J. said "I'm going to beat the shit out of 
him," at some point, right? 
 
A. I don't know if I used the word "shit." 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am sorry, what's the pending question? I 
fazed out for a second. Actually, Mr. Kelly whispered something to 
me. I don't want to incriminate him. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I will strike the question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Start all over again. 
 
Q. You did testify that in that conversation Mr. Simpson said 
words to the effect "I want to beat him up"? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Now, in your book, in Private Diary, you described that 
conversation, right? 
 
A Yes, I did. 
 
Q. You also said yesterday, in testifying, that Alessandro - that O.J. 
said that he had threatened Alessandro before? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. He said that in the same conversation, right? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. He said it virtually right after he said, I'm going to beat him up? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. You described the same conversation in Private Diary; isn't that 
correct? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And in Private Diary, you do not include the statement by Mr. 
Simpson you said he made that he had beaten - or that he had 
threatened Alessandro before. That's not in there, is it? 
 
A. I don't believe that I reviewed that. 
 
Q. Okay. If you could look at page - 
 
MR. MARKS: I am sure we could say that the book will speak for 
itself. I mean - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I also object to these questions because there 
is some assumption that all of the information that she testified to 
in this deposition should be included in the book. She was not 
subjected to examination in preparing her book as she was when I 
examined her. Her memory was not probed and jogged in the same 
way as when I examined her. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I appreciate that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: And I object to your attempt to somehow 
argue with her that the information should be the same in both 
places. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I am not arguing with her. I am just asking her 
questions. I understand your objection. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: In any event, I am making that objection to 
this line of questions. I am not going to repeat it, okay? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Thank you. 
 
Q. If you would look at page 107, paragraph 1, of Private Diary. 
Actually, it starts over at the bottom of page 106. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: We all have our books out. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Okay. 
 
Q. Do you see where it starts "I put my hand on O.J.'s arm"? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And said "O.J., whatever you do, please don't create a scene"? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Correct? I can't - next paragraph: "I can't help it, Faye, he said, 
barely under control, can you believe this man coming in here, 
knowing we're in here?" And that's what you are saying O.J. said, 
right? 
 
A. And then I say "I'm going to get up and beat the shit out of him. 
I'm going to." 
 
Q. And then you interrupted him and you said "No, you're not." 
That's how you describe that in the book, correct? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. This does not contain any statement about O.J. that he had 
threatened Alessandro before; is that right? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am going to object because the book speaks 
for itself. It is purely argumentative. There is nothing in this 
passage that indicates that that was the full extent of the 
conversation. She pulled out - 
 
MR. LEONARD: You can testify for the witness as much as you 
want but - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No, she pulled out certain pieces of the 
conversation that were relevant to the point she was trying to 
make. 
 
MR. LEONARD: How do you know that? How do you know that? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You are trying to pretend this is supposed to 
be her dispositive recounting of the conversation. This is a royal 
waste of time, Mr. Leonard, okay? The book speaks for itself. If it 
is not in there, it's not in there. You can make your argument to the 
jury. You are arguing with the witness right now. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I'm not arguing. 
 
Q. Is that contained in there? 
 
A. Please repeat the entire question. 
 
Q. Is there anything in the exchange as you describe on page 106 
and 107 about O.J. saying that he had threatened Alessandro 
before? 
 
MR. KELLY: Same objection. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: This is really a waste of time. 
 
MR. MARKS: You may answer the question . 
 
A. Let me explain briefly exactly the pressures that - 
 
Q. Can you answer the question for me? 
 
MR. KELLY: I object to that. We are talking about a 250-page 
book, we are talking about a two-year period. To go over any 
omission in the book, that does not make sense, okay? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It's not in there. 
 
A. It's just not in the book. 
 
Q. And why is that not in there? 
 
A. I - there's a lot of things that are not in the book. I have told you 
that over and over. 
 
Q. Do you recall why in particular you did not put this in the book, 
this statement? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Some particular recollection as to that 
statement? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Yes. 
 
Q. Do you remember why you didn't do that? 
 
A. I didn't believe that every single statement - if I was to write 
every single statement of O.J. Simpson down, that would be the 
Bible. I'm sorry. 
 
Q. Did you think that statement was important? 
 
A. I thought the most important thing was the relationship, the 
disintegration of the human being. I thought the importance of the 
book was not about every single statement that was made. I was 
trying to give an overview. 
 
Q. You testified yesterday that when you were in Cabo, you 
described some type of incident that occurred where O.J. talked 
about The Frogman, the fact that he was The Frogman. Do you 
remember that? 
 
A. Yes, I do. 
 
Q. Did you describe that in the book? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What page, Mr. Leonard? 
 
Q. Yesterday you - 
 
MR. LEONARD: 144. 
 
Q. Yesterday you testified that Nicole - 
 
A. 144? 
 
Q. Yeah, it's at page 144. Yesterday you testified that when O.J. 
made this statement about Frogman, that Nicole responded and 
said, I'm afraid. Is that right? 
 
A. I recall what I said yesterday, that she said, I don't think that's 
funny, to O.J. 
 
Q. And then she said, I'm afraid, right? 
 
A. And then she told me, I'm afraid, in a different conversation. I 
believe that was my recollection. 
 
Q. Okay. That's what you recall testifying to yesterday? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. You testified yesterday that O.J. made innumerable calls, I think 
that's what you adopted from Mr. Petrocelli's questions. 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Adopted? What does that mean? She 
answered truthfully. 
 
Q. Did you testify yesterday that O.J. made innumerable phone 
calls to you for a period from October of 1993 until April of 1994? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, beyond April. 
 
Q. Or beyond that? 
 
A. I testified that O.J. Simpson called me a lot, yes, I did. 
 
Q. Was there any period of time, let's say, from October until 
April, that those calls became less frequent? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You are - 
 
MR. KELLY: I will object to the form of the question because I 
don't think she testified in terms of numbers. I think her testimony 
was something that they seemed to be nonstop day and night, in 
terms of context, of conversation, not numbers of times. I don't 
think that's a fair question . 
 
MR. MARKS: Could you - 
 
Q. Was O.J. calling you constantly during that period? Let me put 
it to you that way. 
 
A. O.J. would call me typically when Nicole wasn't responding to 
what he wanted. That's when he would call me the most. 
 
Q. Okay. And he would call you whether he was in town or out of 
town? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Do you recall how many times, roughly, that he called you - 
when he was living in New York during that period? 
 
MR. KELLY: Can we have a time frame? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Yes. October of 1993 to April of 1994. 
 
A. I cannot recall exactly or even approximate how many times he 
called, to be quite honest with you. 
 
Q. Do you think he called you a lot? 
 
A. I'm sorry. I can only say that I wasn't keeping track of every 
single phone call that O.J. Simpson made. That would be 
impossible. 
 
Q. So you - you are unable to give us any estimate of that? I am 
talking about the period that O.J. would have been in New York, 
which was roughly the football season, during that time period. 
You can't give us any estimate? 
 
A. I can't estimate how many times he called me, no, I wasn't 
keeping track. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Between Octoberof '93 to January of  '94? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Yeah, that's a good period. 
 
A. I think it would be unrealistic to even try and recall something 
that is like that. 
 
Q. Do you have a memory that he was calling you frequently 
during that time period? Let me ask you that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: This is football season now. 
 
MR. KELLY: This is the October '93, January of '94 - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, ending with the Super Bowl in Atlanta. 
 
A. What is "frequently"? 
 
Q. Say, more than once a week. 
 
A. I really can't recall how many times. I'm sorry, really, I can't. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You don't have to be apologetic for that. Just 
try your best. 
 
Q. You testified yesterday that your best recollection was that there 
were two phone calls that O.J. made to you from Puerto Rico. Do 
you remember that? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. In The Private Diary, at page 162, you describe getting calls day 
in and day out during that time period, and that's at page 162. 
 
MR. MARKS: I am sorry, what time period are we? 
 
MR. LEONARD: When O.J. was in Puerto Rico. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, her testimony was that those two calls 
stood out in her mind, if you recall. 
 
MR. LEONARD: That was not her testimony. That was not her 
testimony. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: This is argumentative. That is exactly why 
this is improper. But what is your question? 
 
A. Where are - give me exactly where it is. 
 
Q. On page 162, at the bottom. The last paragraph, it's not a 
complete paragraph. The first sentence. Were you - let me ask you 
this question: Were you describing the time period there that O.J. 
was in Puerto Rico? 
 
A. This - this is very vague. It looks as I described that O.J. was 
calling Nicole. First of all, if you will look at the top of the page, 
during those two weeks, he was trying - pardon me. The next day 
O.J. phoned me again, started right away - 
 
MR. KELLY: If I can make a suggestion, since we seem to be 
taking up the context, if we are going to address pages, I would 
like Ms. Resnick to just take a moment to read those two pages so 
she is clear what she is talking about because- 
 
MR. LEONARD: Fine. 
 
Q. First of all, read those pages, 161 and 162, and then I have a 
couple of questions for you. Maybe you should read 163, too. 
 
A. Why did you want me to read 161? 
 
Q. I want to make sure that I get a foundation for my question. I 
want to make sure that you have been able to read this so I can ask 
you some general questions. 
 
A. I see. I see. 
 
MR. MARKS: Okay? 
 
THE WITNESS: I didn't finish this part. I am sorry. 
 
MR. MARKS: Is there a particular question you would like to ask? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Yeah. 
 
Q. You were describing, in this particular portion of the book, a 
time period when O.J. was in Puerto Rico; is that correct? 
 
A. Yes. And it goes on to - actually, at this part of the book I am 
describing right as we come back. It's mid-April 1994, and this is 
back at home, I swung into the Beverly Hills young matron 
routine, charity work, and it goes to the time where he was calling 
me - in fact, it describes two particular phone calls, which I recall, 
and from what I can see here - should you ask me the question - 
 
Q. Yes. I think I better ask you the questions. 
 
A. Okay. 
 
Q. Is it true that O.J. was phoning you day in and day out, while he 
was in Puerto Rico? 
 
A. It looks to me that this is a problem also, because if you will 
look at the very top, it says "I have been calling her every day." 
And then it says, "as O.J. phoned me day in and day out." I think 
that's a mistake on the editor's part, because my best recollection is 
I received two phone calls from O.J. and I had written about the 
content of those phone calls in this chapter. 
 
Q. So that was the editor's fault, then? 
 
A. That would be an editing problem. 
 
Q. And that's not something you suggested should be in the book? 
Is that your testimony? 
 
A. I can only say I gave the information and, you know, how it was 
arranged and we also - and we also - Brett Shaves was 24 years old 
one day and then a little later on he was 29 years old, so there were 
some editing problems, yes. 
 
Q. Do you have a memory of ever discussing this, this issue, with 
anyone? 
 
MR. MARKS: This issue being this particular line that she - 
 
MR. LEONARD: This particular line, yes. 
 
MR. KELLY: Regarding editors or anybody in the world? 
 
MR. LEONARD: No. Let's say editors, before the book was 
published. 
 
MR. MARKS: Do you recall? 
 
A. This particular incident? 
 
Q. This particular line, "as O.J. phoned me day in and day out." 
 
A. I don't know if there is - I don't recall if I did or not. I didn't 
think it was very significant. 
 
Q. But it is - it is incorrect, O.J. wasn't calling you day in and day 
out? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: From Puerto Rico? 
 
MR. LEONARD: From Puerto Rico. 
 
A. From Puerto Rico, I said he called me twice. That's the best of 
my recollection. 
 
Q. At - excuse me. When you testified yesterday you said that you 
and Nicole ran into Ron Goldman at the - at Roxbury? Is that a 
disco or something like that, a dance club? 
 
A. Yes. It's a restaurant and there's also a dance club there. 
 
Q. Did you testify - 
 
MR. LEONARD: Strike that. 
 
Q. Do you recall when that happened? 
 
A. It was between the time that we came back from Mexico and the 
time of her death. It was within the time frame, it was very brief 
that I had even known them, so it was in the latter part of her life. 
 
Q. Was it the - let me see if I can refresh your recollection. Was it 
the weekend that you describe where you are going from - that you 
are - went out to a couple of different clubs with Nicole? Do you 
remember describing that in the book? 
 
A. I described that we had gone out to a couple of different clubs, 
restaurants and clubs, I believe was my description. And that 
would have been whatever weekend that was, that would have 
been one of the nights. 
 
Q. You didn't put in the book that you guys ran into Ron Goldman, 
when you described that weekend in the book; isn't that right? 
 
A. It didn't end up in the book. That's all I can say. 
 
Q. Do you recall telling - that that was something that you told to 
the transcriber? 
 
A. I do believe I did. 
 
Q. You do. Do you have any idea why that didn't end up in the 
book? 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection. I think she testified several times she had 
no editorial control over either of these books. 
 
A. I'm sorry. 
 
Q. You testified yesterday that you were at - I think it was the 
second time that you had met Ron Goldman, you were at Starbucks 
with Nicole and Ron and a couple of his friends were there? 
 
A. Mm-hmm. 
 
Q. And O.J. came in and he said, That's my wife, and he asked to 
talk to Nicole, or he said, Come with me, something like that, to 
Nicole, and they walked outside? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. You, in the book, at - and I am talking in Private Diary, on page 
185, you describe an occasion when you were at Starbucks with 
Ron and with Nicole and with Ron's friends. Do you recall that? 
 
A. I'd like to see that. 
 
Q. Sure. It's at page 1885. 
 
MR. KELLY: You should buy this book, Faye. 
 
THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. 
 
Q. Do you see that in the second paragraph? Actually, it is the first 
full paragraph on page 185. 
 
A. Mm-hmm. 
 
MR. MARKS: Is there a particular question ? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I just wanted to be sure she had read it. 
 
Q. Is that the particular occasion - are you describing there in the 
book the particular time that you and Nicole were at Starbucks 
with Ron Goldman and O.J. came in? 
 
A. In this particular passage, I read that we had been stalked by - I 
write that we had been stalked by O.J. and how I was nervous. 
That's what, how it begins. I do believe this is where I actually met 
Ron because I pointed him out, his name was Ron Goldman, the 
first time I saw him. That was not the time that O.J. Simpson came 
and did his little routine. 
 
MR. MARKS: I just want to indicate that the witness is quoting 
parts of that page, 185. I am sorry, page - yes, 185. 
 
Q. You met Ron for the first time at Starbucks? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. There is no question about that, in your mind? 
 
A. There's no question. 
 
Q . Yesterday you testified that, I think it was the day that you 
went to stay at Kathy's house- 
 
A. Yes. Q. - and I don't recall what day it was but it was - was it, 
probably the Monday, Monday June 6th, is that when you went to 
Kathy's? 
 
A. I believe it was the 6th and the 7th. 
 
Q. You testified that Nicole discovered a key or keys and her 
remote that was missing? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. You testified that both you and Nicole went down to the 
kitchen. 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And Nicole looked in a drawer, and both the remote and the 
keys were missing. Do you remember testifying to that? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Describe the layout of that kitchen. How is that - it's downstairs. 
What does that mean? 
 
A. What do you mean, what does that mean? 
 
Q. Were there three levels to the townhouse? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Was that the first level? 
 
A. It was the first level of the townhouse, yes. 
 
Q. At the time that this happened, were you in the room with 
Nicole? 
 
A. I was - 
 
Q. At the time that she discovered, that she looked in the drawer. 
 
A. I was in the kitchen with Nicole. 
 
Q. Okay. And where was the drawer? 
 
A. The drawer was, there was a big island, the refrigerator was 
here, the sinks were here, the entry was here, and as you walked 
through the entry from the front door, the island would be here and 
her set of drawers with all of the crystal and all this over on top, 
and it was underneath, the set of drawers. 
 
Q. Did you see her open the drawer? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. And she opened a drawer, a single drawer, right? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And what did she - what happened then? Did she just say, I 
can't find the keys? 
 
A. She said that the keys were not there, that O.J. Simpson must 
have taken them when he was there last week. 
 
Q. And did she say that the remote was missing? 
 
A. Yes, she did. 
 
Q. As soon as she opened the drawer, or at least as soon as she 
looked in the drawer? 
 
A. To the best of my recollection, yes. 
 
Q. Did you - did Nicole search anywhere else for the remote? 
 
A. Yes, she did. She looked through the house. 
 
Q. Did you help her search? 
 
A. I was right around - right with her as she was looking. I didn't 
want to start going through her personal belongings, but I was 
searching with her. 
 
Q. Did anybody else help her search? 
 
A. I believe Elvie, her housekeeper, did. 
 
Q. Did five people help her in her search? 
 
A. Actually, there was. She had told the story to Cynthia Shahian. 
Cynthia had helped her look for the keys also, to my knowledge, 
from what Cynthia says. She had asked Kris Jenner, she had told 
Kris Jenner about it. There was Elvie, there was - and I am not sure 
if she talked to Cora about it, to be honest with you, and I would 
have assumed - 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection. Don't assume anything, Ms. Resnick, 
please. 
 
THE WITNESS: Thank you. 
 
Q. Do you recall writing in Shattered, at page 181 - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Shattered? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Yes. 
 
Q. If you look at the - it's actually the top of 180, it begins "she 
told." Do you see that? It's about six, seven lines down. If you 
could read those two sentences. 
 
A. It says that - 
 
MR. MARKS: You don't want her to read it out loud? 
 
Q. You can read it to yourself. 
 
A. Okay. Yes. 
 
Q. Did you mean to suggest in those two sentences, when you said 
"all of us," that five, five different friends searched for the remote, 
searched for the keys? 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection again. She had no editorial control over 
the book. She didn't write these statements herself. I think we have 
gone through this many times now. If you want to ask her a 
question directly about that incident, but she had no control over 
the words as they appeared in the book. 
 
Q. Can you answer the question? 
 
A. I - to answer the question properly, if you count the people that 
were told about this, there was Elvie, Nicole looked for her keys, 
Kris Jenner looked for her keys and Cici Shahian looked for her 
keys, if that answers your question. 
 
Q. You say that - if you go back to the bottom of page 179 if you 
look at, starting at the very last paragraph, "Wanting to give," if 
you could read that, please, over until about line 5 of the next page. 
 
MR. KELLY: Now, once again, I am going to make the same 
objection and recommendation at the same time that when we are 
addressing a particular page or sentences that the witness take a 
minute and look at the page on either side of it and get the context. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Sure. That's absolutely appropriate. 
 
Q. Have you had a chance to read that? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Now, the passage I identified, that describes a situation where 
Nicole came rushing back into the room, right? 
 
A. That's what it describes. 
 
Q. Is that the way it happened? 
 
A. I believe there is an editing problem in that. I believe that's a 
problem with editing. 
 
Q. So that's incorrect in the book? 
 
A. The - what Nicole did was Nicole opened the drawer, realized 
that the keys were not there and the remote was not there. And then 
we searched through the house. 
 
Q. So also the statement in here that - 
 
MR. KELLY: You know, Mr. Leonard, once again for the last 
time, and I will say it once again, too. This book was not written 
by her, it was not subject to cross-examination, she had no editorial 
control whatsoever over what appeared in the book. For you to ask 
her about the truth or veracity of certain lines that appear in there, 
does not make sense at this time. I think you should ask her 
questions directly regarding her recollection and not the book at 
all, because she had no control over what went in there. If you 
want to question her about incidences, I think you should question 
her about incidences, dates or times or places. 
 
Q. This passage also describes Nicole as not discovering that the 
remote was missing until after she had discovered that the keys 
were missing and she went someplace else. Is that right? 
 
MR. MARKS: Is what right? 
 
Q. That describes what this passage says? 
 
A. It looks - it looks like it's describing it that way. I think it's fairly 
insignificant and I have not had time to go through and re-edit at 
this time. I will make changes in Shattered, but it just recently 
came out and that would be one of the changes that will be made. 
 
Q. You testified yesterday about a telephone conversation you had 
with Nicole at approximately 9:00 p.m. on June 12th. 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And you said that - you described - you were asked to describe 
what Nicole said to you. Do you remember that? 
 
MR. MARKS: Is there a specific question about her that you 
would like to ask her? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I'm getting to it. 
 
Q. And you said in your testimony, when you were asked to 
describe that, that she told O.J. that she didn't want to be around 
him, or words to that effect. Do you remember that? That she didn't 
want him around. Do you remember that? This is a discussion that 
she had with O.J. at the recital. 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. In the book, when you describe that, you - and that's Private 
Diary, at page 225 - and you can take a look at that - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It starts at page 221. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Okay. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It's actually a whole chapter. It's called "The 
Last Phone Call, June 12, 1994." What is your question so maybe 
she can look for that particular passage. 
 
Q. Did you, when you described - in the book, you say that Nicole 
told you, in that conversation, that she told O.J. to fuck off. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: At the recital? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Right. 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And that's what you say in the book? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You are holding up Shattered. 
 
MR. LEONARD: That's what you say in the book, right? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You are really confusing the witness. 
 
MR. MARKS: Everyone is laughing because you held up the 
wrong book. What is your specific question? 
 
Q. Did you say that in the book? 
 
MR. MARKS: Well, the book speaks for itself. Do you want to ask 
her what the conversation was about that? 
 
Q. When you described the conversation yesterday, you didn't say 
that Nicole had told O.J. to fuck off? 
 
A. No, I did not say she had told him to fuck off. 
 
Q. Did she tell you that? 
 
A Yes, she did. 
 
Q. And yesterday you said that - 
 
A. I used different wording. 
 
Q. Yesterday you said that Nicole did not tell you where this 
conversation took place. Do you remember that? 
 
A. I remember yesterday being very confused, at times, by you. 
You were back and forth with a lot of different things and it was 
very difficult for me to focus on what the questions were that you 
were asking me. 
 
Q. Do you remember me asking you if Nicole told you where this 
conversation with O.J. took place, and your answer was no? Do 
you remember that? 
 
A. My answer was no, that I don't remember where - 
 
Q. No - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let her finish. 
 
A. The conversation, where the last phone call took place? 
 
Q. No. Do you remember me asking you yesterday - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: This is not a memory - 
 
MR. MARKS: Why don't you ask her the question you would like 
to ask or repeat the question, whatever you would like. 
 
Q. Did Nicole, in that last conversation, tell you where the 
discussion took place? 
 
MR. KELLY: Between - 
 
Q. Between O.J. and her at the recital? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: At the recital. 
 
A. She said it was at the recital. She said that her family was 
around. I mean, that was - I mean, the importance, that I felt. 
 
Q. Did she tell you that her family was with her when this 
happened? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You mean, right there listening to the 
conversation? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Yeah. 
 
A. She said that her family was around, that her family was there at 
the recital, is what she said. She had also sat with her family. 
 
Q. She didn't tell you exactly where the discussion took place, 
then, with O.J.? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You mean - 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection. Asked and answered. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I think the problem here, Mr. Leonard, is 
what you mean by "exactly where." I mean, at the recital, a 
particular place, do you want to know where at the recital? 
 
Q. Where at the recital? She didn't tell you that? 
 
A. I don't think that's what I was focusing on. 
 
MR. KELLY: Yes or no, if you could, Ms. Resnick. 
 
A. Yesterday, when I was asked that question. Nicole had told me 
what was said at the recital, and that's the important information. 
 
Q. You testified, I think, at the very beginning of today's session, 
that you recalled only one occasion where O.J. said to you that he 
would kill Nicole. Do you remember that? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. You say in Shattered, at page 4, that O.J. on several occasions - 
you say, "On several occasions, O.J. had told me hewould kill 
Nicole." That's what it says at page 4. 
 
MR. MARKS: Let's just have a moment so the witness can look at 
the reference. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Leonard, you picked up the wrong book 
again. That's why I was confused. Page 4. Where is that, Mr. 
Leonard? 
 
MR. LEONARD: It's the first full paragraph. 
 
MR. MARKS: All right. Do you have a question ? 
 
Q. Did O.J. tell you on several occasions that he would kill Nicole? 
 
A. No. I believe that that is an editing problem. I stated exactly in 
The Private Diary when he did say that he would kill her, and I 
said "several times he said," and I think this is "several occasions." 
 
Q. So that's just another editing mistake? 
 
A. Yes. I am sure it must be. 
 
Q. On page 68 - 
 
MR. KELLY: Of - 
 
MR. LEONARD: Shattered. 
 
Q. If you can look at the first full paragraph. If you could read that, 
please, to yourself. 
 
MR . PETROCELLI: What page, Mr. Leonard ? 
 
MR. LEONARD: 68. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What - 
 
MR. LEONARD: First full paragraph. 
 
A. I see it. 
 
Q. In that paragraph, you say, or the book says, excuse me, "And in 
the weeks before the murders, he called me many times saying he 
was going to kill her." And the book refers to O.J. there, right? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Is that another editing mistake? 
 
A. Absolutely. 
 
Q. Do you have any idea how that occurred? 
 
A. Oh, yes. There were five different editors on that, on Shattered, 
alone. 
 
Q. You just think that one of them chose to put that in there, is that 
what - 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: She answered your question. That's why we 
don't try cases with books, Mr. Leonard. 
 
Q. How much money did you make from Private Diary? 
 
MR. MARKS: Starting in 1994? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: How much money did she receive 
 
Q. In total, how much have you received to date? 
 
MR. MARKS: 1994. 
 
A. In 1994, I received $60,000 from Private Diary. In 1995, from 
the same source, my tax statements, tax returns, $100,000 from 
The Private Diary. 
 
Q. And the $60,000, was that - did you get an advance for Private 
Diary? 
 
A. That was partial payment of the advance. The advance was not 
given in advance. 
 
Q. So that, your testimony is that you have made a total of 
$160,000? 
 
MR. MARKS: Through the end of 1995, yes . 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Through 1995, for Private Diary. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Okay. 
 
Q. Do you have any idea how much you have made this year from 
Private Diary? 
 
A. So far, I believe, to the best of my records, $18,000 and $15,000 
from the - this is the combination of The Private Diary and 
Shattered, by the way. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: For what? 
 
MR. KELLY: Can we go back again? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: For what numbers, all these numbers? 
 
THE WITNESS: All these numbers. I know it doesn't - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, Shattered didn't exist in 1994, so that's 
just for Private Diary. 
 
Q. Did you get an advance for Shattered? 
 
A. I got a partial advance for Shattered. I was just paid the entire 
amount of the advance right before I left, actually. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Can you clear this all up, Mr. Leonard? 
 
MR. KELLY: Ask her each year, each book, what she has 
received. 
 
Q. How much did you receive for Private Diary in 1994, including 
any advances? 
 
A. My tax returns - I mean, it's a little difficult because my tax 
returns say $60,000 in '94, and they say $100,000 in '95, and part 
of that was Shattered, was part of the advance. 
 
MR. MARKS: In '95? 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. Part of that was the advance for Shattered. 
 
Q. Let me just cut to the quick. Is it fair to say to say that you have 
made a total of, to date, of $160,000 on both books, right? Plus - 
 
A. No, there is in addition - 
 
Q. Plus $18,000? 
 
A. Yeah, it's fair to say that that would be - I mean, there's things 
that I am sure are missing, but that's a fair assessment of what I 
have made. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Can I ask a question, too, here? 
 
MR. LEONARD: You can get to it. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I just want to clear this up now while it is in 
the record. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Go ahead. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Just to be sure we are all on the same page 
here. Thank you very much, Mr. Leonard. In 1994, the only book 
which was relieved and from which you received any income was 
Private Diary; is that right? 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: And the total amount of money that you 
received was $60,000, right? 
 
THE WITNESS: That's what my tax returns say, yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: And in 1995, the total amount of money that 
you received for both Private Diary and Shattered was $100,000, 
according to your tax returns, right? 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: And in 1996, what is the total amount of 
money that you have received, to date, for both books? 
 
THE WITNESS: I am the worst bookkeeper in the world. 
 
MR. KELLY: Approximately. 
 
THE WITNESS: I would think that the $18,000 and the $15,000 
figure is - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Is it 18 plus 15 for a total of $32.,000 for both 
books? 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
THE WITNESS: I mean, that's very close. 
 
MR.PETROCELLI: Okay. So if you add all these figures up, then, 
for all of your books, both of them, for the three years, the total 
amount of money that you have received is $193,000, 
approximately? 
 
THE WITNESS: Approximately, that's correct. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you, Mr. Leonard. 
 
BY MR. LEONARD: 
 
Q. Do you anticipate earning more money on these books in the 
future? 
 
MR. MARKS: How can she know that? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Shattered was just released when? 
 
THE WITNESS: Shattered was just released last week. 
 
MR. LEONARD: No further questions. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I have some redirect. 
 
MR. KELLY: Can we take a break to - 
 
MR. MARKS: No, I don't want to take a break. I want to finish this 
so everybody can go somewhere, forward. I am glad Mr. Leonard 
has asked all the questions that he wanted and you have the same 
opportunity, and let's move this forward, and let this witness, who 
has volunteered to testify for both sides, leave. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: May we go off the record for a moment? 
 
FURTHER EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:

A. Yes, I have. 
 
Q. And you have heard records reports in the media for Chris 
Darden getting over a million dollars for a book? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And Robert Shapiro getting over a million dollars for a book? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And have you also heard reports that you have received millions 
of dollars for your books? 
 
A. Countless. 
 
Q. You have heard countless reports that you have received many 
millions of dollars? 
 
A. Yes.

$193,000; is that right? 
 
A. Approximately, yes. 
 
Q. Covering a couple of years? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Now, while we are on the subject of these books, Mr. Leonard 
was asking you a lot of questions about information that is not in 
the books. Do you recall his line of questioning? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Now, why don't you tell us, set the record straight on this. What 
was the purpose of your writing a Private Diary? 
 
A. My friend was killed brutally, slaughtered, and her friend. I was 
very nervous for my life because I had been told of this before it 
happened, by O.J. I was nervous that I had too much information 
against him and I thought he would kill me for that information, 
which I had told at Exodus all of the counselors this. I was told that 
I would not be able to testify because I had been in treatment. 
These murders were being blamed on me. And I didn't know how 
to cope. I did not know how to cope with all of the circumstances. 
It was too much. I wanted the information to get out to the public 
just in case anything happened to me. I wanted other women to 
know what had happened to Nicole, and I was afraid that I would 
not be able to make it on the stand and get that message out. 
 
Q. Ms. Resnick, whose story were you trying to tell in the book? 
 
A. Nicole's story. 
 
Q. Were you - was it your intention, in writing Private Diary to 
marshal all of the evidence that existed against O.J. Simpson? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
Q. Was that your intention? 
 
A. No, that was not my intention. 
 
Q. Was it your - did you attempt, in writing Private Diary, to 
recount every single conversation you ever had with O.J. Simpson? 
 
A. No, I did not. 
 
Q. Did you attempt, in writing private diaries - Private Diary, 
excuse me - to recount every single act of O.J. Simpson that you 
ever observed? 
 
A. No, I did not. 
 
Q. Was it your intention, in writing Private Diary, to mount and 
make a case against O.J. Simpson? Was that your intent? 
 
A. No, it was not. 
 
Q. Did you work with a criminal lawyer in writing Private Diary? 
 
A. No, I did not. 
 
Q. Did you work with a lawyer in order to determine what facts 
would be probative to prove Mr. Simpson's guilt? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection to the form. 
 
A. No, of course not. 
 
Q. Did you read any legal materials on the elements of first degree 
murder, in writing your book? 
 
A. Of course not. 
 
Q. Were you trying to come up with facts that would make a case 
against O.J. Simpson? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. You saw the criminal trial, you said, in response to Mr. 
Leonard's question, while you were writing Shattered? 
 
A. Much of it. 
 
Q. Is it your belief that Nicole's story was told in that trial? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
A. No, it was not. 
 
Q. When you watched that trial, did you see all of the incidents of 
domestic violence between O.J. Simpson and Nicole that you had 
learned about from the call? 
 
A. No, I did not. 
 
Q. The manuscripts that you initially participated in writing 
contained more or less information than appears in the book? 
 
A. Much more information. 
 
Q. Significantly more information? 
 
A. 10,000 words. 
 
Q. Excuse me? 
 
A. 10,000 words. 
 
Q. So there's 10,000 words of information that originally you 
participated in creating that are not in your book? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And you have said you did not have any control over editing or 
the final print of the book; is that right? 
 
A. I did not have any control. That was my biggest nightmare. 
 
Q. Is that part of the contract that you had with the publisher? 
 
A. Yes, it is. 
 
Q. And in the contract for both Shattered and private diaries, there 
were - in both - 
 
MR.PETROCELLI: Withdrawn. 
 
Q. In respect of both books, Private Diary and Shattered, according 
to the contract with your publisher, you did not have any control 
over the final product? Is that what you're saying? 
 
A. I'm saying I did not have any control over any editing rights. 
 
Q. Any editing rights? 
 
A. I did not have any editing rights at all- 
 
Q. In both of the books? 
 
A. - in either of the books. 
 
Q. Let me ask you a question about these phone calls in the 
football season, '93 to '94 terminating in the January Super Bowl, 
okay? Was that a period of time that O.J. Simpson and Nicole were 
involved in their reconciliation? 
 
A. They were getting - yes. 
 
Q. And to your knowledge, your recollection, is that generally one 
of the better periods of time in their year-long attempted 
reconciliation? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
Q. Was it? 
 
A. During that time they were, they were happy with each other. 
 
Q. And is it the case you heard less frequently from O.J. Simpson 
when things were going good with Nicole? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 
 
A. Yes. 
 
MR. MARKS: May we conclude this? Do you have much more? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am looking. 
 
Q. Christian Reichardt - excuse me, you broke off the relationship 
with Christian Reichardt? 
 
A. Yes, I did. 
 
Q. Was he happy or unhappy about that? 
 
A. Extremely unhappy. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I have - 
 
MR. KELLY: Well, if you have something- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Hold on. 
 
Q. Were there times when you observed O.J. Simpson when he 
was acting - when he had a good and positive relationshipwith 
Nicole? 
 
A. Yes, there were. 
 
Q. And how did O.J. Simpson behave towards Nicole when you 
observed things were going well between them? 
 
A. O.J. could be one of the most charming men I have ever met. He 
was at times fun-loving and gentle. That's the O.J. that I first met 
and that I became friends with. 

Q. Did you ever see him act playfully? 
 
A. At times, yeah. Yeah. 
 
Q. Like a little boy, almost? 
 
A. Sometimes. 
 
Q. And give a lot of attention to Nicole? 
 
A. Oh, yes. Sometimes he was very attentive. 
 
Q. He could be a lot of fun? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
Q. Could he? 
 
A. Yes, yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Why don't we stop for a tape break. I will see 
if I have anything more by consulting with my colleagues, okay? 
 
MR. MARKS: Yes. I would like to conclude this as soon as we 
can. Everybody has had their questions, so - 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 12:32. This will be the end - 
 
MR. MARKS: Let's put in the new video and see if we can get this 
concluded. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 12:32 and this is the end of 
tape number 6 of the deposition. 
 
(Recess taken.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 12:50, and we are back on 
tape number 6. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I have no further questions, Ms. Resnick, and 
other counsel have indicated they also have no further questions. 
We would all like to thank you very much for making yourself 
available to testify. In terms of a stipulation, we have agreed off the

<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>Harvard law professor Arthur Miller hosts a panel discussion about the issues raised by the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal. Miller and his guests address police misconduct, what it takes for a defendant to get a new trial, the death penalty, and other issues. This Court TV special was first broadcast on July 11, 1996.</P>
<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> Sometime later this year, or early next, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court will decide whether Mumia Abu-Jamal will receive a new trial. We can be certain that if Pennsylvania denies his appeal, he will take his case to the federal courts. With me tonight to discuss the larger issues that arise from this case are Ira Glasser, Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union. Mr. Glasser writes extensively on the subject of civil liberties. Vernon Geberth, Homicide and Forensic Consultant, former Lieutenant Commander of the New York City Police Department with over 30 years of law enforcement experience. Jeanine Pirro, District Attorney of Westchester County in New York. Formerly a Westchester County Court Judge. Stuart Taylor, senior writer for Legal Times and The American Lawyer. Stuart is the author of an article about this case entitled "Guilty and Framed." He's also a supporter of Abu-Jamal's efforts to receive a new trial. And Cornel West, author and professor of Afro-American Studies and Philosophy of Religion at Harvard University. Professor West also supports Abu-Jamal's appeal for a new trial. Welcome to you all. Vernon, your reaction to the documentary.</P>

<P><B>Vernon Geberth:</B> My reaction was that I outraged by the documentary. I found it to be prejudicial, biased, towards Abu-Jamal's case. I felt that the real issue, the death of a young police officer on the streets of Philadelphia was entirely forgotten in a hype that seemed almost surreal as he described being kicked and the lights flashing around. Very, very well done, obviously produced by and supported by folks who were in Abu-Jamal's corner. As a police officer, I have had the unpleasant experience of having to investigate too many homicides of police officers.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> And Cornel? Your view?</P>

<P><B>Cornel West:</B> Well, first I want to agree with Vernon that the death of a fellow citizen, in this case Daniel Faulkner, is quite tragic. There's no doubt about that. Whoever did it deserves punishment. But I do think that the documentary made it fairly clear that the law, which ought to be a force of fairness in a democratic society, has not been in this case. And therefore, here's someone who's actually on death row for 13 years, if we can show that there's a reasonable doubt that someone else may have done it than just as citizens, we've got to insure that fairness is put forward.</P>

<P><B>Vernon Geberth:</B> I would certainly support fairness. As a homicide cop, I have the responsibility, the awesome responsibility of being fair and not bringing to the table a personal agenda. I can't afford to have a personal agenda. Especially in this day and age.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> Now Stuart, you've written about this. And then you see the documentary. Fair or foul?</P>

<P><B>Stuart Taylor:</B> I think it's basically fair. There are portions of it I disagree with. Most fundamentally, I think the tone of the documentary suggests there's more doubt as to whether Abu-Jamal actually shot this police officer than I think there is. I think this is something in which reasonable people can disagree and I thought that the documentary through Joseph McGill, the trial prosecutor, allowed that point of view to be presented fairly. At the same time, it's clear that the people who made the documentary had a point of view. They thought he didn't have a fair trial, they thought there was some doubt as to his guilt, and the documentary was prepared with that in mind and therefore was not as balanced as somebody looking for objective journalism ...</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> Point of view journalism.</P>

<P><B>Stuart Taylor:</B> Yes.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> Something you're not supposed to be into.</P>

<P><B>Stuart Taylor:</B> Well, you're not supposed to be into it if you're writing front page stories in the New York Times. But if you're producing a documentary, that's different.</P>

<P><B>Jeanine Pirro:</B> I couldn't agree with you more, Stuart. When you say that reasonable people can disagree about some of the facts of this case, as related by the documentary. Clearly, there was a bias in the documentary. But I think that the interesting part is that there was a slant on the part of this defendant or appellant, and there were issues that can be easily resolved that were not even discussed in an objective way. But, you know, having said that, I think the important issue here is that we have a police officer who was killed in the line of duty, we also have a defendant who has been on death row for 14 years, which is an indication that there are some problems, in the process.</P>

<P><B>Cornel West:</B> I think we have to distinguish between bias and a counter-balance. The courts in Philadelphia, they've already made their decisions. He's on death row. The documentary comes along and says maybe in fact there was not fairness in this case. It is a counter-balance to what is already in place in light of decisions that have been made.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> Abu-Jamal's case has become a national cause celebre. Now Cornel, you got involved in this early. Why? What attracts you to this case?</P>

<P><B>Cornel West:</B> Well, one, fundamentally, I claim to be committed to fairness and I believe I am. And it's a question of fairness. It would be the case for an ordinary white, brown, red or yellow brother or sister who I thought was treated unfairly by the courts.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> But why this one? There are 3,000 people on death row in this country.</P>

<P><B>Cornel West:</B> Well, I must say, if I was called on a number of cases, given whatever time I had, I would contribute to ... contribute the way in which I could that ensured that there's fairness. Now when I was called about this case and was told about it, I responded. And I like to respond to cases across the board in this regard, because it's not just a matter of Abu-Jamal, it's a matter of the criminal justice system in general in this country.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> Why were you called on this case as opposed to other cases?</P>

<P><B>Cornel West:</B> My hunch ... I was called from some people in New York who were putting together a gathering. And I said, "Well what are the facts? What's the background? What's going on here?" Because I know people of whatever color have the capacity to be right or wrong, like anybody else.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> Now Jeanine, what happens if you're on the prosecutorial side of a case that gets captured by the media?</P>

<P><B>Jeanine Pirro:</B> Well, then, there are a lot of other issues, because what happens when the case becomes a cause celebre is that people start to sign on to a case based upon their own predispositions, based upon where they're coming from, their frame of reference, their assessment of the criminal justice system. And sometimes the facts get lost in the mixture here. And we've seen it before with other cause celebres.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> Now, Ira, you've done your share of this.</P>

<P><B>Ira Glasser:</B> The celebrated cases always have, at their root, factual disputes which even if you were in the courtroom and listened to every word of testimony, you wouldn't be 100 percent sure of what the facts were. That's why juries sometimes have a hard time deciding. But here you are, you're a member of the public and you're getting this filtered through all kinds of advocacy journalism and little snippets on the news and so what you do bring to it are your own perceptions. In the O.J. Simpson trial, for example, a key factual question was whether cops planted evidence and then lied about it. Now, if you were black and lived in the inner city, you likely have had a lot of experience with knowing about cases in which cops planted evidence and lied about it. If you were white, middle-class, and lived in the suburb, that would be almost unthinkable to you. So you would form an impression on that facts in that case based on your experience in other cases.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> But two things bother me. Number one, does this distort the process? Number two, how do we pick this case as opposed to 2999 other cases of people who may not be as articulate, may not be as connected as this man was ... is that in any sense fair?</P>

<P><B>Stuart Taylor:</B> I think it clearly can distort the process. I don't think it's distorted the process in this case, the criminal process. It also more clearly distorts perceptions when we fixate on this case or on the O.J. Simpson case. However, compared to what? I mean, I think it's better that we pay a lot of attention to this case than if we pay attention to no cases. Because this case, whatever side you're on, illustrates very important problems in the criminal justice system. A police officer was murdered almost 15 years ago and we're still arguing about whether the man who's been on death row most of that time is the one who did it or is not.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> You sound like a clinical scientist, as if you were examining something in a test tube.</P>

<P><B>Vernon Geberth:</B> I tell you, from my perspective as a law enforcement and a homicide cop, ... and I don't know anything about the real facts of this case, but just from what I've read before going on this program, this is what we could call in police work, a ground ball homicide. The guy's at the scene, shot by the cop, his gun's there, the ammunition matches. Hey? What's the mystery? This is the guy. Okay?</P>

<P><B>Ira Glasser:</B> Yeah, but what you don't know is who initiated it, what happened, what the circumstances were.</P>

<P><B>Jeanine Pirro:</B> Okay, but in addition to that, what you have is a jury that unanimously found him guilty. He was given the death penalty, a conviction that was affirmed unanimously and all kinds of issues throughout the criminal justice system. And the distortion issue is about the public. Well, it doesn't much matter what we say. The most important thing is that the system work. And that the rules are followed. And so I think that ...</P>

<P><B>Stuart Taylor:</B> ... well, if we're going to follow rules, what about the evidence in this case, not to get too deep into it, that the police fabricated a confession out of whole cloth. I shot him and I hope he dies. Made up.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> We're joined now by Judge Carolyn Engle Temin of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. Judge Temin is the Chief Criminal Calendar Judge administering the homicide and major trial divisions for the court. Now, as is clear, from the discussion we had going into the last break, one of the most emotional aspects of this case is the allegations of police misconduct. Just as you pointed out before, there were allegations in the O.J. Simpson case of police misconduct. Now, we don't know what the truth is, as we sit here today, we have to keep referring to these as allegations. What I'm interested in and perhaps you can shed some light on this, Judge, is this a common phenomenon of these allegations of police misconduct in ... in the criminal justice system? Is this now sort of the defense of the day?</P>

<P><B>Judge Temin:</B> Well, I think that there's a lot of that going on. I think there are a lot of cases where that's part of the defense and there's a reason for it, and that's because we have evidence that it happens. Right now in Philadelphia, if you read the paper, they're covering a case where in a whole police division, evidence was planted and over 200 cases have already been thrown out by the District Attorney of Philadelphia because of this. Police misconduct is very hard to detect. Usually it requires a grand jury, it requires subpoena power and the authority to give immunity and so in an individual case, it would be difficult for the defense to actually establish police misconduct. But we know that it does happen. We hope it's not common. But whether it's a phenomenon in defense of criminal cases, particularly homicide? Yes, I think you can say that it is.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> In the abstract, you're sitting there with your black robe on and you hear the allegations and you listen to witnesses. Do you have an instinct for these things? Are there signs of the misconduct? When do you believe it, when do you disbelieve it?</P>

<P><B>Judge Temin:</B> We have to judge allegations of police misconduct as a fact finder and I assume you're asking me as a fact finder, well did the jury ... in cases of this nature, usually, the jury is the fact finder. They're rarely tried to a judge alone. But sitting as a fact finder, we use the same standards that we would use to judge anybody else's credibility in deciding the credibility of witnesses who are testifying about police misconduct.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> You make prosecutorial decisions based, in large measure, on what the police say to you. Do you have antennae? Do you have red flag signals?</P>

<P><B>Jeanine Pirro:</B> We have to. We're living in the time when it's simply too important to not suspect that that is a possibility. And what we do as prosecutors, or as judges, is to try to assess whether or not a person appears to be credible, whether what they're saying makes sense, whether it agrees or disagrees with other people who are supposedly at the same place at the same time. But you're correct. It's all about antennas and judgment calls. And with respect to this being almost a mantra now, by defense attorneys in criminal cases, Mark Fuhrman has created the basis and that seed of doubt in jurors' minds so that, you know, a defense attorney would be crazy not to play to that issue.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> Now Vernon, this is more than 30 years of your life that we've just put on the table.</P>

<P><B>Vernon Geberth:</B> That's correct. And there is, in fact, police misconduct. And hopefully, it's found out by the police themselves and not exposed, so to speak, because of some police error, okay, and if he becomes part of the ... the case itself. My perception, okay, of this is that we're people, just like everyone else, and sometimes they don't think that cops are people, we're people. We bleed, we cry, we do everything else. We suffer from the same things as the larger society. But you mentioned Mark Fuhrman. To this day I think Mark Fuhrman probably is a racist, but more importantly, I think Mark Fuhrman on those tapes was playing up to that reporter to try to make himself look like someone important who would get a big movie role.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> You think it's as innocent as that?</P>

<P><B>Vernon Geberth:</B> Well I think that he certainly has some racist tendencies, but I think that his talk on that tape was to make himself look like some sort of a super cop.</P>

<P><B>Jeanine Pirro:</B> You know, Vernon, look, he's a liar, he's a bigot, he's a perjurer, he's a racist. He's all those things. But unfortunately, people are drawing the conclusion that other police officers are as well.</P>

<P><B>Vernon Geberth:</B> Well, I know, because I ...</P>

<P><B>Jeanine Pirro:</B> And that's the important issue. I mean, the issue here is that police officers get out on the street every day of the week and they put their lives on the line for innocent victims. And prosecutors are, Arthur, prosecuting these cases just as I am in Westchester County, we're putting these cases in the grand jury because it does not behoove us to have police officers on a force who are going to ruin cases, who are going to cause suppression of evidence.</P>

<P><B>Ira Glasser:</B> The problem is that some terrible crimes are committed against police and also it's true that police commit terrible crimes. And the task, always, is to sort out the facts in a particular case, which is not always so easy. When I grew up in the '50s in New York City, the notion that a cop would beat you up for no reason was as foreign to me as it could be. Cops were people who helped you cross the street when you went to school. When I first heard the ... in the '60s, allegations that cops were and that the FBI was planting evidence and framing and ... and looking to kill members of the Black Panther Party, I thought it was paranoid craziness. Then there was the case of Fred Hampton and so many other cases where it turned out cops did exactly that. So what happens is that when the charge is make, it behooves everybody to take it seriously because we know it happens. On the other hand, it doesn't happen in every instance. So you're still faced, at the end of the day, with the belief that this is possible and you may not, in good conscious, and with any integrity, dismiss the charge of any defendant that the cop did this, you can't just dismiss it, but you still have to take a look at the particular case and try to evaluate the facts in the fairest way possible. That's the task of the jury. It cannot be the task of the public reading newspaper articles.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> What is the effect in the black community of these high profile cases in which these allegations are made, again, no proof. Allegations?</P>

<P><B>Cornel West:</B> Well, one is, we don't really need celebrity cases for most black people to acknowledge the level of police misconduct. And it's not a matter of demonizing police. There's misconduct of lawyers, pharmacists, doctors, professors, right across the board. There's a history of differential treatment in black communities, vis-a-vis, other communities. It's partly a matter of class, poor communities versus well-to-do communities and race. There's no doubt about that. And to be an American means you've got to struggle with racism and that's true for policemen, it's true for politicians, it's true for professors, right across the board. So that the sense of ... of the police themselves assuming that they're friendly, given that history, is going to be a difficult one. Even given the tremendous and courageous efforts of some police.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> Stuart, be a philosopher for me. What do we do? In many instances, and I think Vernon would take this position, the objective of a police officer engaging in ... sort of fabricating evidence is he knows he's got his man, he just wants to sort of embellish the case. He's testalying. What do we do? Should the system throw the prosecution out? Should we punish the cop? How do we solve this?</P>

<P><B>Stuart Taylor:</B> It's a very hard. Surely, we should punish the cop if he's caught. Because even though he's doing it for an honorable reason, he wants to convict this guilty person, it's against the rules. You don't make up evidence, you don't ... you don't fool with the facts. You don't perjure yourself. And I think we need judges and jurors and prosecutors to be vigilant, we need police to punish their own, but we also need to recognize that there's a special problem here in police misconduct which is, a lot of the police, correct me if I'm wrong, Vernon, think that the courts have rigged the game to make it too hard for them to win. You can't search unless you have a warrant or probable cause. There are a lot of things they think they ought to be able to do to fight crime that the courts won't allow them to do. This creates a temptation to fudge a little bit about what happened to sort of say, "Oh, I saw him drop the gun before I arrested him," rather to admit that you just assumed he had one.</P>

<P><B>Ira Glasser:</B> Yes, but the problem always is, is that very often, what we don't know is how often a cop will decide this guy is a bad guy. He may not have committed this crime, but he's committed other crimes and I'm going to plant the gun now to get him now because in the larger sense, I'm doing justice, even though I'm making this case up. That's happened.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> Judge, what does it take to throw a case out these days?</P>

<P><B>Judge Temin:</B> Well, depending on what ground. You mean on the ground that you believe that there's police misconduct?</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> Yes.</P>

<P><B>Judge Temin:</B> Well, there may be police misconduct that doesn't infringe on the guilt of the party and the proof beyond a reasonable doubt. For instance, there are cases where some evidence is still suppressed, but there's still enough evidence left for the prosecution to try the case successfully. So even though there's been police misconduct at some point in the case, there's still enough other credible evidence that's admissible under the constitutional requirement that allows the prosecution to continue. But it takes for a policeman to be disbelieved, I think ... you know, we ... we tell the jurors, we ask them whether they will consider the testimony of a law enforcement officer by the same standards that they use to consider anybody else's testimony and you have to say yes to that question in order to get on the jury. But I think most people believe that policemen tell the truth.</P>

<P><B>Jeanine Pirro:</B> I disagree. When I was a judge, I would ask the potential jurors whether or not they felt that simply because a person wore a uniform that that person was necessarily more credible or more believable than anyone else. Now we're at a different time where the question is almost the opposite. Because they are wearing a uniform, do you promise you won't automatically think that they are less credible?</P>

<P><B>Judge Temin:</B> ... but I think that, as a general rule, that if people were not trying to get on the jury or trying to give you the answer that you expect, that most people, especially from middle class backgrounds, like to believe that policemen are especially professionally trained to do things, they're professionally trained to observe, and that they have no interest in the outcome of the case. And we know that that's not always true.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> Let's talk about the resources available or not available to a defense team. You've got court-appointed counsel, you've got privately retained counsel. Ira, people would say, look, the state has the police, it's got Jeanine and all of the little Jeanines out there. How can court-appointed public defender defense possibly match that?</P>

<P><B>Ira Glasser:</B> Well, public defenders and legal aid lawyers are more than competent and experienced as a rule. The problem is that they are also on overload. They have a caseload, normally, because of budget limitations, that no private lawyer would dream of having and that in effect preclude very often, given a case, the kind of attention that it deserves. The kind of defense power that we all saw in the O.J. Simpson is the exact opposite of what the average poor defendant faces. If, in the O.J. Simpson case, a person accused of killing his wife and another person had been a gas station attendant, he would have been on death row in 16 minutes.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> Oh, there's the cynicism. Well ...</P>

<P><B>Ira Glasser:</B> 98 percent of people convicted of homicide are not sentenced to death. When you look at the two percent who are, this whole debate about the death penalty is that two percent of people convicted of homicide, sentenced to death, and they're almost invariably are poor and without resources and without private investigators and without money and with lawyers who don't know how to try a capital case or with people who do know how to try a capital case but have 90 of them and can't give any of them their attention. There is no question about the fact that the quality of defense for the average defendant has a real relationship to the outcome.</P>

<P><B>Jeanine Pirro:</B> Okay, now I have to disagree with that. In my experience, I have seen many public defenders, many legal aid attorneys who were far savvier because they spend every day in criminal court than a retained attorney. In addition to that, just as a public defender is overburdened, prosecutors are overburdened. My budget and and our resources are not unlimited. In fact, we're trying and prosecuting more cases than we have in the history of the county with fewer attorneys than we had six years ago. So, you know, we're all, both on the public defender's side and the prosecution side, suffering from the unavailability of all the resources that we could need. And I think that it's a myth to say that because you can hire an attorney that they're probably better.</P>

<P><B>Stuart Taylor:</B> Who do the police work with? The police are the investigative resources. They work for the prosecutors' office. They don't work for the defense lawyers.</P>

<P><B>Jeanine Pirro:</B> But Stuart, every day of the week you'll have police coming in and saying that there isn't enough evidence in this case, that this person can't be arrested. You're assuming that every time a police officer looks at a case he's looking to arrest this individual. That's not true. Every day of the week there are people who are not arrested because police have cleared them.</P>

<P><B>Ira Glasser:</B> That may be, but if that were true ... why ... if O.J. or anybody else in the position to do so had their choice, they wouldn't go to legal aid. And it's not because legal aid lawyers aren't good, it's because you can't do 90 cases without investigatory resources and do justice to those cases. No one in the position to choose would choose that.</P>

<P><B>Judge Temin:</B> I have to agree with Jeanine. At least from what I've seen in the big cities that have big public defender offices such as Philadelphia, the defender office is almost as big as the District Attorney's office and staffed by equally competent attorneys who are equally overburdened, and they have resources. They have psychiatrists they can hire. They have other resources. What I see though, is the private bar, whether court appointed or retained, and generally it's the same pool, there's a very small pool of lawyers, for instance, in Philadelphia, who try capital cases and they're court appointed sometimes and sometimes they're privately retained. But as a rule, defendants don't have the resources. Even people who can afford lawyers don't have the resources sometimes to pay all the experts you need to successfully defend a capital case, particularly in the mitigation phase. Your case may never go to the penalty phase. It may come out something less than first degree. But if you're charged with a capital offense, you have to prepare for that penalty phase from the very beginning of the case.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> Now, Vernon, when you were on active duty, were you overworked?</P>

<P><B>Vernon Geberth:</B> Absolutely. I'm sitting here listening about all these resources we had. I didn't have enough detectives to cover the chart. You're telling me the awesome amount of people we had. It was completely ridiculous. 400 homicides a year in the county of the Bronx when I left. All right? Impossible to handle. The District Attorney then would have the need for these detectives for trial prep, so I lose these people off the chart. So ... I ...</P>

<P><B>Ira Glasser:</B> ... Yeah, but I never said anything about your resources or suggested that they were adequate. What I'm saying is that in the average capital case, the legal counsel and the expert witnesses, and the investigatory resources that are available to the average capital defendant are horrendous and are the things that result in death sentences where people ... you will never find anybody wealthy sentenced to death.</P>

<P><B>Jeanine Pirro:</B> But a couple ...</P>

<P><B>Ira Glasser:</B> ... tell me why.</P>

<P><B>Jeanine Pirro :</B> A couple of things. Number one, any judge in that capital case can approve additional spending for the expert witnesses, investigative witnesses, in a capital case. In addition to that, in New York State, when we just passed the death penalty statute, there was more money for the capital defender than there was for even prosecution in these cases ...</P>

<P><B>Ira Glasser:</B> If that were true, you wouldn't have death penalty resource centers in every state in the south where most of the death penalty cases are.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> See, Ira makes a good point. There is life outside of New York. There are problems around this ... Stuart, what do you see out there?</P>

<P><B>Stuart Taylor:</B> I think the further south you get, the worse the defense lawyer typically is in these cases, and New York City, New Jersey, Philadelphia probably are better than most places. What the ... defendants who are the worst off are the ones who get some guy who's maybe a year out of law school trying to learn how to do wills and estates and the local judge says, "Hey, you're defending a death penalty case next week. And we're paying you $500." That happens. It happens a lot. And it doesn't always serve the interest of the prosecution. Because if you look at these cases where people have been sitting on death row for 15 years and they're still appealing, almost always, if you go back and look at the trial, you have a lawyer who did a lousy job and that's why this case is still kicking around.</P>

<P><B>Ira Glasser:</B> That's what the fight about habeas is.</P>

<P><B>Cornel West:</B> Yeah, but I think for me, a much deeper issue, which is not the role of the defense and prosecutor, but the role of the criminal justice system in general in our society. We live in a society in which there's increasing disorder, increasing fear, increasing anxiety. And those who already find themselves on the way through the criminal justice system have already been up against a set of circumstances such that it makes it very difficult for us to talk seriously about the justice meted out. Why so? Because it looks as if our society prefers to put the burden on the police to deal with some of these effects of social problems, rather than talk seriously about justice at the work place and education, high quality communities, and so forth. So that even before we move into this dialogue, I think it's important to note on the one hand how the police themselves are overburdened because there's so little attention to the deeper sources of our social problems and then the fact that we're going to find racists among the police, just like we're going to find racists among any other sector of our society and they become then scapegoated and still find some of them abusing, especially young black men. Because you've got the negative stereotypes. Black men are criminals and so forth. And I think before we can even engage in defense versus prosecution, if we can't deal with these larger issues, then increasing disorder and fear are going to lead toward ...</P>

<P><B>Vernon Geberth:</B> I would tend to agree with everything you said except statistically, the black male is disproportionately represented in the crime statistics. And when we hear about the death of young black males by, not white males, by other black males, right? We're talking about a very violent society. So what you're saying is true. But statistically, the perception is not that far off.</P>

<P><B>Cornel West:</B> But see, but it makes sense though, Vernon. Why? Because the levels of joblessness among black males exponentially increased in the last 25 years. The level of black men staying in school, junior high, and high school. This is true for any group of human beings who are jobless and don't have access ...</P>

<P><B>Ira Glasser:</B> Let's not forget the drug prohibition laws which are almost singly most responsible for the differential in sentencing for the higher rates of crime for the explosion of imprisonment, for the disproportionate ...</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> You're all painting a rather terrible picture. You extend your paintbrush to society in general. But for the professionals, the law professionals here, this is an indictment beyond indictment.</P>

<P><B>Ira Glasser:</B> Yeah, but Cornel makes a very important point that we have over-defined these problems as criminal justice problems. That's certainly true for drug issues. But it's true for most of these issues. And the whole criminal justice system is caught up in a reflection which is a political diversion from the real issues. Politicians make their living getting elected by diverting the public's interest from the real problems into a simpler way of dealing with it. Let's beef up the criminal justice system, let's build prisons instead of schools. Let's deal with those problems because we know how to deal with those problems. If everything becomes a criminal justice system, the cops will be victims, the people will be victims, and we'll all be victims. You can't deal with these problems as if they were criminal justice issues.</P>

<P><B>Jeanine Pirro:</B> But the reality is that we are living in a society that is more violent than it has ever been. And I couldn't agree with Cornel more. We have got to get to the root causes of poverty, the root causes of why people are not staying in school, and what the problems are, dealing with prevention as opposed to reaction. But in the meantime, what we've got is a violent, violent society and we've got to do something about it.</P>

<P><B>Ira Glasser:</B> And most of that violence is because people are settling commercial disputes with automatic weapons on the streets. Al Capone didn't shoot people because he was drunk or because he was poor.</P>

<P><B>Jeanine Pirro:</B> And ... and so you don't disagree...</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> In the Abu-Jamal case, the system is trying to decide whether to give him a new trial. Now one of the things that many people have commented to me about, they simply don't understand, Judge, is how can you have the same judge who sat on the original trial, decide whether that was fair or unfair for purposes of deciding whether to give him a new trial?</P>

<P><B>Judge Temin:</B> That's the way it's currently done. That's the traditional way and it is our procedure in Philadelphia County that if the judge is still sitting on the bench when the collateral attack is made, and perhaps we should explain that there are two kinds of appeal, one is the direct appeal from the trial, where you have the trial and then you appeal, in our case, to the intermediate appellate court and then eventually, if the supreme court accepts your case, to the supreme court of Pennsylvania, and then you can go to the supreme court of the United States. After you finish that, you can come back and do what's called a collateral attack on your appeal, which is where the Jamal case is now, on collateral attack. And you start once again at the trial level. And traditionally, the same judge who sat on the trial hears the collateral attack, hears additional evidence and additional arguments, and reassesses the case and decides whether the original proceedings were fair.</P>

<P><B>Jeanine Pirro:</B> And that collateral attack is based upon information ...</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> Yes, explain collateral attack.</P>

<P><B>Jeanine Pirro:</B> The collateral attack is based upon evidence that was not part of the original record which is why it can go back to the original judge. Then the original judge makes the assessment as to whether or not there should be a new trial because of the information that he or she didn't know.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> And that sounds good in theory, if the basis for the attack is, we've got new stuff. But what if the basis of the attack is your conduct in hearing the case? To give that back to the same judge bothers some people.</P>

<P><B>Judge Temin:</B> That is a practice that judges how we routinely re-examine our own rulings. And we routinely hear new arguments about why we ... what we did was wrong. And we welcome, most of us, the opportunity to re-examine that because we're human and we make errors.</P>

<P><B>Cornel West:</B> ... cases in which the judges have decided that a particular judge has been thoroughly unfair?</P>

<P><B>Judge Temin:</B> Sure. On appeal. On the direct appeal.</P>

<P><B>Cornel West:</B> On appeal. So appeal is the next level of accountability.</P>

<P><B>Judge Temin:</B> A judge may re-examine his or her own ruling and decide that it was in error.</P>

<P><B>Cornel West:</B> But that's still self-regulation. What about mechanisms of accountability for charging that the judge is unfair.</P>

<P><B>Ira Glasser:</B> This federal habeas. And that's particularly useful ... years ago, during civil rights movements in the south where southern judges regularly convicted black defendants in outrageously and explicitly brutal racial ways, the only remedy was not to appeal to those judges or even to their appellate courts in the state court system. It was to get out of the system entirely, go into federal court, and on what's called a habeas petition, and basically say this trial was unconstitutional because of certain things that happened. And ask the federal court to order a new trial.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> All right. Let's review the bidding. Because there may be some heads swimming out there. You're convicted, you take an appeal up to the highest court, maybe you try to get to the U.S. Supreme Court. It doesn't work. Then you try a collateral attack, right? You come back in to the original court, knock on the door and say, "Hey, something was rotten here." That doesn't work. Presumably, you appeal that up. Then, in the old "three strikes you're out" image, you say, "Okay, now I'm going to go across the street to the United States Federal Court and I'm going to do it all over again." And that is why we are in the 14th year of this case?</P>

<P><B>Jeanine Pirro:</B> Exactly.</P>

<P><B>Ira Glasser:</B> Well, that could be as one of the reasons.</P>

<P><B>Judge Temin:</B> There are reasons why time passes when nothing happens. You're assuming that one thing follows another. And that didn't used to happen. And traditionally, particularly in capital cases, that didn't used to happen, the collateral attack was often not filed until the execution warrant was summoned. But now we have new statutes, both passed by congress and by the various states, that are trying to stop that from happening and would make the scenario much as you described it where the collateral attack follows not only immediately upon the appeal, but you have to bring it with the direct appeal.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> Let me be cynical for a moment. I'm sitting on the appellate court. Some misguided governor has made me a judge of an appellate court. I see a case coming up to me, and maybe there are lots of errors in the case. But I say to myself, that defendant is guilty as sin. I know that. I can see it in the record, despite the errors. If I send that case back down for retrial, so many years later, given the attitude that jurors have toward police, a jury today is going to acquit. Now, should I be thinking that way, Stuart? As an appellate judge?</P>

<P><B>Stuart Taylor:</B> The law clearly says you should not. If the first trial was unfair in a way that's constitutional error, you're supposed to reverse it and not worry about what happens next, even if all the witnesses are dead, let alone just having forgotten things. I think in reality it would be hard for the appellate court not to think about that. If they think, well, there was some error in this trial, let's say, I think the confession was phony or something, but I know this guy did it and I'm afraid that the jury's going to let him walk, I think judges think about that.</P>

<P><B>Cornel West:</B> I think that's one of the best arguments against the death penalty, though. We have to have such absolute knowledge, almost divine knowledge to be so certain that we then put someone to death. As long as there's that possibility of error, then you would think in the case of a death penalty there ought to be a full-fledged re-evaluation and very, very strong mechanisms of accountability. That's true for anyone ...</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> Let me play devil's advocate. The reason the criminal justice system has no deterrent effect is because by playing all of these cards, by being super careful, there's no reality to the system.</P>

<P><B>Cornel West:</B> No, not at all. I think first we need to broaden justice in the society. But on the other hand, we've got to be able to show that punitive punishment can be meted out without it requiring a death penalty which would require a kind of divine knowledge that no mortal has.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> That's why you're a professor of religion.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> Stuart, where are we in the Abu-Jamal case as we sit here tonight?</P>

<P><B>Stuart Taylor:</B> Ironically, we're fairy early in the case in its 15th year in the sense that he's doing his first so-called collateral attack in state court. The trial judge, ruled against him last September. He has appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The total briefs filed by both sides are more than 300 pages. Jamal is still coming up with new evidence. He recently filed an affidavit from a defense witness who says the police threatened her with a long prison term if she didn't say what they wanted to say. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court will probably hear arguments later this year. Jamal's lawyers are not optimistic about their chances because the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has already ruled four-nothing against him. Then he'll go to federal court and start over.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> And he's being represented at this point by new counsel.</P>

<P><B>Stuart Taylor:</B> He now has new counsel. Very competent counsel with adequate resources. Leonard Weinglass is his senior lawyer who's represented a lot of radicals over the years, including the old Chicago Seven trial. And he's being very well represented now and that's one reason the briefs are 300 pages.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> How long will this process go on?</P>

<P><B>Stuart Taylor:</B> It's very hard to tell because congress in April passed a new law that's designed to cut it shorter at the federal level. So suppose he loses in Pennsylvania next year, a few years ago he might have looked forward to years more of federal appeals. Now congress is trying to shut that down to make a federal appeal go very fast, over and done with within a year or two and it remains to be seen whether that will succeed.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> As a professional law enforcement officer, Vernon, what's your reaction to all this?</P>

<P><B>Vernon Geberth:</B> My reaction is that, I know this sounds very foolish, but I believe in a higher authority, and all of this that takes place now, there's a guy upstairs who knows who did what and there will be a reckoning. And as a homicide cop, I believe in that. And, of course, I try to bring that into my investigations. But yes, there will be a reckoning after all is said and done.</P>

<P><B>Cornel West:</B> Vernon, I believe in that same God, but I also think it's important that we have increasing attention to ensure that justice is done, that fairness is done to the best of our human ability.</P>

<P><B>Vernon Geberth:</B> And I believe in that also, Cornel. And the problem is, and I'm going to have to agree with you, justice is not done in the criminal justice system 'cause I know. I see the surviving families. As a homicide cop, I know that.</P>

<P><B>Jeanine Pirro:</B> And the fact that we are here 14 years later and the fact that this defendant has had 14 years within which to appeal and will continue to appeal is an indication that the system is sensitive to the needs of the defendant, and sometimes we forget that we're here because a police officer was shot in the line of duty.</P>

<P><B>Ira Glasser:</B> And its precisely that sensitivity which congress has just sought to erase. That's the problem.</P>

<P><B>Jeanine Pirro:</B> No, what congress has sought to do is to make sure that the defense doesn't wait until the day that the warrant is signed to bring the next appeal.</P>

<P><B>Ira Glasser:</B> Well, you talk about the defense not waving, is this defense was sitting there, when in fact, what usually happens in most death penalty cases, as you know, is that the defense was incompetent and it's only when you get new lawyers later on and you ... and the execution warrant has been signed, that the thing always starts. That's why it happens that way. Nobody who voted for that bill restricting habeas would want to be subjected to it if it was their life on the line or one of their kids.</P>

<P><B>Judge Temin:</B> I have to take issue with your statement that most lawyers are incompetent.</P>

<P><B>Ira Glasser:</B> Most lawyers in death penalty cases. In most states where the death penalty is ... in the south, have not had competent counsel.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Miller:</B> All right, unlike the criminal justice system, in television, I have to say I'm afraid that's all the time we have.</P>

<P>We hope our discussion has provided you with the context in which to understand this case. And perhaps more in importantly, has illuminated some of the problems that confront our system of criminal justice. I'd like to thank the six people who have joined me on this discuss for Court TV. I'm Arthur Miller. Good night.</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+2>Jamal's Last Stand</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Infamous Murder Case May Be Significant<BR>
Test of New Habeas Statute</FONT></B><p>

<P>Commentary By Stuart Taylor Jr.<br>
June 11, 1996</P>

<P>When death row defense lawyers present "new evidence" to support claims of innocence as long as 14 years after the defendant's conviction -- as those representing Pennsylvania death row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal did May 22 -- people are understandably skeptical.</P>

<P>Such claims are often little more than desperate, last -ditch ploys by lawyers running out of delaying tactics. Impatience with such stalling helped prompt Congress and President Clinton to enact strict new limits on federal habeas corpus appeals in April.</P>

<P>But the fact is that due to the peculiar dynamics of our criminal process -- and especially the woefully inadequate representation most capital defendants receive at trial -- evidence casting real doubt on the fairness of murder convictions and death sentences regularly emerges many years later.</P>

<P>As the Supreme Court begins to grapple with the ambiguities in the new habeas statute, the Jamal case stands as an example of the need for federal courts to remain open to new evidence, even after seemingly intolerable delays in carrying out the sentence of a defendant who was convicted in 1982 of murdering a police officer in cold blood.</P>

<P>Jamal's case has been much publicized for reasons that have no direct bearing on his guilt or innocence: He is a self -proclaimed black "revolutionary," and an extraordinarily articulate and talented journalist. Those traits have won him a big following in leftist, Hollywood, and European intellectual circles.</P>

<P>Inconveniently for Jamal's admirers, the evidence that he probably killed police officer Daniel Faulkner remains strong: It is undisputed that he was found 4 feet from the dead officer a minute after the killing, with his empty revolver nearby and a bullet from Faulkner's gun in his torso. In addition, while claiming to be "innocent," Jamal has never said that he did not shoot Faulkner or specified who did.</P>

<P>But new evidence, mostly dug up since 1993 by Jamal's first good lawyers, raises at least a tiny doubt as to whether it was he who killed Faulkner, strongly suggests that if he did, it was closer to manslaughter than to cold-blooded murder, and shows clearly that he received an unfair trial, tainted by grossly inadequate defense lawyering, flagrantly biased judging and, in all probability, police fabrication of evidence and intimidation of witnesses.</P>

<P><b>Timely, Tantalizing Testimony</b><br>

The latest piece of new evidence is a May 21 affidavit by Veronica Jones, belatedly bolstering both Jamal's trial defense that the killer got away and his current claims that the police intimidated witnesses.</P>

<P>Jones was plying her wares as a prostitute in a seedy part of Philadelphia at 4 a.m. on Dec. 9, 1981, the morning of Faulkner's death. She told police a few days later that she had seen two men hurrying from the scene of the shooting (which she had heard but not seen) before the police arrived and arrested Jamal. But when called as a defense witness at trial, Jones unexpectedly repudiated her police report and supported the prosecution claim that nobody had left the scene.</P>

<P>This, Jones now swears, was perjury, suborned by police. Her May 21 affidavit claims that two (unidentified) Philadelphia detectives had visited her in jail days before Jamal's 1982 trial and had "threatened me by reminding me that I faced a long prison sentence" on multiple pending felony charges; they said she would get off easy if she would help the prosecution at Jamal's trial.</P>

<P>"When they finally left," the affidavit says, "I knew that if I did anything to help the Jamal defense I would face years in prison." And when she was taken from jail to testify at Jamal's trial, "[b]oth detectives who had threatened me earlier were in plain view, standing in the rear of the courtroom. When asked by Jamal's attorney to confirm what I had first told the police -- that I saw two males run from the scene after the firing stopped -- I steadfastly denied it."</P>

<P>Trial testimony by Jones that two men had escaped would have helped Jamal by corroborating the account of another defense witness, Dessie Hightower, that he had seen someone running from the scene. As it was, Hightower's testimony was not much of a counterweight to the prosecution's theory -- backed by two of the three witnesses who identified Jamal as the killer -- that nobody had escaped.</P>

<P>Jamal's current lawyers not only have shredded the credibility of those prosecution witnesses, but also have identified no fewer than five eyewitnesses (including Jones and Hightower) who have said at one time or another that someone escaped the scene. At least four of them said so in their initial police reports, but the jury heard only about Hightower.</P>

<P>Why did it take so long for defense lawyers to come up with the new Veronica Jones account? Well, she says she was afraid to help Jamal. Besides, Jamal's original lawyer never interviewed her, either before or after her surprising trial testimony. And by the time Jamal's current chief lawyer, Leonard Weinglass, began investigating a very cold trail in 1993, Jones had long since left the Philadelphia area, moving several times, using aliases, and keeping an unlisted phone number. It took some doing to find her.</P>

<P>Of course, it's possible that Jones is lying now, but her current account helps convince me that somebody escaped the scene of the crime.</P>

<P>Moreover, the Jones affidavit adds weight to the considerable body of evidence that police influenced a number of vulnerable witnesses -- some through intimidation, some though more subtle suggestions -- to make dramatic changes in their initial stories so as to paint Jamal as a cold-blooded murderer deserving of death, while suppressing evidence that might complicate the picture.</P>

<P>Most flagrantly, it appears probable that a flamboyant Jamal "confession" that was presented to the jury -- "I shot the motherfucker and I hope the motherfucker dies" -- was a complete fabrication, concocted by police long after the fact to clinch the case. Although a prosecution witness claimed that Jamal had shouted this out at the hospital twice, within earshot of 15 or 20 police officers -- who were soon interviewed by homicide detectives seeking to build the strongest possible case against Jamal -- not a word about this "confession" found its way into a single police report for more than two months.</P>

<P>And one of the officers who was later to claim he had heard Jamal's shouted "confession" wrote in his initial report, hours after the shooting, that Jamal had "made no comments" at the hospital. The jury never heard about that.</P>

<P><b>Bad Means To An End?</b><br>

Some might be tempted to dismiss even such gross violations of due process, and the many others detailed by Jamal's current lawyers, as harmless error if it were utterly clear that Jamal is a cold-blooded cop-killer. But it's not clear.</P>

<P>Evidence that was not provided to the jury shows that Jamal -- then a 27-year-old man with no criminal record -- ran toward Faulkner only after coming upon the sight of the officer beating Jamal's younger brother bloody with a 17-inch flashlight.</P>

<P>(The brother had slugged the officer first while being patted down after a traffic stop; it's unclear whether Jamal saw that. Prosecution and defense agree that the brother did no shooting. He was arrested at the scene, but has never testified.)</P>

<P>The evidence also supports the inference that -- contrary to the prosecution's claim that Jamal fired the first shot "from ambush" into Faulkner's back -- the officer probably fired first, hitting the charging Jamal in the chest and nearly killing him. Then (probably) Faulkner was shot in the back, fell to the ground, and was killed by a bullet between the eyes.</P>

<P>So even if we could be confident beyond a reasonable doubt that it was Jamal who shot Faulkner -- which may be debatable, given the evidence that someone escaped -- it's not at all clear that this was a cold-blooded, first-degree murder, which Pennsylvania law defines as a malicious, unprovoked killing with "deliberation and premeditation."</P>

<P>Jamal is seeking a new trial, and he is entitled to one. But his first collateral attack on his conviction and sentence was predictably rejected last September by Albert Sabo, the same notoriously pro-prosecution Philadelphia judge who presided over the 1982 trial. Jamal is now appealing to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which has already rejected (by 4-0 in 1989) his direct appeal in the politically charged case.</P>

<P>If Jamal loses in the state courts, as seems probable, he will seek federal habeas relief. It will be an important test of the new habeas statute, which requires federal judges to give state courts a strong presumption of correctness on issues of federal constitutional law as well as of fact.</P>

<P>Has Congress paved the way for executions of people whose convictions and sentences are tainted by egregious violations of the Constitution and who may not be murderers at all? We'll see.</P>

<H2>Mumia Abu-Jamal Sues NPR, Claiming Censorship</H2>

<P>By Staff Reports<BR>
March 26, 1996</P>

<P>Mumia Abu-Jamal, a nationally-known journalist serving a death sentence for the murder of a Philadelphia police officer, says National Public Radio violated his First Amendment rights.</P>

<P>In a civil lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, the former radio journalist contends that NPR decided not to run a recorded broadcast of his death-row commentary for the show "All Things Considered" in 1994 because of political pressure from the Fraternal Order of Police and  U.S. Sen. Robert Dole.</P>

<P>The lawsuit seeks $1.5 million in punitive damages from NPR and the airing of Abu-Jamal's recordings.</P>

<P>Abu-Jamal contends that NPR canceled the program after Sen. Dole threatened its funding.</P>

<P>In May 1994, Senator Dole denounced NPR and threatened closer Congressional oversight and reduction of NPR's funding because of NPR's initial decision to broadcast Mr. Jamal's commentaries, according to the lawsuit.</P>

<P>In a 1995 speech delivered on the Senate floor, Senator Dole asserted that NPR's abrupt reversal of its decision to air Mr. Jamal's commentaries was due to pressure brought to bear by members of Congress, including himself, the lawsuit alleges.</P>

<P>The suit contends that NPR has also failed to honor repeated requests from Abu-Jamal that his recordings be released to him and the project.</P>

<P>In a public statement, NPR officials said the decision not to air the commentaries was editorial discretion, not censorship.</P>

<P>Abu-Jamal, convicted in 1982 of killing Philadelphia Police Officer Daniel Faulkner, has become a prison author and celebrity whose case has drawn international attention.</P>

<P>Earlier this year, his lawyers asked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to overturn his conviction. Abu-Jamal's defense team contends that his original lawyer botched his defense in 1982; that the trial judge was biased against the defendant; and that new evidence suggested someone else killed Faulkner in 1981. The court is expected to issue a ruling sometime this summer.</P>

<h2>Guilty and Framed</h2><P>

<P>By Stuart Taylor, Jr.<br>
The American Lawyer<br>
December 1995</P>

<P>You've probably heard about the current darling of the radical-chic crowd and the America-bashing European intellectual set: Mumia Abu-Jamal, a convicted cop killer seeking to parlay his literary and black militant credentials into a ticket off death row.</P>

<P>In a full-page advertisement in the August 9 New York Times, 112 writers, actors, politicians, and others declared: "There is strong reason to believe that as an outspoken critic of the Philadelphia police and the judicial and prison systems, Mumia Abu-Jamal has been sentenced to death because of his political beliefs." The signers included the likes of director Oliver Stone, actors Mike Farrell and Paul Newman, Professor Derrick Bell, and the same Norman Mailer who helped free killer-author Jack Henry Abbott, who killed again.</P>

<P>Cornel West compares Jamal with Martin Luther King, Jr. Jesse Jackson compares him with Nelson Mandela (who has asked that Jamal be spared). And Jamal's book, Live from Death Row, has helped make him an international cause celebre, selling more than 50,000 copies since May.</P>

<P>What you would not know from such stuff is that the evidence shows that Jamal is probably an unrepentant killer, who on December 9, 1981, stood over 26-year-old Daniel Faulkner and put a bullet between his eyes while the already wounded officer lay helpless on his back.</P>

<P>So why the big hoo-hah about this character? Is it just the old radical conceit that any black guy who shoots a white cop can't be all bad, especially if he is a "revolutionary" with the Black Panthers on his resume, long dreadlocks, an engaging smile, and a way with words?</P>

<P>Actually, it's more complicated than that. Complicated enough that I'm joining the "Save Mumia" movement, here and now.</P>

<P>After a detailed review of the trial transcripts, witness statements to police, and other evidence brought out before and during a much-publicized post-conviction hearing this summer in state court in Philadelphia, it appears to me that Jamal's trial was grotesquely unfair and his sentencing hearing clearly unconstitutional.</P>

<P>Jamal was prejudiced by police misconduct and probably rampant police perjury; ineffective and underfunded defense lawyering; inappropriate prosecution arguments to the jury; egregiously bad judging by the notoriously biased, pro-prosecution Albert Sabo of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas; and questionable voir dire stratagems that forced Jamal to face an 83 percent white jury (ten whites, two blacks) in a 40 percent black city.</P>

<P>Due to this toxic combination of factors, the jury that convicted and condemned Jamal in 1982 lacked some important evidence, including a police report strongly supporting Jamal's claim that his "confession" was a complete fabrication, cemented by perjured prosecution testimony.</P>

<P>There is also evidence -- much of which the jury did not have -- suggesting that all three of the prosecution's eyewitnesses changed their stories to conform to the prosecution's theory of the crime between their initial police "interviews" and their testimony at trial, and that the police sought to stifle exculpatory evidence.</P>

<P>Moreover, even if Jamal did kill Faulkner, the evidence shows that there were mitigating circumstances: When Jamal came on the scene, what he saw was a big (6-foot) white police officer beating Jamal's much smaller brother bloody with a 17-inch flashlight; and when Jamal rushed to his brother's aid, the officer probably shot Jamal in the chest before Jamal shot the officer -- perhaps before Jamal drew his own gun.</P>

<P>In the end, even the overblown assertion in that New York Times advertisement -- that Jamal "has been sentenced to death because of his political beliefs" -- has a kernel of truth to it.</P>

<P><b>A Most Unusual Death Row Inmate</b><br>

Mumia Abu-Jamal is an extraordinary man, with a powerful intellect, a rare talent for radio journalism, a burning empathy for poor people, a lot of admiring friends in journalism and politics, and no prior record of crime or violence, despite personal experience of police brutality and years as a teenage Black Panther under the microscope of FBI and police surveillance.</P>

<P>The day after the 27-year-old Jamal's arrest,  the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Jamal's "searing and skillful interviews" had made him "a well-known figure in local broadcast journalism." Jamal had been on National Public Radio, the National Black Network, and local Philadelphia stations including WUHY-FM (now WHYY). He had been elected chair of the Philadelphia Chapter of the Association of Black Journalists and had won mention in Philadelphia magazine as one of "81 people to watch in 1981."</P>

<P>You won't find many people on death row with credentials like that.</P>

<P>But this was no ordinary journalist, either. Jamal's radical activism went back to his mid-teens, when, he has said, he was beaten, threatened with a gun, kicked in the face, and called "nigger" by police in connection with various peaceful protest activities.</P>

<P>While he was protesting at a George Wallace-for-president rally in 1968, Jamal wrote in Live from Death Row, "we were attacked by several white men. . . . I was grabbed by two of them, one kicking my skull while the other kicked me in the balls. Then I looked up and saw the two-toned, gold-trimmed pant leg of a Philly cop. . . . I yelled, 'Help, police!' The cop saw me on the ground being beaten to a pulp, marched over briskly -- and kicked me in the face. I have been thankful to that faceless cop ever since, for he kicked me straight into the Black Panther Party." Jamal became a founding member of the Black Panther Party's Philadelphia chapter in 1969 at the age of 15.</P>

<P>After joining mainstream news organizations in the 1970s, Jamal, who changed his name from Wesley Cook as a teenager, took an interest in stories about police brutality, and with good reason. The Philadelphia police department was so notorious that the Justice Department, in an unprecedented 1979 civil suit, charged then-mayor (and former police commissioner) Frank Rizzo and the top police brass with encouraging rampant police brutality, racism, and lying. (The complaint was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds.)</P>

<P>By the late 1970s Jamal was also an ardent sympathizer of MOVE -- a black militant, antiestablishment, antipolice group -- and was wearing his hair in long dreadlocks like a MOVE member. By mid- 1981 Jamal's growing obsession with MOVE had compromised his standing as a journalist and cost him his job at WUHY. He was freelancing while moonlighting as a cabdriver. After being robbed, he had started carrying a gun.</P>

<P>Nonetheless, Jamal's arrest for Faulkner's murder stunned friends and fellow journalists, several of whom have said that despite the revolutionary rhetoric, violence was alien to his nature.</P>

<P><b>Who Shot Faulkner: What The Jury Heard</b><br>

Police officer Daniel Faulkner's radio dispatches, accounts of witnesses, and physical evidence establish beyond serious dispute how the chain of events leading to Faulkner's death began that December night in 1981.</P>

<P>At 3:51 a.m. Faulkner stopped Jamal's brother, William Cook, who was driving a Volkswagen Beetle, apparently for a traffic violation, on the south side of Locust Street, about 80 feet east of 13th Street. It was a seedy area replete with late-night bars, nightclubs, cafes, and streetwalkers. Faulkner radioed his location, and then added: "On second thought, send me a wagon" -- apparently planning to arrest Cook (or someone in Cook's car) for an unknown reason.</P>

<P>Both Faulkner and Cook got out of their cars. Faulkner spread- eagled Cook across one of the cars. Then Cook suddenly turned and slugged the officer, or so say two prosecution witnesses. Faulkner responded by clubbing Cook several times with his 17- inch flashlight. (Cook's face and neck were bloody when police arrived.)</P>

<P>At this point, Jamal came out of a parking lot on the northeast corner of Locust and 13th, accelerating from a walk to a run as he charged across Locust Street, right at Faulkner. That's when the shooting started, at point-blank range. (It has never been clear why Jamal, whose cab was parked nearby, happened to be around.)</P>

<P>When police arrived at the scene less than a minute later, the wounded Jamal -- sitting on the curb 4 feet from Faulkner, with his empty shoulder holster on and his empty gun nearby -- was the obvious suspect.</P>

<P>Cook was standing a few feet away against a wall, with what two witnesses called "a look of shock" on his face. He allegedly told police, "I ain't got nothing to do with it." (Cook was prosecuted only for slugging Faulkner; Jamal's lawyers and prosecutors agree that he did not shoot Faulkner.)</P>

<P>The main disputes are over who fired the two shots that hit Faulkner, and over when Faulkner shot Jamal, during the interval of a few seconds after Jamal began running toward the scene.</P>

<P>According to the prosecution's theory, Jamal ran up behind Faulkner "from ambush" to within about 1 foot, and shot him in the back. The wounded Faulkner returned fire, hitting Jamal in the chest, while falling onto his back. Jamal emptied his gun at his helpless victim's face at close range, finishing him off with a shot between the eyes.</P>

<P>It's a nice, clean theory, pointing to a clear legal conclusion: first-degree murder, which is capital murder in Pennsylvania when the victim is a police officer. If all one had to go on was the physical evidence (as it was presented to the jury) and the trial testimony of the three prosecution eyewitnesses, Jamal's guilt would seem established beyond a shadow of a doubt.</P>

<P>Cynthia White, a prostitute, swore that she had seen Jamal, with gun in hand, firing two shots at Faulkner's back; then Faulkner "turned around and staggered and seemed like he was grabbing for something, then he fell"; and then Jamal was "standing over" the fallen officer firing "three or four more" shots into his face. Robert Chobert, a cabdriver, swore that he had heard a shot, looked up, and had seen Jamal firing down at the supine Faulkner. Michael Mark Scanlan, who had been out bar-hopping, swore that he had heard a shot while watching a dreadlocked black man (evidently Jamal) rushing at Faulkner with arm outstretched, as though pointing a gun; then the man had stood over Faulkner firing more shots.</P>

<P>"There's no question in my mind," says Jamal's trial prosecutor, Joseph McGill, "that Mumia Abu-Jamal viciously killed Officer Faulkner in the manner presented before the jury, and the jury agreed."</P>

<P>But the prosecution's theory begins to unravel when one studies the initial statements that these three witnesses gave to police on the morning of the shootings, and traces the dramatic changes -- all to the benefit of the prosecution -- in their accounts over the next six months, culminating in their testimony at trial. Still more doubt creeps in when one weighs the strong incentives that White and Chobert had to give police what they wanted.</P>

<P>The prosecution's theory is that Jamal shot Faulkner in the back before being shot by Faulkner. But review of all available evidence (much of which was not before the jury) suggests to me that Faulkner probably saw Jamal coming -- perhaps with gun in hand, perhaps not -- and may have fired the first shot. And other evidence suggests that Cook may well have had a passenger in his car, who jumped out and got away, perhaps after firing one or more shots at Faulkner.</P>

<P>The prosecution's theory -- and, probably, the reality -- is that it was Jamal who fired the fatal shot into the fallen Faulkner's face. But the testimony undergirding this theory was far shakier, less credible, and less consistent with the eyewitnesses' initial reports to police than the jury could have known.</P>

<P>Nor is the physical evidence conclusive, although it may have looked that way to the jury. There was no definitive match, for example, between Jamal's gun and the bullet that killed Faulkner. And police could have gone a long way toward establishing whether or not Jamal was the killer by testing his hands, </P>to determine whether he had recently fired a gun, and smelling his gun barrel, to determine whether it had recently been fired. They did neither.

<P><b>A Concocted Confession?</b><br>

If the jurors had any doubts about Jamal's guilt after hearing from the prosecution's eyewitnesses, those doubts probably evaporated when they heard Jamal's "confession."</P>

<P>As he was lying on the floor of the hospital emergency room, near the police officer he was suspected of murdering, Jamal defiantly shouted: " 'I shot the motherfucker, and I hope the motherfucker dies.' " He shouted it again a minute later. At least that was the testimony of Priscilla Durham, a hospital security guard, at Jamal's 1982 trial. Officer Garry Bell, Faulkner's former partner and best friend, swore that he heard Jamal shouting the same words.</P>

<P>Prosecutor McGill not only made powerful use of this alleged confession in his closing argument for a first-degree murder conviction; the next morning, in urging a death sentence, he stressed "the arrogance of an individual who defiantly will do it and then defiantly brag after it."</P>

<P>But this was a most peculiar "confession," even putting aside the improbability that a man described by another prosecutor at this summer's hearing as "one of the smartest people I have ever seen" would so spontaneously and flamboyantly incriminate himself.</P>

<P>For although Jamal allegedly shouted it out while 15 or so police officers were grappling with him or nearby, and although most or all of these officers were interviewed over the next few days by homicide detectives seeking to build the strongest possible case against Jamal, not a word about this "confession" found its way into a single police report for more than two months.</P>

<P>Jamal's lawyers contend this "confession" was fabricated. And due to the ineffectiveness of Jamal's defense lawyer and the bias of Judge Sabo, the jury never heard the most exculpatory evidence: Officer Gary Wakshul, who was in the paddy wagon that took Jamal from the scene to Jefferson Hospital, reported later that morning that "we stayed with the male at Jefferson until we were relieved. During this time, the Negro male made no comments."</P>

<P>Did Wakshul just not hear Jamal's confession? Or did he step away for a minute and miss it? Or did he leave the hospital before Jamal uttered it? Nope. It turns out he heard the whole confession, loud and clear. At least, that's what Wakshul said in a new statement 64 days after the fact, on February 11, 1982, when questioned in a probe of Jamal's claim that police had beaten him.</P>

<P>Wakshul suddenly recalled there was this one little comment: "As he was placed on the floor [outside the hospital emergency room], and as I was standing back up, I did hear him say, 'I shot him. I hope the motherfucker dies.' " Asked by his interviewer to explain his initial report, Wakshul said that "the statement disgusted me, and I didn't realize it had any importance until today."</P>

<P>Didn't realize it had any importance? Wakshul's initial report had included far less important details, such as the exact times of Faulkner's radio dispatches. The idea that he had heard Jamal confess but hadn't bothered to report it is patently incredible.</P>

<P>Like Wakshul, officer Garry Bell made no mention of Jamal's "confession" in his reports in the days after the shooting. It was not until 78 days later that Bell says he "remembered" the confession. Bell explains he was "devastated seeing Danny . . . with his face almost blown off," but not one of the other 15 to 20 other police officers with Jamal at the hospital ever reported hearing the confession.</P>

<P>Priscilla Durham first mentioned Jamal's "confession" to police investigators in a February 9, 1982, interview, 62 days after the shooting. It was not until yet another four months had gone by that Durham first claimed, in her June 24 trial testimony, that she had reported the alleged Jamal confession "the very next day" after the shooting to a hospital investigator, in a statement that he wrote down by hand. Prosecutor McGill, seemingly surprised, interjected, "I've never seen one."</P>

<P>Nor has one ever been produced, from that day to this. McGill sent word for the hospital to dig up this handwritten "statement," and while Durham was still on the stand there arrived in the courtroom an unsigned, unauthenticated, typewritten piece of paper, dated December 10, 1981.</P>

<P>Durham said that she had never seen this typed "statement" before, but that it was close to what she had reported to hospital investigators. "They took the handwritten statement and typed this," Judge Sabo helpfully conjectured. He then let McGill bolster Durham's credibility by reading key portions of this unauthenticated document to the jury.</P>

<P>Jamal's lawyers stress that Durham was a biased witness because she knew Faulkner and Bell, worked closely with police on a daily basis, and harbored hopes of getting a job as a police officer. Durham and Bell (like Wakshul) also undermined their credibility by denying that Jamal had been brutalized at the hospital, despite evidence (some of which the jury did not hear) suggesting that he was beaten in their presence.</P>

<P>Nor would this have been the first time that Philadelphia police cooked up a phony confession. "That's the kind of bullshit we see all the time," asserts John Packel, chief of the appeals division of the Defender's Association of Philadelphia. "Cops making up whatever they think will help, making up confessions, to get someone they think is guilty."</P>

<P>In fact, police may have manufactured two Jamal confessions. Inspector Alfonzo Giordano reported later on the morning of the shooting that the handcuffed Jamal had confessed to him when they were alone in the back of the paddy wagon.</P>

<P>Giordano says he asked Jamal, " 'Where is the gun that goes into the holster?' and he stated to me, 'I dropped the gun on the street after I shot him.' " The prosecution elected not to use this "confession," partly because of the risk of reversal on Miranda grounds.</P>

<P>But I think Giordano made it up. I think Jamal was telling the truth in an interview 11 weeks later, when he told Philadelphia Daily News columnist Chuck Stone: "I confessed? That's absurd. I do remember he [Giordano] called me a black motherfucker and hit me with a walkie-talkie." Giordano -- who pled guilty in 1986 to tax charges arising from his taking $57,000 in payoffs -- stands by his story.</P>

<P><b>Eyewitnesses: A Cabbie With Problems</b><br>

"Throughout this trial, whenever there was any testimony that was changed, it was always to the benefit of the commonwealth."</P>

<P>So said Anthony Jackson, the defense lawyer at Jamal's 1982 trial, while on the stand at this summer's hearing. The proof of his point lies in the remarkable evolution over time in the stories told by the three prosecution eyewitnesses who fingered Jamal as a cop-killer.</P>

<P>Consider cabdriver Robert Chobert.</P>

<P>It is undisputed that he was closer to the scene than the two other prosecution eyewitnesses, parked in his cab a car's length behind Daniel Faulkner's squad car, and some 50 feet from the shooting. He was writing up a fare when he heard the first shot and looked up. He had to look over or past Faulkner's car, with its flashing red dome light, to see the action, and saw the shooter only from the side.</P>

<P>Chobert testified at trial that when he looked up, he saw Faulkner fall; then saw Jamal "standing over him and firing some more shots into him."</P>

<P>"I know who shot the cop, and I ain't going to forget it," Chobert snapped at Jackson during cross-examination.</P>

<P>But Chobert's first recorded statement to police -- about which the jury was not told -- was that the shooter "apparently ran away," according to a report that morning by Inspector Giordano.</P>

<P>Giordano encountered Chobert upon reaching the scene about five minutes after the shooting: "[A] white male from the crowd stated that he saw the shooting and that a black MOVE member had done it and appearently [sic] ran away. When asked what he ment [sic] bby [sic] a MOVE member, the white male stated, 'His hair, his hair,' appearantly [sic] referring to dreadlocks. I asked him to step over to the rear of EPW #601 [the paddy wagon], the wagon crew opened the back door, the suspect was laying on his back on floor, the white male immediately stated, 'That is the man that shot the policeman.' "</P>

<P>The white male was Chobert. The dreadlocked suspect in the wagon was Jamal. And the problem with Chobert's first account was that if indeed the shooter "ran away" from the scene, then it would be hard to pin the crime on the critically wounded Jamal, who was found on the curb 4 feet from Faulkner, and who had not run anywhere, according to three other witnesses. (Giordano now says that "I don't doubt that this cabdriver saw somebody run away," but that it was not the shooter. The prosecution's theory, and Chobert's testimony, was that nobody ran away.)</P>

<P>Had Chobert gotten confused and misidentified Jamal as the shooter when he saw him in the paddy wagon, because of his race and hairstyle? (Cook had dreadlocks too, and a third man with dreadlocks escaped the scene, according to other witnesses.) Or what?</P>

<P>This account would have given the defense a good start at attacking the prosecution's case against Jamal, on the ground that Chobert's initial report showed that the shooter had escaped -- or, at the very least, that Chobert had no idea who the shooter was. But Chobert's story changed in each of his two subsequent police interviews, getting better for the prosecution each time.</P>

<P>At the homicide unit, less than an hour after his initial report to Giordano, Chobert signed a statement that "I saw this black male stand over the cop and shoot him a couple more times. Then I saw the black male start running towards 12th Street. He didn't get far, maybe 30 or 35 steps and then he fell. . . . The cops got him and stuck him in the back of a wagon."</P>

<P>Chobert also told police that the dreadlocked shooter was "kind of heavyset. He was about 6 feet tall and he was wearing a light tan shirt and jeans."</P>

<P>This second recorded Chobert statement still posed big problems. For one thing, while Jamal is over 6 feet, he was far from heavyset; he was lean, almost gaunt. And when arrested he was wearing not a light tan shirt, but dark clothes.</P>

<P>More important, if the shooter ran 35 steps (about 100 feet) toward 12th Street, the shooter wasn't Jamal, who sat down or collapsed on the curb 4 feet from Faulkner, and who, according to prosecution eyewitness Cynthia White, "didn't try to run or anything."</P>

<P>Three days later, in a December 12, 1981, reinterview, Chobert said that the shooter's shirt was "dark gray" -- not "light tan." And when asked (yet again) "how far did this man [the shooter] run," he revised 35 steps to "about a car length away," adding that then the shooter "just layed [sic] there by the curb, about 10 feet from the cop." Thus did 100 feet (35 steps) suddenly shrink to 10 feet, perhaps with a little coaching by police.</P>

<P>By the time of his June 19, 1982, trial testimony, Chobert was swearing that the shooter had not run at all: "I saw him walking back about 10 feet and he just fell by the curb."</P>

<P>Jackson stressed some of these discrepancies in cross- examination, but he didn't do it very well, and he didn't get the biggest discrepancy of all ("ran away") before the jury. This enabled prosecutor Joseph McGill plausibly to dismiss the discrepancies as trifling details.</P>

<P>And while McGill told the jurors they could "trust" Chobert, he didn't tell them -- and with Judge Sabo's help prevented the defense from telling -- that Chobert needed friends in law enforcement because he was, among other things, on probation for arson-for-hire.</P>

<P>"I threw a bomb into a school. . . . A Molotov [cocktail]. . . . I got paid for doing it," Chobert explained in chambers. Judge Sabo ruled the arson conviction inadmissible for purposes of impeachment on the ground that it was not "crimen falsi" -- a crime tending to show untruthfulness.</P>

<P>Nor was the jury told about Chobert's drunk driving record, which Sabo deemed inadmissible. Nor was the jury -- or the defense -- told that Chobert had been driving his cab with a suspended license the night of the killing; that it was still suspended at the time of the trial; that police had never given him any trouble about this; that (according to Chobert's testimony this summer) Chobert had asked McGill during the trial "if he could help me find out how I could get my license back"; that McGill had "said he'll look into it"; and that this was "important" to Chobert because "that's how I earned my living."</P>

<P>McGill never mentioned this exchange to the defense. He says now that the conversation probably occurred after Chobert testified.</P>

<P><b>Tales of Two Prostitutes</b><br>

The only prosecution eyewitness who claimed that she had seen a gun in Jamal's hand at any time, and the only one who reported Faulkner grabbing at his side (for his own gun?) after being shot, and the only one besides Chobert who identified Jamal as the shooter, was the prostitute Cynthia White.</P>

<P>She told the jury she had seen the whole thing unfold while standing on the southeast corner of Locust and 13th Streets. That would put her about 80 feet from the scene and perhaps 30 feet behind Chobert's cab.</P>

<P>But White has more credibility problems than the average prostitute -- so many that it's hard to dismiss Jamal's lawyers' contention that her tale was scripted to please the police. Some evidence suggests she wasn't even there.</P>

<P>White had at least 38 arrests on her record in Philadelphia, with three open cases awaiting trial there when she testified at Jamal's trial. She was serving 18 months for prostitution in Massachusetts at the time of Jamal's trial. The jury heard about all that. But Judge Sabo blocked proffered testimony from another prostitute, Veronica Jones, that might have cast even more doubt on White's credibility.</P>

<P>Jones had heard the shooting, but not seen it, while standing almost a block to the east, at Locust and 12th Streets, according to her December 15, 1981, statement to police. Called to testify (reluctantly) for the defense at Jamal's trial, Jones started to say something intriguing: Sometime after her December 15, 1981, statement, she had been locked up "for nothing," held for five hours, and pressed by police to say, "I had seen Mumia . . . do it . . . intentionally." Prosecutor McGill cut Jones off with objections.</P>

<P>In a bench conference, Jackson said that Jones had told him that police "told her that if she would give a statement that backed up Cynthia White, they would let her work the street just like they were letting [Cynthia] work." At McGill's request, Sabo barred any such testimony as irrelevant, and struck the part that Jones had already blurted out.</P>

<P>White's account of the shootings, like Chobert's, evolved considerably after her initial police interview on December 9, 1981, as Jackson stressed in cross-examination. Police arrested her for streetwalking on December 12 and 17, and took the opportunity to send her up to Homicide to be reinterviewed each time. She was reinterviewed again on December 23.</P>

<P>In her first statement, the morning of the shooting, White said that the shooter was "short" with dreadlocks, and "came running out of the parking lot on Locust Street. He had a handgun in his hand. He fired the gun at the police officer four or five times. The police officer fell to the ground, starting screaming."</P>

<P>Problem: Jamal is tall (6 feet 1 inch). Cook is much shorter. Both had dreadlocks. Bigger problem: Chobert and Scanlan, the third prosecution eyewitness, both told police that same morning that they had heard only one shot before Faulkner fell, and that the rest of the shooting had come as he was flat on his back.</P>

<P>By December 17, 1981, White had a revised version: "He pointed the gun at the police officer and shot him one or two times. Then the officer fell, and he went over and stood above him and shot three more times."</P>

<P>Also in her initial statement, White said that "there was no struggle" between Faulkner and the driver of the Volkswagen (Cook). Problem: Scanlan told police that he saw Cook slugging Faulkner, and then saw Faulkner beating Cook hard with a billy club (apparently it was Faulkner's flashlight).</P>

<P>Three days later, White amended her story, saying that "the driver of the V.W. struck the officer. The officer grabbed him and turned him around." At trial she said Cook had suddenly struck Faulkner "with a closed fist to the cheek." But she still swore that Faulkner had never struck Cook, and had nothing in his hands.</P>

<P><b>Credible But Confused</b><br>

Scanlan, the bar-hopping motorist, was the most credible of the three prosecution eyewitnesses. He saw the critical events a lot less clearly than Chobert and White claimed to have seen them. But his story also got better for the prosecution between his initial accounts to police and his testimony at trial.</P>

<P>Scanlan was headed east on Locust Street and stopped at the light on the west side of 13th, about 120 feet from the scene [see diagram, page 77]. To see the shootings, he had to look past the corner where Cynthia White claimed she was, past Chobert's cab, and past Faulkner's squad car with its flashing red dome light.</P>

<P>According to Scanlan's initial statement to police, Faulkner had "spread the guy across the car with his arms out, and the guy turned back around and swung at the officer. The officer pulled his billy club out and swung hard at the guy hitting him several times on the arm and back. . . . Then I noticed another black guy come running across the street towards the officer and the guy he was hitting. Then the guy running across the street pulled out a pistol and started shooting at the officer . . . the officer fell down. Then he stood over the officer and fired three or four more shots point blank at the officer on the ground."</P>

<P>While Jamal's lawyers don't dispute that Jamal was the man Scanlan saw running across the street, they do dispute that Scanlan saw Jamal shoot Faulkner in the back, or at all. And with good reason. For one thing, when Scanlan was asked by police at the scene to identify Jamal, he identified him as the driver of the Volkswagen -- not the shooter. For another, Scanlan then drew a diagram that clearly showed Faulkner facing Jamal as Jamal approached the scene. And in a police reinterview two days later, Scanlan muddied the waters even more.</P>

<P>First, Scanlan said he hadn't seen the man who ran across the street holding or firing a gun. Rather, he assumed that this man was the source of the first gunshot that he heard. Scanlan also noted: "I don't know if the officer fired his gun or not, I didn't see him pull his gun or fire it, I didn't know whether either of the males was shot or not, I was stunned. . . ."</P>

<P>Second, Scanlan told police in this reinterview that he had no idea which black male had fired the shots after Faulkner fell: "One of the two males was standing over the officer, I don't know which one it was, then I saw two or three flashes, and heard the shots, I saw the gun in one of the males' hand, but I don't know which male had the gun."</P>

<P>By the time of his June 25, 1982, trial testimony, however, Scanlan's account was less messy: He said that a man (concededly Jamal) had run at Faulkner from behind, and that "I saw a hand come up, like this, and I heard a gunshot. There was another gunshot when the man got to the policeman, and the gentleman he had been talking to. And then the officer fell down on the sidewalk and the man walked over and was standing at his feet and shot him twice. I saw two flashes."</P>

<P>"The man walked over . . . and shot him twice"? Which man? How could Scanlan -- who had admitted on December 11, 1981, that he had no idea which man it was -- be sure in June 1982 that it was Jamal? In cross-examination, Scanlan indicated that he was not very sure: "There was confusion when all three of them were in front of the car."</P>

<P><b>What Really (Probably) Happened</b><br>

Jamal's lawyers theorize that Scanlan saw Faulkner facing Jamal as Jamal charged the scene; heard Faulkner shoot first at Jamal; mistakenly assumed that it was the other way around; and then saw someone standing over Faulkner and killing him -- the same someone who, according to Chobert's first statement, "ran away."</P>

<P>The prosecution's theory that Jamal fired the first shot, from within 12 inches, into Faulkner's back, depends on the assumption that the wounded Faulkner, while staggering and falling onto his back, with two assailants right on top of him, was able to pull out his gun, turn, and fire into Jamal's upper chest a bullet that lodged in his lower back. Also that Jamal passively waited with gun in hand for Faulkner to draw and shoot before continuing his assault.</P>

<P>It's possible it happened that way. But it's doubtful that it did -- especially since none of the prosecution's three eyewitnesses ever claimed to have seen Faulkner draw, aim, or shoot his gun, and only the less-than-credible Cynthia White claimed to have seen the charging Jamal, with gun in hand, shooting at Faulkner from behind.</P>

<P>The defense theory seems more plausible: "At that moment, Officer Faulkner faced a life-threatening situation. He had one suspect who allegedly struck him bent over the hood of a car with another individual running toward him. He was alone. It was 4 a.m. It was dark. The neighborhood was unsettling." So Faulkner shot Jamal first. And then Faulkner got spun around and shot in the back by Jamal. Or, as the defense claims, he was shot in the back by a man who ran away.</P>

<P>The who-shot-first question is important: A jury might find that even if the gravely wounded Jamal did shoot Faulkner, the circumstances warranted neither the death penalty nor, perhaps, a first-degree murder conviction, which requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of malicious and unprovoked killing with "deliberation and premeditation."</P>

<P>The defense could argue: Here we have a 27-year-old man with no criminal record. He sees his beloved kid brother being brutally clubbed by a big police officer. He understandably rushes to his brother's aid, his gun in its holster. The officer turns and shoots him in the chest, nearly killing him. He is racked with pain and shock. Even if you believe that he then shot the officer, it was surely in self-defense, or defense of his brother, or at worst manslaughter, committed after grave provocation and in the heat of passion.</P>

<P>The prosecution could, of course, counter that the execution- style fatal shot, with Jamal standing over his helpless victim, was first-degree murder punishable by death no matter who fired the first shot. But a verdict of manslaughter would be a real possibility, especially if any juror had even a scintilla of doubt as to who fired that fatal shot.</P>

<P>Jamal's lawyers say that if they win a new trial, they're after an acquittal, not just a manslaughter conviction. And to that end, they have taken aim at another key element of the prosecution's case: the theory that Jamal must have killed Faulkner because nobody else but Cook was at the scene.</P>

<P>No fewer than five eyewitnesses (including Chobert) have made statements at one time or another that support the defense theory that someone ran away from the scene. These accounts also raise at least a suspicion that police were so bent on nailing Jamal that they may have shunted aside, or even suppressed, evidence supporting this defense theory.</P>

<P>The most important of these witnesses, and the only one whom the jury heard saying that someone escaped the scene, was a part-time college student, Dessie Hightower. He has consistently and credibly stuck by the story he told police 80 minutes after the shootings: that he saw a man (or possibly a woman) about 6 feet tall, who looked "Jamaican" from behind (meaning that his hair was in dreadlocks or braids), "run from the scene of the crime" before police arrived.</P>

<P>Hightower's initial account posed a problem for police. He was called in for a reinterview six days later, on December 15, 1981. It lasted almost six hours. He told the same story, adding details about what happened after police arrived: Several officers had kicked and beaten Jamal, and had banged his head against a pole while dragging him to the paddy wagon by his dreadlocks. (Police admitted at trial that they banged his head against a pole and dropped him on his face, but claimed these were accidents.)</P>

<P>In the middle of this reinterview, Hightower was asked to take a polygraph test. (None of the prosecution witnesses was asked to do this, despite White's and Chobert's criminal records.) Hightower did so, and was told he had passed, he claims. But prosecutors at this summer's hearing produced a typed police report, dated 12 days after the polygraph test, purporting to show the opposite. The report says that Hightower was told that there was "deception indicated" when he denied "know[ing] for sure who killed Pol. Faulkner"; when he denied "see[ing] Pol. Faulkner killed"; and when he denied "see[ing] Jamal with a gun in his hand."</P>

<P>This report is puzzling in at least two respects. First, it indicates that the polygrapher asked Hightower questions wildly out of sync with police reports of his prior interviews, in which he said he did not see the shootings because his view was blocked by a wall at that moment. Second, the report indicates that the polygrapher did not ask Hightower anything about the important subject on which his prior interviews had focused: his claim that he had seen someone running away.</P>

<P>What kind of game were the police playing with this exculpatory witness?Aside from Hightower, the prostitute Veronica Jones told police (but not the jury) that after Faulkner fell, "I saw two black guys walk across [the] street and then they started sort of jogging." Two black guys jogging: That matches Chobert's (second) December 9, 1981, report, which says he saw the shooter and another black man running. Cook, perhaps -- and who?</P>

<P>Taking the eyewitness evidence as a whole, it seems more likely than not that somebody had been in Cook's car with him and had run away before police arrived. It's also at least conceivable that this mystery man killed Faulkner.</P>

<P>That, in fact, is the sworn testimony of one William Singletary, a new witness who contacted Jamal's lawyers in 1990 and testified publicly -- if not very credibly -- for the first time at this summer's hearing.</P>

<P>Another less than credible new defense witness this summer was Arnold Howard, a lifelong Jamal acquaintance with forgery and burglary convictions on his record. He provided the identity of the mystery man who allegedly was in Cook's Volkswagen and escaped the scene: Kenneth Freeman, Cook's (now deceased) partner in a vending stand a few blocks away.</P>

<P>In an affidavit, Howard swore that Freeman "told me he was driving [Cook's] Volkwagon [sic]" when Faulkner stopped it.</P>

<P><b>Ineffective Assistance</b><br>

During the six months between Jamal's arrest and his trial, while police and prosecutors were putting their case together and doing some 150 witness interviews, Jamal's court-appointed defense lawyer, Anthony Jackson, was doing a lot less.</P>

<P>Jackson was far from the worst lawyer a death penalty defendant has ever had. He had some 20 homicide trials under his belt and other useful experience, including several years at a public interest group that specialized in lawsuits alleging police brutality.</P>

<P>But Jackson's preparation of Jamal's case was woefully inadequate, and he was working under conditions that became increasingly difficult. Judge Paul Ribner, who handled the pre- trial proceedings, allocated Jackson the standard Philadelphia ration for an investigator and expert witnesses -- "not to exceed $150" apiece. Several Jackson motions for additional funds to investigate the case were denied, as was a Jackson plea for the appointment of a second lawyer to help out.</P>

<P>As trial approached, Jackson's investigator had stopped work due to insufficient funds, after interviewing only two witnesses. Jackson also lacked funds to pay for trial testimony by a pathologist or a ballistics expert. Meanwhile, Judge Ribner had denied a defense request for a lineup to test the questionable identifications of Jamal as the killer by eyewitnesses Chobert and White. And by May 1982, Jamal was aware of the prosecution's apparent intention to use one or both of his two (probably phony) "confessions" at trial.</P>

<P>So perhaps it's not hard to understand how it was that by the time of the June 1982 trial, Jamal -- who had been slipping into the MOVE group's strange orbit for some time -- got the impression that he was being railroaded by a corrupt and dishonest system bent on killing him, and that Jackson was being used as a fig leaf.</P>

<P>Jamal elected on May 13 to represent himself at trial. Jackson, meanwhile, was ordered by Judge Ribner to act as Jamal's "backup counsel," and the first of his several requests to withdraw was rejected. He ceased to work on the case for the five weeks before trial, because (he says) he assumed that Jamal would handle everything from voir dire to questioning witnesses. But Judge Sabo, who took over the case as trial approached, apparently had other ideas.</P>

<P><B>An Unfair Trial</B><BR>

The unfairness of Jamal's 1982 trial was almost guaranteed once it was assigned to Judge Albert Sabo (who declines to comment on the case). The short, white-haired judge, who is said to be genial and informal off the bench, was undersheriff of Philadelphia County for 16 years, and a proud member of the Fraternal Order of Police, before taking the bench in 1974. Sabo, now 74 and semiretired, has sent 32 defendants (27 blacks, two Asians, two whites, and one Latino) to death row -- far more than any other judge in the nation. He is notoriously pro-prosecution -- a cop on the bench.</P>

<P>Judge Sabo and Jamal began battling soon after the start of voir dire, on June 7, 1982. After two laborious days, Sabo granted a request by prosecutor McGill to bar Jamal from continuing to question prospective jurors, on the ground that he was taking too long and making them uncomfortable.</P>

<P>But this smacked of pretext. The Inquirer wrote at the time that Jamal "was intent and businesslike" and "subdued" in voir dire. While some jurors were apparently upset by Jamal's dreadlocks, beard, and questions about their home life, Sabo's claim (in findings of fact after this summer's hearing) that he was "belligerent" during voir dire rings false.</P>

<P>Prosecutor McGill used peremptory challenges to strike 11 of the 14 blacks in the eligible jury pool. By the time testimony began, the black militant defendant, charged with the highly publicized murder of a white policeman, in a then-40 percent black city, faced -- as a result of a probably unconstitutional voir dire -- a jury of two blacks and ten whites, including a friend of another officer shot in the line of duty.</P>

<P>After being unjustly barred by Sabo from representing himself at voir dire, Jamal made things worse for himself by insisting over and over again, throughout the rest of the trial, that MOVE founder John Africa be allowed to sit at the defense table and counsel him. Sabo rejected any such arrangement because Africa was not a lawyer. But Jamal refused to accept the finality of Sabo's rulings. Instead, he repeatedly complained in front of the jury that he was being "gagged" and deprived of his right to represent himself, and did not want or trust Jackson or any "any legal-trained lawyer."</P>

<P>These disruptions led Sabo to bar Jamal from examining witnesses or otherwise representing himself at any stage of the trial, and to expel him from the courtroom -- with such comments as "take a walk" -- each time Jamal misbehaved.</P>

<P>Jackson, meanwhile, was suddenly thrust unprepared into the arena, whipsawed between an unmanageable client -- who, Jackson told Sabo, "has no faith in anything I say" -- and a judge who would neither let Jackson withdraw nor give him a break. With Sabo rushing the trial through three consecutive Saturdays, Jackson recalled in an affidavit this year, "I was kept busy each evening feverishly reviewing over 100 police interviews" and other materials, "with little or no time for witness preparation or the defense case."</P>

<P>Under these difficult circumstances, Jackson blew it. For example, he did not interview either of the defense eyewitnesses, Dessie Hightower and Veronica Jones, before the trial. And Jones gave Jackson a nasty surprise when she took the stand: She flatly disavowed her December 15, 1981, statement to police that she had seen "two black guys . . . sort of jogging" after the shootings.</P>

<P>Sabo compounded Jackson's difficulties by issuing a string of pro-prosecution rulings on key issues throughout the trial. The most prejudicial precluded a belated bid by Jackson to put on the best evidence that Jamal's confession was a fabrication: Officer Gary Wakshul's report the morning of the shootings that Jamal had "made no comments" while at the hospital.</P>

<P>Jackson swore at this summer's hearing that he had simply forgotten to subpoena Wakshul or give the prosecution timely notice that he wanted him to testify. Although this may well have been ineffective assistance of counsel, it does not excuse the responses of prosecutor McGill and Judge Sabo on July 1, 1982, when Jackson sought a brief continuance to summon Wakshul.</P>

<P>McGill strenuously objected, saying, "He is not around." Judge Sabo, scanning the December 9, 1981, Wakshul statement, preposterously suggested that it was consistent with the trial testimony that Jamal had defiantly shouted out a confession at the hospital. Sabo also conjectured -- with remarkable clairvoyance -- that Wakshul "could be on vacation." McGill checked, and reported back that, in fact, "he is on vacation until July 8."</P>

<P>Jackson asked whether this meant Wakshul was "not in the city." McGill did not answer. Instead, Judge Sabo cut in: "I am not going to go looking for anybody now." When Jamal complained that this was a crucial witness, the judge snapped, "Your attorney and you goofed." Jamal responded: "You are trying to hide the truth."</P>

<P>Ironically, at this summer's hearing Wakshul recalled that he had spent most of that 1982 vacation at home, leaving town only after "I believed the testimony was over."</P>

<P>A bit later on the same day (July 1, 1982) that Sabo spurned Jamal's pleas to call Wakshul, Jamal elected not to testify in his own defense, explaining to the court: "The right to represent myself, the right to select a jury of my peers, the right to face witnesses and examine them . . . were taken from me. It seems the only right that this judge [wants] to confer is my right to take the stand, which is no right at all. I want all of my rights, not some of them . . . because my life is on the line."</P>

<P>The Wakshul episode was not the only instance of sharp practice by prosecutor McGill at the trial. He also sponsored possibly perjured testimony by witnesses including Durham, Bell, Chobert, and White. And in his summation, McGill improperly vouched for Chobert's testimony, misleadingly suggested that Chobert had no reason to tailor his account to the prosecution's liking, and contended that Jamal's vociferous insistence on his right to represent himself showed a "vicious . . . frame of mind."</P>

<P>(McGill rejects these criticisms as "absolutely wrong," and notes that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejected all of Jamal's attacks in a 1989 decision.)</P>

<P>Jackson's closing was feeble -- especially his lame statement to the jury that "you have heard all of the evidence," which was very far from being the case. Jackson also urged the jury (perhaps at Jamal's insistence) not to "compromise this verdict," and either to convict Jamal of first-degree murder or acquit him of any role in Faulkner's death.</P>

<P>The jury got the case at noon on July 2. After asking at one point to be reinstructed on the law of first- and third-degree murder and manslaughter, the jury returned its first-degree conviction at about 5 p.m.</P>

<P><b>An Unconstitutional Sentence</b><br>

If Jamal's trial was unfair, his sentencing proceeding was a travesty. It was pushed through by Judge Sabo in less than three hours on the Saturday of the July 4 weekend, the morning after the conviction. And it was riddled with constitutional flaws including ineffective assistance of counsel, improper cross- examination and argument by prosecutor McGill, and inadequate instructions of law by Sabo.</P>

<P>Jackson says he did no preparation for the sentencing proceeding, gave no thought to the "available tactical approaches," and had only a perfunctory meeting with Jamal, at which he neither consulted with his bitterly estranged client on what to do nor looked at the statement that Jamal was about to read to the jury.</P>

<P>The best hope for persuading the jury that Jamal did not deserve to die was to establish the mitigating circumstance of good character, through testimony by some of his many friends and admirers -- journalists, politicians, and others. Yet Jackson did not call a single witness in the sentencing phase. (Jackson had called 15 character witnesses during the guilt phase. They testified briefly that Jamal was a peaceful and law-abiding man. But the rules would have allowed for far more detailed accolades at sentencing.)</P>

<P>Jackson's closing argument at sentencing was pathetic. He wasted time and credibility, for instance, quibbling with the prosecution's unassailable claim that Faulkner was a "peace officer" within the meaning of the statutory list of aggravating circumstances on the verdict form.</P>

<P>Jamal's own uncounseled and ill-advised statement to the jury made a disastrous situation worse. His assertion that "I am innocent despite what you 12 people think" was lost amid his attacks on the judge ("black-robed conspirator"), the prosecutor, and the defense lawyer ("this worthless sellout and shyster"), and his denigration of the jury. "Had he been actively seeking the death penalty, some have said, he could hardly have done a better job," Marc Kaufman wrote in the Inquirer after the trial.</P>

<P>But if Jamal helped dig his own grave, he was shoved into it by the police, the prosecutor, the judge, and the ineffective defense lawyer, in gross violation of the Constitution. And if Jamal seems a paranoid wacko when one first reads his rantings about a corrupt and dishonest system, a closer look suggests that maybe the system proved him right.</P>

<P>McGill -- in his cross-examination of Jamal at the sentencing -- made inflammatory use of political pronouncements Jamal had made as a Black Panther 12 years before, when he was 15 years old. McGill read from a 1970 newspaper clipping in which Jamal was quoted saying, "All power to the people," and asserting that blacks "are facing the reality that the Black Panther Party has been facing: Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." McGill implied that these statements and Jamal's courtroom behavior showed that Jamal deserved to die.</P>

<P>"I saw it," said Jamal in a recent interview. "When [the name Black Panther] hit the jury, it was like a bolt of electricity -- pow."</P>

<P>This alone should require reversal of Jamal's sentence both under long-established First Amendment and death penalty case law, and under the logic of the Supreme Court's 8-to-1 decision in Dawson v. Delaware, in 1992. It held that a prosecutor violated the First Amendment in a death sentencing proceeding when he stressed the defendant's membership in a white racist prison gang called the Aryan Brotherhood. A defendant's "abstract beliefs," the Court held, could not be used to argue for a death sentence unless relevant to "the issue being tried."</P>

<P>McGill misleadingly suggested in his closing argument that the Jamal quotation showed that "this is not something that happened overnight" -- implying that Jamal had been looking for a chance to kill a cop -- and stressed that "one thing that cannot be tolerated is constant abuse of authority, defiance of authority, and daily law-breaking."</P>

<P>Daily law-breaking? For all his revolutionary rhetoric, the 27- year-old Jamal had a spotless criminal record. And "abuse of authority" is not supposed to be a capital offense in this country. (The Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 1989 unpersuasively upheld McGill's use of Jamal's political statements as showing his "long-standing disdain for the system.")</P>

<P>McGill also sought to minimize the jury's sense of responsibility by arguing, among other things, that the jurors could bring in a verdict of death without worrying too much about Jamal's being executed: He would have "appeal after appeal after appeal," and any verdict for death would not be final.</P>

<P>In my view, this violates several U.S. Supreme Court cases and a 1986 Pennsylvania Supreme Court precedent, which had struck down a man's death sentence because of nearly identical comments to the jury by the same Joseph McGill. (The Pennsylvania court, straining to distinguish these precedents, rejected Jamal's appeal on this point too.)</P>

<P>Judge Sabo's instructions of law to the jury were also constitutionally flawed in at least two respects: Sabo made no explicit mention of the jury's obligation to consider any evidence of overall good character as a mitigating circumstance. He also used a standard Pennsylvania verdict form that appears to violate principles later detailed in the 1988 Supreme Court decision in Mills v. Maryland, by leaving the false implication that unanimity might be required to find any such mitigating circumstance.</P>

<P><b>Celebrity on Death Row</b><br>

After his 1982 trial, Jamal, like most death row inmates, largely disappeared from view. But by 1989 -- when his less-than-well- crafted direct appeal was spurned by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court -- the seeds were being planted for his remarkable rise to global celebrity. He has since emerged as the nation's premier anti-death penalty poster boy, and as a rallying point for what remains of the radical left.</P>

<P>In the late 1980s, Jamal's MOVE supporters brought his cause to the attention of the far left, New York-based Partisan Defense Committee, which portrayed Jamal as a political prisoner and began organizing protests around the country and in Europe. Jamal's cause was also taken up by other leftist groups, death penalty opponents, and black politicians.</P>

<P>Leonard Weinglass, a seasoned 62-year-old trial lawyer with a long list of leftist causes and criminals on his resume, was recruited by Jamal's family and friends and took over as lead counsel in early 1992. Weinglass has represented three defendants in the 1969-1970 Chicago Seven conspiracy trial as well as Angela Davis, Jane Fonda, Kathy Boudin, and various protesters, accused bombers, and killers. Working with Weinglass are his protege Daniel Williams, of New York's Moore & Williams; PDC staff counsel Rachel Wolkenstein; and Jonathan Piper, a 35-year-old associate at Chicago's Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal. Piper and others at his firm have put in thousands of pro bono hours on the case.</P>

<P>While his legal team was preparing for post-conviction appeals, Jamal was writing dozens of essays about prison life and the criminal justice system. He was published in the Yale Law Journal (in 1991), the Nation magazine, and elsewhere, and he taped radio broadcasts that were aired in New York, San Francisco, Canada, Cuba, England, France, Germany, and Australia. Addison-Wesley Publishing Co. collected many of these commentaries this spring in Jamal's book, Live from Death Row, which has been a commercial success.</P>

<P><b>The Sabo Circus: Part II</b><br>

National and international media attention on Jamal's case reached a crescendo this summer, after Pennsylvania governor Thomas Ridge signed a death warrant on June 1, scheduling Jamal's execution for the week of August 13. Jamal's legal team filed his first state petition for post-conviction relief, as well as related motions for discovery, a stay of execution, and recusal of Judge Sabo -- some 300 pages in all -- on June 5.</P>

<P>Under Pennsylvania procedure, Judge Sabo had the option of presiding over the post-conviction proceeding, much of which consisted of attacks on his own conduct at the 1982 trial. Although semiretired, he seized the case with relish, summarily spurning contentions that he should recuse himself because of what Jamal's lawyers called his bias at Jamal's trial, his general bias against African-American capital defendants, and "his inability to endow this proceeding with . . . the appearance of fairness and impartiality."</P>

<P>This last accusation proved an understatement. Throughout the internationally scrutinized post-conviction hearing, which ran from July 26 to August 15, and the closing arguments on September 11, Judge Sabo flaunted his bias, oozing partiality toward the prosecution and crudely seeking to bully Weinglass, whose courtroom conduct was as correct as Sabo's was crass.</P>

<P>Sabo denied all of Jamal's discovery requests and quashed over 25 subpoenas, many of which sought evidence that Sabo had barred the lawyers from exploring through discovery or other witnesses. He sharply restricted Jamal's lawyers in their questioning of witnesses, and blocked them from making offers of proof on the record to show the import of the precluded testimony. In a letter to Sabo, Weinglass complained that the judge's conduct "raises the troubling spectre of attempting to defeat judicial review."</P>

<P>Sabo also hurled two unwarranted contempt-of-court citations at Jamal's lawyers. On August 2 he ordered Rachel Wolkenstein handcuffed and arrested for repeatedly seeking to explain for the record the relevance of two witnesses whose subpoenas Sabo had quashed. And on August 11 Sabo fined Leonard Weinglass $1,000 for failing to hand over some photographic slides quickly enough.</P>

<P>"We were in some kind of a game where, when we complied with a request or a ruling, the rules changed," recalls Weinglass, adding that Sabo and the late judge Julius Hoffman of Chicago Seven fame are the only two judges who have held him in contempt. Asked to compare the two, Weinglass responds: "Judge Hoffman had a lot more finesse and a good sense of humor. Judge Sabo is just a blunderbuss of bias."</P>

<P>Jamal's lawyers did not hit any home runs at the hearing, and had some setbacks. Their new witnesses -- including William Singletary and Arnold Howard -- were less than credible. But they did succeed in doggedly piling up a record that, when scrutinized in detail, establishes the unfairness of Jamal's trial and sentencing; casts a dark shadow over the integrity of the system that put him on death row; raises substantial doubt about whether this was a first-degree murder; and leaves a lingering question whether Jamal killed Faulkner at all.</P>

<P>Sabo rejected Jamal's petition on September 15, four days after receiving the parties' post-hearing briefs and hearing their closing arguments. Much of his 154-page opinion was lifted verbatim from the prosecution's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Jamal's lawyers have appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. If they lose there, they will seek federal habeas corpus review.</P>

<P><b>What Should Be Done</b><br>
A careful appraisal of the facts, and a scrupulous application of the constitutional precedents, would lead a reviewing court to reverse both Jamal's sentence and his conviction, and to grant him a new trial. (That's not a prediction.)</P>

<P>But while I have no doubt that Jamal's death sentence should be reversed, I initially hesitated to call for a new trial, and I suspect that judges might hesitate as well.</P>

<P>The reason (which no judge would admit) is this: Big-city juries can no longer be counted on to convict -- even when the defendant is clearly a vicious murderer -- in racially charged cases poisoned by police misconduct. See, for example, People v. Orenthal James Simpson. So a new trial for Jamal might very well mean an acquittal.</P>

<P>And the evidence that Jamal shot Faulkner -- and probably fired the fatal shot -- remains very strong, even if, as I believe, both of Jamal's "confessions" were fabrications, and the police and prosecutors cannot be trusted, and the eyewitness testimony was unreliable, and someone ran away from the scene, perhaps after shooting Faulkner at least once.</P>

<P>Is it clear beyond a reasonable doubt that Jamal killed Faulkner? I lean toward that conclusion, but with some ambivalence. I still have a nagging little question about whether the real killer may have gotten away. And the evidence that tips me toward finding Jamal guilty beyond a reasonable doubt is supposed to be irrelevant (under Fifth Amendment case law), and would be inadmissible at any retrial.</P>

<P>That evidence is the 14-year-long silence of both Jamal and his brother, William Cook, about what happened. Neither of them has ever said how Faulkner was killed, or even denied explicitly that Jamal killed him. Not on the day of the murder. Not at Jamal's trial. And not during the 14 years since.</P>

<P>The most Jamal has ever said about the murder was his statement to the jury during the sentencing phase that "I am innocent of these charges."</P>

<P>What's that supposed to mean? Jamal's lawyers say it means Jamal didn't shoot Faulkner. I'm not so sure. This is a man who chooses words with care. If he were truly innocent, wouldn't he have found at least one occasion, in the 5,000 days since Faulkner's death, publicly to say something like "I didn't shoot him"? And to explain who did?</P>

<P>Jamal will not answer such questions. Although he has granted some interviews, he declined my request for one, through his lawyers, after I refused to agree to their condition that I promise in advance not to ask Jamal anything about what happened the morning of Faulkner's death.</P>

<P>The silence of Jamal and Cook leaves me convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Jamal shot Faulkner at least once, and comes very close to convincing me that he fired the fatal shot. Still, there is good reason to believe that if Jamal did fire the fatal shot, he acted with a mental state somewhere on the spectrum of culpability between manslaughter and classic first-degree murder, because he resorted to deadly force only after seeing Faulkner beating Cook bloody, and probably only after being shot by Faulkner.</P>

<P>And for doing that -- in the interval of a few seconds that crashed without warning into what had for 27 years been a largely admirable life -- the appropriate penalty is less than death, and less than life without parole. The maximum penalty for manslaughter in Pennsylvania in 1981 was ten years, with parole eligibility after five. I'm not sure that this was a mere manslaughter, and I'm not sure that the 14 years Jamal has already spent behind bars -- mostly in the hell-on-earth called death row -- is punishment enough. But it's close.</P>

<P>And that is reason enough to put aside any qualms about the possibility that granting Jamal the appropriate legal relief might lead to his walking free. He deserves a new trial, and he should get one.</P>

In this three-day hearing, lawyers argued over what evidence the prosecution must turn over to the defense. Prosecutors are obliged to provide the defendants any evidence they consider using in a trial as well as any information that might help the defense side. Defendant Timothy McVeigh's attorney, Stephen Jones, asked for details on negotiations between authorities and Michael Fortier, a former associate of McVeigh's who is expected to testify for the government in exchange for a plea agreement. Jones contended that Fortier changed his story as part of deal to avoid trial. The hearing is divided into five parts for easy viewing.

On Oct. 25, 1996, U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch ordered separate trials for Oklahoma City bombing defendants Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. Judge Matsch singled out statements that Nichols made to FBI agents when he was arrested two days after the April 19, 1995, bombing as a reason for the need to have separate trials. "There can be no effective separation of Terry Nichols' explanations for his conduct from what he reportedly said Timothy McVeigh told him," he wrote.</P>

<P><A HREF="/casefiles/oklahoma/documents/deathpen.html">Judge's Ruling Clears Way for Prosecutors to Seek Death Penalty</A><BR>
Chief Judge Richard Matsch, presiding over the Oklahoma City bombing trial, cleared the way for the United States to seek the death penalty against defendants Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. The court denied defense motions requesting that prosecutors be enjoined from asking for the death penalty because the Department of Justice did not follow proper protocol for deciding to seek death, and because of other procedurual problems. This is the September 25, 1996 ruling.</P>

<P><A HREF="/casefiles/oklahoma/documents/severtx.html">Brief Opposing Separate Trials for McVeigh and Nichols</A><BR>
Federal prosecutors are opposing Oklahoma City bombing defendants Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols' motions for separate trials. In this brief filed September 25, 1996, portions which are blacked out per the court's order not to disclose evidence, the prosecution argues that a joint trial will cause less disruption for the victims' families and hundreds of witnesses, and will be the best way to efficiently administer the trial.</P>

<P><A HREF="/casefiles/oklahoma/documents/mcsever.html">McVeigh Brief Seeking Separate Trials</A><BR>
Oklahoma bombing suspect Timothy McVeigh is seeking a separate trial from codefendant, Terry Nichols. In this brief filed September 4, 1996, some of which is blacked out per the court's order not to reveal discovery material, McVeigh contends that nine hours of statements Nichols made to to the FBI before he was arrested will be improperly considered by a jury against McVeigh. (Judge Matsch ruled earlier this year that the statements are only admissible against Nichols.) McVeigh also claims that he and Nichols will have antagonistic defenses, and that their Eighth Amendment right to individual sentencing, would be violated by a joint proceeding.</P>

<P><A HREF="/casefiles/oklahoma/documents/usmctx.html">Nichols Brief Seeking Separate Trials</A><BR>
Oklahoma City bombing defendant Terry Nichols is arguing that his trial should be separated from that of his codefendant, Timothy McVeigh. In this brief filed September 5, 1996, portions of which are blacked out per the court's order not to reveal evidence, Nichols contends that he and McVeigh have antagonistic defenses -- to prove their innocence, each one must blame the other -- so trying them together will aid the prosecution. Nichols also proffers a novel argument: The jury in this death penalty trial will not be able to distinguish his case from McVeigh's, thus violating their 8th Amendment right to individualized sentencing.</P>

<P><A HREF="/casefiles/oklahoma/documents/timmedia.html">McVeigh Motion for Access to the Media</A><BR>
The attorneys for Timothy McVeigh have petitioned the Court to allow McVeigh greater access to the media --  "reasonable access to members of the local, Oklahoma, national, and European media as specified herein, including the opportunity to participate in one videotaped interview with either Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer, Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather, Susan Candiotti or Jack Bowen, and a videotaped interview with the BBC-TV.<P>

<P><A HREF="/casefiles/oklahoma/documents/nicagree.html">Prosecutors Say Nichols Orally Agreed to FBI Interview</A><BR>
This brief was put into evidence by the prosecution during hearings in July, 1996, concerning suppression of evidence in the Oklahoma City bombing trial. In 1992, Terry Nichols was being sued by his bank in Michigan for non-payment of a debt. He filed this motion challenging the court's jurisdiction. In the Oklahoma City case, prosecutors used the brief to argue that Nichols was fully cognizant of his rights when he orally agreed to speak with the FBI without an attorney present.

<P><A HREF="/casefiles/oklahoma/documents/nicphone.html">FBI Phone Calls from Nichols' Home</A><BR>
Terry Nichols' attorneys have been trying to have Chief Judge Richard Matsch throw out key evidence obtained by the FBI thrown out of court. As part of their motions, the Nichols' legal team alleged that phone records from Nichols' house show calls being made at a time when Nichols was at the local police station. In this brief Nichols' lawyers contend that the FBI was in the house and using the phone during a time when they did not have a search warrant. In an Aug. 14 ruling Matsch denied Nichols' motions to suppress evidence. However, Matsch reserved ruling on this specific matter until trial.<P>

Defense lawyers had asked for  the evidence to be excluded from trial, claiming that a warrant was not used during the search.

<P><A HREF="/casefiles/oklahoma/documents/govcirc.html">Closed-Circuit TV Brief</A><BR>
In this May 1, 1996 brief, the government asks that closed-circuit television be set up for Oklahoma City bombing victims and their family members. Lawyers argue that the Anti-Terrorism Act requires the closed-circuit televising of trial proceedings when the venue has been changed to a distant location to enable victims to view the trial.</P>

<P><A HREF="/casefiles/oklahoma/documents/circtv2.html">Defense's Reply to Closed-Circuit TV</A><BR>
In this June 24, 1996 reply and supplemental memo, defense lawyers argue against closed-circuit TV for victims and their families. They say the section of the Anti-Terrorism Act that provides for closed-circuit television is unconstitutional because it violates the separation of powers doctrine and it denies Timothy McVeigh equal protection under the laws. They also express concern over how to keep the signal secure as it is transmitted from Denver to Oklahoma City.</P>

<P><A HREF="/casefiles/oklahoma/documents/hearing4.html">June 28 Hearing</A><BR>
In this pre-trial hearing, Marife Nichols, the Philippine-born wife of Oklahoma City bombing suspect Terry Nichols, said she is unfamiliar with U.S. customs and was "confused" shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing when the FBI questioned her in a windowless room for nearly six hours. She told the court she felt that she had no choice but to sign consent forms allowing authorities to search her home and a truck. Defense lawyers want evidence obtained in this search thrown out, claiming it was obtained through coercion.</P>

<H2>Bombing Trial's New Look, Issues</H2><P>

By Robert Schmidt <BR>
<I>Legal Times</I><BR>
November 4, 1996 <P>

One of the biggest federal trials ever staged suddenly has been transformed into two of the biggest trials ever. <P>

And as the Oklahoma City bombing case moves forward, that transformation not only has implications for each side's legal strategy, but also will touch witnesses, the crime victims and their families, and U.S. taxpayers. <P>

Most notably, Chief Judge Richard Matsch's surprising Oct. 25 decision to sever the trials of accused bombers Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols appears to be a setback for the prosecution. <P>

The government had argued that the two former Army buddies who were charged together should be tried together. And although prosecutors downplay the ruling's significance and say they are eager to get their evidence before a jury, they now face the challenge of planning and carrying out two highly charged, sensational trials instead of just one. <P>

Moreover, the government must prove that the two men were engaged in a conspiracy to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building -- without the prospect of both alleged conspirators sitting next to each other in the courtroom. <P>

Defense lawyers for McVeigh and Nichols proclaimed the severance ruling a victory, saying that separate trials will force the prosecution to try each case on its merits, rather than allowing the government to paint the defendants with a broad brush ofguilt. <P>

"This, at least in theory, sets the stage for a fair trial," says Stephen Jones, Timothy McVeigh's lead counsel. <P>

Jones adds that he is quite pleased with the outcome of his pretrial wrangling with the prosecution, in which he prevailed not only on the severance issue but also on bids to get the case heard by a judge not from Oklahoma and to move the trial out of state. <P>

Still, prosecutors appear upbeat and confident of their ability to win convictions against McVeigh, who is alleged to have actually carried out the bombing in Oklahoma City, and Nichols, a Kansas farmer alleged to have helped plan the bombing. The April 19, 1995, blast resulted in 168 deaths and more than 500 injured. <P>

"Nothing affects the admissibility of evidence in the severance ruling," says prosecution team member Larry Mackey, special attorney to the U.S. attorney general. <P>

"We were not looking for any strategic advantage [in arguing for a joint trial]," Mackey offers, "but looking, hopefully, to the advantages that would flow to the victims, the witnesses, and the judicial system that would reap the benefits of earlier closure." <P>

While most observers agree that Matsch's decision can be seen as a boost to the defense, experts caution that its costs and benefits are not as clear-cut as they may seem. <P>

The prosecution, for example, derives a potentially huge hidden benefit from the ruling, in that it eliminates the defendants' most significant appealable issue-the claim that a joint trial violated their constitutional rights. <P>

And while it seems that Nichols, who will be tried second, appears to be in the better position, his defense team will have to sit mum as the judge makes evidentiary rulings in the first trial that will likely affect Nichols' trial, too. <P>

As the pretrial hearing schedule in U.S. District Court in Denver winds down (the pretrial hearings will continue to be tried together) and the lawyers prepare to litigate United States v. Timothy James McVeigh, experts say that subtleties such as these will keep all three legal teams busy. <P>

Among the questions the three sides need to consider, say a number of law professors and litigators, are: Will McVeigh have to worry that prosecutors will cut a deal with Nichols in exchange for his testimony? Will the government hold back on some of its evidence so that Nichols' counsel, watching the first trial, won't have a clear map of the prosecution? Will the jury pool be so tainted by publicity by the time Nichols' case begins that his lawyers will move for another change of venue? <P>

"It has got to change the strategies of everybody involved," observes defense attorney Henry Asbill of D.C.'s Asbill, Junkin & Moffitt, who adds that the ruling bodes well for McVeigh and Nichols. "This decision to give separate trials, coupled with the fairness and length of the jury selection process, are the two keys to winning this case." <P>

One clear effect of Matsch's severance ruling is that it goes a long way toward helping McVeigh secure a fair trial, say outside experts, as well as his own attorneys. <P>

Because of the severance, the jury in McVeigh's case will not hear the nine hours of statements Nichols made to agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shortly before he was arrested; those statements are said to pin much of the blame for the blast on McVeigh. (The complete statements are sealed, as is much of the evidence in the case, under the judge's order not to disclose sensitive discovery material.) <P>

Although the statements previously were ruled inadmissible against McVeigh, Judge Matsch feared that a jury in a single trial would be unable to consider them only against Nichols. <P>

"[T]here is an unacceptable risk that the jury will use Terry Nichols' extrajudicial statements against Timothy McVeigh," Matsch wrote in his 20-page order. "Timothy McVeigh will be profoundly prejudiced by a joint trial of this case." <P>

POTENTIAL PREJUDICE <BR>
Indeed, Matsch based his ruling largely on the potential prejudice to McVeigh from Nichols' statements, which he said could violate McVeigh's Sixth Amendment right to cross-examination and his Fifth Amendment right to due process. The statements reportedly mentioned McVeigh's name more than 60 times, but because Nichols cannot be compelled to testify, McVeigh's attorneys would be powerless to punch holes in the highly incriminating statements. <P>

The judge in his opinion also gave credence to the defense lawyers' arguments that the two defendants had antagonistic defenses. While the defenses were not mutually exclusive, Matsch noted that "there will be substantial and significant differences in the tactical approaches taken by their respective counsel." <P>

In fact, by separating the trials, Matsch removed the potential for much acrimony inside his courtroom. Both Jones and Nichols' lawyer, Michael Tigar, indicated in their severance briefs that their clients were poised to blame each other for the crime.Even if they continue this strategy of finger-pointing, it will now be more muted. <P>

"Severance changes the whole dynamic of the trial because there won't be quite the same finger-pointing and falling out amongst the attorneys for McVeigh and Nichols, at least not in front of the jury," observes Paul Rothstein, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center who teaches criminal procedure. "Fighting and refuting each other makes them both look noncredible" to the jury, Rothstein notes. <P>

The ruling should also make each trial quicker than a joint proceeding would have been. There will only be one cross-examination of each witness and one defense case, and the prosecution will be able to pare down its case by focusing on one defendant. <P>

"[Severance] streamlines the case," says Professor Stephen Saltzburg of the George Washington University Law School. "You don't need to worry about two defense lawyers trying to weaken the case. It's now a straightforward U.S. v. McVeigh." <P>

Just how the prosecution pares down its case could be a crucial tactical move, experts say. Because the severance has in effect given Nichols full discovery through watching the McVeigh trial, prosecutors may try to hold back evidence that does incriminate McVeigh, but is more important to the case against Nichols. <P>

Such a move could help counter the advantage the Nichols defense gets by being able to see how the judge and jury react to certain arguments, as well as seeing how witnesses come across on the stand. <P>

"[The prosecutors] have to be very cautious to walk a fine line and seek to admit into evidence only that evidence they need to convict McVeigh, and nothing more," says D.C. defense lawyer Asbill. "They don't want to give Nichols any more of a preview of the case than is necessary." <P>

The prosecution, however, points out that, by trying McVeigh first, it too will learn what works and what doesn't.  <P>

"The truth of the matter is that we're watching the same preview as well," says Mackey, the prosecutor. <P>

'ELEMENT OF SURPRISE' <BR>
Instead of watching a preview, McVeigh is the preview. And his lawyer contends that this actually gives him the upper hand.  <P>

"I would much prefer to go first; we have the element of surprise," says Jones. "Number two, the government would be trying the case for the first time, and [won't be able] to recoup from mistakes that might or will be made."  <P>

Some observers, however, point out one significant disadvantage to the McVeigh team stemming from its position in the starting gate: the possibility of a Nichols plea bargain. <P>

"One thing about a separation like this is it puts some distance between the two defendants," says Saltzburg of George Washington. "[Nichols] now has this card of 'I could save you a second trial,' and if you combine that with 'I can save you a second trial and I can testify in the first trial'-that can be the single most valuable thing he can trade." <P>

Prosecutors decline comment on the possibility of plea discussions. Ronald Woods, an appointed counsel for Nichols, dismisses the idea. <P>

"The option of a plea has never arisen and so it's not something we're considering," says Woods. <P>

Of much more concern to Nichols' lawyers now is how McVeigh's trial will affect their client-particularly if it will be possible to find a jury untainted by the media attention. (The trial will not be televised.) <P>

"Based on what happens in the trial and based on whether we feel we can get a fair and impartial jury, we may be forced to file a motion for a change of venue," says Woods. "It depends on what happens. The government's case against Nichols is very weak, and it may show during that trial how weak, so we might not need a change." <P>

Of course, two faster trials will likely still take more time than one single trial. The added expense to taxpayers will be considerable: Hundreds of expected witnesses, many on the government payroll, must testify twice. The government is also paying for McVeigh's and Nichols' defenses.  <P>

Then there is the human cost. More than 2,000 victims and family members are looking for the trial to bring them closure. <P>

"I'm a little bit disappointed because of the enormous expense and the inconvenience to witnesses and victims of doing this trial twice," says William Pizzi, a professor of law at University of Colorado School of Law who teaches criminal procedure. "I'm not criticizing [Matsch's] decision, I just feel this is a weakness in our system." <P>

At first, many of the crime victims and family members were also disappointed in the severance ruling, says Paul Heath, president of the OK City Murrah Building Survivors Association. Heath notes, however, that prosecutors have since met with the victims in Oklahoma City and calmed some of their concerns. <P>

"The prosecution has assured us that the trials won't be much longer than if they have them together," says Heath. "Most everybody is willing to accept severance because there will be less chance of an appeal." <P>

<H2>No Media Blitz for McVeigh</H2>



By Robert Schmidt <BR>

<I>Legal Times</I><BR>

October 7, 1996 <P>



DENVER--Accused Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh will not be going on a media blitz before his trial. <P>



Chief U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch, ruling from the bench on Oct. 4, denied McVeigh's motion to be allowed to conduct a series of interviews with hand-picked television and print reporters. <P>



Matsch avoided First Amendment questions in his ruling, finding that the interviews would violate a protective order he issued in June that prohibits discussing evidence in the case. McVeigh's interviews, the judge said, would constitute potential character evidence.  <P>



"It is an inappropriate pretrial dissemination of evidence," Matsch said. "The denial of this motion is consistent with the jurisdiction [of the court]." <P>



Matsch noted that McVeigh still has access to reporters by mail and telephone. Prosecutor Joseph Hartzler said in court that McVeigh has reporters on his telephone list. <P>



"I am reassured that Mr. McVeigh and [co-defendant Terry] Nichols are not being held incommunicado," Matsch said.  <P>



Media groups are expected to appeal the ruling. Last week, ABC, CBS, and NBC filed an amicus brief in support of McVeigh. Matsch refused to give permission to the media organizations' attorney, Floyd Abrams of New York's Cahill Gordon & Reindel, to argue in court. <P>



McVeigh's attorney, Stephen Jones, had wanted to use the interviews to counter what he called the "demonization" of McVeigh by the media. Because McVeigh is a pretrial detainee, federal law requires him to get permission from the court before giving interviews. <P>



Prosecutors argued against the motion, claiming that it would be tantamount to allowing McVeigh to produce "an infomercial." <P>



Hartzler, a special attorney to the U.S. attorney general, told the court that McVeigh could use the voir dire process to counter pretrial publicity. Nichols also opposed the motion.  <P>



Arguing in support of his motion, Jones lashed out at some of the victims organizations that have been very public in their criticism of McVeigh. In widely disseminated comments, victims and family members have told reporters outside the courthouse that they want to "claw his eyes out" or kill him themselves. <P>



"There is an organized public effort to use every vehicle in the media to convict my client before a jury has been empanelled," Jones said. He also told Matsch that he wished the protective order could be extended to victims and their associations. <P>



Outside the courtroom, victims and their family members hailed the judge's ruling and sharply criticized Jones. <P>



"I know who blew up the building and it was not me, it was not the survivors association, and it was not the families," said Paul Heath, president of the OK City Murrah Building Survivors Association. "If you participate in a crime, you give up the opportunity to participate in a media circus." <P>

<H2>Bomb Defendants Want Separate Trials Severance Payoff</H2><P><P>

By Robert Schmidt <BR>
<I>Legal Times</I><BR>
September 30, 1996<P>

With the start of the Oklahoma City bombing trial still months away, prosecutors are facing their most serious challenge to date as they try to fend off the defendants' push for separate trials. <P>

Defense lawyers -- apparently sensing that severance may be their best chance to win acquittals for accused bombers Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols -- are treating the motions like the capstone of their cases. <P>

Nichols is fighting the hardest for a separate trial. The 41-year-old Kansan wasn't in Oklahoma City the day of the blast, and his lawyers are concerned that he could be tarred by the greater notoriety of his co-defendant. <P>

McVeigh, for his part, is worried that nine hours of statements Nichols made to the FBI could unfairly prejudice the jury against McVeigh, even though they are inadmissible against him. <P>

Because of these divergent interests, and because each man's life is at stake, animosity has erupted between the two former Army buddies. <P>

RULING NOT PREDICTABLE <BR>
Chief U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch is not taking the issue lightly either. He has scheduled oral arguments on the severance issue starting Oct. 2 and will rule sometime after that.  <P>

In making this potentially pivotal decision, Matsch does not have to fully grant or deny the severance motions. Some courtroom observers say Matsch might solve the trickiest problem -- Nichols' statements to the FBI--by empaneling two juries to hear the case, one of which would step out during that part of the testimony. Another possible scenario: Matsch could order separate penalty phases for the defendants if they are convicted. The judge could sever any time during a joint trial as well. <P>

The filing of severance motions by defense lawyers -- and their subsequent denial -- has become almost perfunctory in multidefendant criminal trials. Attorneys often believe that a separate trial makes it easier for any given defendant to blame, and distance himself from, the others. <P>

But the bombing case is not an ordinary prosecution, and experts say Matsch's decision could go either way.  <P>

"There is a 50-50 chance that the judge may say, 'We're going to have separate trials,' " says former Colorado state court judge Frank Jamison. "This will be the most significant decision in all the pretrial motions." <P>

The defense lawyers are certainly treating it as such. In early September, McVeigh's lead attorney, Stephen Jones, and Nichols' counsel, Michael Tigar, each filed 100-plus-page motions arguing for severance. (Significant parts of the briefs were filed under seal, per the court's order not to disclose sensitive discovery material.) <P>

"It is the only way to get a fair trial," Jones said in an interview. "As a practical matter, if there is no severance there is a substantial likelihood of Mr. McVeigh's conviction." <P>

Some criminal procedure scholars say Jones is not overstating his case. "The single most important thing a defendant can do in a conspiracy case is get severance," says Ira Robbins, a professor at American University's Washington College of Law. <P>

But McVeigh and Nichols have an uphill battle to win separate trials. <P>

The U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, which includes Denver, prefer that defendants charged with the same crime be tried together, since that route is more efficient and prevents the problem of inconsistent verdicts. <P>

Experts agree that under the relevant case law, district courts grant severance only when there is a "serious risk" that a joint trial will compromise the rights of one of the defendants or will prevent the jury from making a reliable decision about guilt or innocence. <P>

But a number of criminal procedure experts say that the facts in the bombing case may satisfy the criteria set forth for severance, and that a joint trial for McVeigh and Nichols would be rife with constitutional pitfalls. <P>

For instance, Nichols' statements to the FBI, which have been ruled as inadmissible against McVeigh, contain 67 mentions of McVeigh and will likely be highly prejudicial. Some of that will probably seep into the court record, but McVeigh's attorneys cannot cross-examine Nichols (except in the unlikely event that Nichols testifies). This could compromise McVeigh's Sixth Amendment right to cross-examination, as well as his Fifth Amendment right to due process. <P>

FINGER-POINTING STRATEGIES<BR>
Another potential problem is that the defense strategies pit the accused against each other -- each defendant will likely try to blame the other and in effect become a second prosecutor against his co-defendant. This could be especially damaging should the trial reach a capital sentencing phase, where less culpability in the crime becomes a factor that mitigates against death.  <P>

"Indeed, the prosecution could simply take a seat during this aspect of the case, as the emperors of Rome did in ancient times, and let the gladiators slay each other," the McVeigh defense team argues in its severance brief. <P>

As a result, severance is shaping up to be the most disputed aspect so far in the case, not only pitting the prosecutors against the defense, but also bringing to the surface bitter differences between the two defendants and former Army buddies. <P>

While some of the rhetoric being bandied about is no doubt meant to convince the judge that McVeigh and Nichols have antagonistic defenses and thus a factor for severance, it is apparent that the interests of the two defendants have in fact diverged. In their severance briefs, they waste no opportunity to blame the other. <P>

"In the present posture of this case, Mr. Nichols stands in serious risk of being found guilty by mass application," argues Tigar. "It would be fully consistent for one jury to conclude that Mr. McVeigh, who is directly linked to the scene of the crime itself and who described his plans and intentions with respect to the bombing to others in detail, is guilty, while another jury found Mr. Nichols -- who the government agrees was not at the scene, and against whom there is no remotely similar evidence of participation or intention -- to be innocent." <P>

McVeigh's attorneys, of course, offer the opposite viewpoint. <P>

"[T]he substantial weight of the evidence of guilt, as reflected in the government's own investigative memoranda, its examination of the physical evidence, and the documents it has gathered is against Terry Nichols, not Timothy McVeigh," Jones contends in a 49-page supplement to his 93-page severance brief. "Accordingly, even if Mr. McVeigh is found guilty along with Mr. Nichols, the evidence will point to a more significant and far greater -- and more blameworthy -- involvement in the crime by Mr. Nichols." <P>

As the defendants point to each other, prosecutors are adamantly opposing separate trials. <P>

Led by Special Attorney to the U.S. Attorney General Joseph Hartzler, the prosecution argues that co-conspirators should be tried together and that any prejudice from a joint trial could be cured through careful instructions to the jury. Further, prosecutors say, two trials would overburden judicial resources and the hundreds of witness involved. <P>

"[A] second trial would repeat almost the same evidence, through almost the same witnesses, heard in the first trial," prosecutors argued in a 77-page brief filed Sept. 25. "This overlap of proof greatly reduces any risk of 'spillover' prejudice and suggests that defendants' respective litigation strategies are unlikely to be as antagonistic as they would have the court believe." <P>

The prosecution is also loath to give up the significant courtroom advantage it can gain by painting McVeigh and Nichols with the same broad brush of guilt. This is especially true in a case like the Oklahoma City bombing where the defendants are charged with a conspiracy, because the jury can use the actions and words of one defendant to consider the guilt of the other. <P>

"If [the prosecution] can keep the two of them together, then they have a much stronger case," says Jamison, the former Colorado state judge, who is now a professor at University of Denver College of Law. "They've got a much better case against McVeigh, and if some of that can be lapped over to Nichols -- that's why they want to try it together." <P>

The prosecution can take some comfort in the fact that federal judges grant separate trials only in the rarest of circumstances. <P>

"Judges do not want to try the same case twice," says George Washington University Law School professor Stephen Saltzburg, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's Criminal Division. "They don't want to use scarce judicial resources to do the same thing over again, nor do they want to burden witnesses more than necessary." <P>

Underscoring that point, one federal judge -- U.S. District Judge William Terrell Hodges of the Middle District of Florida -- admonished a class of new federal judges in Washington earlier this year to "never sever" before trial. <P>

Matsch, however, is not one to favor efficiency or tradition over a defendant's constitutional rights, say courtroom observers, pointing to his controversial decision to move the trial to Denver. <P>

"I'm absolutely confident that if any judge would grant a severance in a case like this if the law demanded it, then Matsch is the one," says criminal defense lawyer Henry Asbill, a partner in D.C.'s Asbill, Junkin & Moffitt. "Matsch is as independent a judge as I've run across." <P>

Another factor that could be weighing on Matsch's mind is the appeals court. In a high-profile death penalty case that promises to feature hundreds of witnesses and complex jury instructions, there is a strong possibility for reversible error  throughout the trial, say criminal law experts. So why ask for trouble during the pretrial stages? <P>

"Simply denying the motion to sever immediately raises an appellate issue before the trial has even started," says American University's Robbins. "District judges do have a lot of leeway [on severance], but they also have to respect the Bill of Rights and provide a trial with due process." <P>

<H2>Monsters and Boy Scouts</H2><p>

By Stuart Taylor Jr.<BR>
<I>Legal Times</I><BR>
September 16, 1996<p>

At first blush, accused Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh's pending motion for permission to give media interviews -- including one with a famous TV journalist, to be chosen from a gaggle of eager applicants who have already auditioned for the opportunity -- might seem an occasion for revulsion.  <p>

Here's how the prosecution characterized the motion in a seething Aug. 29 court response filed with Chief Judge Richard Matsch, of the U.S. District Court in Denver:  <p>

"McVeigh . . . seeks this court's authorization of an extraordinary attempt to manipulate the news media to produce a favorable impact on the potential jury pool. According to the motion, defendant's counsel has already met with such well-known television reporters as Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer, Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather and others--and now wants to 'choose among' them the one least likely to 'exploit' an interview of Mr. McVeigh, 'brow-beat' the defendant, or ask Mr. McVeigh questions 'he cannot answer.'. . . Mr. McVeigh also has 'interviewed' representatives of major national newspapers, and now wants to choose among them as well. . . . And he wants to make a similar selection from among local television and newspaper reporters."  <p>

But the motion should be granted. (Indeed, even the prosecution's response, which exudes distaste for the motion, stops short of explicitly urging that it be denied.) Meanwhile, the media should spurn any conditions restricting what they can say about McVeigh before or after airing any interviews.  <p>

This spectacle raises two distinct questions, one of law and one of journalistic ethics:<p>

Should courts allow McVeigh (who is in jail awaiting trial) and other accused monsters to give media interviews when their primary purpose is obviously to curry sympathy with the jury pool?  <p>

And how should the media deal with efforts by such defendants and their lawyers to impose conditions designed to guarantee that they will be presented in the most sympathetic possible light?  <p>

The legal question becomes relatively easy if one takes seriously the constitutional presumption of innocence.  <p>

Like many Americans, I am all but convinced that McVeigh murdered 168 men, women, and children -- and is thus unspeakably evil -- largely because of what I've read in newspapers about the evidence and his post-arrest conduct. I therefore recoil viscerally from the spectacle of Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer, Tom Brokaw, et al., making nice to this probable monster in the hope of being awarded a journalistic coup.  <p>

But the presumption of innocence argues for deciding the media- access question based on the hypothesis that McVeigh -- against whom the government seeks the death penalty -- is in fact the wrongly accused innocent he claims to be.  <p>

As a general First Amendment proposition, anyone in this country can give an interview to anyone he wants, anytime he wants, about anything he wants, for any purpose he wants. Why should a presumptively innocent defendant be denied this right?  <p>

It's true that the Supreme Court has upheld restrictions on pretrial media interviews of jailed defendants based on (sometimes pretextual) concerns about institutional order and security, such as lack of secure interviewing facilities, the possibility of sparking riots, and such. But McVeigh's jailers have raised no such concerns in this case. Nor has the Justice Department expressed any concern that McVeigh will use media interviews to incite new terrorist acts, or to signal confederates about an escape plot, or any such thing. In short, there's no reason he should be less free to give interviews than if he were free on bail.  <p>

The only real argument for restricting interviews by McVeigh is that he is trying to influence the jury pool. But the argument is unpersuasive.  <p>

Courts do often impose gag orders on lawyers -- and Judge Matsch has imposed one here -- to insulate potential jurors from prejudicial pretrial publicity, which has been so massive in McVeigh's case as to spur a change of venue from Oklahoma City to Denver. And some courts have become all too ready to extend such gag orders to defendants as well, especially since the O.J. Simpson trial and acquittal spread concern about the danger of big trials degenerating into media circuses, and of jurors disregarding the evidence. (There is surprisingly little case law on this, because so few defendants want to talk to the media.)  <p>

But while lawyers representing parties in pending cases are officers of the court, and thus subject to the court's rules, as the Supreme Court stressed in Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada (1991), defendants are involuntary participants in the proceedings. Their constitutional rights to freedom of speech should be restricted only when indispensable to insuring a fair trial.  <p>

And in McVeigh's case, media interviews depicting him as a human being rather than a monster -- at least in outward appearance -- would further, rather than detract from, the goal of a fair trial before jurors not strongly predisposed toward either side.  <p>

The ideal, of course, is (in the words of Chief Justice William Rehnquist's opinion in Gentile) a trial "by impartial jurors, who know as little as possible of the case" in advance. But that ideal is unattainable in a case like McVeigh's. He has been hit with an avalanche of adverse publicity (not all of it accurate), depicting him as a mass murderer motivated by right-wing lunacy, and has been shown repeatedly on television shackled and under heavy guard. Such publicity and such dire images may predispose potential jurors to convict. In this context, any success that the defense may have in orchestrating a bit of humanizing publicity would be at best a modest and salutary counterweight to the massive publicity depicting him as a monster.<p>

This is especially true because McVeigh seeks here not to publicize evidence that would be inadmissible in court, or tendentious arguments about the facts of the case -- which he refuses to discuss -- but to present an image of himself smiling, chatting informally, and coming across as a regular guy, so as to "stop the rush to judgment of guilt [and] soften the less than human sculpture that the government has chiseled into the consciousness of the nation," in the words of his lawyer, Stephen Jones.  <p>

Michael Tigar, counsel for McVeigh co-defendant Terry Nichols, said in his own response to McVeigh's motion that if they are tried together, Nichols might be prejudiced -- particularly in any post-conviction proceeding on whether to impose the death penalty -- because jurors might be influenced by McVeigh's "scripted production" to regard him as the less culpable of the two.  <p>

But Tigar's point was to urge that Nichols be tried separately -- not that McVeigh be gagged -- and he recognized that McVeigh "has a constitutional right to say his piece."  <p>

McVeigh also has a right to insist on any conditions he wants before agreeing to an interview; to orchestrate a competition among networks eager for a journalistic coup to boost their ratings during the November sweeps period; and to choose the most compliant of the many journalists who have besieged him with requests.  <p>

But the media have no obligation to agree to any conditions. Indeed, they have an ethical duty to spurn any that would mislead their viewers or readers, or limit their editorial discretion.  <p>

Of course, journalists routinely agree to various conditions to get cooperation from subjects of or sources for their stories -- restrictions on how sensitive information can be attributed, on asking questions during presidential photo- opportunities and other picture-taking sessions, and the like. There would be nothing wrong with agreeing to reasonable conditions insisted upon by McVeigh. But what sorts of conditions would be reasonable?<p>

This is not such a hard line to draw. The conditions that McVeigh has imposed in a few previous media interviews, for example -- barring any questions about facts relevant to his case and any pictures that show his handcuffs -- seem reasonable enough. He has a constitutional right not to answer questions about the facts before or during the trial, and a tactical interest in keeping the prosecution from finding out in advance what he might say in any testimony. He also has a legitimate interest in refusing to be filmed in shackles or while being pressed with questions he is unwilling to answer, which might convey an image of danger and guilt.<p>

But any journalists who obtain interviews with McVeigh should fully disclose any such conditions to their viewers or readers. And if McVeigh seeks explicit or implicit agreements limiting what would-be interviewers can say about him or his case immediately before or after any interview or photo session, no self-respecting journalist should agree. That is a matter of editorial discretion and integrity.  <p>

We may soon find out how much integrity the networks and others have exercised in their efforts to boost their ratings by making deals with this accused mass murderer who wants to look like a Boy Scout.  <p>

<h2>McVeigh's Media Bid Tests Inmate Rights</h2>
<P>Robert Schmidt <br><i>
Legal Times<br></i>
Sept. 9, 1996</p>


<P>Over the last several months, accused Oklahoma City bomber
Timothy McVeigh has held off-the-record interviews with some of
the luminaries in the national press corps. But in a move that
turns the tables on such well-known reporters as Barbara
Walters, Tom Brokaw, and Diane Sawyer, McVeigh has also been
asking the questions--auditioning media heavyweights for the
chance to interview him. </P>

<P>The result of this beauty contest, if McVeigh and his attorney
Stephen Jones have their way, would be a series of interviews
with hand-picked reporters that would serve to soften the image
of McVeigh, whom many Americans believe is a right-wing zealot
guilty of the most heinous act of domestic terrorism in U.S.
history. </P>

<P>In a 21-page brief filed late last month, Jones asked Chief
Judge Richard Matsch, who is presiding over the case in U.S.
District Court in Denver, to grant his incarcerated client
permission to proceed with his media strategy--and argued that
refusal to do so would infringe on McVeigh's constitutional
rights. </P>

<P>"There is not in the United States of America in the year 1996
one First Amendment for the Department of Justice, the
survivors, and the media, and another for Timothy McVeigh,"
Jones wrote. "McVeigh's limited, restrained responses in the
requested interviews would not even begin to bring the scales
into balance." </P>

<P>The brief provides an unusual look at a carefully crafted public
relations campaign designed to paint a new picture of a high-
profile, much vilified client. But the filing is not just a
media strategy. It also raises provocative legal questions about
jailed defendants, the First Amendment rights of pretrial
detainees, and the role of the press in the trial process. </P>



<P>These issues are not exclusive to the Oklahoma City case. In the
last few months, about a half-dozen states have enacted, or are
considering, restrictions on some face-to-face prisoner
interviews. The Justice Department issued regulations that would
silence federal prisoners who pose a terrorism threat. And the
judge in the O.J. Simpson civil trial issued an unusually strict
gag order on all participants. </P>



<P>"A lot of people in the legal establishment are raising doubts
and uncertainties about the sweep of the First Amendment, which
we've always accepted, in the trial area," says William Pizzi, a
professor at University of Colorado School of Law. </P>

<P>The practice of trying the case in the media "is not the way
trials should be conducted: They should be litigated and
[participants] questioned from the witness stand, under oath,"
adds Pizzi, who expresses reservations about McVeigh's motion,
but thinks it is legally sound and should be granted. </P>

MATSCH LIMITING PUBLICITY <BR>

<P>Publicity has always been a major issue in the Oklahoma City
case, and Judge Matsch has taken steps to reduce its effect. </P>

<P>In February, the proceedings were moved to Denver from
Oklahoma--in a bid to find a jury pool less affected by the
bombing and the media swirl surrounding it. And in June, the
judge ordered attorneys, supervising officials, and support
personnel involved in the case to restrict their statements,
explicitly prohibiting public discussion of discovery material
and voicing opinions about the defendants' guilt or innocence. </P>

<P>McVeigh has already granted four limited interviews to print
media, and has allowed CBS and NBC to film him talking with
Jones. The strict rules followed by the two networks included no
questions and no shots of McVeigh's handcuffs. While there was
little reaction to his previous interviews, Jones' motion to
increase his client's media exposure has provoked an outcry. </P>

<P>On Aug. 29, the prosecution filed an objection to McVeigh's
request, calling it "an extraordinary attempt to manipulate the
news media to produce a favorable impact on the potential jury
pool." </P>

<P>Terry Nichols, McVeigh's co-defendant, also filed comments
claiming that the interviews could infringe on his rights to a
fair trial. Nichols threatened to hold his own media blitz if
the request is granted. </P>

<P>So far, media representatives have not voiced their views on the
issue. </P>

<P>Matsch is expected to rule on the matter in the next few weeks
because it is time-sensitive. In his motion, Jones asked
permission for a BBC camera crew to film in the prison during
the week of Oct. 7, and for an unspecified major American TV
network crew to come sometime during the month of October. </P>

<P>The American network televised interview, which will likely be
22 minutes long and run during the November sweeps period, is
the centerpiece of Jones' strategy. </P>

<P>In his motion, Jones wrote that McVeigh would choose among
Walters of ABC, Sawyer of ABC, NBC's Brokaw, Dan Rather of CBS,
Susan Candiotti of CNN, and Jack Bowen of Fox Television for the
interview. (Jones is also asking permission for shorter
interviews with a national newspaper, a wire service, and local
television and print media in Denver and the Southwest.) </P>

<P>Jones contends that the interviews are necessary to counter a
"juggernaut of guilt" perpetuated against McVeigh that Jones
says has hampered efforts to hire expert witnesses and find
witnesses willing to testify on behalf of his client--making it
impossible for him to receive a fair trial. </P>

<P>(The request was first filed by Jones ex parte and under seal,
but when the judge ordered him to demonstrate why opposing
counsel could not see the brief, it was withdrawn. Jones then
filed a public request late last month.) </P>

'UNUSUAL' DEFENSE STRATEGY <BR>


<P>Jones' strategy is also noteworthy because it turns general
wisdom about trial strategy upside down. Since anything
defendants say publicly can be used to cross-examine witnesses
in court, defense attorneys almost never advise their clients to
speak with reporters until the trial is over. </P>

<P>"I discourage clients from giving interviews during the pendency
of the case, particularly when the case is going to be
litigated," says noted defense lawyer Plato Cacheris of D.C.'s
Cacheris & Treanor, whose high-profile clients have included CIA
spy Aldrich Ames (who spoke with the press after pleading guilty
to espionage charges) and Fawn Hall, Oliver North's former
secretary during the Iran-Contra affair. "Not being critical of
Mr. Jones, it is an unusual step." </P>

<P>Indeed, Jones' request is so unusual that there is precious
little case law on the subject in the federal courts. </P>

<P>Statutes and case law provide guidelines on an attorney's right
to speak to the press, the right of the press to seek interviews
in prisons, and authorities' power to restrict a prisoner's
direct access to the press. </P>

<P>But McVeigh's case presents the issue of the right of a prisoner
who has not been convicted to get his story out. The novel
defense strategy has First Amendment and media law specialists
sharply divided in their opinions of the request. </P>



<P>"I think it is absolutely an absurd motion--it takes my breath
away," says Jerome Barron, an expert in media law at George
Washington University Law School. "The whole idea is that we
want to try the accused with all the protections of the
Constitution, but that [does not include] an effort toward
further manipulation of the media." </P>



<P>However, David Cole, a professor at Georgetown University Law
Center who specializes in the First Amendment, says the judge
should grant the motion. </P>



<P>"The law gives the courts a fair amount of discretion in
attempting to balance fair trial rights versus free press
rights," says Cole. "But I think you have to have a very strong
concern for tainting a trial before you cut off the defendant's
ability to speak to the press." (Cole writes a monthly column
for Legal Times.) </P>

<P>Matsch does have a lot of latitude to deny McVeigh's motion, say
several criminal procedure experts. Matsch could determine that
the interviews would unfairly prejudice the prosecution's case
or would make jury selection too difficult. </P>

<P>"I understand why a court would want to restrict it, but
[McVeigh] has strong arguments," says University of Colorado's
Pizzi. </P>

<P>The strongest of those, experts say, is the First Amendment
right to freedom of speech. </P>

<P>"First Amendment rights do not stop at the jailhouse door," says
Cole. "You can imagine many totalitarian governments which take
people into custody and hold them incommunicado. . . . That's
not consistent with our notion of a free and open government." </P>

NEW RULES GAG PRISONERS <BR>


<P>Yet even in the United States, the pendulum has been swinging
against the free speech rights of inmates. </P>

<P>In fact, the Justice Department can stop McVeigh on its own if
it wishes. The department quietly issued new Bureau of Prisons
regulations this past May that were created to silence inmates
who may incite, promote, or plot terrorist attacks. Those
regulations are currently in effect on an interim basis. (See
"Silencing Suspected Terrorists Behind Bars," June 10, 1996,
Page 1.) </P>

<P>The rules allow the bureau, after being advised by the attorney
general, to keep an inmate from conducting interviews, using the
phone, and corresponding with reporters by mail. </P>



<P>In June, BOP General Counsel Wallace Cheney said that the
Oklahoma City bombing and the 1993 World Trade Center blast
provided a final impetus for implementation of the new
procedures--though they were not designed with any particular
case in mind. </P>



<P>Justice has not invoked the regulations in the Oklahoma City
case. </P>



<P>The issue of media access to prisoners has also been percolating
through a number of states in the last few months, including
South Carolina, California, Illinois, and Indiana. The trend in
the states, say advocates for prisoners and the press, has been
to limit severely or to ban face-to-face interviews with some
inmates, such as those on death row. While the advocates decry
such bans, they say a legal challenge to them would probably
prove futile. </P>

<P>"We would like to think that the courts will be independent
arbiters and protectors of the Constitution," says Jane Kirtley,
who is the executive director of the Arlington, Va.-based
Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. "But the track
record, from the Supreme Court on down, has been to show great
deference to prison authorities." </P>

<P>The rules in the state courts were spurred mainly by concerns
that inmates were becoming media stars. That is not the case
with McVeigh. Jones stresses in his brief that the interviews
are important because McVeigh has become a television demon, not
a star. </P>

<P>"Timothy McVeigh has the right to appear in court as an accused
defendant in something other than sackcloth and ashes," Jones
argues. </P>

<H2>Low Key, High Pressure</H2>







By Robert Schmidt<BR>

<I>Legal Times </I><BR>

September 2, 1996



<P>Of all the thousands of veteran federal prosecutors in the nation,

Joseph Hartzler, an assistant U.S. attorney in Springfield, Ill.,

seems one of the least likely to have been placed in charge of the

massive Oklahoma City bombing case.</P>



<P>As head of the government's trial team, Hartzler faces the challenge

of managing one of the largest and most complicated federal

prosecutions ever staged, complete with untested statutes, more than

21,000 witness statements, and 4,000 pieces of physical evidence.</P>



<P>He also has to contend with two star defense attorneys, Stephen Jones

and Michael Tigar, who are pursuing a scorched-earth litigation

strategy that tries to poke holes in even the most minute aspects of

the government's case.</P>



<P>Although he once was a hotshot prosecutor in Chicago, Hartzler has not

tried many complex cases in the past few years. He has no ties with

Oklahoma City, where 168 people were killed in the bombing last year,

or with Denver, where the trial will be held. He is not especially

well-connected at Main Justice. And in 1991, having been diagnosed

with multiple sclerosis, Hartzler left a demanding law-firm

partnership in Chicago and took the prosecutor job in Springfield.</P>



<P>Yet, as the case winds its way through pretrial hearings in U.S.

District Court in Denver, Hartzler has held his own against the

onslaught of motions from the defense, and according to courtroom

observers and his supervisors in Washington, he has molded a diverse

group of 10 lawyers into a top-notch legal team.</P>



<P>Last month, the prosecution won an important victory when Chief Judge

Richard Matsch denied defense lawyers' attempts to suppress key

evidence against their clients, accused bombers Timothy McVeigh and

Terry Nichols. Beginning this month, Hartzler faces an even greater

challenge as Tigar and Jones argue for separate trials.</P>



MAN OF MYSTERY <BR>

<P>In leading the government's charge, though, Hartzler

remains a bit of an enigma.</P>



<P>Through an important series of pretrial hearings, he has not gone head

to head against Jones and Tigar, choosing instead to let his deputies

take the lead in court. Hartzler has also shied away from the

intensive media attention, generally refusing to grant interviews and

rarely stopping outside the courthouse to make statements for the

expectant press pool.</P>



<P>"I don't understand where they found him or why they chose him," says

Michael Deutsch, who as an attorney in Chicago defended a Puerto Rican

terrorist in a 1985 bombing case prosecuted by Hartzler, a successful

prosecution that is often cited as one of the reasons Hartzler got the

Oklahoma City job.</P>



<P>In fact, the selection of the low-profile Hartzler may be part of the

government's strategy in the bombing case.</P>



<P>Some attorneys who follow the bombing case speculate that the

government may have preferred an unobtrusive lead lawyer who would

toil in the background, letting his superiors in Washington call the

shots. After all, the bombing has become an important political symbol

that has been used to promote issues as diverse as the war on domestic

terrorism, victims' rights, and gun control.</P>



<P>Another theory -- so delicate that none of the three lawyers who

suggested it wish to be quoted on the record -- is that Hartzler's MS

helped land him the appointment. Having a lead prosecutor who

maneuvers around the courtroom in a motorized scooter, some say, is a

good tactic for gaining sympathy with a jury -- especially in a case

where more than 500 people were injured.  (Justice Department

officials say Hartzler's disability played no role in his selection.)</P>



<P>According to friends, Hartzler, 45, was more than willing to endure

the physical discomfort and long hours necessary to try the case,

because he felt so strongly about bringing the bombers to justice. In

fact, Hartzler went out of his way to volunteer his services after

hearing on his car radio about the carnage in Oklahoma City.</P>



<P>"I thought I had some skills that I could contribute," says Hartzler.</P>



<P>And his supporters caution against underestimating the unassuming

Midwesterner.</P>



<P>Justice Department officials who hired Hartzler are quick to praise

him as a sharp trial lawyer with a quick mind who stays calm in the

face of intense pressure.</P>



<P>And defense lawyers who have faced Hartzler in court -- usually losing

-- say he is a very aggressive prosecutor with a healthy ego who has

trouble letting go of a case. They also laud his trial skills, his

fairness, and his ethics.</P>



<P>"Joe is the consummate professional prosecutor," says Springfield,

Ill., attorney Michael Metnick. "In the courtroom, he's very

methodical and forceful, not flashy, although he certainly can be

emotional."</P>



<P>Hartzler's biggest test so far in the bombing case will come in the

next few weeks as the defendants prepare to argue for separate trials.

Should their severance motions be granted, the prosecution's already

daunting task will become much harder.</P>



WHO'S IN CHARGE?<BR>

<P>The pressure on Hartzler to win is, of course,

enormous. A loss would be a devastating blow to federal law

enforcement. His marching orders were set before he took the job in

May 1995: Both President Bill Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno

told a national television audience that the bombers, if convicted,

would face the death penalty.</P>



<P>Accordingly, each decision Hartzler makes is being scrutinized by the

public, the press, and his superiors in Washington. His decision to

remain mostly silent in court so far has provoked speculation that he

may not be directing the case.</P>



<P>Aside from introducing his legal team to the court at the beginning of

each session, Hartzler has generally remained mum during important

pretrial hearings on defense motions to change venue, rule out the

death penalty, and suppress evidence.</P>



<P>"I don't think that Joe is in charge of the prosecution team. The

shots are called by [Deputy Attorney General] Jamie Gorelick and [her

top aide] Merrick Garland," claims defense counsel Stephen Jones.

"This case's backdrop is clearly presidential politics, so Clinton can

say he's tough on crime."</P>



<P>Justice Department officials scoff at such a notion, pointing out that

they are too far away and too busy to micro-manage the trial team.

Hartzler, they say, is firmly in charge.</P>



<P>Hartzler's low profile in court has also formed a marked contrast with

the image projected by defense attorneys Jones and Tigar. Both are

larger-than-life figures prone to using sweeping rhetoric in the

courtroom, and they have delegated little to the other lawyers on

their legal teams.</P>



<P>Indeed, it is quite unusual for a lead prosecutor -- especially in

such an important case -- to stay so far out of the spotlight.</P>



<P>But according to Hartzler, that has been the plan. Each of his

deputies handles a different area of the case, and when something that

pertains to their specialty comes up, they take charge in court.</P>



<P>"Our team will be a lot different than the defense. Ours is much, much

more of a team effort," says Hartzler.</P>



<P>Although Hartzler may not be as flamboyant as Jones and Tigar, lawyers

who have worked with him say he can more than hold his own against

them.</P>



<P>"He's clearly a formidable foe for the defense lawyers in this case,"

says his former boss, Dan Webb, who was U.S. attorney in Chicago when

Hartzler worked in the office.</P>



<P>Hartzler will not remain close-mouthed in court for long -- he is

slated to be a main voice in court once the case goes to trial,

probably early next year -- but his willingness to let others share

the glory helps explain his management style and his approach to the

prosecution of two of the most notorious defendants in history.</P>



<P>Moreover, the prosecution doesn't believe it needs a celebrity lawyer

or courtroom theatrics in a case that centers around the mass murder

of 168 people, 19 of them children.</P>



<P>"My style is to recognize the strengths in others," says Hartzler.

"You'll see no grandstanding by any of us."</P>



<P>Hartzler's wide smile, clean-cut looks, and evenhanded demeanor should

play well to the jury. Lawyers who have worked with him in court say

jurors often see Hartzler in the same way they do Peter Jennings or

Tom Brokaw -- as an impartial presenter of facts.</P>



<P>"He's not overly theatric or flamboyant, and that gains him a lot of

credibility," says Vincent Connelly, a partner at Chicago's Mayer,

Brown & Platt, who worked with Hartzler in the Chicago U.S. attorney's

office. "Although he's an advocate in many respects, he comes across

as a newscaster."</P>



<P>Defense attorneys, however, say Hartzler is not always Mr. Nice Guy in

the courtroom -- especially when he ends up on the losing side of a

case.</P>



<P>"Mr. Hartzler was a very aggressive prosecutor," says Chicago defense

lawyer Philip Parenti, who faced Hartzler in 1986. Parenti's client,

an alcoholic attorney charged with swindling some of his clients, got

off without jail time.</P>



<P>"He was very vocal in his disagreement with the federal judge's

decision, and several months later, he found a way to try to revoke

[the client's] probation, but the judge would have none of it," says

Parenti.</P>



<P>Hartzler's aggressiveness, however, is rarely apparent outside the

courtroom. In person he comes across as an all-American boy, a

straight-shooter.</P>



HOMETOWN HERO<BR>

<P>Hartzler even has some credentials to back up his image:

In 1987, before he developed MS, he was named a "hero" by the city of

Chicago for chasing after and helping to subdue a pickpocket on the

elevated train. Hartzler, who is 5 feet, 9 inches tall, put the much

larger man in a headlock on the subway platform.</P>



<P>Born and raised in Ohio, Hartzler attended Amherst College and

American University's Washington College of Law (graduating first in

his class in 1978), but returned to the Midwest to settle down.</P>



<P>Hartzler met his wife, because the alphabet fatefully put them next to

each other in law school; they now have three sons, age 11, nine, and

five.</P>



<P>Shortly before being appointed lead prosecutor in the bombing case,

Hartzler was honored as the 1995 MS Father of the Year by the National

Multiple Sclerosis Society. President Clinton presented the award to

Hartzler as his family looked on.</P>



<P>The society noted Hartzler's devotion to his sons and in a news

release talked of the children's favorite father-son activities,

including playing "Monster," "wrestling buddies," "basement ball," and

listening to a bedtime story series invented by Hartzler called "Magic

Yellow Sweatshirt." The group also noted that Hartzler coached youth

baseball and named his team the Mighty Skunks, a twist on the initials

MS.</P>



<P>Hartzler is not shy about acknowledging his illness, a degenerative

neurological disorder. But he prefers to dwell on other aspects of his

life.</P>



<P>Hartzler says his three boys are his main focus. He left a partnership

at Chicago's Rudnick & Wolfe after only two years and moved to

Springfield because an hour-long commute from the suburbs would take

away too much time from his family life, he says.</P>



<P>"If I stayed in Chicago, I probably could not have ever coached Little

League again in my life -- and that was just not acceptable," says

Hartzler.</P>



<P>Working in the U.S. attorney's office in Springfield, Hartzler has a

12-minute commute if he hits all the lights. Coaching Little League,

however, is on hold until the bombing trial is over.</P>



<P>Hartzler is also a small-stakes poker player and has hosted a social

game in Springfield frequented mainly by other lawyers. Before he

developed MS, Hartzler was a tennis player, and he says, poker has

become a new way to get together with his male friends.</P>



<P>Even the years he spent living in the city didn't rob him of his

boy-next-door demeanor, according to those who know him in

Springfield.</P>



<P>"For somebody coming from Chicago, he is pretty down to earth," says

Brian Otwell, chief public defender for Sangamon County, Ill. "He

isn't above having a few beers."</P>



<P>Hartzler's laid-back style, according to Justice Department officials,

was one of the reasons he was selected to head the bombing prosecution

team. His long career as a prosecutor and the legal challenges he

faced also played a big role.</P>



<P>In particular, Justice sought candidates who could deal with

complicated factual matters, wide-ranging forensic evidence, and

complex records, including phone records. Officials also wanted a

prosecutor who had experience with terrorism or bombing cases, could

work closely with investigators, and had managed and supervised a

large trial team.</P>



<P>Hartzler fit the bill. Before moving to Springfield, Hartzler spent 10

years in the Chicago U.S. attorney's office, heading both the Civil

and Criminal divisions. During that time he prosecuted a case against

Puerto Rican nationalists who were making bombs to blow up a number of

buildings in Chicago.</P>



<P>"Joe is an outstanding trial lawyer. His mind works very quickly,"

says former U.S. attorney Webb, who was Hartzler's supervisor from

1981 to 1985. "He's known as tough but fair-minded."</P>



<P>Webb, now a partner at Chicago's Winston & Strawn, says Hartzler

usually handled the bigger prosecutions in the office, including major

fraud, political corruption, and judicial bribery trials, and was

acclaimed for his extraordinarily thorough case preparation.</P>



<P>Another area where Hartzler excelled, says Webb, was in his dealings

with investigators, a skill that should help him in the Oklahoma City

case.</P>



<P>"Joe always got along well with the FBI," says Webb. "Sometimes

prosecutors get their nose up in the air and believe they're better

than investigative officers, but Joe's attitude was to roll up his

sleeves and work with [them]."</P>



<P>In fact, one of the reasons Hartzler says he has remained a prosecutor

is because he enjoys the investigations so much.</P>



<P>"Defense lawyers have to be much more reactive," says Hartzler. "As a

prosecutor, [you have] a search and discover mission."</P>



<P>One case where Hartzler coordinated the investigation with the FBI and

numerous other law enforcement agencies was his 1985 prosecution of

four members of the Puerto Rican nationalist group known as the FALN.

The group, which believes in independence for Puerto Rico and

socialism for America, claimed responsibility for more than 100

bombings or planned bombings in New York and Chicago.</P>



<P>In Hartzler's case, the four defendants were charged with plotting to

bomb a Marine Corps Reserve training center and an Army Reserve center

in Chicago. They were also charged with maintaining safe houses for

storing weapons and explosives, and planning a robbery of a Chicago

Transit Authority money collector to support their activities.</P>



<P>Although Oklahoma City is a larger and more complex case, the FALN

trial had a number of similarities, says former Assistant U.S.

Attorney James Ferguson, a partner at Chicago's Sonnenschein Nath &

Rosenthal, who tried the case with Hartzler.</P>



<P>Like Oklahoma City, the FALN case had an enormous amount of evidence,

it involved terrorism statutes rarely used, and had political

undertones. A lot of pressure was put on the prosecutors; the U.S.

attorney's office received death threats during the investigation.</P>



<P>Yet there were also some big differences between the two cases. Unlike

Oklahoma City where the evidence is mainly circumstantial, the

prosecution in the FALN case had videotapes of three of the defendants

building bombs. If that wasn't enough, those three defendants refused

appointed counsel and would not recognize the court's jurisdiction,

declaring themselves prisoners of war.</P>



<P>While the three defendants without lawyers were sentenced to 35 years

in jail, the one defendant with a counsel got off with probation. His

attorney, Michael Deutsch, says the case was hardly a test for

Hartzler.</P>



<P>"It was a slam dunk," says Deutsch, now legal director for the Center

for Constitutional Rights in New York. "It was not too difficult a

case for the government. Three of the defendants were on a videotape,

sitting at a table making bombs."</P>



<P>Deutsch says he was surprised that when Hartzler was appointed lead

counsel in the Oklahoma City bombing trial, the FALN case was being

cited as his big terrorism case.</P>



<P>"[The FALN trial] didn't put you to the test on how skillful you are,"

says Deutsch. "We stayed away from bomb evidence. There was no tight

cross of expert witnesses."</P>



<P>But Ferguson, the former prosecutor, says Hartzler learned important

lessons during the FALN case, including how to investigate terrorist

organizations and how to choreograph the presentation of evidence.</P>



<P>To show the jury the potential harm the group could inflict, Hartzler

had some of the confiscated bombs set off and videotaped. Hartzler

also created an enormous bulletin board on which he mounted all the

weapons found in the group's safe house.</P>



<P>"It was pretty chilling, and needless to say it really dominated the

courtroom," says Ferguson.</P>



<P>From his perspective, Ferguson says, the government's decision to

bring in Hartzler for the Oklahoma City trials was "inspired."</P>



<P>Justice officials, too, say they are confident they chose the right

lead prosecutor.</P>



<P>"He's shown good judgment in the midst of a media storm," says Merrick

Garland, principal associate deputy attorney general, who is

supervising this case and other major terrorism cases for the

department. "He's got his head down and is getting the case ready for

trial."</P>



<P>Hartzler, meanwhile, is not trying to parlay the case into a lucrative

partnership in a private law firm, nor is he trying to move up the

Justice Department's ranks.</P>



<P>When the trial is over, Hartzler plans to head back to Springfield,

Ill., and resume his work as an assistant U.S. attorney.</P>



<P>"Where else would I go but back to Springfield?" says Hartzler. "I'm

very comfortable with what I do."</P>

<H2>DOJ deploys Its Own 'Dream Team'</H2><p>





By Robert Schmidt<BR>

<I>Legal Times</I> <BR>

September 2, 1996



<P>The government's trial team in the Oklahoma City case was put together

by lead prosecutor Joseph Hartzler and by senior officials in the

Justice Department.</P>



<P>The six main lawyers, not including Hartzler, cover all the bases: Two

are from Oklahoma City, one is an appellate expert on loan from Main

Justice, one is based in the Justice Department's Terrorism and

Violent Crime Division, and two are assistant U.S. attorneys known as

fierce litigators.</P>



<P>While Hartzler has not yet taken an active role in court, his deputies

have all made appearances and are spearheading the legal work in

specific areas. Despite facing off against high-profile defense

attorneys Michael Tigar and Stephen Jones, the prosecutors have held

their own, say courtroom observers.</P>



<P>"The government has some pretty good lawyers. It's not a terrible

mismatch," says Oklahoma City defense lawyer John Coyle III, who

provides commentary on the trial for local television news. "What

they've said in court for the most part seems to have been effective."</P>



<P>Rounding out the prosecution team are:</P>



<P>* Sean Connelly, on detail from the Justice Department, where he

handles appellate work in the Criminal Division. Connelly has been the

most public face in court for the prosecution. Thus far, he has taken

the lead on the prosecution's replies to defense challenges to the

death penalty and motions to suppress evidence. He also writes most of

the government's legal briefs.</P>



<P>Connelly, who without notes gave the prosecution's closing argument in

the suppression hearings in July, has argued more than 60 cases in

nearly every federal circuit.  Before joining the Justice Department,

Connelly was in private practice at the D.C. firms of Zuckerman,

Spaeder, Goldstein, Taylor & Kolker and Brand & Lowell.</P>



<P>In court, Connelly sometimes speaks so quickly that the court reporter

asks him to slow down.</P>



<P>* Beth Wilkinson, principal deputy chief of the Criminal Division's

Terrorism and Violent Crime Section. Wilkinson is spearheading the

Prosecution's efforts on discovery and expert witnesses.</P>



<P>Wilkinson began her legal career in the U.S. Army, where  she worked

on the prosecution of Manuel Noriega. In that case, she specialized in

handling issues related to the use of classified information. As an

assistant U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, Wilkinson

successfully prosecuted a terrorist charged with the bombing of an

Avianca Airlines plane.</P>



<P>* Patrick Ryan, the U.S. attorney in Oklahoma City, who joined the

team shortly after he was appointed by President Clinton in the weeks

following the bombing. Ryan has done a significant amount of work with

the crime victims, including handling motions to ensure that they have

seating in the courtroom. Ryan also worked on venue motions, which

were argued in Oklahoma.</P>



<P>* Vicki Zemp Behenna, an assistant U.S. attorney in Oklahoma City.

Behenna, who argued the Prosecution's closed-circuit television

motion, is the only attorney on the team who has worked on the case

since the investigation began.</P>



<P>* Scott Mendeloff, an assistant U.S. attorney in Chicago. Brought in

by Hartzler, Mendeloff, the deputy chief of the office's Special

Prosecutions Division, has handled more than 35 federal prosecutions.

In the Oklahoma City case, Mendeloff cross-examined several of

defendant Terry Nichols' witnesses during the suppression hearings.

Mendeloff has a reputation for being a no-holds-barred litigator.</P>



<P>* Larry Mackey, chief of the Appellate Division in the U.S. attorney's

office in Indianapolis. Mackey, who had been a runner up for the lead

prosecutor's job, was brought on by Hartzler, who knew him largely by

reputation. Mackey had been the first assistant in the Springfield,

Ill., U.S. attorney's office before Hartzler arrived.</P>



<P>Mackey had the delicate task of cross-examining Nichols' wife, Marife.

He pulled no punches -- hammering at her for lying about her age and

skeptically questioning her version of her dealings with the Federal

Bureau of Investigation.</P>



<P>While Hartzler may be known as a tenacious litigator, he "is Lassie

compared to Mackey," says one Springfield, Ill., defense lawyer.</P>

<H2>Tigar's Stripes</H2><p>

By Janet Elliott <BR>
<I>Texas Lawyer</I><BR>
August 26, 1996<p>

Michael Tigar, having described himself simply as a law professor and father of three, faced the panel of high-ranking Air Force officers who would determine the outcome of his client's court-martial and inquired whether they had heard anything about him that might prejudice the case.<p>

Tigar, in an interview after winning an Aug. 15 acquittal for Maj. Debra Meeks on charges of sodomy and conduct unbecoming an officer, says he had in mind his representation of one of the men charged with blowing up the Oklahoma City federal building. But he also could have been remembering his early career, when he successfully challenged the Selective Service for putting Vietnam War protesters at the top of its induction lists.<p>

But the nine panel members being questioned during voir dire shook their heads, clearing the way for an old student radical to transform himself for his first court-martial into a folksy, pro-military advocate.<p>

He quoted the Bible and referred to his childhood Southern Baptist preacher and his brief stint in the Navy. He praised the profession of being a soldier, and had a catch in his throat when he talked about watching the flag pass by.<p>

Tigar says he wasn't just posturing for the military jury and meant every word of his summation. He says the conscientious objectors he represented in the '60s just wanted to "serve out of uniform."<p>

But more important than any stirring words Tigar spoke was his effectiveness in attacking the credibility of the prosecution's complaining witness.<p>

"This was a reasonable doubt case if ever there was one," says Tigar, who holds the Joseph D. Jamail Centennial Chair at the University of Texas School of Law. A key theme for the defense was that officers are potential targets for extortion by accusers who understand their vulnerability to allegations of homosexuality.<p>

In fact, several of the officers raised their hands when Tigar asked if they had ever been the subject of any kind of unjustified charge during their military careers.<p>

"I think the kinds of arguments the [court] members found compelling were the ones based on their own experience as military officers," Tigar says.<p>

Don't be misled by Tigar's posturing for the military jury, admittedly something any good trial lawyer does. He also was aware of another audience in the courtroom, an elbow-to-elbow crowd of journalists who would carry the story to the court of public opinion.<p>

Tigar's fiery question-authority persona never stayed far behind. But it emerged only outside the presence of the court panel, such as when he chastised prosecutors for eliciting testimony from their key witness that Meeks may have been involved with a female Air Force major who carries the "football," or nuclear trigger, for the vice president. At times like these, the presence of the media wasn't lost on Tigar, who looked over to see the effect of his words as reporters scribbled in their notebooks energetically.<p>

Tigar's co-counsel, former military lawyer and judge Peter Held, says he was in awe of Tigar's cross-examination of Pamela Dillard, Maj. Meeks' accuser and former roommate. Held says Tigar risked creating sympathy for Dillard, who was presented as a victim of domestic violence, if he had been too tough on her.<p>

"He was the fatherly professor," says Held. "He was very smooth and before the witnesses realized it the noose was around their neck and being tightened."<p>

Tigar was the largest presence in the small courtroom at San Antonio's Lackland Air Force Base. The judge, Lt. Col. Mary Boone, was an imposing figure in her own right. But it was Tigar, with his ramrod-straight posture and rich voice, who commanded attention.<p>

He overshadowed the prosecutors, called trial counsel in the military system. The lead trial counsel, Maj. James Flannery, was a short, balding man whose high-pitched voice squeaked at times and who always maintained a respectful demeanor. Assistant Trial Counsel Capt. Vance Spath showed the most spark and willingness to go head-to-head with defense accusations that the military lawyers had thwarted discovery and skirted ethical rules. Spath's flat-top and quick temper reminded several observers of a young Sgt. Vince Carter from the Gomer Pyle show. The other assistant trial counsel, Capt. James R.A. Byrne, played a minor role in the proceedings.<p>

TEST CASE EVAPORATES<BR>
For a lawyer who has reveled in representing some of the most notorious clients of his times, including black militant Angela Davis, accused Nazi war criminal John Demjanjuk and bombing suspect Terry Nichols, Tigar had an unusually sympathetic client in Meeks.<p>

A squadron training officer who helped match recruits to jobs, Meeks' 19-year military career was in jeopardy. She had been offered a deal to plead to the charge of conduct unbecoming an officer, which stemmed from Dillard's claim that Meeks threatened her with a gun. Meeks would have avoided a federal conviction but would have lost the retirement benefits that had been scheduled to begin this past February.<p>

Tigar says he agreed to represent Meeks because he was outraged that the Air Force added the sodomy charge after Meeks declined the plea offer involving the gun charge.<p>

He says he also thought the case might help clarify President Bill Clinton's "don't ask, don't tell" policy designed to allow homosexuals to serve in the military. Meeks, who maintained throughout the trial that her sexual life is private, had faced a similar investigation 10 years ago, her lawyers said.<p>

Meeks was provided a free military defense counsel, Maj. Dawn Eflein. Meeks hired civilian counsel in the form of Held, who had worked in the military legal system for 18 years before retiring, and sought out Tigar after learning of his reputation.<p>

Tigar agreed to take the case for his expenses. Eflein says it was clear that Tigar would serve as lead counsel during the trial and would make all tactical decisions. Held and Eflein researched and prepared all the pretrial motions, which took up the first two days of the court-martial.<p>

In many ways, the pretrial motions were more interesting than the actual testimony. The motions involved questions about whether Meeks had been selectively prosecuted and whether the sodomy charge violated the 1994 "don't ask, don't tell" policy.<p>

The defense unsuccessfully fought to look at all Air Force files on consensual sodomy prosecutions to support Tigar's contention that "not in the history of the Republic" had a case similar to that against Maj. Meeks been pursued. The military's legal definition of sodomy would allow prosecution for a married couple who engaged in oral or anal sex.<p>

Adding to the intrigue was a suggestion that the general who had reopened the investigation into the assault charge against Meeks and expanded it to include homosexual conduct had himself been asked to retire after making inappropriate comments about the commander-in-chief and women during a speech. Held told the judge he had received such information and wanted time to investigate it because it could affect the defense claim of selective prosecution. The prosecution called the request a "fishing expedition" and the judge agreed.<p>

Although Held was handling the pretrial motions, Tigar couldn't resist getting involved. It was during this phase that he got to cite two of his more famous cases. He mentioned Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada, a case involving pretrial publicity, when the trial counsel asked for a gag order. And he referred to Demjanjuk v. Petrovsky on the issue of a prosecutors' duty to provide exculpatory evidence. Tigar also got in a reference to his representation of Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, who won a pretrial dismissal of ethics charges.<p>

But the defense arguments didn't sway the judge, who denied the motions and called the panel into the courtroom.<p>

THE ACCUSER'S DIARY<BR>
The nine lieutenant colonels and colonels who indicated they had no animosity toward Tigar also expressed little negativity about homosexuals. Most said they believed homosexuality was a lifestyle that exists in today's society, and all but two said they had served with people they believed to be gay.<p>

One female panel member was excused by the judge because she said she had a relative who was gay and could not fairly consider the sodomy charge. The defense struck another panel member, leaving a group of five men and two women to hear the evidence.<p>

Tigar began his opening remarks by quoting Job: "Would that my adversary had written a book." Maj. Meeks' adversary had, Tigar said, explaining that Pamela Dillard had kept a diary in which she spoke of hating Meeks, calling her a "monster" and "Ivan the Terrible." The reference was an ironic twist given Tigar's former representation of Demjanjuk, the retired Cleveland autoworker accused of being the infamous Nazi concentration camp guard known as Ivan the Terrible.<p>

Dillard had turned the diary over to the prosecutors, apparently believing that it corroborated her accusations about the sodomy and gun threat. But the diary proved to be Dillard's undoing, as it also contained confessions that she planned to forge a friend's name to a letter of recommendation for medical school and recently had submitted an insurance claim for a car radio that actually had been stolen three years earlier. It also allowed Tigar to expose minor inconsistencies in her testimony, although he didn't shake her on the key issues.<p>

Speaking confidently on direct examination, Dillard told of meeting Meeks at a gay disco in Alexandria, Va., in late 1991. She said the two had their first sexual encounter in January 1992, and three months later, Meeks proposed marriage to her at a party attended by about 20 people.<p>

After Meeks was transferred to San Antonio in May 1992, Dillard testified that they continued their relationship long- distance until she moved to San Antonio in July 1993. Letters and sexually themed cards Dillard said she received from Meeks were introduced into evidence, although a handwriting examiner could positively identify only some of the writing as being that of Meeks.<p>

Dillard said the relationship deteriorated and that Meeks told her she wasn't being physically intimate enough. By June 1994, Dillard testified, Meeks told her to move out of the house.<p>

"I had allowed myself to become financially dependent on Debbie," Dillard testified, and said she tried contacting lawyers to see if she had any legal right to remain in the house.<p>

On Sept. 26, 1994, Dillard testified, she was cooking dinner when Meeks came home, grabbed a loaded pistol from a night stand drawer and said: "If you talk to any more lawyers about our relationship, I will have someone seek you out and kill you."<p>

A close friend of Dillard's, Jonie Isner of Reston, Va., testified that she received a frantic call from Dillard that night and advised her to call the police. A San Antonio police officer came to the house the next day and made a report.<p>

But Tigar pointed out that Dillard continued to stay in Meeks' home for several days after the alleged incident and later returned to spend a few more nights and pack up her belongings. He repeatedly referred to a diary entry where Dillard wrote that one of her motivations in talking to a lawyer was "to scare Debbie."<p>

In the end, Tigar painted a picture of Dillard as an opportunistic freeloader who wanted to stay in San Antonio so she could attend a Texas medical school.<p>

TEARS OF RELIEF<BR>
After deliberating about four hours, the court members wanted to hear the instructions again. After Judge Boone read them the directions concerning direct and circumstantial evidence, accomplice testimony, reasonable doubt and repeated the phrase that they should "vote their conscience," the jury again retired.<p>

After jurors sent out for pizza and talked for about another three hours, a verdict was reached at 10:30 p.m. Aug. 15.<p>

In the military system, a two-thirds vote is required for conviction. Court members only vote one time, a safeguard designed to prevent a member being influenced by a higher-ranking officer.<p>

Meeks had maintained her confidence throughout the trial, telling a courtroom artist to draw her smiling because she planned on winning. But once the not-guilty verdict was announced, the strain of the four-day proceeding became evident.<p>

Meeks began weeping, and after the court members left the room, she hugged Tigar, who also was crying.<p>

Outside the Lackland Law Center, Tigar made appropriate comments to media representatives, declaring the verdict "empowering to all sorts of people in the Air Force." He praised Meeks' courage but the resolve Meeks had displayed all week dissolved before the television camera's blinding lights.<p>

Meeks appeared disoriented at the shouted questions and said she just wanted to go home and see her dog. Held gently took her elbow and guided her away from the glare, saying "We need to get out of here."<p>

The bright lights of the cameras followed her to the van.<p>

MILITARY JUSTICE SYSTEM STRIVES TO KEEP INDEPENDENT DEFENSE<BR>
Dawn Eflein's voice shook with anger as she stood in the courtroom and accused military trial counsel of failing to give the defense evidence that might help them prove an Air Force major was being singled out for prosecution of consensual sodomy.<p>

Eflein had just discovered a letter the Air Force general counsel sent to Congressman Barney Frank giving details of the sodomy cases prosecuted by the Air Force in 1995. Eflein and the two civilian lawyers on Maj. Debra Meeks' defense team had been trying to get such information to argue a motion that Meeks was being selectively prosecuted on the sodomy charge. Meeks also was charged with conduct unbecoming an officer for allegedly threatening her roommate with a gun.<p>

The fact that Eflein, an Air Force major, was wearing the same uniform as the lawyers she was accusing of lacking candor didn't cause her any hesitation. Eflein knew her advocacy wouldn't affect her military career because of steps the Air Force has taken to make its public defender system as independent as possible.<p>

Area defense counsel like Eflein are outside the normal chain of command. They answer not to the commander of the base where they are stationed but to a higher-ranking defense lawyer.<p>

"There are no generals to worry about making angry with something I do," says Eflein, who returned to Lackland Air Force Base for Meeks' court martial from the University of Virginia, where she is furthering her legal education. "Our job performance is evaluated on how well we do for our clients."<p>

MILITARY SYSTEM<BR>
The unusual court martial of Meeks cast a rare public spotlight on the military justice system. <p>

Meeks' acquittal is evidence that the system is fair, says Peter Held, a former military lawyer and judge who served as one of her civilian lawyers along with University of Texas law professor Michael Tigar.<p>

"It is a very good system. It works," Held says. "This case is an obvious example."<p>

Eflein, a former Air Force nurse, began her military legal career on the prosecution side. All defense counsel are required to have prosecuted a certain number of cases before moving to defense.<p>

"They don't want you cutting your teeth on people's careers," she says.<p>

Eflein says she "went to law school to put people in jail" and wasn't sure about being tapped for defense work. But she says she found it fascinating, although, like most defense counsel, not something she wanted to do beyond her two-year rotation.<p>

Eflein is working toward an advanced degree in international law and wants to put it to use in military operations.<p>

Lt. Col. Larry McRell is chief circuit defense counsel for a 13-state area that covers the central United States. He was Eflein's boss when she was stationed at Lackland, and says her two-year stint is typical.<p>

"They start needing a break. The pace is very hectic," McRell says.<p>

CHAIN OF COMMAND<BR>
The decision to remove the defense lawyers from the chain of command came about 22 years ago, McRell says. Before that, a military lawyer might be prosecuting one day and defending the next, he says.<p>

"At the least, it created the appearance of, if in fact it didn't result in, a conflict," he says.<p>

McRell supervises 25 area defense counsel from his office at Randolph Air Force Base. He and five other senior lawyers serve as circuit defense counsel, traveling where they are needed to help the area defense counsel represent military personnel charged with more serious felony crimes.<p>

There are three area defense counsel stationed at Lackland, where most Air Force recruits receive their basic training. Because the recruits come from all different backgrounds and aren't used to the military, the Lackland defense lawyers "constantly are in the role of counseling and assisting" the trainees, McRell says.<p>

Held says that although he thinks the military justice system is superior to its civilian counterpart in many ways, he would like to see changes in selecting the officers who serve as jurors or court members, as they are called in the military. They are selected by the same officer -- often the installation commander -- who authorizes the court martial.<p>

The court members are subject to voir dire and can be stricken for cause or with the one peremptory strike each side gets. During Meeks' court martial, two members were stricken for cause, leaving seven colonels and lieutenant colonels to hear the evidence.<p>

Two-thirds of the court members have to agree on a verdict. As a safeguard against court members being influenced by higher-ranking members, they are instructed to cast only one secret ballot.<p>

Held likes the voting system.<p>

"It encourages them to have a full, open discussion about everything," he says. "Then you vote and that's it."<p>

<H2>More Power to the Bureau?</H2><p>

By Robert Schmidt <br>
<i>Legal Times</I><br>
August 5, 1996<p>

On April 21, 1995, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, furiously pursuing leads in the Oklahoma City bombing, descended on a small police station in Kansas where Terry Nichols had taken his family. The agents promptly took Nichols to the basement and grilled him for nine hours. <p>

Shortly into the interrogation, the agents presented Nichols with a waiver of his Miranda rights, which he refused to sign. Although the FBI obtained a warrant for his arrest a few hours into the questioning, it was not served until the end of the interview. <p>

Attorneys for accused bomber Nichols are arguing that the FBI, in its zeal to solve the murder of 168 people in Oklahoma, ignored the protections of the Constitution. They are trying to get their client's statements and other evidence thrown out, citing these and other alleged abuses. <p>

Few experts think that Nichols' lawyers, Ronald Woods and Michael Tigar, will succeed. Still, the testimony about police behavior in the Oklahoma City case has troubled many civil libertarians, scholars, and defense lawyers, who warn that if the FBI played it too close to the line in the Oklahoma City probe, this may be merely a taste of things to come. <p>

Particularly now, as the nation confronts what may be a growing problem of domestic terrorism in the wake of the explosion of TWA Flight 800 and the bombing at the Olympics, people who worry about police abuses see troubling warning signs emerging from the Oklahoma City trial. <p>

"When you see a major shift of power from one agency to another, you have to be very careful that it doesn't go to the head of those who obtain it," says Nicholas Kittrie, an expert on terrorism and professor at American University's Washington College of Law. "Any agency that gains that additional power wants to show they are successful, and there is a great danger that they will look for some shortcuts." <p>

Last week, President Bill Clinton and lawmakers met to begin negotiations on an anti-terrorism bill that would grant new, widespread wiretapping authority to the bureau. Other proposals are currently being floated to increase the FBI's budget and the size of its work force. <p>

Even without additional powers and resources, the profile of the FBI has been changing. As both Democrats and Republicans have tried to show they are tough on crime, they have hiked the FBI's budget for hiring agents, some of whom are not up to the bureau's previously high standards, according to some critics. <p>

"A new breed of agent is [working now], and there are a lot less checks and balances," says Nancy Luque, a white collar criminal defense partner at the D.C. office of Reed Smith Shaw & McClay. "There is no bright line these days, and the courts don't do anything to deter bad cops anymore." <p>

Testimony earlier this summer in pretrial hearings on defense motions to suppress evidence in the Oklahoma City case certainly shows that there is no strict guideline for agents to follow in investigating a high-profile, fast-moving case. <p>

And just last week in Atlanta, the bureau was strongly criticized for allegedly leaking the fact that it had begun to consider Richard Jewell, the security guard who found the bomb in Centennial Olympic Park, a prime suspect in the crime. <p>

"In these high-profile cases, where the public is outraged, the FBI as a matter of public relations wants to satisfy the thirsts of the crowd," says Gerald Shargel, a prominent New York criminal defense attorney. <p>

The FBI has plenty of defenders, who say the bureau does -- and can be expected to continue to do -- an excellent job of solving crimes while still safeguarding the rights of citizens. <p>

"I think the FBI is still the world's best investigative agency that operates within the framework of a written constitution," says Joseph diGenova, a former U.S. attorney and a partner in D.C.'s diGenova & Toensing. <p>

At a congressional hearing Aug. 1, FBI Director Louis Freeh said publicity like that about Jewell is an unfortunate consequence of many major investigations. <p>

"We regret many times in these investigations that people's names surface as suspects who are later proven not to be connected," Freeh testified. <p>

The Atlanta probe is only in its earliest stages. But the year-old Nichols matter, which is now pending before Chief U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch in Denver, may become a touchstone for how far the FBI can go to obtain evidence and make its case. <p>

"The FBI cut every corner, broke every rule," claims Ronald Woods, a former U.S. attorney in Houston and former FBI agent who serves as appointed counsel for Nichols. "I think this was just a big case to them. The bigger the case, the looser the rules become." <p>

In addition to his concerns about the nine-hour interrogation of Nichols and the alleged disregard of his Miranda rights, Woods says the FBI's treatment of Nichols' Filipino wife, Marife, was particularly egregious. <p>

WIFE ALLEGES MISTREATMENT <br>
Marife Nichols, who was 21, pregnant, and still nursing their young daughter, was interviewed at the police station in Kansas and then taken by the FBI to a nearby hotel after she was told it wasn't safe to go back home. With her husband in jail, she remained for 37 days under the watchful eye of FBI agents, who took her to eight different cities. During this time, she gave consent for 13 searches of the Nichols' property. <p>

Judge Matsch is expected to rule shortly on the motion by Woods and lead counsel Tigar to suppress the evidence acquired as a result of these and other searches. <p>

Maureen Cain, a Denver solo practitioner who represents Marife Nichols, says she is considering filing suit against the FBI for its treatment of her client. <p>

Tigar and Woods also cite other alleged FBI abuses in their treatment of Terry and Marife Nichols: <p>

*A Filipino resident alien, Marife testified that she was never told by the FBI that she had the right to speak with a lawyer, and also testified that she didn't understand she could refuse consent for the searches. <p>

*The FBI seized $5,000 in cash, nine gold coins, and three silver coins that belonged to Marife. She repeatedly asked for the money back but was told it was being tested to see if bombing defendant Timothy McVeigh's fingerprints were on any of the bills. Shortly after Marife spoke with her husband's attorneys, the FBI returned $4,800 of her money. <p>

*Five days after Terry Nichols was arrested, the FBI told his wife that they would arrange for her to telephone him. An agent asked Marife if they could tape the call, and Marife testified that she felt the taping was a condition of making the call. <p>

*Agents were not wholly truthful with Terry Nichols before he was arrested. When he asked why his name was on television and radio, Special Agent Stephen Smith told Nichols that he didn't know. Smith also agreed to give Terry a copy of any notes the agents made during their interview. During the pretrial suppression hearings, Smith testified that he was not planning to hand over the notes but that he hadn't lied because he knew Nichols could get them during discovery. <p>

*Terry Nichols was told three times he was "free to leave" the police station. But, shortly after he came in for questioning, the FBI secured his home and pickup truck. <p>

Was the bureau conducting a "military-style operation reminiscent of Ruby Ridge and Waco," as Nichols' lawyers say? Or, as federal prosecutors contend in a brief in the Nichols case, was the FBI "acting with remarkable diligence and in a manner that honored the Constitution"? <p>

Both sides are partly right, according to experts in criminal procedure and others who study the FBI. (FBI General Counsel Howard Shapiro declines comment, citing a protective order issued by Judge Matsch.) <p>

"The FBI probably should not have come this close to jeopardizing their case," says Paul Rothstein, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center and an expert on criminal procedure. "But I think legally they are just within the bounds of the law." <p>

Adds James X. Dempsey, who handled FBI oversight for 10 years as a House Judiciary Committee staffer and is now deputy director of the Center for National Security Studies: "The FBI, maybe more than any other agency, understands the power of the concepts of consent and waiver, and they work very hard to keep people away from lawyers, but they do it within parameters that have been upheld by the courts." <p>

EXCEPTIONS EXPLOITED <br>
These parameters have been set in the last 25 years by the Supreme Court under conservative Chief Justices Warren Burger and William Rehnquist. <p>

While courts have always been loath to suppress evidence, the Supreme Court in recent years has generally limited the scope of the protections against coercive interrogations and illegal searches granted defendants during the tenure of Chief Justice Earl Warren. <p>

Although the Court has kept in place the essence of the landmark Warren-era decisions, such as suspects' rights to counsel and to remain silent, it has created a number of exceptions to the rules. <p>

In response, the FBI has shown that it is not only willing to take advantage of these exceptions, it trains agents to exploit them. That training seemed to be on display in the Oklahoma City bombing probe. <p>

"Search and seizure law has changed dramatically in the last 15 years," says diGenova, the former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. "[Agents] receive regular training on what the law is, they know how far they can go, and we expect them to know what those limits are." <p>

The limits, however, are not always clearly defined. <p>

"Courts usually don't give [law enforcement officers] advisory opinions--they tell them whether it will fly or not," says E. Lawrence Barcella Jr., a former prosecutor and partner in the D.C. office of Los Angeles' Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker. <p>

Barcella says in a case he was arguing, a judge once explained it this way: "In suppression cases, we treat our police the way we train dogs," the judge said. "We don't tell them how to do it right. We wait until they do it wrong and then hit them on nose with a rolled-up newspaper." <p>

The FBI's defenders point out that the bureau must be doing a good job since the evidence it gathers is rarely suppressed. And if controversial investigatory tactics have been upheld by the courts, FBI agents shouldn't come under fire for using them. <p>

For example, says journalist and longtime FBI observer Ronald Kessler, courts have said it is permissible for agents to lie in the course of interrogating a person in order to get them to confess. So the FBI follows that guideline. <p>

"They are aggressive, and they do go as far as they can go legally. It's an agency that is very conscious of obeying the law," says Kessler, author of The FBI: Inside the World's Most Powerful Law Enforcement Agency. "I think they've really done a superb job of catching criminals and staying within the law and the Constitution." <p>

As a practical matter, the law seems to bend a little when law enforcement officers are hurriedly investigating a major crime. Domestic terrorism--like the Oklahoma City bombing, where 168 people were killed and more than 500 injured--is an area where courts are more willing to give the benefit of the doubt to police. <p>

For instance, the FBI agents on the scene in Kansas were worried that Terry Nichols may have been planning another bombing or that his house was rigged with explosives. Any evaluation of the bureau's treatment of Nichols should be made with the exigent circumstances in mind, say criminal procedure experts. <p>

"It was two days after the bombing, and [agents] were working under incredible pressure," says William Pizzi, who teaches criminal procedure at the University of Colorado School of Law. "This is a very tough world, pressure is brought on suspects, and that is what it's like when you have a very serious crime like this." <p>

However, allowing the FBI or other law enforcement agencies to push defendants a little more than necessary in perilous or fast-moving cases sets a dangerous precedent, say some critics. Once the courts have approved the FBI's behavior, they say, the agency doesn't hesitate to act that way again. <p>

"We shouldn't be trusting anybody with these powers, even if all FBI agents were as upright as Eliot Ness," says Arthur Spitzer, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of the National Capital Area. <p>

These expansions of police power flourished in the war on drugs and now can be seen in domestic terrorism cases such as Oklahoma City and Atlanta. <p>

Many law enforcement standards, such as the length of time police wait before breaking a door down or the degree of suspicion they need to search a car, fell by the wayside in drug cases because drugs are so easy to get rid of or hide, explains Barbara Allen Babcock, a professor at Stanford Law School. <p>

"What's really eroding [the Fourth Amendment] is the war on drugs. Put it together with the fear of domestic terrorism, and it really can be a powerful hydraulic force that undermines all of our liberty," says Babcock. <p>

Critics fear that if the court in Denver admits the evidence obtained with Marife Nichols' consent, the FBI may in the future keep another suspect's wife for 37 days or, more generally, take additional bites out of the Fourth Amendment. <p>

"Once some kind of method is upheld, it applies to everybody," says Babcock, who used to head the Public Defender Service in Washington. "Criminal defendants are the representatives of all of us. They are ones whose cases decide the rights that apply to all of us." <p>

<H2>Fine-Tuning TV Coverage</H2>

<P>By Robert Schmidt<BR>
Legal Times<BR>
July 22, 1996</P>

<P>DENVER--In permitting a closed-circuit broadcast of the Oklahoma City bombing trial last week, Chief U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch managed both to satisfy a congressional mandate that the trial be televised and to address defense attorneys' vocal concerns for their clients' right to a fair trial.</P>

<P>Matsch's July 15 bench ruling focused solely on whether it was constitutional for Congress to order the broadcast in the 1996 anti-terrorism law--but left open some tricky issues relating to the logistics of setting up the coverage.</P>

<P>And although the ruling significantly increases the chances that the telecast will occur, a number of pitfalls remain. Matsch will make a final decision on the matter after an upcoming hearing on how to establish the coverage and protect the feed from people who might pirate the signal.</P>

<P>There are a lot of problems . . . about the terms and conditions," Matsch said from the bench. "These problems may be insurmountable."</P>

<P>While Congress ordered Matsch to allow the camera in his courtroom so victims' families could watch the trial in Oklahoma City, lawmakers also allowed him to control the coverage. The judge's comments indicated that he will narrowly interpret the new law and keep a close watch over the broadcast.</P>

<P>The closed-circuit law, signed by President Bill Clinton in April, was tailor-made for the Oklahoma City case. The measure states that if a trial is moved from its original location out of state and more than 350 miles away, "the trial court shall order closed-circuit televising of the proceedings to that location, for viewing by such persons the court determines have a compelling interest in doing so and are otherwise unable to do so by reason of the inconvenience and expenses caused by the change of venue."</P>

<P>Several Colorado attorneys who know Matsch said he has been adamantly opposed to cameras in federal trials. They say his narrow reading of the law was his attempt to make the best of this situation.</P>

<P>"The dignity of the federal courts is something he would never tamper with," says Larry Pozner of Denver's Pozner & Kaplan. "That camera is going to disappear in that courtroom, and if it doesn't disappear, he's going to make it disappear."</P>

<P>Indeed, Matsch went out of his way to respond to concerns about possible interference with the defendants' rights to a fair trial--concerns that were raised vehemently by lawyers Michael Tigar and Stephen Jones in oral argument at last week's hearing.</P>

<P>"Counsel for the accused have presented this possible parade of horribles about what can happen at a trial with television cameras and microphones and directors and zoom lenses and all of those things," Matsch said. "Well, that's not going to happen."</P>

<P>As Matsch envisioned the broadcast, a feed would go exclusively to a courtroom in Oklahoma City, where seating would be limited and judicial officers would watch over the proceedings. In the Denver courtroom, the one camera would be tucked into the wall. Matsch would have a kill switch and said he would not hesitate to use it should a problem crop up. Jurors would be asked during voir dire whether the camera would affect their impartiality.</P>

<P>"I am much relieved at how he plans to do it," says Jones, who represents accused bomber Timothy McVeigh. "If he follows through on what he said he will do, I don't see how the defendants will be prejudiced."</P>

<P>Jones says he is most worried about victims who are "on a juggernaut to convict my client and Mr. Nichols" holding curbside press conferences in Oklahoma during the proceedings. However, Jones says, Judge Matsch may limit those as well.</P>

<P>One victim, during court hearings last month, announced outside of court that she wanted to climb into the well of the courtroom and claw McVeigh's eyes out. Her comments were widely shown on the evening news.</P>

<P>Tigar, who represents defendant Terry Nichols, said he may raise the issue should there be an appeal, but said he would not bother to mandamus the judge over the closed-circuit broadcast.</P>

<P>"We think it is raisable in the event of an appeal," Tigar told reporters after the hearing. "The government won a temporary tactical advantage that could put the whole [case] at risk."</P>

<P>One thing is certain: The broadcast, as described by Matsch, will not be winning any Emmy awards.</P>

<P>"To my mind, that means a fixed focus--a panoramic view, if you will: a view of the well of the court, not the jury, probably, and no movement of the camera, no focusing on speakers, or witnesses, or anybody else," Matsch said.</P>

<P>At his post-hearing press conference, Tigar noted that the judge's description would produce boring television.</P>

<P>"It's a little bit like watching your ant farm, I think," he said.</P>

<P>Despite the likelihood that the coverage will not be stimulating to watch, victims' family members and survivors of the blast hailed the ruling.</P>

<P>"We're delighted that the judge allowed the closed-circuit television, even though there will be a panoramic view with no zoom-in capacity and you won't be able to see the jury," says Paul Heath, president of the OK City Murrah Building Survivors Association, who was at work in the building at the time of the bombing. "Many of the survivors and family members who work and the injured who are still being treated by doctors will have the opportunity to attend the trial."</P>

<P>STOKING VICTIMS<BR>
The impact of the closed-circuit television decision and other legal issues involving crime victims in the Oklahoma City bombing trial is reverberating in Washington and across the country.</P>

<P>National victims' rights groups have been paying attention to the case and are now using it to propel the movement for a constitutional amendment to protect victims' rights.</P>

<P>"We are continually citing this case for why you need a constitutional amendment," says David Beatty, acting director of the National Victim Center in Arlington, Va. "It is a perfect illustration of how victims are not a party to these cases, and how sometimes victims have fewer rights than the average citizen."</P>

<P>A number of Judge Richard Matsch's decisions have infuriated the victims' family members and survivors who have been attending the pretrial hearings.</P>

<P>In particular, the family members were outraged over Matsch's decision to exclude all people from the proceedings who planned to make victim-impact statements during the penalty phase of the trial. In making his decision, Matsch invoked Rule 615 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which allows witnesses to be barred from trial proceedings so their testimony is not influenced by other witnesses.</P>

<P>Other rulings that have angered victims include Matsch's decisions not to guarantee them seats in the courtroom and forbidding them from wearing jewelry, including religious objects, that brings back the memories of their dead loved ones.</P>

<P>The judge's decision excluding witnesses wanting to make victim-impact statements may have gone too far, say several legal experts.</P>

<P>"The only thing the victims are going to be testifying about is what the loss of their loved ones means to them, and the danger of shaping testimony is very limited," says William Pizzi, a professor at University of Colorado School of Law who teaches criminal procedure. "I think the ruling was too sweeping, too strong, and it is unfair to the victims."</P>

<P>Peter Goldberger, a criminal defense lawyer in Ardmore, Pa., and an expert on the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, says the rule Matsch relied on to exclude the victims applies only to the guilt-or-innocence phase of trial. The victims would be making their statements in the sentencing phase.</P>

<P>"I'm not saying it's a bad ruling or wrong ruling, but Rule 615 does not apply to sentencing," Goldberger says.</P>

<P>That decision, which was issued from the bench in June at the start of a hearing, took the prosecutors and about 30 family members and survivors who traveled from Oklahoma completely by surprise. It forced the victims to decide during a recess if they wanted to forfeit their seats in the courtroom. More than half the family members decided to watch the proceedings.</P>

<P>Editor's note: The transcript of Judge Matsch's ruling on closed-circuit television is available on Counsel Connect in the Court Systems section of the Library.</P>

<P>BAR BASH<BR>
Apparently Judge Richard Matsch has better things to do than glad-hand lawyers in sunny climes--or maybe he is tired of listening to Terry Nichols' defense lawyer, Michael Tigar.</P>

<P>During a courtroom discussion on scheduling last week, Tigar noted that he would be unavailable the first week in August because he was giving a speech at the American Bar Association meeting in Orlando.</P>

<P>"I don't know if the court intends to be there," Tigar said. "I've been invited to give a talk there, and I intend to do it."</P>

<P>Matsch shot back: "I don't intend to be there, for your talk or any other."</P>

<P>Not missing a beat, Tigar replied: "I wanted to warn you in case you were going there. But it's in Orlando and my daughter voted that I go there, and so therefore there will be two Mickey Mouse events--my talk and then our visit."</P>

<P>ODDS AND ENDS<BR>
* For reporters covering the bombing case, one constant has been press conferences by McVeigh attorney Stephen Jones outside the courthouse during breaks in the pretrial hearings. Nichols' lawyer, Michael Tigar, and lead prosecutor Joseph Hartzler, on the other hand, have merely waved to reporters as they hustled back to their offices. Not only have the two refused to talk, but they have damned Jones for his cozy relationship with reporters and subtly accused him of leaking discovery material. So imagine Jones' surprise during the June and July pretrial hearings, when he was forced to wait in line for a chance to speak in front of the courthouse--behind both Hartzler and Tigar. "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery," says Jones with a smirk. "I now have to fight my way to the microphones."</P>

<P>* Oklahoma City U.S. Attorney Patrick Ryan, a member of the prosecution team, missed last week's hearing after falling out of a tree and shattering his hip. Ryan, who was helping his father with yard work, underwent surgery this week and is recovering quickly, according to a prosecution spokeswoman.</P>

<P>* Michael Tigar hasn't let his pro bono work slide during the Oklahoma City case. He's representing Maj. Deborah Meeks, an Air Force officer in San Antonio accused of pulling a gun on her housemate. After Meeks refused to plead guilty at a nonjudicial proceeding, a separate charge of engaging in consensual sodomy with the same woman was added by the Air Force. Meeks faces a general court-martial on Aug. 12.</P>

<h2>Bombing Case Lawyer Redraws Map</h2>
<P>Robert Schmidt <br><i>
Legal Times<br></i>
June 18, 1996</p>

<P>Look in any road atlas, and you'll find that Denver is 609 miles from Oklahoma City. But don't tell that to defense lawyer Michael Tigar, who managed to shave more than 300 miles off that distance in a recent court filing in the Oklahoma City bombing case.</P>

<P>Tigar, who represents defendant Terry Nichols, indulged in some creative math and used some novel legal reasoning to argue that a closed-circuit broadcast should not be permitted in the bombing trial. The defense team representing co-defendant Timothy McVeigh also opposed the coverage.</P>

<P>At issue is a new federal law requiring the U.S. District Court in Denver to provide a television feed of the trial solely for the victims and their families to watch back in Oklahoma City.</P>

<P>Members of the Oklahoma congressional delegation tacked the requirement onto the anti-terrorism law, which was passed in April. In May, the federal prosecution team asked the presiding judge, Richard Matsch, to set up the broadcast. Prosecutors wrote in their brief that the coverage "will simply expand the courtroom to people who would have observed the trial in person had the venue not been changed." Matsch has not yet ruled on the issue.</P>

<P>This potential electronic expansion of the courtroom is hailed by victim advocates, but worries some litigators and constitutional experts, who say it could violate the rights both of defendants and of people who want to watch the trial.</P>

<P>The new law states that the court shall establish the broadcast "in cases where the venue of the trial is changed out of the state in which the case was initially brought; and more than 350 miles from the location in which those proceedings originally would have taken place." But Tigar, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, claimed in his brief that a literal reading of the law shows that it does not apply to the bombing trial that it was intended to reach.</P>

<P>Building his argument around the words "location" and "venue," Tigar says that the trial was actually moved to the federal district of Colorado and not specifically to Denver. And the distance from Oklahoma City to the Colorado state border is less than 300 miles--which would fall below the 350-mile threshold established in the legislation.</P>

<P>"The venue of the trial has been changed [from Oklahoma City or Lawton, Okla.] out of the state where the case was originally brought and [a certain distance] from the location where those proceedings would originally have taken place," Tigar wrote.</P>

<P>"The new venue is Colorado, a judicial district comprising the entire state. We must therefore ask whether it is more than 350 miles from Oklahoma City (or Lawton) to the Colorado state line." In case that argument doesn't work, Tigar also contended that the closed-circuit requirement was an unconstitutional usurpation of the judiciary's powers and that the prosecutors failed to show that the bombing case met the proper requirements for a broadcast.</P>

<P>Timothy McVeigh's legal team, headed by Enid, Okla., lawyer Stephen Jones, also argued that the broadcast was unconstitutional. In a more conventional brief, the team claims that the closed-circuit law violates the separation of powers doctrine, as well as McVeigh's Sixth Amendment guarantee of a fair trial and his rights to due process and equal protection of the laws.</P>

<P>Most important, McVeigh's attorneys note, Congress went too far when it imposed this requirement on the judiciary.</P>

<P>"This statute ties the judge's hands," says McVeigh lawyer Randall Coyne, a professor on leave from the University of Oklahoma College of Law. "The court's responsibility is not to provide comfort for victims, but to provide a fair trial for defendants." </P>

<h2>Rethinking the 5th</h2>

<P>Stuart Taylor Jr.<BR>
<I>Legal Times</I><BR>
July 17, 1995</P>

<P>When Timothy McVeigh was charged in April with the Oklahoma City
bombing, something very revealing happened. </P>

<P>McVeigh said nothing. He did not say, "I had nothing to do with it."
He did not say, "You've got the wrong guy." In fact, he has never, to
this date, said anything like that. </P>

<P>McVeigh's nondenial is highly probative -- indeed, it is what most
convinces me of his probable guilt. But the jury at his trial will
never be told about it. </P>

<P>Why not? </P>

<P>And if McVeigh fails to take the stand at trial to assert his
innocence or explain where he was and what he was doing at the time
of the murders with which he is charged, the prosecutor will be
barred from commenting on his silence, and the jury will be
instructed that no inference of guilt can be drawn. </P>

<P>Why not? </P>

<P>The answer, of course, is the Fifth Amendment provision that "[n]o
person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness
against himself," as it has been construed by the Supreme Court. </P>

<P>The constitutional language clearly gives every criminal defendant
the right to remain silent at trial. The Warren Court and its
predecessors, going back to 1886, extended the privilege to (among
other things) pretrial proceedings and police station interrogations;
stretched the meaning of the word "compelled" in the Fifth Amendment
to require the familiar Miranda warnings and to bar prosecutors from
making reference either to a defendant's silence after arrest or to
his or her failure to testify at trial; and mandated exclusion from
evidence both of "compelled" pretrial statements and of any physical
or other evidence (such as the location of a murder weapon or the
names of witnesses) derived from such statements. </P>

<P>The deeper question, debated for more than a century, but never laid
to rest, is whether all this makes much sense, or whether the Fifth
Amendment privilege -- at least as stretched by the Court -- serves
primarily to shield guilty defendants, with social costs that far
outweigh any benefits. </P>

<P>The breadth of the Fifth Amendment's shield for the guilty has long
baffled many ordinary citizens and has troubled an especially
illustrious list of scholars and judges. Among the many luminaries
who have criticized either the privilege itself, or the Court's gloss
on it, as a kind of misbegotten growth on an otherwise sound Bill of
Rights, have been English philosopher Jeremy Bentham, legal scholar
John Henry Wigmore, Harvard Law School Dean Roscoe Pound, and Judge
Henry Friendly of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, who
wrote in 1968 that the Court "has stretched the privilege not only
beyond its language and history but any justification in policy." </P>

<P>DRAMATIC REINTERPRETATION <br>
Now comes Professor Akhil Amar of Yale Law School in an impressive
72-page article (co-written by Rene Lettow, a student), entitled
"Fifth Amendment First Principles: The Self-Incrimination Clause," in
the just-published March issue of the Michigan Law Review. </P>

<P>Amar makes a provocative, well-crafted argument for a dramatic
reinterpretation of the privilege that would (among other things)
allow police or prosecutors to interrogate arrested suspects, in
judicially supervised pretrial depositions, on pain of contempt for
refusing to answer and of perjury for failing to tell the truth. </P>

<P>While the government could not use the defendant's testimony against
him at trial -- which would flout the clear original intent of the
Fifth Amendment -- it could use any physical evidence, names of
witnesses, or other leads or reliable evidence derived from such
interrogations. </P>

<P>Amar grounds his proposals in a conception of the privilege as
evincing a core purpose of protecting innocent defendants from being
convicted based on a species of unreliable evidence: testimony
compelled from an unpracticed defendant-witness who can be
manipulated by a clever prosecutor into looking like a guilty liar to
the jury. In Amar's view, the privilege should protect the guilty
only as a necessary incident of the need to protect the innocent
defendant from being compelled literally "to be a witness against
himself" at trial. </P>

<P>If reliability is the touchstone, Amar reasons, the privilege is
offended neither by the compulsion of incriminating testimony before
trial (so long as it is not introduced at trial) nor by the use at
trial of any reliable evidence (such as the location of a murder
weapon) that may be derived from the compelled testimony. </P>

<P>Amar has already drawn a ripsnorting, 81-page rebuttal (in the same
issue of the law review) from Professor Yale Kamisar of the
University of Michigan Law School, long a leading scholarly advocate
of using broad Fifth Amendment rules to deter abusive police
interrogations. Kamisar is persuasive (and exhaustive!) in arguing
that Amar's proposals would amount to a far more radical demolition
of more than a century of Supreme Court precedent than Amar
acknowledges. Kamisar also warns plausibly that Amar's approach could
encourage third-degree interrogation techniques by allowing police to
use even evidence derived from confessions coerced behind closed
doors without judicial supervision. </P>

<P>Still, Amar (like Judge Friendly and others) makes a compelling case
that Fifth Amendment doctrine is bloated with unwarranted extensions
and riddled with internal inconsistencies and incongruities. He (like
they) also torpedoes the flaccid policy rationales -- "ringing but
vacuous pronouncement[s]" and "cacophonous clichs," in Friendly's
words -- that have been offered by the Supreme Court and others over
the years for a privilege that so generously shields the guilty, not
only from police misconduct but also from being put to the slightest
disadvantage for refusing to respond even to the most civilized and
carefully monitored kinds of pretrial questioning. </P>

<P>Take the Warren Court's assertion in Murphy v. Waterfront Commission
(1964) that the privilege reflects "our unwillingness to subject
those suspected of a crime to the cruel trilemma of self-accusation,
perjury, or contempt." </P>

<P>But there is no "cruel trilemma" for the innocent. They can simply
tell the truth. As Mickey Kaus (now of The New Republic) has written,
the Court was in effect saying that it would be too cruel for "a
guilty man asked to testify [to be] placed between a rock and a hard
place. So he is. But isn't that exactly where we want him? . . . Why
should the Constitution reach down and extricate him from the trap he
has gotten himself into?" </P>

<P>The Court's further rationale in Murphy that an expansive Fifth
Amendment privilege is warranted by "our preference for an
accusatorial rather than an inquisitorial system of criminal
justice," in which prosecutors and police must prove their cases
without forcing defendants to assist in their own convictions, smacks
of the "sporting theory" of justice as a game played for its own
sake, rather than a truth-seeking process. It is also belied by the
broad powers of prosecutors to compel defendants to provide such
physical evidence as their fingerprints, voice prints, and blood. </P>

<P>Justices and commentators have also argued that an underlying purpose
of the privilege is to protect the "private enclave" of each
individual. But this argument cannot be reconciled with the
established doctrines that testimony about intensely private matters
can be compelled by the government from witnesses who have done
nothing wrong or who have been granted immunity, and by civil
litigants in (for example) divorce cases. </P>

<P>Then there is the notion that we need a broad Fifth Amendment
privilege as a shield for dissidents. The privilege still inspires
affection among many liberals because of its undoubted value in
shielding alleged Communists and others accused of ideological heresy
by red-hunting congressional committees during the McCarthy era, and
during other witch hunts going back to the Star Chamber. But
notwithstanding this pedigree, the best protection against witch
hunts in today's world lies in the First Amendment, rather than in a
bloated privilege that serves primarily to shield violent criminals
and white collar crooks. </P>

<P>The most compelling argument for such Warren Court expansions of the
privilege as Miranda v. Arizona (1966) is the need to deter police
from using brutality or abusive "third-degree" interrogations to
obtain coerced confessions -- which are inherently unreliable in
themselves and are often embroidered in police reports and testimony.</P>


<P>But while some advocates of expansive Fifth Amendment rules tend to
equate all forms of questioning with cops using rubber hoses, Amar
points out that in fact, "[b]y effectively preventing formal,
civilized depositions -- by creating an overly strong Fifth Amendment
immunity -- perhaps we are driving interrogation underground, in ways
that make some citizens more vulnerable and the weakest most
vulnerable of all." </P>

<P>It is easier to conclude that the Fifth Amendment privilege, as
construed by the Court, is too broad than to agree on how to fix it.
I am not entirely convinced, for example, of Amar's view that the
Supreme Court properly could responsibly adopt his proposals simply
by rejiggering its case law. So dramatic a departure from a century
of precedent might require a constitutional amendment even if it is a
good idea. And I question whether it is a good idea, to the extent
that Amar would remove the Fifth Amendment as an obstacle to police
use of the fruits of coerced station-house confessions. (He would
rely solely on statutory and administrative remedies, including
damage suits, to deter police misconduct, and he notes that the
Fourth Amendment is a more logical vehicle than the Fifth for
judge-made rules of deterrence.) </P>

<P>A MODEST PROPOSAL <br>
There is much to be said, on the other hand, for a much older, more
modest proposal for seeking recorded pretrial testimony from
defendants -- one that eschews compulsion via the threat of contempt,
but would allow comment at trial upon a defendant's pretrial silence.
Proposals fitting this basic model trace back at least to 1932 and
have been endorsed by scholars including Judge Friendly, in an
important series of lectures published in 1968, entitled "The Fifth
Amendment Tomorrow: The Case for Constitutional Change." </P>

<P>Under this approach, a statute might give police and prosecutors the
power to interrogate defendants as soon as they have been arrested,
in on-the-record investigative proceedings supervised by judicial
magistrates. The defendant would be told that he has a right to
remain silent, but that in any subsequent trial, his refusal to
answer questions or respond to accusations could be disclosed to the
judge and jury, and the prosecution could argue that this silence is
suggestive of guilt. </P>

<P>Judge Friendly proposed including such a regime as part of a broader
constitutional amendment. But a statute prescribing this approach
might pass muster with the current Supreme Court. While it would
require overruling some case law, it would do no violence either to
the language of the Fifth Amendment or to any reasonable policy that
the amendment serves today. </P>

<P>The benefits of such a statute in terms of convicting the guilty
would be considerable: If a Timothy McVeigh, for example, refused to
answer questions at such a pretrial hearing, the jury at his trial
could be told of his silence and invited to draw appropriate
inferences. </P>

<P>Such a statute would also have the virtue of lessening the current
system's de facto discrimination in favor of white collar defendants
and professional criminals, who, unlike defendants in ordinary street
crimes, typically are not subjected to back-room police
interrogations, or indeed to any interrogation unless they volunteer.
And it might reduce (at least marginally) the current incentives for
police to use subtle coercion or trickery to coax or browbeat
defendants (including some innocent ones) into waiving their Miranda
rights and giving unreliable, back-room confessions. </P>

<P>Should prosecutors also be able to comment on a defendant's failure
to take the stand at trial? Should judges be able to instruct that
the defendant's silence may in some circumstances warrant an
inference of guilt? Those are closer calls. As the Supreme Court held
in Griffin v. California (1965), such practices (which Griffin barred
as unconstitutional) would exact a significant price for exercising
the core Fifth Amendment privilege, especially because any inference
of guilt may be misplaced. An innocent defendant may elect not to
testify for several reasons, including concern that he may make an
unconvincing witness or that prior convictions or other discrediting
facts will be used to impeach him. I don't think this price rises to
the level of unconstitutional compulsion in every case. Amar thinks
it does. </P>

<P>But how many innocent defendants would insist on remaining silent at
on-the-record pretrial hearings held for the sole purpose of finding
investigative leads and providing police and prosecutors with the
defendant's side of the story? </P>

<P>Not very many. </P>

<h2>The NRA Under the Gun</h2>

<P>Naftali Bendavid<BR>
<I>Legal Times</I><BR>
May 1, 1995</P>

<P>At a turbulent convention 18 years ago in Cincinnati, a group of
insurgent National Rifle Association members revolted against their
leaders, setting what had been a moderate sporting organization on a
path of hard-line political activism and harsh anti-government
rhetoric.</P>

<P>The reconstituted NRA, some say, ultimately laid the philosophical
groundwork for the rise of paramilitary groups like the Michigan
Militia. And the Oklahoma City tragedy now confronts the gun lobby
and its supporters with a wrenching question: Should they seek to
distance themselves from the militias and retreat from their longtime
strategy of demonizing government to justify gun ownership?</P>

<P>Wayne LaPierre, NRA executive vice president, says the group is not
considering a change in approach. "It doesn't accomplish anything to
lower the rhetoric if the abuses don't stop," LaPierre says,
referring to government raids he considers overzealous. "If the NRA
is beaten into lowering its rhetoric, will the African-American
community be beaten into lowering its rhetoric when a police abuse
occurs?" </P>

<P>But some NRA-watchers, including allies, say NRA leaders disagree on
what message the group should send now. Sorting out how -- if at all
-- the group should alter its strategy in the aftermath of the
bombing is likely to be a heated topic at the NRA's upcoming
convention May 20 in Phoenix. </P>

<P>"There are differences of opinion within the NRA itself on how they
are going to come down," says Lawrence Pratt, executive director of
Gun Owners of America. "It's something they'll have to thrash out.
You have quite a range of opinion on the NRA board." </P>

<P>Gun-control activists already are doing their best to use the bombing
to embarrass the NRA -- and goad the group into moderation -- by
shining a hot light on its connections with the militias. </P>

<P>"As the NRA has found itself in increasingly difficult battles, they
have been willing to reach out to the further fringes of American gun
society," says Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the
Washington-based Violence Policy Center, which researches firearms
violence. "The NRA's problem is that they don't differentiate anymore
between your run-of-the-mill gun nuts and your real nuts with guns."</P>

<P>Some of the connections between NRA leaders and militias are
relatively direct. Robert Brown, a member of the NRA executive
committee, is also publisher of Soldier of Fortune magazine, which
ran articles in its April and May issues supporting militias (along
with a much shorter one questioning them). </P>

<P>And earlier this year, NRA lobbyists rode to the rescue when they
heard rumors that the feds were about to raid certain militia groups.
Thomas Wyld, director of public relations and communications for the
NRA, wrote to the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms to express concern and seek information about any such
raid. </P>

<P>The membership of the militias and the NRA also overlaps, at least
somewhat. "Quite a few of us are members of the NRA," says Neil Watt,
regimental commander of the Texas Light Infantry, whose members dress
like soldiers and conduct military-style maneuvers. </P>

<P>But there is a more fundamental connection between the NRA and the
fatigue-clad weekend warriors. The NRA for years has pushed a
philosophy that justifies -- almost demands -- the militias'
existence: Citizens need guns to protect themselves against
tyrannical government, and parts of the U.S. government have become
fascistic. </P>

<P>A host of NRA literature -- assembled by groups like the Violence
Policy Center and Handgun Control Inc. -- illustrates the fever pitch
NRA leaders can hit when preaching to the faithful. </P>

<P>"Not too long ago, it was unthinkable for federal agents wearing nazi
bucket helmets and black storm-trooper uniforms to attack law-abiding
citizens," says a recent mailing appeal signed by LaPierre. "Not
today, not with Clinton." </P>

<P>The June 1994 issue of American Rifleman, the NRA magazine, includes
a special report apocalyptically titled, "The Final War Has Begun."
The article cites an alleged government plan to deglamorize guns and
reduce gun owners to a "manageable" number. "That's the fascist
language of Stalin, Hitler, Castro and Saddam Hussein," the article
says. "How many is 'manageable'? Who's going to 'manage' you and how
-- with fines and jail, or with tanks and clubs like Tiananmen
Square?" </P>

<P>Meanwhile, a newspaper column written last December by NRA executive
committee member Neal Knox suggests the assassinations of President
John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. were part of a conspiracy
to enact gun control. "Is it possible that some of those incidents
could have been created for the purpose of disarming the people of
the free world?" Knox writes. "It's possible." </P>

<P>The sharpest NRA rhetoric, though, is reserved for the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the agency that enforces federal gun
laws. Agents' recent confrontations with the Branch Davidians in
Waco, Texas, and with white supremacist Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge,
Idaho, are frequently cited as examples of ATF horrors. </P>

<P>Sometimes, ATF agents are likened to Nazis. </P>

<P>Jeff Cooper, an NRA board member in Arizona, in comments made on a
computer bulletin board that are being publicized by the Violence
Policy Center, even suggested that the agents are worse than Nazis.</P>

<P>"The Nazis are long ago and far away, whereas the ninja in the U.S.
are right now in full cry and apparently without fear of any sort of
control. They move mainly at night. They conceal their faces. They
use overwhelming firepower and they make almost no effort to identify
their targets. They are scarier than the Nazis, who at least never
concealed their faces." </P>

<P>SECOND AMENDMENT THEORY <BR>
At the same time, the NRA promotes a theory that the Second Amendment
to the Constitution, which guarantees the right to bear arms, is
intended to ensure that citizens can resist a tyrannical government.</P>

<P>There is an element of self-fulfilling prophecy in this thinking,
gun-control activists say. If the very act of enforcing gun laws
makes government agents into fascists -- and the only way to prepare
for a fascist attack is to stockpile weapons -- then armed
confrontation seems inevitable. </P>

<P>The harsh language used by the NRA and its supporters has led some
critics to suggest that the group's rhetoric contributed to the April
19 carnage in Oklahoma City. </P>

<P>"I am certain the NRA had nothing to do with Oklahoma," says Victor
Oboyski, president of the 10,000-member Federal Law Enforcement
Officers Association, which includes more than 600 ATF agents. "But
their heated rhetoric and full-page ads in The Washington Post and
USA Today showing ATF agents as Darth Vaders does feed the flames of
the paranoia that resulted in Oklahoma." </P>

<P>NRA leaders counter that it is ridiculous to link the NRA to the
militias or to the Oklahoma bombing. "Do they blame the automakers
for automobile accidents?" asks NRA board member Edie Reynolds, a
homemaker from Raleigh, N.C. "It's just incredible what people will
come up with to make a connection with something that really
shouldn't be connected." </P>

<P>BACKING AWAY FROM MILITIAS <BR>
The NRA's adversaries predict the group will increasingly begin
stressing its differences from the militias. "Clearly the NRA is in a
position where they will try to distance themselves from these
groups," says Robert Walker, legislative director of Handgun Control.</P>

<P>But LaPierre says the NRA already distanced itself -- 31 years ago.
He cites a January 1964 NRA statement that disavowed any connection
with groups that organize for violence, advocate the overthrow of the
government, or take on responsibilities that properly belong to the
police or military. </P>

<P>NRA leaders also expressed their attitude toward militias more
recently. Last November, the organization issued a statement saying,
in part, "Although the NRA has not been involved in the formation of
any citizen militia units, neither has the NRA discouraged, nor would
the NRA contemplate discouraging, exercise of any constitutional
right." And in a telephone interview last week, LaPierre hastened to
point out that not all militias are violent, anti-government groups.</P>

<P>The NRA does take particular care to distance itself from one of the
militias' central purposes. Many of the militias were formed because
the Constitution seems to guarantee gun ownership to militia members:
"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free
State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
infringed." But the NRA states emphatically that the right to gun
ownership does not depend on militia membership. </P>

<P>NRA board member Wayne Anthony Ross, writing in the April issue of
Soldier of Fortune, goes further in questioning the militias, saying
that under the Constitution, militias are to be organized by the
states. So militias that appoint officers and conduct training
without state authority are unconstitutional, Ross says. </P>

<P>NEW POLITICAL CLIMATE<BR>
Whether it is fair to link the NRA to the militias -- or the militias
to the bombing -- the political climate surrounding gun control
clearly has changed since the Oklahoma City tragedy. </P>

<P>Before April 19, the gun lobby was on a roll. Many NRA-backers won
congressional seats in the November elections, and the gun lobby and
its allies were marshaling forces to repeal the assault-weapons ban
and roll back the Brady law, which imposed a five-day waiting period
on those seeking to buy handguns. </P>

<P>Suddenly, all that has changed. House hearings on repealing the
assault-weapons ban and on abuses by ATF agents have been delayed.
And the House vote on repealing the ban, scheduled for May 18, has
been postponed. </P>

<P>"Given the fact that there are some politicians and groups that are
somehow demagoguing the issue and trying to blame gun owners or the
NRA, it's in everybody's interest to move that legislation to a
slower track," LaPierre says, "but not take it off the track. It will
be coming up again." </P>

<P>NRA opponents, of course, are doing all they can to make sure it does
not come up again. The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence has issued a
statement calling on House Speaker Newt Gingrich to abandon the move
to repeal the assault-weapons ban in the wake of the Oklahoma blast.
Handgun Control is also using the bombing to argue against the
repeal. </P>

<P>Oboyski, chief of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association,
predicts that the lawmakers who have been loudly attacking the ATF
and gun control will be on the defensive. "They're going to back off
100 percent," Oboyski says. "I think people on the Hill should be
held accountable, like the NRA, for the outrageous things they've
said on the floor of the House or Senate." </P>

<P>Steve Weidman, projects director for the Citizens Committee for the
Right to Keep and Bear Arms, warns that if the gun lobby lies low too
long, it risks ceding the field. "[Senate Majority Leader] Bob Dole
was going to lead the charge, but how much stomach he has for that
now, I wonder," Weidman says. "I don't think we should let them
regain the initiative. I think we should keep the momentum going."</P>

<h2>FBI's New Siege Mentality </h2>

<P>Naftali Bendavid<BR>
<I>Legal Times</I><BR>
July 3, 1995 </P>

<P>QUANTICO, VA. -- A dozen masked FBI agents burst into a room full of
hostages and gun-wielding terrorists, screaming, "Get down! Get
down!" Three figures collapse as the FBI men open fire. Two agents
hold the prostrate hostage-takers at gunpoint, while others race off
to search adjacent rooms. One of the terrorists reaches haltingly for
a gun; an agent kicks him and shouts, "Knock it off!" </P>

<P>From an adjacent observation tower, instructors in yellow T-shirts
watch the scene unfold, making half-insulting comments. The
nightmarish drama is surreal under the hot Virginia sun. </P>

<P>"You try to make it as realistic as possible," senior FBI agent Robin
Montgomery says of the training scene. "You may think there are three
people in the room, and it turns out there are four." </P>

<P>The agents are wearing Darth Vader masks, black T-shirts with "FBI"
emblazoned on the front, fatigue pants, heavy black boots. This is
meant to intimidate. "If the bad guys see the professionalism in the
attire, they're liable to be more acquiescent," Montgomery says.
"It's not like you see sometimes on TV. They don't wear luau shirts."</P>

<P>Welcome to the Critical Incident Response Group. Created a year ago
in the aftermath of the siege near Waco, Texas, this unit is the U.S.
government's best hope for resolving future confrontations and
conflagrations. It brings together in one place the nation's most
elite commandos, its highest-tech equipment, and its best thinking on
what the FBI dryly calls "critical incidents": hostage-takings and
sieges. </P>

<P>This new setup is an attempt to learn the lessons of Waco, where in
April 1993 Branch Davidian sect members perished in a blaze when the
FBItried to end a protracted siege. And it represents a major shift
in FBI strategy. While many reports and hearings have focused on what
went wrong at Waco, few have noted the FBI's actual reforms since the
event. For the first time, all the agency's resources for tackling
barricade situations -- from commandos and negotiators to snipers and
psychologists -- are under one unified, high-level command. </P>

<P>The unit has been formed at an especially propitious time. The United
States, which historically has been relatively free of terrorism, now
seems to face a greater threat. The bombings at the World Trade
Center and Oklahoma City are feared by many to be just the beginning.
Even more frightening is the growing availability of weapons of mass
destruction -- nuclear materials, spreading illegally from Eastern
Europe; biological weapons, such as viruses and bacteria; and
poisons, like the gas used recently in the Tokyo subway system. </P>

<P>A growing number of law enforcement specialists are concerned that
terrorists could use such weapons in the United States. Someone has
to think about exactly how the country would handle that. Someone has
to spend his time imagining the most horrifying events that could
ever engulf a nation. </P>

<P>ORDER FROM CHAOS<BR>
After more than 80 people died in the flames at Waco, there was no
shortage of critics willing to tell the FBI exactly what it had done
wrong: The Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) was too small. Commanders were
poorly trained in handling sieges. The FBI misunderstood the nature
of fringe religious groups.</P>

<P>Most of all, over and over again, came this message: Confusion
reigned. It was not clear enough who reported to whom or which agency
and which people were in charge. </P>

<P>"Clarification of the chain of command is extremely important," says
Robert Louden, who spent 13 years as a hostage negotiator with the
New York Police Department and now teaches at the John Jay College of
Criminal Justice in New York. "Not everybody can have every toy,
every resource. You have to put the best people in place to do the
job, with clear lines of authority." </P>

<P>Louis Freeh, the FBI's new director, took such comments to heart. In
the aftermath of the Waco tragedy, he required 15 senior agents from
around the country to be schooled in crisis management; when a
confrontation erupts, he's said, he will pick one of these 15 to run
the show. (At Waco, the head of the FBI's San Antonio office took
charge on the ground simply because he was closest.) </P>

<P>Freeh also put high-ranking Justice Department officials, from
Attorney General Janet Reno on down, through two days of crisis
training. Meanwhile, the FBI is negotiating agreements with other
agencies to clarify that the FBI alone will take the lead when major
standoffs occur.   But Freeh's most dramatic move was to announce in
April 1994 that he was creating a completely new division of the
bureau, bringing all the FBI's crisis units under it, and putting one
man, Montgomery, in charge. This gives Montgomery, a 25-year FBI
veteran who formerly headed the bureau's office in Portland, Ore.,
the flexibility to dispatch precisely those agents whose skills are
needed. </P>

<P>Previously, a crisis prompted every FBI unit to send its specialists
en masse. At a 1992 standoff with white supremacist Randy Reaver in
Ruby Ridge, Idaho, in which Weaver's wife and son and a U.S. marshal
died, a huge number of federal agents showed up. </P>

<P>"At Ruby Ridge, you ended up overnight with the third-largest city in
Idaho in a potato field," Montgomery says. "I can get a quick idea
from the people on the ground as to what their specific needs might
be, and I have a plane available to use for a 'Noah's Ark' concept"
-- that is, he can pick a couple of agents from each unit. </P>

<P>Not everyone is applauding the Critical Incident Response Group. </P>

<P>"They can reorganize all they want, but that doesn't solve the
problem," says Lawrence Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of
America. "There are fundamental questions that need to be answered:
Did they do the right thing [at Waco and Ruby Ridge]? Should they be
doing this kind of work at all? Maybe it's time to re-examine the
existence of that entire sort of police work at the federal level."</P>

<P>And doubtless, the FBI's efforts at reorganization will do little to
mollify the militiamen nationwide who regard Waco and Ruby Ridge as
showcases of federal law enforcement's tendency toward what the
militias see as jack-booted thuggery. </P>

<P>But Montgomery says such fears are misplaced. Stressing that his unit
includes negotiators and behaviorial specialists, as well as
commandos, Montgomery says his true goal is to prevent confrontations
in the first place. "That is where we're focusing," Montgomery says.
"We are not focusing on the tactical side. It is there, it is needed,
but our primary focus is on dialogue." </P>

<P>THEME PARK FOR COPS<BR>
Back at Quantico, Montgomery, 49, glides around the grounds of the
FBI Academy, where his headquarters are, in a navy blue Mercury Grand
Marquis. A hand-exercise grip lies alongside his cellular phone.
Montgomery has sandy hair, blond eyebrows, and a reddish complexion.
An almost imperceptible scar is etched horizontally across his chin.</P>

<P>He surveys a scene that resembles a theme park for cops. Helicopters
thrum overhead, and the rattle of gunfire is constant. Agents arrayed
at shooting ranges blast away at white targets that vaguely resemble
human torsos. The ghostlike torsos turn slowly sideways to provide a
tougher mark. Everyone here is color-coded: Instructors wear bright
yellow, trainees dark blue, Drug Enforcement Administration officers
light gray. </P>

<P>The jewel of Montgomery's new unit is the Hostage Rescue Team. A
small, elite group created in the 1970s, the HRT is now being beefed
up from 51 members to 91. These agents train for just one thing --
the siege -- and they know it better than anyone else. They can serve
as snipers or storm into buildings. They can blow a hole in the wall,
if that's the only way in. </P>

<P>Montgomery points out an indeterminate two-story wooden edifice,
still under construction; when it's complete in a few months, it will
simulate a labyrinthine criminal lair, and the HRT will practice
storming in. To train HRTmembers to function under great fatigue,
Montgomery says, they are exercised to the point of exhaustion, then
given decision-making problems. </P>

<P>Montgomery gestures toward a hangar. "This particular helicopter can
be folded up and taken with us," he says, adding that the HRT can be
airborne within four hours. </P>

<P>Montgomery passes a group of agents from Miami who are watching a
shooting expert demonstrate quick-draw techniques. This is one of the
FBI's nine regional super-SWAT teams, who receive one week of
training at Quantico each year. </P>

<P>The instructor pulls out his gun and aims it at an imaginary
adversary in one motion, over and over again, his movements silky as
a cat's. "Not a lot to it, is there?" he asks. "The weapon clears the
holster and comes toward the target . . . safety's on . . . ready gun
. . . out toward the target . . . fire." </P>

<P>Recently expanded to roughly 30 members each, the SWAT teams respond
instantly when a crisis erupts, taking charge of the area until the
HRT arrives. The agents have undergone this training a dozen times.
"It may seem redundant," says Montgomery, watching from a distance.
"And it's meant to be redundant as hell so the tactics are second
nature." </P>

<P>Also part of Montgomery's operation are five full-time hostage
negotiators and three agents who specialize in creating command posts
-- setting up phone lines, fax machines, computers, conference areas,
and systems for sifting through information. </P>

<P>The idea behind all this is to create interlocking teams of rescuers
across the country, all familiar with each other -- a fraternity of
white knights ready to charge in. The goal is simple: to keep control
amid utter pandemonium. </P>

<P>"You need to make some kind of order out of absolute chaos," says
Tony Daniels, a former assistant FBI director who now runs an
investigative and consulting business in McLean, Va. "The quicker you
can do that, the better off you are. Put yourself in the place of an
individual in Oklahoma City, for example. Imagine the absolute chaos,
and the information coming in by the bucketload, and trying to get it
all organized as quickly as possible." </P>

<P>NO MORE WACOS<BR>
Back in his corner office, Montgomery has an expansive view of the
manicured academy campus. The room is dominated by an elaborate
wooden book case, with the FBI motto -- "Fidelity, Bravery,
Integrity" -- etched into the wood. A mock "Wanted" poster, presented
by mischievous subordinates, charges Montgomery with the crime of
"impersonating an FBI executive." </P>

<P>Montgomery's life sounds like it was dreamed up by a screenwriter for
a Chuck Norris movie. Shipped to Vietnam at 18, he was leading a
Marine scouting party in June 1969 when his men were trapped by heavy
fire. The young lieutenant crawled forward in a rice paddy, stood up
in full view of the enemy soldiers, and took out two machine gun
positions. Badly wounded in the process, Montgomery won the Navy
Cross for heroism. </P>

<P>His FBI career is studded with dramatic moments. Montgomery was at
Wounded Knee, S.D., during a 70-day takeover by Indian activists in
1973. He helped plan the successful storming of the federal prison at
Talladega, Ala., after inmates took nine hostages in 1991. He was
with the FBI forces at Ruby Ridge in 1992. </P>

<P>Now Montgomery, more than anyone outside the military, is charged
with helping the country fight its nightmares. Because Freeh
envisioned a unit that could be called on during any unconventional,
"exotic" threat, the agents who specialize in everything from serial
killers to child abductions -- not just sieges -- also have been
placed under Montgomery's command. </P>

<P>When Freeh asked him to take the job, Montgomery knew that his
biggest successes -- preventing sieges in the first place -- would go
unnoticed, while his failures would likely be fiery and spectacular.
But he felt he could not say no. "I'm at a place where I don't have
to prove anything to anybody, OK," Montgomery says. "I believe in the
concept. There are a lot of dedicated people around here who want to
prevent another Waco." </P>

<P>IT BEGAN WITH MUNICH<BR>
Few images linger the way hostage standoffs do. In 1971, inmates at
New York's Attica prison riot. Before the siege ends, 29 inmates and
10 hostages lie dead. In 1972, black-hooded terrorists hold Israeli
athletes hostage at the Munich Olympics and massacre 11. In 1977,
Hanafi Muslims seize three buildings in Washington and take 149
hostages. A radio reporter is killed, but the standoff otherwise ends
peacefully.</P>

<P>Yet just 25 years ago, the country had little experience with
hostage-takings and scant plans for fighting back. It was only after
Munich that the FBI was jolted into creating SWAT units (short for
Special Weapons and Tactics), recalls Conrad Hassel, a longtime FBI
counter-terrorism expert. And it was not until 1978 that the Hostage
Rescue Team was created. </P>

<P>"The modern age of terrorism dates itself back to Munich," says
Hassel, now a partner at Hassel & Hassel, a law firm in Manassas, Va.
"It's not because terrorism started then -- I worked in the South in
the '60s and people were blowing up churches -- but that's when
satellite TV was available. And terrorism in my opinion is basically
theater. You try to impress as many people as possible." </P>

<P>Some experts say the conflagration at Waco and the explosion at
Oklahoma City are at least as traumatic for the nation as Munich was.</P>

<P>And they may be just a warm-up. Scholars who study violent movements
say it is easier than ever for those with conspiracy delusions to
communicate, especially through the Internet, so the delusions can
blossom into full-fledged group paranoia. Others note that television
exposure is increasingly available; instead of periodic updates, CNN
now is at the scene around the clock. </P>

<P>The ominous spread of nuclear materials from Eastern Europe and the
use of sarin gas in the Tokyo subway attack earlier this year -- once
the seemingly far-fetched stuff of Batman movies -- has given
terrorists the potential to threaten not just buildings, but whole
communities. </P>

<P>"It was the final breaking of the paradigm," says Bertram Brown, a
terrorism expert and former director of the National Institute of
Mental Health, about the terrorist act in Tokyo. "For years we were
wondering: 'They use guns, knives, and explosives . . . but the
chemical, the biological, the bacteria, the toxins have never been a
major factor.' " </P>

<P>Even if they aren't used, the mere threat of such weapons can have a
strong emotional effect, making people lose faith that their
government can protect them, says Brown, currently a senior physician
with the Pentagon. "Just the panic component is going to be so
extraordinary," he says. "We're studying what happened in Japan, and
you have psychological effects that far exceed the physical ones."</P>

<P>Another fear is that as the year 2000 approaches, the country will
see an increase in religious groups convinced that the apocalypse is
at hand, some of whom may try to bring it about themselves through
violence. </P>

<P>"While many of us will find a way of celebrating the year and the
events of civilization, for others it's a way to hold their own
memorials," says Frank Ochberg, a professor of criminal justice,
journalism, and psychiatry at Michigan State University. "Some are
religious and feel they have to carry out their interpretation of
Armageddon, to separate the blessed and the damned." </P>

<P>These nightmarish scenarios may never occur. But among the small,
informal community that studies such things, the consensus is that it
is important to be prepared. And that is where Montgomery and his
team come in. </P>

<P>In June 1993, shortly after the Waco siege, Ochberg called together a
group of academics, law enforcement officers, psychologists, and
others and created an ongoing "analysis group." It is meant to be a
pool of brainpower that authorities can summon if instant expertise
is needed on some obscure corner of theology, psychology, weaponry.</P>

<P>"We had long needed an advisory network of the brightest people in
the country that we could turn to," says Donald Bassett, a longtime
FBI crisis specialist and now a consultant in Reedville, Va. "I'm a
firm believer in synergistic problem solving." </P>

<P>Montgomery has been receptive, accepting the group's self-appointed
role as outside consultant. He attended a seminar the group held six
months ago. He met with nuclear arms expert Edward Rowney at the
group's suggestion. "We're becoming more and more involved in some of
your more exotic scenarios: nuclear weapons, biological weapons,"
Montgomery says. </P>

<P>NOT LOOKING FOR BUSINESS<BR>
The FBI, of course, has not satisfied all its critics by creating the
Critical Incident Response Group. Some say the Hostage Rescue Team
should be beefed up even more -- or that some of its members should
be stationed in the West, to speed the response to incidents in that
part of the country. </P>

<P>Others say the FBI's attempts to establish its lead-agency role have
been inadequate, and that what is really needed is an executive order
by the president to eliminate any confusion. Some are dissatisfied
with Montgomery's informal consultation with psychologists and
sociologists, saying more official action is required. </P>

<P>Still, these suggestions involve fine-tuning, and most experts seem
to agree that the FBI is at least heading in the right direction. </P>

<P>Typically mild is the critique of Richard Davis, former assistant
secretary of the Treasury for enforcement, who recommends a far
bigger Hostage Rescue Team. </P>

<P>"You can have [a standoff] in a hotel or even a 747 where the
[team's] numbers wouldn't be sufficient," says Davis, now a partner
in New York's Weil, Gotshal &Manges. "But in tough budget times,
these are tough calls. I favor what I favor, but I understand what
they are doing." </P>

<P>Ultimately, it will be hard to judge the success of Montgomery's
group until a major siege erupts. So far, the operation has not been
truly tested. </P>

<P>Montgomery stresses that it would be fine with him if this dazzling
assembly of technology and training is never tested. Avoiding sieges
is preferable to fighting them, he says. That is why his agents work
regularly with FBI field offices to prevent hostages from being taken
in the first place. </P>

<P>"If we have to be the Maytag man," Montgomery says, "that's okay."</P>

<h2>Representing the Accused Bomber</h2>

<P>Robert Schmidt<BR>
<I>Legal Times</i><BR>
May 22, 1995</P>

<P>ENID, OKLA. -- When defense lawyer Stephen Jones got a message on May
5 to call David Russell at home, his first thought was that the judge
must have wanted another basset hound. </P>

<P>Jones and Russell, chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the
Western District of Oklahoma, have known each other for nearly 30
years, and they got their dogs from the same breeder. </P>

<P>But Russell wasn't making a social call. He wanted to know if Jones
would agree to be the court-appointed lawyer for one of the suspects
in the April 19 Oklahoma City bombing that claimed 167 lives. Russell
declined to name the suspect, saying only that it was someone who had
been or would be charged. </P>

<P>Jones told the judge he needed a day to think about it and to get
some advice. He consulted his wife and their four children; the
lawyers and staffers at his firm; and local business and political
leaders. He even reached out, through an intermediary, to a friend
and sometime client Frank Keating, the Republican governor of
Oklahoma. It was only after Jones accepted the assignment that
Russell told him he would be representing the main suspect, Timothy
McVeigh. </P>

<P>Russell knew that other suspects were likely, and had called four or
five other lawyers to see if they were available. Meanwhile, court
officials were scrambling to find counsel for McVeigh, whose original
appointed lawyers had declared a conflict and were trying to get out
of the case. </P>

<P>"I think I took a deep breath, and I said, 'Yes, sir,' " says Jones,
who concedes his first thought on learning his client's identity was,
"Oh, shit." </P>

<P>Jones was right to be a little nervous. </P>

<P>With that one decision, the life and practice of the 54-year-old
self-described "county seat lawyer" would change dramatically. </P>

<P>THREATS, CALLS, AND TV SHOWS <BR>
Jones quickly hired security for his home and office. Already, he has
received one telephoned death threat, an intruder has tried to break
into his home, and two men in a pickup truck pulled up one night to
the front gate of his house on the outskirts of town, demanding to
speak to him. They only left after being threatened with arrest. </P>

<P>Then there's the media. Reporters have flooded his office and home,
which is listed in the Enid phone book, with phone calls. Knowing his
client needs all the good press he can get, Jones has done his best
to respond to press inquiries. On May 16, Jones' day began with a
5:30 a.m. interview on NBC, which was followed by a 6:15 appearance
on ABC's "Good Morning America." </P>

<P>During a subsequent interview, conducted at his 11th floor offices in
the Broadway Tower professional building in Enid, Jones supervised
preparation of a brief seeking to delay the demolition of the Murrah
federal building. He also fielded several important phone calls,
including one from his son who needed money for a haircut. </P>

<P>"The judge asked me if he could do anything for me, and I said, 'Yes,
you could enter an order extending the 24-hour day to 60 hours,' "
says Jones. </P>

<P>Jones, who heads Enid's six-lawyer Jones &Wyatt, is finding out he
needs more than 60-hour days to defend a client who might be the most
hated man in America. Jones will have to tap every bit of skill he
has gleaned during a 30-year career as a litigator and political
player. </P>

<P>UNPOPULAR CLIENTS <BR>
He has taken on unpopular causesbefore -- the case of a man arrested
for unfurling a Viet Cong flag in 1970, state prisoners fighting for
better treatment, and numerous murderers and other criminal
defendants. He has handled close to 25 death penalty cases and has
never lost a client to the execution chamber. Currently, Jones is
trying to spare the life of Oklahoma condemned prisoner Roger Dale
Stafford, scheduled to die July 1 for killing a Texas family in 1978.</P>


<P>He is also no stranger to politically charged situations. A former
counsel to the Republican Party in Oklahoma, Jones was a young
assistant in New York to Richard Nixon in 1964. His political career
came to an end, he says, in 1990, when he was trounced as the GOP
candidate running against Democratic Sen. David Boren. </P>

<P>"They may not have discovered a cure for AIDS, but I will tell you, I
discovered a cure for politics. Try it. Run,'' says Jones. </P>

<P>Today, Jones is a full-time litigator with a prominent statewide
practice. He is well-known in the courthouses in Oklahoma City,
although he lives and practices about 80 miles north of the capital,
in Enid (population 50,000). And despite his small-town address,
Jones says he is no "aw-shucks" lawyer. </P>

<P>His practice is split 50-50 between criminal and civil litigation, in
both federal and state courts. His clients have ranged from the Shell
Oil Co. and Sears & Roebuck to 1960s radical Abbie Hoffman to Gov.
Keating to local farmers and to cop killers. </P>

<P>"Stephen is a very, very fine lawyer; he really has ability," says
litigator James Paul Linn, of Oklahoma City's Linn & Neville. He says
Jones is probably one of the top five criminal lawyers in the state.</P>


<P>Linn and eight other lawyers who know Jones say they are not
surprised that he took on the McVeigh case. </P>

<P>"I question his judgment sometimes, as to what he takes for cases,"
adds Linn. "He's the only one of the five, if you'd pick them, that
would take the [bombing] case." </P>

<P>OFFICER OF THE COURT <BR>
Jones says he has a very simple reason for agreeing to represent
McVeigh: He's an officer of the court, and had no disqualifying
conflict of interest. </P>

<P>"We shouldn't let just left-wing lawyers defend left-wing cases and
right-wing defend right, or traditional criminal defense lawyers do
criminal work," says Jones. "It keeps the bar independent if you
involve everybody." </P>

<P>Jones is a trial lawyer from the old school -- when law was a
profession, not a business. In the vein of the late Edward Bennett
Williams, whom Jones admires, he goes into the courtroom looking to
win at almost any cost -- as long as it is ethical. </P>

<P>Jones takes on seemingly impossible cases, several Oklahoma lawyers
say, because he thrives on the challenge. And like most top-notch
litigators, these lawyers say, Jones has a healthy ego. </P>

<P>He also has not shied away from controversial causes he believes in,
even if there is a price to pay. </P>

<P>PROTECTING FIRST AMENDMENT <BR>
During the Watergate scandal, Jones split with the Oklahoma Civil
Liberties Union, for whom he worked as general counsel. Nixon was one
of Jones' heroes. When the organization called for Nixon's
impeachment, and refused to let Jones formally dissent in the group's
newsletter, Jones says he felt he had no choice but to resign his
post. </P>

<P>"I thought we were an organization devoted to the protection of the
First Amendment, and we don't even practice it internally," Jones
recalls thinking at the time. </P>

<P>Then there is the Viet Cong flag incident, which happened precisely
25 years before the call came from Judge Russell. </P>

<P>On May 5, 1970, the day after four student protesters at Kent State
University were shot dead by the National Guard, a student at the
University of Oklahoma was arrested for carrying a Viet Cong flag in
a campus protest. Jones, a young lawyer practicing at a venerable
Enid firm called Otjen & Carter, agreed to represent the student. </P>

<P>"I was young and full of piss and vinegar," says Jones. "I walked out
of the courtroom and there were a couple of reporters there and they
said, 'What are you going to do now?' and I said, 'By God, I'll take
this case all the way to federal court.' " </P>

<P>The case was the lead story in the local paper. The older partners at
the firm, which is now defunct, were horrified at the political
stance of Jones' client. </P>

<P>Name partner Frank Carter, the former mayor of Enid, "blew a
gasket,'' Jones recalls. Carter ordered him to drop the case or leave
the firm. Jones told him he felt bound by the lawyers code of ethics
and could not withdraw. </P>

<P>Shortly thereafter, Jones was driving home from an amusement park
with his son and heard on the car radio that he had been fired. Then
Carter sent out about 5,000 letters to firm clients, local country
club members, the media, and other lawyers, telling them Jones had
"resigned." </P>

<P>"That was my position," says Jones, who promptly opened his own shop.
"I paid a price, politically and socially. But I thought I was right,
and I continued to take unpopular cases." </P>

<P>The flag case, Jones says, made it impossible for him not to take
McVeigh on as a client. </P>

<P>"When Judge Russell called me, what could I say? That my life had
been a living lie for 25 years, and I was older now and wiser, and I
wouldn't make that mistake a second time?" Jones says. </P>

<P>Thus far, Jones says he has not been given the cold shoulder by the
Oklahoma establishment for taking on McVeigh. </P>

<P>DOESN'T SEEK SPOTLIGHT <BR>
He concedes that he considered his own interests, but says he doesn't
need the national spotlight to build his practice. </P>

<P>"I'm a county seat lawyer before this happened, and when it's over
with, I will go back to being a county seat lawyer," he says. "I
don't want clients in New York or St. Paul or Atlanta or Timbuktu. I
live very well. I have a very nice income, a very nice home." </P>

<P>Early in his career, Jones, who was born in Lafayette, La., and
raised in Texas, was on the way to becoming a Washington political
insider. Ultimately, he decided to settle in Enid instead. </P>

<P>Jones' first brush with national politics came in 1964, when he was a
law student at the University of Oklahoma Law School. One day, Jones
returned from class to find a letter from Nixon, who was then a
partner at New York's Nixon Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Mitchell,
the firm now known as Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon. Nixon,
who had lost the California gubernatorial race in 1962, asked Jones
to come to New York and be his assistant. </P>

<P>Jones had caught Nixon's eye with an essay Jones wrote in college,
claiming that because of ballot irregularities Nixon had actually
beaten John F. Kennedy in Texas during the 1960 presidential
election. Jones, politically savvy at an early age, sent Nixon a copy
of his paper and a letter about himself. </P>

<P>After getting the job offer and a free plane ticket from Nixon, Jones
put law school on hold and flew to New York City. Jones' main job was
to help Nixon prepare a number of articles he was commissioned to
write. </P>

<P>"I had $25 in my pocket, which showed you how naive I was," says
Jones. </P>

<P>TURNED DOWN WHITEHOUSE JOB <BR>
Jones worked for Nixon from January 1964 until the Republican
convention that summer, when Barry Goldwater was nominated. Although
Nixon offered to get Jones a job with the presidential candidate,
Jones opted to head back to law school. </P>

<P>Jones graduated in 1966 with thoughts of running for office. Through
a friend, he was introduced to Rep. Paul Findley, a Republican from
Illinois. Findley hired Jones to be his administrative assistant in
Washington. </P>

<P>He worked for Findley for three years, until 1969, the year Nixon
became president. Although Nixon offered Jones a chance to work in
the White House, Jones turned him down, he says, because he wanted to
go back home and settle down. </P>

<P>"There are just times in life where you have to decide what to do,
and I wanted to live out here," says Jones. "And I never regretted it
for a day." </P>

<P>RUNNING AND WALKING <BR>
Although he left Washington, Jones did not put aside his political
aspirations. He ran for Congress in 1976 and 1980, losing both times
in the Republican primary. He also lost a bid for state attorney
general in 1974. </P>

<P>His most prominent campaign was the 1990 Senate race, when he
garnered a mere 17 percent of the vote against the Democratic
incumbent, David Boren. </P>

<P>A Boren campaign official who watched Jones carefully throughout the
election says that Jones was a gentlemanly campaigner but never
received support from Republicans -- especially because of his track
record in the courtroom. </P>

<P>"He was pleasant, he was smart, and he was courteous as an opponent,"
this official says. "He just wasn't the kind of candidate who was
going to capture the excitement of the Republican Party. Boren was
more conservative." </P>

<P>Jones says he was just overpowered by Boren, a law school classmate
and one of Oklahoma's favorite sons. </P>

<P>"I didn't so much run for that as I walked," says Jones. "I was just
glad they counted my votes." </P>

<P>Five years later, Jones says he harbors no further political plans
but that he is now firmly conservative. </P>

<P>Formerly a self-styled liberal Republican in the tradition of Nelson
Rockefeller and Wendell Willkie, Jones traces his political evolution
to two events: the election of Ronald Reagan and, more important, the
confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. </P>

<P>"As those hearings went on, I said, 'Boy what a bunch of hypocrites,'
" says Jones, referring to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
"The more I listened, the madder I got." </P>

<P>"When Clarence Thomas came on and said, 'This is a high-tech lynching
of an uppity black,' I thought, 'By God, that's right,' " Jones says.
"This is politics. It's about Roe v. Wade. From that day forward, I
kind of re-examined some of my basic beliefs." </P>

<P>Nevertheless, Jones insists he is no right-winger, and says he
remains tolerant and committed to defending people from the left, as
he has in the past. </P>

<P>"I'm a traditional conservative," says Jones. "I believe in the Bill
of Rights, and vigorous defense, and the exclusionary rule. I support
the Miranda decision." </P>

<P>Most of his cases are local. He says 90 percent of his clients are
within 60 miles of his office in Enid. "You don't have to live in New
York or Washington to have the interesting cases," says Jones. "There
are challenges everywhere." </P>

<P>Some of his biggest challenges have come in representing defendants
facing the death penalty. Of the 20 to 25 capital defendants he's
represented, Jones says, only five have been sentenced to death. Four
of the five sentences were vacated on appeal; the fifth case, which
is no longer being handled by Jones, is still on appeal. </P>

<P>Jones' clients have run the gamut from '60s radicals to establishment
politicians. Jones does some legal work for Oklahoma Gov. Keating.
The governor turned to Jones in a dispute involving J.C. Watts' seat
on the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, which regulates oil and gas
industries in the state. (Watts is now a member of the U.S. House).</P>


<P>Watts, a Republican, was forced to give up his post after being
elected to Congress last November. He waited until Keating was
inaugurated on Jan. 9, so outgoing Gov. David Walters, a Democrat,
could not make the appointment. </P>

<P>Walters, however, appointed his own candidate, contending that Watts
became a member of Congress when the body convened on Jan. 3. Watts
argued that he became a member on Jan. 9, when he took the oath of
office. Jones argued the case before the Oklahoma Supreme Court in
February. </P>

<P>Asked if his representation of Gov. Keating -- who will help pilot
the Oklahoma City cleanup -- conflicts at all with his representation
of McVeigh, Jones says his research indicates there's no problem. </P>

<P>ABBIE HOFFMAN'S LAWYER <BR>
Abbie Hoffman first appeared in Jones' life about 25 years ago.
Students at Oklahoma State University had asked Hoffman to speak at
the school, but were overruled by the school's board of regents. The
student senate turned to Jones to challenge the regents' control over
students' choice of speakers. </P>

<P>Jones took the case to federal court, but it was mooted when the
regents dropped their policy. Hoffman spoke at the school, and Jones
introduced him from the stage. </P>

<P>While at the school, Hoffman "got some students riled up at four in
the morning," says Jones, and was later arraigned in U.S. District
Court for the District of Columbia on charges of violating the
interstate commerce clause by inciting a riot. </P>

<P>William Kunstler recommended Jones to Hoffman's attorney, criminal
defender Gerald Lefcourt, who hired Jones to handle the Oklahoma part
of the case. The government later dropped the prosecution after the
judge required them to reveal information about their surveillance.
Jones says he later found out that he was the target of the bugging.</P>


<P>In 1972, Jones took on a landmark civil rights case in Oklahoma,
Battle v. Anderson. </P>

<P>Jones' client, Bobby Battle, an inmate at the Oklahoma State
Penitentiary in McAlester, sued the state over a litany of alleged
unconstitutional conditions at the prison -- including racial
segregation, overcrowding, and disparate punishments. Joined by the
U.S. Justice Department, Jones won the case and the state prison
system was taken over by the court until 1984. </P>

<P>McVeigh's is not the first bombing case Jones has handled. In the
mid-1970s, Jones represented Harawese Moore, who was convicted of
planting an incendiary device outside the U.S. Courthouse and Federal
Building in Oklahoma City. The prosecutor in the case was then U.S.
Attorney David Russell -- who went on to become the chief judge who
appointed Jones to represent McVeigh. </P>

<P>Jones' career has crossed the paths of several other players involved
in the current Oklahoma City bombing case. </P>

<P>Arlene Joplin, the Oklahoma City prosecutor involved in the matter,
began her legal career in private practice working for Jones. Merrick
Garland, the Justice Department's principal associate deputy attorney
general, who is coordinating the investigation for the department, is
a former partner at D.C.'s Arnold & Porter -- the firm Jones works
with when he has legal work in the District. Arnold & Porter has also
used Jones as a local counsel in Oklahoma. And Jones and Michael
Tigar -- the University of Texas law professor who is representing
another Oklahoma City bombing suspect, Terry Nichols -- have worked
together before, defending a controversial Oklahoma City
psychotherapist. </P>

<P>Despite the high-profile nature of the bombing case, Jones is trying
not to let it take over his whole law practice. </P>

<P>Last week, for instance, Jones met with two clients in other cases.
Jones says he expects the other five lawyers at his firm to work on
the McVeigh case with him, but they will also handle other matters.
(Federal law provides for at least two paid defenders for McVeigh,
but Jones can bring in as much unpaid help as he likes -- or petition
the court for further paid assistance.) </P>

<P>"I think it's important to keep some balance and perspective," says
Jones. </P>

<P>Nevertheless, Jones' time is certainly consumed by McVeigh and the
investigation. </P>

<P>To start with, he's been playing catch-up. Jones was handed the case
slightly more than two weeks after the blast. McVeigh's former
lawyers -- John Coyle III of Oklahoma City's Coyle & McCoy, and
Oklahoma City Federal Public Defender Susan Otto -- were recused
because they knew a number of people killed in the bombing. </P>

<P>Worried that his client was being hurt by so much negative press,
Jones took to the airwaves shortly after his appointment. One of his
first stops was CNN's "Larry King Live." </P>

<P>Jones is also trying to develop a good working relationship with
McVeigh, which he concedes has not been easy, largely because of
logistics. Any visit to see him takes at least two-and-a-half hours,
taking into account the drive to the federal prison in El Reno,
Okla., and the time it takes to get inside the prison once he's on
site. Last week, Jones says, it took him 45 minutes just to pass
through security. </P>

<P>At Jones' request, the court has appointed Assistant Federal Public
Defender Robert Nigh in Lincoln, Neb., to assist Jones in the
defense. Nigh used to work for Jones in private practice. Jones says
he also expects the court to appoint another lawyer to his team, but
he wouldn't disclose who it was. </P>

<P>Jones, who will be paid $125 an hour, also has been busy hiring
experts, conducting interviews with witnesses, inspecting the blast
site, and researching the law. In one area, Jones is heading into
uncharted waters: Federal death penalty trials are rare, and McVeigh
will be one of the first defendants tried under federal death penalty
provisions enacted last year. </P>

<P>Jones is also planning on having McVeigh tested by a psychiatrist to
see if he is mentally competent, which he says he does in all murder
cases he handles. </P>

<P>Another large part of his job right now, Jones says, is "correcting
some of the very wrong, misleading information about tips,'' in the
media -- from McVeigh's possible paramilitary connections to the many
sightings of John Doe No. 2. Jones has already told reporters that
published accounts citing sources who claim McVeigh confessed to the
crime were false. </P>

<P>Despite the daunting task in front of him, Jones is confident. </P>

<P>"I'm beginning to think what they've basically got is a guy whose
motives indicate that he doesn't like the federal government, but
what they're short on is forensic proof,'' says Jones. "Very few
people ever got convicted for their motives. While they'd like you to
think it's all buttoned up, and it may be, I suspect they've got some
legal nightmares." </P>

<h2>Toiling in the Rubble</h2>

<P>Daniel Klaidman<BR>
<i>Legal Times</i><BR>
May 8, 1995</P>

<P>OKLAHOMA CITY -- Federal prosecutors are accustomed to assembling
their cases in antiseptic government offices far from the scene of
the crime, insulated from the raw emotions of its victims. </P>

<P>But here in Oklahoma City, where on April 19 a truck bomb blew apart
the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in the bloodiest act of
terrorism on American soil, government lawyers and agents are working
at ground zero, piloting the massive investigation out of a dank
two-story warehouse whose windows were shattered by the blast. </P>

<P>Outside the squat, brick-and-cement-block building, it is not
uncommon to see mourners weeping before a hastily erected shrine of
flowers and teddy bears commemorating the children killed in the
explosion. Inside, hundreds of letters from citizens of Oklahoma City
praising the police cover a wall -- powerful signs of the grief and
humanity that surround investigators as they labor around the clock
to crack the case. </P>

<P>Despite its war-torn appearance, the Southwestern Bell Building at
Oklahoma and Northeast Sixth streets has been transformed into a
high-tech command post for the Federal Bureau of Investigation -- the
cerebral cortex of one of the most intensive and far-flung federal
investigations ever. Banks of powerful computers line the walls to
help investigators sort through tens of thousands of potential leads.
Teletype machines click through the day and night as thousands of
special agents fanned out across the country transmit their findings
back to the command post. </P>

<P>At the helm of the operation for the Justice Department, directing
the prosecution, is Merrick Garland, an intense 42-year-old
prosecutor and top aide to Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick.</P>

<P>A former assistant U.S. attorney in the District and a former partner
with the powerhouse D.C. firm of Arnold & Porter, Garland brings an
array of skills to the daunting task of quarterbacking the Oklahoma
City prosecution team. His colleagues at Justice say he combines an
unusual ability to analyze difficult policy questions for both their
legal and political content with the guts to make difficult calls in
criminal cases -- attributes that had already made him perhaps the
most influential staffer in the department. </P>

<P>And his self-effacing style -- one that has helped him tame egos in
the upper echelons of Main Justice -- is well-suited to the challenge
of coordinating prosecutors and agents spread out over six states.</P>

<P>WORKAHOLIC'S WORKAHOLIC <br>
But commanding the Oklahoma City case will test Garland's skills and
grace under pressure as never before. </P>

<P>"With these kinds of investigations, there is excruciating pressure
to convict, but the trick is to produce convincing, legally
admissible evidence against the ones who really did it," says Alan
Strasser, who worked alongside Garland in the U.S. attorney's office
in Washington. </P>

<P>"Merrick is the perfect choice because he understands exactly how the
investigative steps will be critical to obtaining and sustaining
convictions," adds Strasser, now a partner in the D.C. office of
Omaha's Kutak Rock. </P>

<P>The enormous scope of Garland's responsibilities here -- from
ensuring that the fast-moving investigation is not tainted by poorly
executed searches or mishandled subpoenas, to assembling a
prosecution team and an airtight legal case against alleged bomber
Timothy McVeigh -- is a measure of the confidence placed in Garland
by Gorelick and Attorney General Janet Reno. </P>

<P>"Merrick was the logical person and the most talented person for the
job," Gorelick said in an interview last week. </P>

<P>And he has thrown himself into the job. A workaholic's workaholic,
Garland seems propelled forward by an inexhaustible frenetic energy,
which tumbles out in his rapid-fire, Chicago-tinged speech. As one
colleague puts it, "It seems like Merrick is everywhere at once . . .
and he talks very, very fast." </P>

<P>Garland declined comment for this article, but senior Justice
Department officials, including Gorelick, provided details of his
role in the case. </P>

<P>THE FATEFUL DAY <br>
On the morning of April 19, a few minutes after 10 a.m., Eastern
time, a message marked "urgent" flickered across Garland's computer
screen in his modest Justice Department office. The electronic
missive from a prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office for the
Western District of Oklahoma was concise: There had been an explosion
in the Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, and the situation
was grave.</P>

<P>Garland walked briskly over to Gorelick's office; the deputy attorney
general had already been alerted to the bombing by Reno. Garland and
Gorelick huddled, quickly agreeing that Reno should put into place
the department's Emergency Response Plan, a crisis-management
strategy developed after the ill-fated 1993 assault on the Branch
Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, in which more than 80 people
died. </P>

<P>The two then met with Reno and began mapping out a plan, establishing
clear lines of authority between Justice's law-enforcement agencies
and other federal investigative bodies. They agreed that the FBI
should be given unequivocal command of the investigation. Later that
afternoon, President Bill Clinton announced to a nationwide
television audience that he had placed the bureau in charge of the
case. </P>

<P>Meanwhile, Gorelick dispatched Garland to the Strategic Information
Operations Center at FBI headquarters across Pennsylvania Avenue,
where he was briefed by senior bureau officials. Hundreds of
potential leads were already scrolling across a giant computer screen
projected on the wall of the windowless SIOC bunker. Garland and
bureau officials hashed out theories on who was behind the attack. A
truck bomb with such pinpoint precision seemed to bear the signature
of Middle Eastern terrorists. </P>

<P>By Friday, two days after the bombing, the FBI had a suspect: Timothy
McVeigh, a brooding, 27-year-old Army veteran with zealous
anti-government feelings, who was placed at the scene of the crime by
witnesses. </P>

<P>With tips quickly leading agents to two brothers with ties to McVeigh
in Kingman, Ariz., and Decker, Mich., and with a manhunt getting
under way for a second suspect known only as John Doe 2, it was
becoming evident that the investigation would involve thousands of
agents and prosecutors across the country. </P>

<P>Gorelick decided she needed a prosecutor who possessed the management
skill, legal judgment, steady temperament, and clout necessary to
spearhead such a wide-ranging undertaking. She would send Garland to
Oklahoma City. </P>

<P>"It was quickly clear that the investigation would involve not just
Oklahoma City, but many other jurisdictions," recalls Gorelick. "It
would require the ability to act quickly, with judgment and
authority." </P>

<P>Gorelick hit the phones, calling U.S. attorneys around the country to
instruct them that the bombing investigation and prosecution would be
run out of Oklahoma City -- and that Garland was the attorney
general's man in charge. "Everything goes through Oklahoma City,"
Gorelick says she told them. </P>

<P>By Friday afternoon, Garland was on an FBI Saberliner aircraft en
route to Oklahoma City to take command of the burgeoning case. </P>

<P>PROSECUTION DREAMS<br> 
It is not surprising that Gorelick turned to Garland in time of
crisis; the two have known each other since they overlapped as
undergraduates at Harvard. Both went on to Harvard University Law
School. </P>

<P>When Garland graduated from law school in 1977, he clerked for Judge
Henry Friendly of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. That
was followed by a Supreme Court clerkship with Justice William
Brennan Jr. </P>

<P>In 1979, Garland got his first taste of working at the nexus of law,
policy, and politics as a special assistant to Attorney General
Benjamin Civiletti. Among other assignments, Garland helped develop
the "Principles of Prosecution," the Justice Department guidelines
that instruct prosecutors on what facts to take into consideration
when making a decision on whether to prosecute. </P>

<P>Garland left government for a stint in private practice, joining
Arnold & Porter in 1981. There, his practice included a mix of civil,
criminal, and antitrust litigation. </P>

<P>He excelled at Arnold &Porter, earning recognition as a "hot
prospect" among the nation's up-and-coming lawyers in a 1983 Legal
Times survey and establishing himself as a star junior partner. But
he found himself longing to return to prosecutorial work. </P>

<P>Garland got his chance in 1987, when he took leave from the firm to
serve as an associate independent counsel investigating the Wedtech
affair, in which a machine-tool company in the South Bronx prospered
-- and ultimately unraveled -- due to a series of bribes and
deceptive business practices that implicated some high-ranking
officials and members of Congress. Former White House aide Lyn
Nofziger was tried for violating federal ethics laws, and Garland
assisted in the prosecution. (Nofziger's conviction was later
overturned on appeal.) </P>

<P>Garland returned to Arnold & Porter the following year, but did not
stay long. Although he is a lifelong Democrat -- he worked as a
volunteer lawyer for Michael Dukakis' 1988 presidential campaign --
Garland got back into prosecuting thanks to a Republican. Jay
Stephens, U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia under President
George Bush, called Garland with an attractive offer, making him an
assistant U.S. attorney, but allowing him to skip the customary tour
of duty in D.C. Superior Court trying the local cases that are
standard fare for most new federal prosecutors in the District. </P>

<P>Garland began by handling mostly federal gun and drug cases. In his
second case, he helped prosecute Michael Palmer, the first drug
defendant charged with operating a continuing criminal enterprise in
the District who was eligible to receive a mandatory life sentence.
Garland joined lead prosecutor Judith Retchin late in the game. </P>

<P>"I had been investigating the case for months," says Retchin, now a
D.C. Superior Court judge. "Within two weeks, he had total command of
the facts and could have tried the case himself." Palmer was
convicted and is serving a life sentence. </P>

<P>Retchin was sufficiently impressed by Garland that she would later
come back to him in the highest-profile case of her career, the drug
prosecution of D.C. Mayor Marion Barry Jr. Garland would play a
little-known, behind-the-scenes role in the Barry investigation. </P>

<P>Meanwhile, he moved quickly to complex white-collar and fraud cases
of his own, putting a senior official at the Agency for International
Development behind bars for embezzling thousands of dollars, and
taking part in the bank fraud case against Democratic Party elder
Clark Clifford and his protg, Robert Altman. (The Justice
Department deferred to New York state prosecutors in the case; Altman
was acquitted of all charges, and those against Clifford were
dismissed.) </P>

<P>NAVIGATING JUSTICE <BR>
Garland returned to Arnold & Porter in 1991, but when Bill Clinton
was elected president, Garland could not resist the opportunity to
return to government. </P>

<P>He was one of about a dozen Washington lawyers who prepped Clinton's
first nominee for attorney general, Zoe Baird, for her Senate
hearing. His old friend and classmate Gorelick led the team. After
Baird's nomination flamed out amid allegations that she had hired an
illegal alien and failed to pay Social Security taxes, Garland was
part of the team -- also headed by Gorelick -- that shepherded Reno
through the confirmation process. </P>

<P>Garland impressed Reno and secured a senior position in the Justice
Department's Criminal Division. </P>

<P>Last year, after Gorelick replaced Harvard law Professor Philip
Heymann as deputy attorney general, she tapped Garland to be
principal associate deputy attorney general, her top aide. In that
position, he has quickly become a force within the department,
playing a major role in most important policy matters. </P>

<P>"He's the engine of this office," says Gorelick. </P>

<P>Those who have worked with Garland at Justice praise his ability to
navigate the department's pressure cooker of bureaucratic and
ideological rivalries with aplomb. </P>

<P>"He is someone who can be a buffer between the career and the
political people, between the case-oriented and the policy people,"
says Ronald Klain, Reno's former chief of staff who now works for
Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle (D-S.D.). "He's an unusual
nexus between all these different forces at the department." </P>

<P>BEGINNING INQUIRY <br>
Those qualities seem to be serving Garland well in Oklahoma City,
where by all accounts the management of the investigation, involving
more than a dozen federal, state, and local police agencies, is
progressing smoothly.</P>

<P>When Garland touched down in Oklahoma City, he headed straight to the
FBI command post. Quickly briefed on the status of the nascent
investigation by FBI agents in charge, Garland then headed for El
Reno Federal Correctional Institution, where McVeigh first appeared
before a judge. </P>

<P>Within hours of landing, Garland was hit by a barrage of legal
concerns. Motions had been filed for a change of venue by McVeigh's
federal defender. Subpoenas were being sought. And search warrants
needed to be approved in the widening probe. Garland even had to
worry about the implications of McVeigh's inability to obtain
permanent counsel -- a situation created by the claims of McVeigh's
lawyers that their proximity to the tragedy made it impossible for
them to provide adequate representation for the bombing suspect. </P>

<P>In subsequent days, Garland met with Oklahoma County District
Attorney Robert Macy, gently notifying him of the Justice
Department's desire not to have a local investigation going on
simultaneously. And Garland began interviewing witnesses and
presenting them before a federal grand jury convened at Tinker Air
Force Base near Oklahoma City. </P>

<P>Back in Washington, officials were dealing with the political fallout
of the bombing and assessing whether the FBI had sufficient legal
authority to penetrate the kinds of militia groups linked to McVeigh
and his fellow travelers. Besides keeping Gorelick and Reno updated
on the course of the investigation several times a day, Garland was
also giving input on the administration's legislative response. </P>

<P>But Garland's principal focus is the investigation and prosecution of
the bombers. He had to put together a unified prosecution team -- no
easy feat, given the inherent tension between Main Justice and the 94
U.S. attorney's offices. </P>

<P>Garland skirted that problem by assembling a team that included
prosecutors from both camps. Leading the unit of Oklahoma-based
attorneys is Arlene Joplin, a senior prosecutor in the U.S.
attorney's office. Joplin is aided by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Vicki
Behenna and Kerry Kelly. </P>

<P>On the team from Main Justice are Bruce Delaplaine and John
Lancaster, both line lawyers in the Criminal Division's Terrorism and
Violent Crime Section. </P>

<P>To provide support to the prosecution team and to help manage the
lawyers in the local U.S. attorney's office, Reno has dispatched
Donna Bucella, deputy director of the Executive Office of U.S.
Attorneys, to Oklahoma City. And to bolster the team's experience
with terrorism prosecutions, Garland called in Gilmore Childers, a
senior trial counsel in the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern
District of New York, who worked on the World Trade Center bombing
case. </P>

<P>To date, Garland has done the bulk of the courtroom work, but he is
not expected to try the case; a final decision on who will represent
the government in court has not been made. Some close to the case
speculate that the trial work will be shared by Joplin and an
experienced anti-terrorism prosecutor from Main Justice. </P>

<P>AT WORK IN OKLAHOMA <br>
On a typical day, Garland leaves his hotel on the outskirts of the
city (he is staying with senior FBI agents and other Justice lawyers)
at about 7 a.m. Upon his arrival at the command post, he is briefed
on overnight developments, and then has a conference call with
investigators and prosecutors from around the country to review the
day's strategy and pressing legal matters, such as questions about
venue and subpoenas. </P>

<P>He and the other prosecutors are working closely with FBI agents,
sifting through the myriad leads streaming into the command post --
from citizen calls to the FBI's 800 number, from agents in the field,
and from other sources. </P>

<P>The leads are written on forms; FBI typists then load them into a
massive computer known as the Rapid Start Automatic Case Support
System. As of late last week, investigators had already stored close
to 10 million bits of information, including 14,000 separate
interviews. The computer enables investigators to cross-reference
leads. </P>

<P>"It's incredible," says one command-post official of the computer
system. "I don't know how they did their jobs before they had it."</P>

<P>Despite the high-tech wizardry, the most crucial aspect of any
investigation is old-fashioned, painstaking detective work. That
requires people working together and cooperating -- not something at
which the FBI has always excelled. But Oklahoma City -- where agents
and prosecutors sit elbow to elbow at dinner, wolfing down stew
donated by the Salvation Army -- appears to be different. </P>

<P>"The perception in law enforcement for many years was that most
federal agencies, and especially the FBI, were a lot more concerned
with gathering information from local agencies than with sharing
information with local agencies," says Oklahoma City Police Chief Sam
Gonzales. "In this particular case, the FBI has been willing to show
us every document they have, every lead they have. </P>

<P>"We have really been made a part of the investigative team, and
everybody I've talked to says this level of cooperation in joint
investigations is unheard of," adds Gonzales. "Maybe it's due to
changing philosophies in the FBI leadership." </P>

<P>But for Garland and the others, perhaps it is more than changing
philosophies. Perhaps it is the children, both dead and alive, who
have given investigators sustenance and common purpose. </P>

<P>"With such an awful, gut-wrenching crime, egos are submerged," says
one investigator on the scene, looking off at what's left of the
hollowed-out Federal Building. "When someone points out the
child-care center and you realize it's no longer there, it gives you
some perspective." </P>

<h2>Scrambling to Find a Defender</h2>

<P>Richard Barbieri<BR>
<I>Legal Times</I><BR>
May 1, 1995</P>

<P>When 27-year-old Timothy James McVeigh went before a federal
magistrate April 27 for a hearing on allegations that he was
responsible for the most grotesque act of domestic terrorism in U.S.
history, he was represented by attorneys who didn't even want to be
involved in the case. </P>

<P>His appointed lawyers, Oklahoma City criminal defenders John Coyle
III and Susan Otto, by their own admission were laboring under a
sharp conflict of interest that cast serious doubt on whether they
could vigorously defend McVeigh. Both lawyers lost friends or
acquaintances in the massive April 19 bombing of an Oklahoma City
federal building that claimed more than 110 lives -- and both had
already unsuccessfully sought to be removed from the case. </P>

<P>The court's failure last week to move more quickly to remove lawyers
with such an obvious conflict left McVeigh in a vacuum at a crucial
time -- the first days of an investigation when permanent legal
counsel can be vital to developing a defense strategy and protecting
a defendant's constitutional rights. </P>

<P>"If they are going to replace someone, they want to do it early,"
says John Copacino, director of Georgetown University Law Center's
D.C. Criminal Justice Clinic. "You are leaving lawyers on the case
who are telling you they can't represent him zealously." </P>

<P>The lawyers had wasted no time trying to get out of the case,
petitioning U.S. Magistrate Judge Ronald Howland within a few days of
being tapped to represent McVeigh. </P>

<P>"[E]veryone in our city has been impacted by the explosion, and
counsel is no exception," Coyle wrote in an April 24 motion. "The
enormous impact of this tragedy . . . has caused doubt as to my
ability to give Timothy McVeigh the absolutely unbiased and objective
representation that everyone accused in our country deserves." </P>

<P>Despite their pleas, Coyle and Otto were left on the case, at least
as of April 28. </P>

<P>Fourteen criminal practitioners and professors interviewed for this
story sympathized with the difficult situation facing Coyle and Otto.
But some criticized Coyle for drawing unnecessary attention to the
conflict by talking about it publicly. </P>

<P>"I do question Coyle going on 'Larry King Live,' " says Elisabeth
Semel, a San Diego criminal defense attorney and co-chair of the
legislative committee of the National Association of Criminal Defense
Lawyers. "The optimum would have been for Coyle to go to the judge
and say, 'I have a conflict,' and, once it was done, to have issued a
statement." </P>

<P>Throughout the week, court officials in Oklahoma City and in
Washington scrambled to find a way around a high-stakes dilemma. </P>

<P>Leaving Coyle and Otto on the case despite their conflict set up a
situation where McVeigh could later argue that he was denied his
Sixth Amendment right to competent counsel, some observers say. At
the same time, removing the appointed lawyers before substitute
counsel were found could have left McVeigh with no representation at
all -- a scenario fraught with problems of its own. </P>

<P>But at the bottom of it all, last week's struggle to sort out legal
representation for McVeigh was driven by a confluence of
extraordinary -- and mostly unavoidable -- factors stemming from the
unprecedented nature of the case. </P>

<P>From the outset, Attorney General Janet Reno's decision to seek the
federal death penalty against the perpetrators -- announced just
hours after the blast and more than a day before McVeigh's arrest on
charges that he destroyed a federal building with a bomb -- upped the
ante for finding counsel. </P>

<P>In capital-punishment cases, federal law requires that courts move
swiftly to appoint at least two lawyers for defendants who request
counsel. (Most criminal defendants who can't afford a lawyer are
represented by a single deputy public defender.) And in capital
cases, at least one of the two appointed lawyers must be skilled in
death-penalty law. </P>

<P>The search for counsel was complicated by the rarity of federal
death-penalty cases: There are no regional defense resource centers
with standing lists of experienced lawyers to jump into emergencies,
as there are for state capital cases. </P>

<P>The U.S. government last executed a prisoner in 1963; federal
prosecutors haven't even filed capital charges in Oklahoma City in
many decades. Nationwide, there have been only 46 prosecutions
approved by the attorney general since 1988 -- a period when states
have brought thousands of death cases. The law McVeigh is being
charged under, a provision of the 1994 Omnibus Crime Control Act that
added some 50 new death penalties to federal law, has been invoked in
only a handful of previous cases throughout the country. </P>

<P>It didn't take long for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts
to get involved in the search for lawyers. The federal death-penalty
statute says that federal public defenders should put together a list
of qualified counsel for judges to appoint. But owing to Otto's
declaration of a conflict in this case -- and her claim that the
entire public defender's staff had been affected by the blast -- the
Administrative Office stepped in to help prepare a list. </P>

<P>The Administrative Office declines to discuss the case in any detail.
Spokeswoman Karen Redmond confirms that the AO helped with the search
and that this was the first time the office had been called on for
such a task. </P>

<P>An experienced capital litigator, who asked not to be identified,
says judicial officials were forced to cast a wide net because most
other qualified Oklahoma practitioners would probably suffer the same
conflicts cited by Otto and Coyle. </P>

<P>"There was a fairly wide-ranging -- informal but fairly wide-ranging
-- canvas for ideas," this lawyer says. </P>

<P>Indeed, prospective lawyers would likely have to come from elsewhere
because the blast had such an enormous impact on the relatively small
legal community in Oklahoma City. </P>

<P>"Just about every lawyer here has friends who were injured or killed,
or knows people who do," says Oklahoma City's William Devinney,
president of the 300-member Oklahoma Criminal Defense Lawyers
Association." There's no way out of it." </P>

<P>THE PERFECT FIT? <BR>
In most cases, Coyle and Otto would be logical choices to handle
Oklahoma City's first federal death-penalty case in years. </P>

<P>But United States v. McVeigh isn't most cases. </P>

<P>The 47-year-old Coyle is an experienced defense specialist, a name
partner in four-lawyer Coyle & McCoy, an active participant in local
trial bars, and a member of the National Association of Criminal
Defense Lawyers. </P>

<P>"John Coyle is one of the leading criminal defense lawyers in
Oklahoma City," says Devinney. </P>

<P>Coyle's partner, Gloyd McCoy, goes a step further. "John Coyle is the
best trial lawyer in Oklahoma," says McCoy, a former deputy state
public defender who joined Coyle's firm a little more than two years
ago. </P>

<P>Coyle did not return phone calls seeking comment for this article.</P>

<P>As the federal public defender for the Western District of Oklahoma,
Otto also seemed well-suited for the case. She has worked in the
federal public defender's office since the late 1980s, and served as
first assistant in the office before taking over the top job in 1993,
according to Devinney. </P>

<P>Otto, who did not return phone calls, apparently sought out Coyle to
represent McVeigh because Coyle had experience representing
defendants in state death-penalty trials. </P>

<P>But almost immediately after being appointed, both lawyers took steps
to get removed from the case. Each filed a motion April 24, seeking
to withdraw. </P>

<P>Both said they had been personally affected by the blast. </P>

<P>Coyle was in the Oklahoma County Courthouse when the 4,800-pound
fertilizer bomb, allegedly delivered by his would-be client,
exploded. Coyle then headed for the nearby federal office building,
witnessing the "the terror and carnage at the scene." At his law
office, four blocks away, his employees were "emotionally shaken" and
"terrified." </P>

<P>Coyle said he was friends with several government employees who were
slain. </P>

<P>In a similar motion, Otto said that her office had been badly damaged
by the blast and that she and her staff were lucky to be alive. </P>

<P>"This was a terrifying experience for every person in the Federal
Public Defender's office," she wrote. "It was immediately clear to
all of us that we were spared from injury and personal loss by pure
good fortune." </P>

<P>EASY CALL <BR>
Given their palpable conflict of interest, the lawyers' decision was
appropriate ethical conduct, according to the consensus of criminal
practitioners and professors interviewed for this article. </P>

<P>Many conflicts fall into gray areas. But not the one faced by Coyle
and Otto, the lawyers and ethics experts say. Many instead faulted
the court for not immediately disqualifying Coyle and Otto. </P>

<P>"This is one of the most critical times [in the case] because it sets
the foundation for everything that is to follow," says Ira Robbins, a
professor at American University's Washington College of Law. </P>

<P>"This [decision] was such an easy call," Robbins adds. "How often do
lawyers publicly state that they have a personal interest and as a
result cannot represent the client objectively?" </P>

<P>While not faulting Coyle and Otto for declaring a conflict, a few
lawyers and professors question at least some of Coyle's public
statements about the issue. </P>

<P>"When I saw the people hollering at [McVeigh], I thought that I had
never seen anyone that needed a lawyer more than he did at that time.
So when they asked me if I would help that evening, I agreed to do
it," Coyle said on "Larry King Live," a Cable News Network call-in
program. At another point, while resisting many of King's attempts to
get him to reveal details about his conversations with McVeigh, Coyle
said he had had "mixed emotion[s]" when he first met McVeigh. </P>

<P>Some defense lawyers say Coyle's comments could further prejudice an
already outraged public. </P>

<P>"To air this in a public setting really damaged the guy," says
Michael Burt, a deputy public defender in San Francisco. </P>

<P>"It really creates the impression that no one will touch this guy,
that even the lawyers think he's guilty," says Burt, whose
high-profile clients have included Lyle Menendez, one of the two
Beverly Hills brothers accused of the 1991 slaying of their parents,
and Richard Ramirez, the Los Angeles "Night Stalker" who was
convicted in 1989 of 13 murders. </P>

<P>But most observers say that Coyle didn't cross the line. One lawyer
who was sympathetic to Coyle's position was Avraham Moskowitz, a
partner in New York's Anderson Kill Olick & Oshinsky. </P>

<P>In February, Moskowitz was briefly appointed counsel for Ramzi Ahmed
Yousef, a member of a radical Islamic group, who is accused of
planning the 1993 Word Trade Center bombing. Moskowitz got out of the
case when a federal judge in New York decided that the appearance of
a conflict between the lawyer, a Jew, and his client was too great.</P>

<P>"I don't think it damages the client's presumption of innocence,"
Moskowitz says of Coyle's statement that McVeigh needed a lawyer. </P>

<P>"He needs a lawyer really badly because he is accused of the crime of
the century. Anybody with any sophistication would understand that,"
Moskowitz says. </P>

<P>Coyle's partner, McCoy, says Coyle's critics misunderstood the
lawyer's public statements. </P>

<P>"He didn't say, 'I never saw anyone more guilty,' " McCoy says. Coyle
was merely reacting to the public anger his client faces. </P>

<P>"I was a block away when that thing blew up. I know the impact,"
McCoy says. "These are very troubled people and were expressing their
opinions." </P>

<h2>Nichols' Lawyers: The Odd Couple</h2>

<P>Janet Elliott, Mark Ballard, Robert Elder Jr., Gordon Hunter<br>
<i>Texas Lawyer</i><br>
March 22, 1996</P>

<P>Michael Tigar, the leftist law professor who loves to challenge
government authority, and Ronald Woods, the conservative career
prosecutor, promise to make a formidable defense team for Oklahoma
City bombing suspect Terry Nichols.</P>

<P>"They're yin and yang," said Houston criminal defense specialist Dick
DeGuerin, who worked with both men last year on the successful
defense of U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison's state ethics charges. </P>

<P>Tigar, a federal appellate expert who teaches at the University of
Texas School of Law, has argued seven cases at the U.S. Supreme Court
and 59 at U.S. courts of appeals. Although he has concentrated on
appeals in recent years, he has kept his hand in the occasional
trial. His most recent book, published by the American Bar
Association in 1993, is "Examining Witnesses." </P>

<P>"This is a great lawsuit with genuine fact issues," Tigar said May
16. "I'm going to get ready to cross-examine some FBI agents." </P>

<P>He declined a request for an interview, saying he had to prepare for
a May 18 bond hearing for Nichols. </P>

<P>Tigar and Woods, a former FBI agent and U.S. attorney in Houston,
have been appointed by U.S. District Judge David Russell of Oklahoma
City to represent Nichols, who faces the death penalty if convicted
of destroying the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.</P>

<P>DeGuerin said Tigar is a "brilliant legal strategist" whose magnetic
presence and speaking style should go over well with jurors. "I can't
say enough about his ability to persuade," he said. </P>

<P>Tigar has been closely involved in death penalty cases at the state
level. He is one of the founders of the Texas Resource Center, which
provides post-conviction representation for death row inmates. That
knowledge, combined with his expertise in federal appeals, could be
key skills in Nichols' case because President Bill Clinton has
promised to make the bombing prosecutions a test of speeding the
federal habeas process. </P>

<P>Woods' strong suit is his ability to manage the details of a complex
case and his insider's knowledge of law enforcement, DeGuerin said.
Woods has more than 22 years of experience in law enforcement as an
FBI agent, state prosecutor and federal prosecutor. </P>

<P>"He's meticulously organized and has a phenomenal memory for
details," DeGuerin said. </P>

<P>Woods said May 17 that he feels honored that his name came up in the
search for the most experienced federal practitioners. "All lawyers
have an obligation to take these occasionally unpopular cases and
make sure the people get a fair trial," said Woods, a solo
practitioner. </P>

<P>He said he expects the government to indict Nichols by late summer
and take the case to trial in early 1996. The lawyers will attempt to
keep the cases of Nichols and chief suspect Timothy McVeigh separate
and to have Nichols' case moved from Oklahoma, although Tigar failed
in his intial attempt May 17 to have all Oklahoma City-based
prosecutors and U.S. Magistrate Judge Ronald Howland removed from the
case. </P>

<P>REDEEMING THE BAR <BR>
When Russell and other Oklahoma federal judges realized they were not
going to find lawyers in their state willing to represent Nichols,
they turned to Texas. </P>

<P>The word went out through federal public defenders, Texas criminal
defense lawyers and judges with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in New Orleans. The search eventually led to Tigar, who is no
stranger to friendless clients. Tigar in turn tapped Woods. </P>

<P>5th Circuit Judges Patrick Higginbotham and Fortunato "Pete"
Benavides were among those urging Tigar to take the case. </P>

<P>The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, headed by San
Antonio's Gerry Goldstein, networked to find quality counsel for one
of the most despised men in America. </P>

<P>The choice of the two Texans redeemed the state's defense bar from an
earlier embarrassing episode: Two Houston lawyers, Paul Looney and J.
Brent Liedtke, showed up in Oklahoma City saying they had been
retained by McVeigh's family to represent him. </P>

<P>Looney has been a lawyer for less than five years, and Liedtke was
disbarred in 1990 but says he can practice in the federal system.
McVeigh quickly rejected their counsel, and Russell declared he would
thoroughly check out all lawyers to eliminate "ambulance chasers,"
Woods said. </P>

<P>McVeigh is being represented by Stephen Jones of Enid, Okla., a
litigator who has represented about 25 capital murder defendants. A
similar behind-the-scenes effort led to Jones after two federal
public defenders in Oklahoma City were allowed to withdraw from
representing McVeigh. </P>

<P>Jones will be joined by Rob Nigh, the chief federal public defender
in Lincoln, Neb. A third lawyer may be added. </P>

<P>Russell has said the defense lawyers will be paid $125 an hour, an
amount DeGuerin called "woefully inadequate" when compared to the
resources the government is pouring into the case. </P>

<P>DeGuerin, a name partner in DeGuerin & Dickson, said he was
approached to represent McVeigh, the first suspect arrested in
connection with the April 19 bombing that killed 168 people,
including 19 children. He said he declined because of his heavy
caseload and because he represented Branch Davidian leader David
Koresh during the standoff at the religious sect's Mount Carmel
compound near Waco. </P>

<P>Federal officials believe McVeigh was motivated by anger at the
government's handling of the Waco raid. The bombing occurred on the
second anniversary of the government's tear gas assault on the Branch
Davidian compound. More that 80 people died when the compound burned.</P>

<P>DeGuerin said his taking the case "would have allowed people to
unfairly and improperly make the connection between the Branch
Davidians and what happened in Oklahoma City." </P>

<P>Now involved in one of the biggest cases of the decade, Woods and
Tigar have vowed not to try their case in the press. Woods was known
as a closed-mouthed U.S. attorney. And despite the prominence of his
career, Tigar has rarely sought out media attention. </P>

<P>Woods cringed at the suggestion he and Tigar might be a federal
version of O.J. Simpson's "dream team" of defense lawyers, saying he
does not want to invite any comparison between the bombing case and
the televised Simpson murder trial. "We don't want to start calling
press conferences and going to parties," Woods said. </P>

<P>CONTROVERSIAL CLIENTS <BR>
Tigar was instrumental in bringing the Texas Resource Center to
Austin in 1988 to help recruit and train lawyers for post-conviction
appeals. He was chairman of the center's board from its inception
until late 1993 and argued for death row inmate Gary Graham at the
U.S. Supreme Court and 5th Circuit. </P>

<P>"He's exciting and a challenging person to be around," said Mandy
Welch, the center's executive director. "He's always thinking of
something. His mind is always working." </P>

<P>Austin civil rights lawyer James Harrington said the notoriety of the
bombing case will not cause Tigar to miss a beat. "He's used to
really tough cases and unpopular cases," said Harrington. "And he'll
require the government to prove itself every step of the way." </P>

<P>Tigar's roster of notorious clients includes black militant Angela
Davis and the Chicago Seven war protesters, who were tried for
conspiracy to incite riots at the 1968 Democratic National
Convention. He wrote and argued most of the pretrial motions in that
case; William Kunstler led the trial team. </P>

<P>Tigar also represented John Demjanjuk, an Ohio auto worker stripped
of his U.S. citizenship after being accused of Nazi war crimes. When
legal ethics Professor Monroe Freedman criticized Tigar for taking
the case, Tigar stood his ground. [See "Here's Why I Represent John
Demjanjuk," Texas Lawyer, page 17, Sept. 13, 1993.] </P>

<P>Now 54, Tigar has been in the public eye since he was a law student
in the mid-1960s. While attending Boalt Hall law school at the
University of California at Berkeley, he finished first in his class
all three years while gaining notoriety as a leader of the student
radical movement. </P>

<P>Tigar's brilliance landed him a clerkship with Supreme Court Justice
William Brennan for the 1966-67 term; his radical student activities
cost him that chance to work at the high court. </P>

<P>Brennan's decision to hire Tigar triggered "a campaign to sabotage
his appointment," Hunter R. Clark wrote in the just-published
biography "Justice Brennan: The Great Conciliator." In those Cold War
days, opponents of the court's decisions zeroed in on Tigar's
attendance at a youth festival in Helsinki, Finland, that included
participants from the Soviet Union. </P>

<P>Brennan received considerable pressure to dump Tigar from fellow
Justice Abe Fortas, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and Hoover's
right-hand man, Clyde Tolson. "They bombarded me with all kinds of
letters," most having to do with Tigar's participation in the
Helsinki meeting, Brennan says in Clark's book. </P>

<P>The final straw came when a congressional investigation into the
court was threatened until Tigar was axed, and Brennan fired Tigar
when he showed up for his first day of work. Long after the incident
Brennan acknowledged, "I must say I've had a number of second
thoughts" about firing Tigar, who has argued seven cases before the
high court. (Tigar apparently bore no long-term grudge, saying in
1990, "I have enormous respect for Justice Brennan.") </P>

<P>'AN ASTOUNDING CATCH' <BR>
"I don't think it was Justice Brennan's finest hour, if one is
allowed to say that about an icon," said UT Law Dean Michael Sharlot.
Sharlot, who was a young lawyer in Washington at the time, says the
clerkship controversy made Tigar a familiar name in the capital --
"the hotshot from Boalt" who was "disinvited" by Justice Brennan.
(Tigar is still something of an insider in Washington, as his
caricature ensconced at the tony Palm restaurant suggests.) </P>

<P>Later, "when he indicated an interest in teaching, I thought he'd be
an astounding catch for us," Sharlot said. </P>

<P>The dean said he strongly favored Tigar's appointment to the faculty,
and the two "have been friends ever since." His faculty job has
enabled Tigar to write extensively; his published work includes
plays, along with numerous law books and articles. </P>

<P>Last year Tigar, who teaches civil and criminal procedure, was a
candidate for the dean's job that went to Sharlot. </P>

<P>Students' views on Tigar range from the one who said he has an "ego
the size of the Asian continent" to the stressed-out, first-year
student who said she will never forget his kindness when she broke
down in his office. </P>

<P>Tigar's current annual salary is $147,572, which includes $7,000 for
the Joseph D. Jamail Centennial Chair in Law, a position he has held
since 1987. Mark Yudof, the former UT law dean who is now provost for
the university, said Tigar takes a pay cut for the amount of time he
spends on cases. On the Hutchison case for example, Tigar went on a
half-time schedule, Yudof said. </P>

<P>Yudof said Tigar hates to see government authorities overstep their
roles. That is what drew him to the Hutchison case, which abruptly
ended when Travis County District Attorney Ronnie Earle abandoned the
case as it was going to trial, citing a pretrial ruling that he said
crippled his case. </P>

<P>DeGuerin and Harrington said Tigar took a great deal of flak from his
Austin friends for his representation of Hutchison, who was reviled
by Texas Democrats for taking their last U.S. Senate seat. </P>

<P>WORK ON THREE CONTINENTS <BR>
A true Renaissance man, Tigar is a gourmet cook and sailing
enthusiast. He periodically teaches law courses at a college in
France and is involved in teaching a crash course on litigation to
black South African lawyers. </P>

<P>He had joined Washington's Williams & Connolly after losing the
Brennan clerkship. Tigar cut his teeth on the 1967 legal team headed
by firm founder Edward Bennett Williams that defended Lyndon Johnson
aide Bobby Baker on tax fraud charges. Baker was sent to prison. </P>

<P>Williams was a mentor to Tigar, although a biography of Williams says
he disliked some of Tigar's radical acquaintances. "Williams liked to
boast that Tigar was sleeping with Bernadine Dohrn, the tempestuous
leader of the Weather Underground, though it was untrue," author Evan
Thomas wrote in "The Man to See," a 1991 book about Williams. </P>

<P>Tigar had left the firm in 1969 to teach in the United States and
practice overseas, but in 1974, he rejoined the firm and helped
Williams win the acquittal of former Texas Gov. John Connally, then
the U.S. Treasury secretary, on charges he was involved in a milk
price-support scandal. The win re-established Williams' reputation as
the best trial lawyer in America. </P>

<P>In a previous case involving a bombing, Tigar successfully defended a
Colorado man charged with blowing up power-line towers in protest of
the American defense system. Early in his career, he took on the
Selective Service for putting war protesters at the top of its
induction lists. He won his first case before the U.S. Supreme Court
when that practice was outlawed. </P>

<P>BRILAB PROSECUTIONS<BR>
Woods, 57, also went to law school in the turbulent '60s, but he took
a much different path. After graduating from UT in 1964, Woods had a
three-year stint as an FBI agent. He spent seven years with the
Harris County district attorney's office before joining the U.S.
attorney's office in 1976. In the early 1980s he was involved in the
prosecution of public officials and labor leaders stemming from the
FBI's national BRILAB probe. He later said those cases were the most
important of his career, although the big fish, Texas House Speaker
Billy Clayton, was acquitted. </P>

<P>During his first nine years as a federal prosecutor, Woods tried 50
cases and obtained convictions in 48. He joined Houston's Baker &
Botts as a litigator in 1985 and in 1987 opened his own practice,
specializing in white-collar criminal defense. </P>

<P>President George Bush named Woods U.S. attorney for the Southern
District of Texas in November 1990. He resigned in January 1993, at
the start of the Clinton presidency. </P>

<P>During his two-and-a-half tenure, he hired 57 new prosecutors, bringing
the total to 130. He also refocused the office from its concentration
on drug interdiction -- predecessor Henry Oncken had been criticized
for clogging the Houston docket with small-time drug cases -- to bank
fraud and environmental crimes. </P>

<P>Woods has tried only two death penalty cases while he was a Harris
County prosecutor. The most recent was Texas v. Moses Lopez Garcia,
581 S.W.2d 168, in 1975, one of the first cases under Texas' then-new
death penalty statute. </P>

<P>Garcia's conviction and death sentence was another of Woods'
victories, but it didn't last. The death sentence was commuted to
life, and Garcia was paroled in 1987. </P>

<H2>A Unabomber Trial Stays in New Jersey</H2>



By Maureen Castellano <BR>
<I>New Jersey Law Journal</I><BR>
December 16, 1996<P>



Frustrated by defense delays in bringing Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski to trial in California, federal prosecutors last week tried forum-shopping of a sort: changing the order of prosecution to try him in New Jersey first. <P>



The team led by First Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Cleary wanted to advance the case against Kaczynski for the one bombing not included in the California case. Cleary's team had sought a June trial on the three-count indictment charging Kaczynski with the mail-bombing death of advertising executive Thomas Mosser -- the only attack for which the Unabomber claimed responsibility. <P>



Had Cleary succeeded, he might have been able to start the broader Unabomber trial, scheduled for next November in Sacramento, with a conviction already in place. <P>



But his efforts fell short. Senior U.S. District Judge Dickinson Debevoise called the prosecution's bid for a June 30 trial in Newark unworkable, finding no way to reconcile the court dates that would be necessary here with the detailed trial schedule already set for the Sacramento case.  <P>



"Frakly, I don't think it's a realistic proposal," Debevoise told Cleary's team during a 45-minute hearing Tuesday. Kaczynski's federal public defenders had contended that prosecutors were deliberately trying to interfere with -- and perhaps even undermine -- the Sacramento trial schedule, and more important, the defense's efforts to put together its case. <P>



On the other hand, Debevoise on Friday denied a motion by defense lawyers to transfer the New Jersey case to California. Although he acknowledged the logic of trying the cases together, he found that the concerns raised by the defense did not "outweigh the powerful reasons to try the New Jersey charges separately." That ruling sets the stage for a Unabomber trial in New Jersey, but not until 1998 or 1999. <P>



DEFENDERS LEAD<BR>

Last week's skirmishes were only the latest between prosecutors and defense attorneys intent on gaining a strategic advantage, no matter how small, in the location and timing of the enormous Unabomber cases, captioned here as United States v. Theodore John Kaczynski, 96-CR-607. <P>



Despite Debevoise's refusal to consolidate the cases, it's the public defenders so far who are ahead in the victory count. <P>



In Sacramento, U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell Jr. has granted the defense numerous extensions for filing motions -- over the prosecution's objections -- and has, in the government's words, "substantial[ly]" delayed the start of the trial to its now- scheduled Nov. 12, 1997 date. <P>



Kaczynski's defense team, led by Federal Public Defender Quin Denvir of Sacramento and including New Jersey Assistant Federal Public Defender Chester Keller, had hoped to eliminate a second prosecution in New Jersey by consolidating the three-count indictment here with the 10- count case in Sacramento. And on Tuesday they seemed pleased that Debevoise -- though clearly not favoring the idea -- did not dismiss the motion out of hand, as he did the prosecution's request. <P>



The defense had made the consolidation motion under Fed. R. Crim. P. 21(b), which allows transfers for "the convenience of the parties and witnesses and in the interest of justice." <P>



The lawyers argued that having just one trial is more practical, given the volume of evidence in the case, the government's earlier move to consolidate all the other cases in Sacramento, and the additional time and effort that would be needed to mount a second defense in New Jersey -- for what they contend are virtually identical charges. <P>



Most importantly, Denvir argued in briefs to the court, mandating separate trials could impinge on Kaczynski's Fifth Amendment protection against double jeopardy. <P>



In their brief, the defenders noted that the government plans to present evidence of the New Jersey bombing, under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b), in an attempt to establish a pattern and identify Kaczynski as the Unabomber. With separate trials, the defenders argued, "a Sacramento jury will hear testimony and evaluate evidence of the New Jersey bombing, and a New Jersey jury will have to hear the same or similar testimony and evidence in a subsequent New Jersey prosecution, which will take place many months later." <P>



That was an argument that cearly registered with Debevoise during the hearing. "That really is a principle thesis stated in your brief: Why try this case twice?" the judge said. <P>



Prosecutors quickly countered that separate trials are needed because the murders were separate acts -- and that a trial in New Jersey is necessary because the Mosser murder occurred here. <P>



Cleary argued in his brief that, under 18 U.S.C. Sect. 3235, the location of the crime is "the most crucial factor" in determining where a trial should be held. The statute, Cleary wrote, requires that "[t]he trial of offenses punishable by death shall be had in the county where the offense was committed, where that can be done without great inconvenience." <P>



After the hearing, Cleary maintained that the statute was written specifically with the crime's impact on the community in mind. "We view the statute as voicing a congressional intent" that trials involving capital offenses be held in the location where the murder occurred, he said. Added U.S. Attorney Faith Hochberg, "This is a murder in New Jersey for which there has been an indictment in New Jersey -- and there should be a trial in New Jersey."  <P>



Cleary also argued, in the briefs, that it is the defense's burden to show that proceedings should be transferred to another venue. And, he contended that Kaczynski has failed to meet that burden or prove that there would be substantial inconvenience in having a trial in New Jersey. <P>



Cleary argued that Kaczynski failed to prove any of the 10 factors set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Platt v. Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co., 376 U.S. 240 (1964) for considering motions under Fed. R. Crim. P. 21(b). Those factors include the location of witnesses and documents, expense to the parties, and disruption of the defendant's business. Most of the Platt factors, Cleary says, "mitigate against or fail to support Kaczynski's motion." <P>



Cleary repeatedly stressed the government's stand that crimes that result in death should be prosecuted where the death occurred. "The convenience to the defendant of facing a single trial, standing alone, should not outweigh this critical factor," he wrote. <P>



PROCEDURAL EFFICIENCY<BR>

Debevoise reserved decision, but issued his 11-page ruling just two days later. On Friday, he held that the Platt factors, considered in their totality, do not support a transfer of venue. Debevoise ruled that the "most efficient procedure" is for the Sacramento case to proceed on course and try the New Jersey case separately after the California case is resolved. <P>



While Debevoise acknowledged a "surface plausibility" to the defense's arguments that using the New Jersey case for Rule 404(b) purposes could raise double jeopardy concerns, he held that the evidence that would need to be introduced in Sacramento would be "substantially less extensive" than the evidence required to prove the New Jersey criminal charges. <P>



That ruling means that the trial here, which prosecutors maintain will be "streamlined," will start 70 days after the California case is completed. The guilt phase of that trial is expected to last at least six months. <P>



Much of Debevoise's ruling was foreshadowed by comments the judge had made during the court proceeding Tuesday. He had posited that the defendant's rights were not the only issue to be considered. And he also pointed out that Kaczynski's family lives in New York -- a state, he noted, that is much closer to New Jersey than California. <P>



Overall, too, Debevoise did not seem at all anxious to surrender the high- profile case. Indeed, he even appeared to consider the possibility, if only briefly, of granting the prosecution's motion to go ahead with the New Jersey case first. "I could try [the case]," he told Kaczynski's defense team during the hearing. <P>



"I'm sure you could and Mr. Cleary could," answered Public Defender Denvir. "Mr. Keller and I couldn't." <P>



Denvir told the judge there was no way the attorneys could be ready for a June trial here. "It's very difficult to prepare a defense for two cases simultaneously, separated by 3,000 miles," Denvir said. "It would be like a child-custody case -- who gets to see the client?" <P>



Ultimately, Debevoise seemed to defer to his Sacramento colleague in denying the prosecution's motion for a June trial here. He appeared concerned that unexpected motions or other delays would push the trial's end dangerously close to that November trial start date. <P>



MOSSER COUNT CARRIES DEATH PENALTY<BR>

At the start of Tuesday's hearing, Kaczynski was arraigned on the three-count indictment charging him with the 1994 mail-bomb death of Thomas Mosser of West Caldwell, an advertising executive with the firm of Young & Rubicam. <P>



The indictment, returned in October, charges Kaczynski with transporting and mailing an explosive with the intent to kill or injure. Kaczynski also was charged with using a destructive device in relation to a crime of violence. He pleaded not guilty on all counts. <P>



The first two counts of the indictment can carry the death penalty. But the U.S. Attorney General's office has yet to say whetherit will seek death for Kaczynski. If so, it could be the first federal death penalty case in New Jersey under the present federal statute. One other such case is pending in the Camden vicinage. <P>



In presiding over the case here, Debevoise -- who assumed senior status in 1994 -- would bring with him much more criminal experience than his Sacramento counterpart. Judge Burrell, who drew the Kaczynski case after two other judges there recused themselves, has not handled any of that district's more notable criminal cases in his four years on the bench. <P>



Before being assigned to Burrell, the Kaczynski case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Edward Garcia. But Garcia recused himself in July, saying he did not believe he would be able to devote himself to the time-consuming case once he took senior status in November. To be sure, the Sacramento case, which includes criminal counts relating to four bombings and information on another 12 uncharged bombings, is far more complex than the New Jersey case. But senior status didn't influence Debevoise, who has maintained a full caseload. <P>



Another Sacramento judge, Lawrence Karlton, had also bowed out. Karlton recused himself because a close friend owned the building where the Unabomber's 1995 fatal bombing allegedly occurred. <P>

<H2>Kaczynski Prosecutor's Bombshell</H2><P>
Federal prosecutors reveal that Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski allegedly kept a diary with accounts of his crimes, while the defense claims that the juicy revelation was made with the media in mind, and worry that it may make it impossible to get a fair trial in that venue.<P>

By Howard Mintz<BR>
<i>The Recorder</I><BR>
September 23, 1996<P>

SACRAMENTO -- When federal prosecutors disclosed that Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski allegedly kept a diary with contemporaneous accounts of his crimes, they turned Friday's routine hearing into a news event.<P>

With the courtroom packed with journalists, New Jersey Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Cleary, the lead prosecutor in the case, made the disclosure as part of a straightforward argument to bring Kaczynski to trial much faster than defense lawyers desire.<P>

Cleary peppered his argument with so many tantalizing tidbits about the prosecution's planned trial evidence against Kaczynski that U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell Jr. finally cut him short, saying, "I don't think I want the kind of detail you are  going into right now."<P>

Prosecutors declined comment after the hearing, but their in-court statements were quite a contrast to the subdued performance of Kaczynski's defense lawyers, Sacramento Federal Public Defender Quin Denvir and his co-counsel, Spokane Federal Defender Judy Clarke.<P>

Denvir and Clarke tried merely to persuade Burrell to reject the government's attempt to start trial next March. The defense lawyers dwelt on the daunting task of sorting through 17 years of discovery, steering clear of anything as sensational as the government's mention of a confession-filled diary.<P>

In an interview Friday afternoon, Denvir made no secret of his belief that Cleary walked into the courtroom with the intention of handing the media that juicy revelation. "It was clear he had prepared ahead of time to make those statements," Denvir said. "It was unexpected from our viewpoint and it certainly complicates further whether we can get a fair trial in this venue."<P>

Defense lawyers already indicated in court papers earlier this month that they may move for a change of venue, despite the nationwide publicity in the Kaczynski case. A federal grand jury indicted Kaczynski in June, charging him with four bombings, including two murders in Sacramento.<P>

The charges carry the potential for the death penalty. The prosecution team indicated Friday that it plans within two weeks to make its recommendation to Attorney General Janet Reno on that issue. Under Justice Department protocol, the attorney general makes the final decision, with defense lawyers given an opportunity to argue against the death penalty. Denvir said he has not made that argument to prosecutors at this juncture.<P>

Cleary, meanwhile, tried to put to rest any speculation that the prosecution's case against the Montana recluse is circumstantial. "This is not a circumstantial case," Cleary told Judge Burrell. <P>

The prosecutor said that when federal agents raided Kaczynski's one-room cabin this spring, they discovered a journal that detailed his day-to-day activities. In addition to musings on walks in the woods and other ordinary activities, Kaczynski's diary included admissions connecting him to each of the Unabomber's 16 documented attacks since 1978, Cleary maintained.<P>

"These documents are the backbone of the government's case," Cleary remarked in court.<P>

The prosecutor's other disclosures were not surprising, given the framework of the indictment. Cleary indicated that two other central elements in the case are the typewriter seized during the search of the cabin, which is believed to have been used to author Kaczynski's "manifesto," and forensic evidence linking the Unabomber's explosive devices and other items found in the cabin.<P>

Denvir and Clarke have filed court papers suggesting that they may attempt to suppress the evidence seized during the cabin search, but such motions rarely succeed. The diary thus appears to be another piece of evidence that could foreclose an innocence defense.<P>

"It might block a few avenues of credible defense," said Peter Robinson, a Santa Rosa defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor who is not involved in the case.<P>

However, other defense lawyers not involved in the case say the journal does not necessarily rule out an insanity defense, which prosecutors appear to anticipate. The government's pleadings have made numerous references to the possibility that the defense team will mount some sort of psychiatric defense.<P>

Three top defense lawyers said Friday that a personal journal can fit into a psychiatric defense, depending on the content. "Crazy people keep diaries," said San Francisco defense specialist Dennis Riordan. "If it's a whodunit, it can be devastating. If the defense is psychological, I don't know that the statements in themselves would be inconsistent with the defense."<P>

Former San Francisco U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello, meanwhile, was blunt in his assessment of the evidence, particularly given that an insanity defense is what he called a defense of "last resort."<P>

"It's very damning and it will get in [to evidence]," Russoniello said of the diary. "It's a further strong piece of evidence that he's the guy."<P>

Burrell late Friday refused for now to go along with the government's proposed trial schedule, which would have put Kaczynski before a jury by next spring. Prosecutors told the judge that they estimate it will take three to four months to put on their case.<P>

The judge sided with defense lawyers, who called it unprecedented to move such a complex case to trial within a year. Burrell set a hearing for November to discuss setting a firm trial date.<P>

Friday's hearing, incidentally, was the first appearance by Clarke, the recently installed head of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and a co-counsel in the Susan Smith murder trial in South Carolina. If the hearing was any indication, Clarke will take an in-court role at least equal to Denvir's: She handled much of the argument before Burrell.<P>

<h2>NACDL President-Elect to Join Kaczynski Defense</h2><p>

By Howard Mintz<br>
The Recorder<br>
July 16, 1996<p>


Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski's defense team has received a jolt of star power, with the recruitment of the incoming president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.<p>

Judy Clarke, the current federal public defender in Spokane and former head of the federal defender's office in San Diego, is expected to be added as co-counsel this week. Sacramento Federal Public Defender Quin Denvir has filed court papers asking U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell Jr. to appoint Clarke as second counsel for Kaczynski.<p>

Clarke, who takes over as NACDL president next month, has run federal defender's offices for much of the past 13 years, gaining a reputation as one of the nation's foremost experts on the federal sentencing guidelines. She has even authored a book on the byzantine sentencing statutes, and distributes a monthly publication on developments in sentencing law called "guidelines grapevine."<p>

The Unabomber prosecution is not the first time Clarke has jumped into a high-profile, complex and daunting defense situation: She volunteered to act as co-counsel for Susan Smith, the South Carolina woman convicted but spared the death penalty last year for murdering her two young sons.<p>

"She is the patron saint of defense lawyers," said San Antonio defense attorney Gerald Goldstein, former head of NACDL. "[Her specialty] is impossible tasks that require untold amounts of labor and imagination. There is not anybody I'd rather have at my back in my courtroom."<p>

Clarke, a South Carolina native, jumped into the Smith defense in part because she was well-acquainted with the lead defense lawyer, David Bruck. During the 1995 trial, Clarke was an integral part of the defense team, handling closing arguments in the guilt phase and assisting in the penalty phase. That experience could be important in defending Kaczynski, particularly in light of the fact that few federal practitioners have handled death penalty trials.<p>

In the Smith trial Clarke also attacked law enforcement's preparation of crime scene evidence. Such experience could be important in defending Kaczyinski, who has been linked by extensive forensic and circumstantial evidence to the Unabomber's 18-year crime spree.<p>

"What you get here is one of the most respected appellate advocates in the Ninth Circuit -- a household name," said San Francisco Federal Public Defender Barry Portman, who has lectured with Clarke over the years. "At the same time, you get somebody who has handled a major-league, high-profile death penalty case. It is a sensational combination."<p>

<b>Other Defense Team Candidates</b><br>

Kaczynski, whose next court appearance is scheduled for Friday, is charged with two murders and two other Unabomber -related bombings in the Sacramento indictment. The Justice Department has charged him under statutes that could bring the death penalty.<p>

Clarke could not be reached for comment Monday on her involvement in the case. Denvir also could not be reached, although he said last week that he would prefer not to announce his defense team in increments.<p>

At this point, it is unclear how much outside help Denvir will obtain to defend Kaczynski, although it is apparent he intends to retain a strong lead role for himself. Denvir has close ties to the Bay Area defense community, notably to Portman and appellate specialist Dennis Riordan, prompting speculation he may look locally for more help.<p>

Portman, who declines to discuss his role in the case, already has assisted Denvir in a behind-the-scenes capacity. There also are persistent rumors in the local defense bar that death penalty specialist Gary Sowards might be called in if the Justice Department chooses to press for the death penalty.<p>

Denvir last week declined to confirm the possible involvement of Sowards, a former California Appellate Project lawyer who is currently working on a class action challenge to the new habeas corpus statute before Chief U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson. Sowards did not return three phone calls seeking comment.<p>

Clarke, meanwhile, joins Denvir at a time when she is about to become the first public defender to head NACDL. It is not clear whether Clarke intends to continue running the defender's office in Spokane:  She took a leave of absence for the Smith trial, and turned her fees from the case over to the federal defender's budget.<p>

Lawyers who know both of Kaczysnki's defenders say Clarke and Denvir will present a formidable combination for the Justice Department's prosecution team.<p>

"They are two lawyers who are so secure with themselves they don't demand the spotlight, which will be important in a case like this," Portman said.<p>

<h2>Trial Judge Has Little Criminal Experience</h2>

<P>By Howard Mintz<br>
The Recorder<br>
June 20, 1996</P>

<P>It will be baptism by fire for the Sacramento federal judge assigned to preside over the case of Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski.</P>

<P>U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell Jr., the first African-American federal judge in Sacramento and a man described by his peers as unflappable and methodical, brings a load of civil experience but little criminal trial exposure to the high-profile case against Kaczynski.</P>

<P>As a lawyer, the 48-year-old Burrell's career was almost entirely devoted to civil litigation, one of the only issues to provoke questioning during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1992.</P>

<P>Even since taking the bench, Burrell has not drawn the more noteworthy federal criminal trials to hit the Sacramento courts in recent years, such as the string of Capitol corruption prosecutions brought by the Sacramento U.S. attorney's office. His decisions in criminal cases have produced nothing of published importance out of the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.</P>

<P>Nevertheless, many Sacramento lawyers say Burrell's patience in the courtroom and tendency toward cautious, slowly-delivered opinions suits him for a case that will draw a crush of attention from the media and legal profession. "I think I'm going to be right, two years down the line, that this person does not have an ego," says Sacramento City Attorney Samuel Jackson, a close friend of Burrell's and one of his former colleagues. "I don't think he'll let anything taint that. He will probably take another briefcase or two home [during this case], but that will be because he wants everything to be airtight."</P>

<P>Burrell drew the Kaczynski assignment after at least two other Sacramento federal judges, Lawrence Karlton and Edward Garcia, recused themselves. Karlton decided to bow out of the case because a close friend owns the building where the Unabomber's latest fatal bombing occurred in 1995, while Garcia recused himself because he does not believe he will be able to devote himself to the time-consuming case once he takes senior status in November.</P>

<P>One top Sacramento lawyer speculated that Garcia, who handled a number of the major Capitol corruption trials, simply does not want the headache of such a controversial case at this stage of his career.</P>

<P>The Sacramento indictment of Kaczynski on Tuesday certainly turned a quick spotlight on Burrell. Fellow Sacramento U.S. District Judge David Levi received so many media calls about Burrell on Wednesday that he has politely declined to discuss his colleague's credentials.</P>

<P>The question now for Burrell is whether he can keep a firm grip on the case and what promises to be a complex lengthy trial down the road, or wind up second-guessed and ridiculed like Lance Ito.</P>

<P>"The only hit he's going to take is his lack of experience," says former Sacramento U.S. District Judge Raul Ramirez. "He's a great guy, compassionate, you couldn't ask for more in a judge. I just hate to see him come under that kind of scrutiny. I don't think he's got a fin, and to swim with the sharks you've got to have a fin."</P>

<P><b>A Public Sector Lawyer</b><br>
Based on interviews with Sacramento lawyers and the roughly 40 pages of material Burrell submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1992, the judge brings a strong understanding of government to the bench because of a career centered on the public sector.</P>

<P>In fact, the only hardball question Burrell faced during his confirmation hearing came from Wisconsin Sen. Herbert Kohl, who asked how a lawyer so rooted in representing government could be "sensitive to citizen complaints about misuse of government authority?"</P>

<P>"I am always very sensitive as to how that authority is wielded," Burrell replied. "I grew up in neighborhoods where you had to deal with people of authority and there was some question as to whether or not there was fairness."</P>

<P>Burrell grew up in Los Angeles and eventually got his master's degree in social work in St. Louis before gaining his law degree from California Western School of Law in San Diego. In what would turn out to be his only experience in criminal law, Burrell's first full-time lawyer job came in the Sacramento district attorney's office in 1976, where he worked in the juvenile crimes section and the misdemeanor unit and, for a short time, on preliminary hearings in felony cases.</P>

<P>Burrell then went to the city attorney's office for the first of two stints. He was a deputy city attorney from 1978 to 1979, and a senior deputy again from 1986 to 1990. Jackson, who worked with Burrell through both tenures, labeled his colleague "Nighthawk" because of his relentless work habits.  During Burrell's second tour with the city attorney's office, he defended the police department, sued several local adult bookstores under an anti-smut ordinance, and supervised litigation aimed at drug and gang abatement. Burrell, in one of his more high-profile cases, succeeded in 1990 in shutting down a major Sacramento card room suspected of being a site of drug dealing.</P>

<P>In his Senate Judiciary Committee paperwork, Burrell cites his work for the Sacramento police department in crafting strategies to go after crack houses and other drug nuisances as one of his top accomplishments.</P>

<P><b>The U.S. Attorney's Office</b><br>
Another big chunk of Burrell's career was spent in the Sacramento U.S. attorney's office, where he served exclusively as a civil division lawyer. As a civil lawyer for the federal government, Burrell handled primarily environmental and tort issues, although at one point he successfully defended the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in a civil rights case over illegal searches.</P>

<P>Burrell was a civil litigator handling standard government tort cases from 1979 to 1985, but boosted his career when he came back to the office in 1990 after his second stint in the city attorney's office. At that time, he was hired as civil division chief by then-U.S. Attorney David Levi.</P>

<P>Levi, in fact, was considered a strong backer of Burrell's bid for a judgeship in 1992. Burrell headed the 15-lawyer civil division when former Republican Sen. John Seymour's local judicial screening committee recommended him to the Bush administration. Burrell indicates in his Judiciary Committee papers that he also had his hat in the ring for the Sacramento U.S. attorney's job when he was tapped for the bench.</P>

<P>Since becoming a judge, Burrell has done little to attract attention. In one case, he ordered a local school district to permit three Sikh students to carry ceremonial knives to school on religious freedom grounds, a decision affirmed by the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.</P>

<P>The judge also has been reversed for siding with Indian gaming interests in their long-running fight with the California attorney general's office, and briefly handled litigation over the IOUs given to state employees during the budget impasse two years ago.</P>

<P>There is little indication of Burrell's leanings in criminal litigation, but lawyers who know him say he is not an ideologue and is likely to give both federal prosecutors and Kaczynski's defense team plenty of latitude to make their arguments.</P>

<P>"He'll be able to stand up to public scrutiny," says former Sacramento U.S. Attorney George O'Connell. "He's conservative in following legal precedent -- he's going to be very careful. But there is no ideological bent I've ever seen him display."</P>

<h2>Bombing Indictment: Thin But Powerful</h2>

<P>By Howard Mintz<br>
The Recorder<br>
June 19, 1996</P>

<P>Despite an 18-year crime spree and a mountain of circumstantial and forensic evidence, Justice Department lawyers appear to have resisted the temptation to bloat their indictment of Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski.</P>

<P>A Sacramento federal grand jury on Tuesday returned a 10 -count indictment against Kaczynski that mentions just four of the 16 attacks attributed to the Unabomber by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The bare-bones, nine-page indictment packs plenty of punch, however: It covers two of the Unabomber's three murder victims, and employs death penalty statutes that were amended in 1994 with an eye toward withstanding constitutional challenge.</P>

<P>The indictment also gives strong indications as to why Justice Department officials settled on Sacramento as the lead venue for prosecuting Kaczynski, the recluse arrested this spring at his remote cabin in Montana. In addition to Unabomber -related murders occurring in Sacramento in 1985 and 1995, prosecutors apparently have been able to establish Sacramento links to two of the bomber's other more notorious crimes in 1993.</P>

<P>Those charges involve mail bombs that exploded and injured two different doctors, one in Tiburon and another in Connecticut. The indictment indicates that federal prosecutors will try to prove Kaczynski mailed those explosive devices to his victims from Sacramento in June 1993, giving the government two more compelling crimes to present to a jury in the Sacramento indictment.</P>

<P>Justice Department officials declined comment Tuesday, and even eschewed the usual press conference to announce the indictment. The decision not to hold a press conference was a stark contrast to the stream of government leaks about evidence assembled by the FBI since Kaczynski was arrested in April.</P>

<P>"It augurs well that they are showing self-restraint," a former federal prosecutor said.</P>

<P>The Justice Department did release a media statement outlining the charges and crediting the many U.S. attorneys with a stake in the case, including San Francisco U.S. Attorney Michael Yamaguchi.</P>

<P>Sacramento and New Jersey -- where the Unabomber's third murder occurred -- were always considered front-runners for the prosecution, but Sacramento got the case despite a lobbying effort by New Jersey U.S. Attorney Faith Hochberg. The Justice Department is expected eventually to bring another indictment in New Jersey in connection with the 1994 bombing death of an advertising executive.</P>

<P>The prosecution team, however, is headed by Hochberg's chief assistant, Robert Cleary. The other two principal members are San Francisco Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Frecerro and Sacramento Assistant U.S. Attorney R. Steven Lapham. Frecerro, in fact, presented the case to the Sacramento grand jury, according to two lawyers following the case.</P>

<P>Sacramento Federal Public Defender Quin Denvir, who expects to lead Kaczynski's defense, was not prepared Tuesday to speculate about any vulnerabilities in the indictment. "We'll take a look at everything," said Denvir, already under siege by media members who camped outside his house over the weekend in anticipation of the indictment.</P>

<P><b>Death Penalty Issues</b><br>
One issue certain to be raised by the indictment is the death penalty. Under the statutes adopted by Congress as part of the 1994 crime bill, Kaczynski's lawyers will have an opportunity to dissuade the Justice Department from pursuing capital punishment in the case.</P>

<P>If Attorney General Janet Reno decides to seek the death penalty, the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals is fertile ground for a constitutional challenge to the statutes. In 1994, a Ninth Circuit panel found the two statutes that authorize the death penalty for mail bombing offenses to be unconstitutional in U.S. v. Cheely, 21 F.3d 914, a decision written by Judge Betty Fletcher.</P>

<P>The Justice Department then succeeded in amending the two statutes as part of the 1994 crime bill to address the Ninth Circuit's concerns in Cheely. The statutes, 18 U.S.C. 844(d) and 1716, were labeled overbroad by the Ninth Circuit, but Congress narrowed them to apply only to defendants who mail explosives with the intent to kill or injure.</P>

<P>Federal prosecutors apparently are quite confident that the amendments have erased any constitutional problems -- even for one murder predating the amendments. Justice Department officials stated in their press release that Kaczynski faces the death penalty for both the 1995 murder of Sacramento timber industry executive Gilbert Murray and the 1985 murder of computer store owner Hugh Scrutton.</P>

<P>Lawyers following the case have assumed that Cheely might prevent the government from seeking the death penalty for the 1985 murder, primarily because it occurred before the statute was amended. Denvir remarked Tuesday that his reading of Cheely appeared to prevent capital charges for the 1985 murder.</P>

<P>Denvir and other defense lawyers are less optimistic about the chances of finding the 1994 amendments unconstitutional, however, because the language appears to parallel a lengthy footnote in Fletcher's opinion. Nevertheless, defense lawyers expect the issue to be litigated, much as the defense team has done in the Oklahoma City bombing case, which involves the same statutes. There have been no rulings on the issue yet in the Oklahoma case.</P>

<P>"I think the government, when it passed the 1994 crime bill, sought to eliminate the question," said Indianapolis defense attorney Richard Kammen, who litigated the Cheely case. "From what I've seen out of the Oklahoma City case, not all of the questions have been eliminated."</P>

<P><b>Evidentiary Disputes Likely </b><Br>
Another matter likely to trigger litigation will be the government's ability to introduce evidence of other Unabomber -related crimes not mentioned in the indictment. At trial, prosecutors can introduce such evidence as so-called 404b material, relying on arguments such as modus operandi.</P>

<P>A 1995 Ninth Circuit case that produced a great deal of law on the mail bombing statutes appears to give the government support in this area.</P>

<P>In U.S. v. Manning, 95 C.D.O.S. 4303, the Ninth Circuit permitted federal prosecutors to introduce evidence of a 1972 explosives conviction to show a pattern in the trial of a man for a 1980 mail bombing murder in Los Angeles. Defense lawyers failed in their argument that the prior conviction occurred too far apart from the charged crime. That could be important to federal prosecutors in the Unabomber case, who may want to introduce evidence stretching back to the 1970s.</P>

<P>DNA evidence also may be a source of litigation in the case. The search warrant affidavit for Kaczynski's cabin unsealed last week indicates that the FBI has obtained DNA evidence from saliva taken from letters allegedly linked to the Unabomber. Frecerro, who could not be reached for comment Tuesday, may play a role in this area: He recently put on the Northern District's first DNA case in the trial of an accused jewelry store robber.</P>

<P><b>Judge is Former Prosecutor</b><br>
The federal judge who may decide these issues in the Kaczynski case is U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell Jr., a 1992 George Bush appointee. The indictment was assigned to Burrell's court in Sacramento on Tuesday.</P>

<P>The 49-year-old Burrell is the newest judge on Sacramento's federal bench, which has yet to get an appointment during the Clinton administration. Burrell was for the most part a government lawyer before joining the federal bench.</P>

<P>Although Burrell had a brief stint in the Sacramento district attorney's office, most of his experience has come in civil litigation. He was deputy chief of the civil division in the U.S. attorney's office from 1979 to 1985, chief deputy city attorney from 1986 to 1990, and chief of the civil division in the U.S. attorney's office from 1990 until his appointment to the bench in 1992.</P>


<P>If Denvir decides he wants another judge to handle the case, Burrell could be vulnerable to a recusal motion. This is because of his lengthy tenure in the Sacramento U.S. attorney's office, which has had the Unabomber case in the investigative stage since at least 1985.</P>

<P>Even though Burrell, as a civil division lawyer, probably had no involvement in the case, a Ninth Circuit ruling last year made it tougher for former U.S. attorneys who take the bench to later preside over cases that were in their office. The question in Burrell's case is whether the Ninth Circuit's reasoning applies to supervisors in a U.S. attorney's office who later become federal judges, or just to the U.S. attorney.</P>

<P>The legal wrangling in the case may not begin for another week or so. Kaczynski cannot be transferred to California until a removal hearing is held in Montana, where he remains in custody.</P>

<h2>'Complete Lawyer' in Kaczynski's Corner</h2>

<P>By Howard Mintz <br>
The Recorder<br>
June 18, 1996</P>

<P>With less than three weeks on the job, new Sacramento Federal Public Defender Quin Denvir has scarcely had a chance to hang his law degree on the office wall. But he apparently has taken over the office just in time to inherit a client suspected of being one of the most diabolical, complex and elusive criminals in U.S. history. </P>

<P>The impending indictment of Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski is about to rivet attention on Denvir, who took over the Sacramento defender's office at the beginning of June. An indictment is expected to be returned in Sacramento as early as  this week, an event that will thrust the 56-year-old Denvir into the limelight and most likely consume the attention of his office. </P>

<P>Denvir, however, is unlikely to be the proverbial deer caught in the headlights. As one of California's most respected appellate lawyers, Denvir is no stranger to high-profile cases, from the Billionaire Boys Club murder to former California schools chief William Honig's conflict-of-interest conviction. </P>

<P>Denvir did not return three phone calls seeking comment on his possible role in the Unabomber case, a sign in itself that the defender's life already has been transformed: Denvir is usually quick to respond to the media. But he did tell the Sacramento Bee this weekend that he intends to "take a very active role" in leading the defense team. </P>

<P>Bay Area and Sacramento lawyers who know Denvir well predict that the Catholic-educated son of a Chicago trial lawyer is the right man for what may be a thankless, gut-wrenching job. </P>

<P>"Quin is a complete lawyer," says Sacramento defense attorney Clyde Blackmon. "He's both a trial lawyer and a good appellate lawyer. I've never heard anybody say a bad word about Quin." </P>

<P>While it is too early to determine if Denvir will act as Kaczynski's trial lawyer, defense specialists expect him to play a lead role in formulating strategy and assembling a defense team. Kaczynski has been represented by federal public defenders while in jail in Montana, so it is assumed that at least part of his representation will come from Denvir's office once the bombing charges are filed in the Eastern District of California. </P>

<P>A Justice Department indictment in Sacramento can be expected to hinge in large part on the most recent of the Unabomber's 16 attacks: the 1995 murder of timber industry lobbyist Gilbert Murray. Because the case is likely to be complex and include capital charges, Kaczynski will be entitled to several court-appointed lawyers. </P>

<P>In this regard, Denvir's close ties to the Bay Area defense community could become important: He has longstanding bonds with fellow appellate specialist Dennis Riordan and San Francisco Federal Public Defender Barry Portman, who many local lawyers say will have an influential role in Kaczynski's defense. </P>

<P>Portman, often relied on for advice by other public defenders in the Ninth Circuit, declined comment on what role, if any, he expects to play. But his praise for Denvir, who he has known since the early 1970s, is effusive. </P>

<P>"The bottom line with Quin is that he is very committed to representing the indigent," Portman says. </P>

<P><b>From The Golden Dome to the Capitol Dome</b><br>
Denvir was picked earlier this year to head Sacramento's federal public defender ranks by the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, which in the process chose to oust veteran Sacramento Federal Public Defender Arthur Ruthenbeck. Ruthenbeck, who could not be reached for comment, is slated next month to take a chief administrator's job in the San Francisco office of the state public defender. </P>

<P>The Ninth Circuit made the switch without much fanfare, in part because there is not much that is controversial about Denvir. The only open criticism has come from a small group of Sacramento defense lawyers who complained that he favored Bay Area lawyers while running the indigent defense program for the Third and Fifth District state courts of appeal. </P>

<P>For Denvir, becoming federal public defender brings him full circle, back to the public sector after years of establishing a strong private practice in Sacramento. In fact, Denvir really made his name in California by serving as the state public defender from 1978 to 1984. </P>

<P>A Chicago native, Denvir is a University of Notre Dame graduate who got his law degree from the University of Chicago School of Law. After a brief taste of big-firm life in Washington, D.C.'s Covington & Burling, Denvir moved to California with his brother in 1971 to work for California Rural Legal Assistance Inc. (Denvir's brother, John, is now a law professor at the University of San Francisco.) </P>

<P>Friends say Denvir's father, a trial lawyer himself, advised his son that he needed to gain trial experience, so he joined the Monterey public defender's office in the mid-1970s. Denvir later was appointed chief counsel for the state department of health by Gov. Jerry Brown, which led to his appointment in 1978 to head the state PD's office. </P>

<P>Denvir led the state defender's office until 1984, when Republican Gov. George Deukmejian began to cut funding and staffing for the operation. At that point, Denvir headed for private practice, becoming a partner in the Sacramento office of Marron, Reid & Sheehy. With his reputation as an appellate guru solidified, Denvir struck out on his own in 1987, starting a small practice he maintained until this month. </P>

<P>Now, as federal public defender, Denvir's lengthy resume may be reduced to one line: The lawyer who represents the Unabomber. </P>

<P>"He's obviously a guy who has a first-class academic pedigree," says Riordan. "And yet he's got street sense from living in Chicago and he likes to get in there and mix it up. I'm not saying there aren't people with more trial experience than Quin, but he has tried cases over a 25-year span. He can handle it." </P>

<P><b>Assembling A Trial Team</b><br>
Based on interviews with a dozen top defense specialists, a number of questions surround a prospective Denvir-led defense team. For one thing, many lawyers question whether Denvir can devote himself full time to such a complex case while simultaneously running a fairly large office. </P>

<P>The Sacramento federal public defender's office is actually considerably larger than Portman's: Denvir oversees 21 lawyers, while Portman has 16. "When you are coming in and just starting, it's a difficult thing to do," Portman says of taking on a case like Kaczynski's. </P>

<P>Denvir also faces the delicate issue of bringing in talented outside help from the private bar versus relying on his own lawyers. Sacramento's defense bar gives relatively good marks to lawyers in the PD's office, but Bay Area defense lawyers are less complimentary: They say Denvir could do better by attracting private lawyers from either Sacramento or San Francisco. </P>

<P>While rumors have been flying about possible candidates for a defense team, Denvir's plans remain a mystery. Defense lawyers with experience in complex cases say it is likely Denvir would divide tasks. For example, one lawyer would be appointed to handle death penalty issues. </P>

<P>There also has been considerable speculation that Montana Assistant Federal Public Defender Anthony Gallagher, who has represented Kaczynski since his arrest this spring, will remain on the case if it moves to California. </P>

<P>Gallagher declined comment on the issue.</P>

<P>In the meantime, defense lawyers are sizing up the possibility that Denvir himself might grab the chance of a lifetime and act as lead trial lawyer. And his friends and colleagues say it would be a mistake to pigeonhole Denvir as an appellate lawyer, pointing out that he learned his craft as a state public defender in Monterey.</P>

<P>In addition, Denvir has had broad familiarity with murder and death penalty issues as an appellate lawyer. Most recently, Denvir and Riordan have represented on appeal two defendants convicted in San Mateo County in connection with the Billionaire Boys Club case. </P>

<P>In addition, Denvir has been representing three death row inmates in their federal habeas corpus proceedings: Steven Ainsworth and David Breaux in Sacramento, and Thomas Thompson in Orange County. The capital expertise could be crucial in Kaczynski's case.</P>

<P>"He's smart and even-tempered," says East Bay defense attorney Cristina Arguedas, president of California Attorneys for Criminal Justice. "He's got a reputation as an appellate attorney, but he can try a case. He's so thorough it wouldn't be a problem." </P>

<h2>Mulling the Death Penalty</h2>

<P>By Charles Finnie<br>
Legal Times<br>
April 23, 1996</P>

<P>WASHINGTON -- Since the April 3 arrest of Theodore Kaczynski, the university mathematician turned reclusive mountain man, Justice Department officials have managed to disclose a vast array of information explaining why they believe he is the elusive Unabomber. </P>

<P>But there's one point department officials -- from the attorney general on down -- are keeping well under wraps: the prospect of invoking the federal death penalty for the Unabomber's 17-year terror campaign. </P>

<P>"I can't comment on how this matter will proceed, except to say that we will take every step based on the evidence and the law," Attorney General Janet Reno said April 18 at her weekly news briefing. </P>

<P>Although department officials are loath to acknowledge it, the silence reflects a lesson learned from its case against the two men charged with carrying out the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. </P>

<P>Within hours of the Oklahoma City explosion, Reno vowed that she would move to execute those responsible. "The death penalty is available, and we will seek it," she said, looking to assure a shocked nation -- and seemingly running roughshod over a policy she issued less than three months earlier on how the department would deliberate in cases eligible for capital punishment. </P>

<P>If that isn't reason enough to keep mum, another uncomfortable factor looms when considering the death penalty for the Unabomber. </P>

<P>The Kaczynski family early in their dealings with the Federal Bureau of Investigation voiced objections to capital punishment, says Tony Bisceglie, the Washington lawyer who serves as an intermediary between the Kaczynskis and the FBI. And although they were in no position to "negotiate a guaranteed outcome," Bisceglie says, the family no doubt will remind Reno that she has her suspect in jail only by the grace of Kaczynski's brother, whose suspicions eventually enabled the FBI to make its arrest. </P>

<P>"Let's be frank here," says Bisceglie. "There is only one person who could have brought him to the attention of the government, and it was David [Kaczynski]." </P>

<P>A final reason for the tight lips on the death penalty is that, while lawyers in the case are reviewing potential statutory schemes for invoking capital punishment, it remains to be seen on what charges the evidence is strongest -- and whether the federal interest in the prosecution could be better served by a swifter, non-capital case, which could still put the accused perpetrator behind bars for decades, if not for life. </P>

<P>Across the country, capital defense lawyers, who are keenly interested in how the attorney general has wielded the federal death penalty since its modifications and expansion in the 1994 crime bill, are watching the case closely. </P>

<P>Recalling Reno's "hang 'em high" rhetoric in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, the attorney general has won praise from the defense bar for keeping quiet as the Unabomber case unfolds. </P>

<P>"I can only compliment them on learning their lesson," says Gerald Goldstein, of San Antonio, Texas, the immediate past president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. </P>

<P>Goldstein, however, was quick to add that Reno's silence is in marked contrast to the "flood of leaks" on evidentiary matters emanating from her department, a point Goldstein says is an embarrassment to Reno. </P>

<P>"There will come a day when a court is going to toss out a serious case because of that kind of behavior," he predicts. </P>

<P>On Friday, a judge in Helena, Mont., rejected a defense motion filed on Kaczynski's behalf asking that the planned grand jury proceedings in the case be halted because news leaks have compromised chances for an impartial hearing. Kaczynski's Montana counsel declined comment for this article, citing a local court rule forbidding discussion of criminal cases in the media. </P>

<P>The bottom line of any behind-the-scenes death penalty deliberations is made abundantly clear, however, in the procedures themselves, which Reno issued on Jan. 27, 1995. If an indictment allowing for capital punishment is returned against Kaczynski, it will fall to the attorney general herself to make the final call in yet another hot case -- and perhaps during the heat of a presidential campaign. </P>

<P>According to defense lawyers, legal scholars and former Justice Department officials, Reno's ultimate decision on the death penalty is an open question, given what is known about Kaczynski and what still remains to be seen of his legal defense. </P>

<P>And a department summary of its death penalty-eligible cases in 1994 and 1995 offers few clues about the ultimate outcome. </P>

<P>It shows Reno has authorized an increasing number of capital cases, but suggests she will accept life sentences in some of these cases in exchange for guilty pleas. What's more, she has withdrawn official notices of intent to seek capital punishment in pending cases and, at least once, did so over the objections of a U.S. attorney. </P>

<P>As applied to the Unabomber case, the procedures, known as U.S. Attorney's Manual 9-10, call for the lead prosecutor, Robert Cleary, the top New Jersey assistant U.S. attorney, to invite Kaczynski's defense counsel to meet and present arguments against capital punishment. Kaczynski is currently being represented by Michael Donahoe and Tony Gallagher of the nonprofit Federal Defenders of Montana. </P>

<P>Regardless of whether Cleary chooses to proceed further, the rules call for him to prepare a prosecution memorandum to be submitted to the chief of the department's Criminal Division. The document is supposed to include a comprehensive discussion of the government's theory of liability in the case; facts and evidence covering any aggravating and mitigating factors set forth in the death penalty provisions of the 1994 crime bill; biographical and criminal data on the defendant; and any justification for a federal, as opposed to a state, prosecution. </P>

<P>One thing the rules don't allow Justice prosecutors to do is use the threat of a death sentence as leverage in seeking a plea from the defendant. </P>

<P>Cleary did not return a telephone message seeking comment. </P>

<P>If he were to choose to press for a death penalty authorization from Main Justice, a capital punishment review panel -- made up of Reno and Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick, or their designees -- would be convened. That body must invite defense counsel to make a second presentation. </P>

<P>Following a recommendation from the review panel, which is supposed to be completed within 15 days, it is left to the attorney general to authorize or reject the filing of a death penalty notice. </P>

<P>Capital defense specialists are suspicious of the review process, particularly in high-profile cases, and in the politically charged context of the death penalty. </P>

<P>That sentiment is held strongest perhaps by lawyers for the Oklahoma City bombing defendants, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. </P>

<P>"We declined to participate on the basis that the procedure is a sham and the decision was already made," says Robert Nigh Jr., one of three court-appointed lawyers for McVeigh. </P>

<P>To support the charge, Nigh, a solo practitioner and former assistant federal public defender in Nebraska, cites post-bombing comments by Reno and President Bill Clinton. Indeed, the Justice Department hasn't as yet put the legal implications of the post-explosion comments in the Oklahoma City
blast behind it. A hearing is scheduled May 1 in Denver on a bid by the bombing defendants, McVeigh and Nichols, to block capital punishment in their case. </P>

<P>In the motion, their lawyers claim Reno prejudged the matter, thereby violating her own procedures for authorizing the death penalty -- and, by extension, the due process rights of McVeigh and Nichols. </P>

<P>Nigh says that an acceptable alternative to the procedures for the Oklahoma City case would be for the courts to appoint a special prosecutor or commission to decide the question. </P>

<P>The Justice Department has countered Nigh's claims in court papers. The department argues the attorney general's guidelines confer no due process rights on criminal defendants. </P>

<P>The department also contends that the procedures were properly followed in the case, regardless of the post-bomb statements. </P>

<P>Another defense lawyers says that he has had a better experience with the process. </P>

<P>David Ruhnke, a leading New Jersey capital defense specialist, has appeared twice before the Justice Department death penalty review panel.</P>

<P>"I can't in good conscience call it a rubber stamp," says Ruhnke, of West Orange's Ruhnke & Barrett. </P>

<P>In 1995, Ruhnke succeeded in convincing the attorney general to reject the death penalty for a client charged in a drug-related killing, although the U.S. attorney in Pennsylvania prosecuting the case argued for authorization. </P>

<P>Yet, Ruhnke adds, he is under no delusions that the attorney general would find it easy to reach a similar conclusion in the case against Kaczynski, given the three deaths and 23 injuries that FBI agents have ascribed to the Unabomber. </P>

<P>"In a sense, it is like Oklahoma City," he says. "You've got national attention and the politics of the death penalty. I would be surprised if they're not predisposed, and would have to be talked out of it." </P>

<P>George Kendall, the top death penalty lawyer at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., which has a long tradition of monitoring and intervening in state capital punishment cases, expressed little faith Reno would reject the death penalty in the Unabomber case, if confronted with political pressure to seek it. </P>

<P>"I don't care what policies you have in place," Kendall says. "Objective criteria go out the window." </P>

<P>Stephen Bright, of the Southern Center for Human Rights in Atlanta, applauds Reno for setting up the procedures, but he says he remains skeptical of their value to defendants. </P>

"It is hard to imagine they will be able to resist, with the publicity," Bright says of a decision in the Unabomber case. "Nothing drives the death penalty like publicity." 

<P><b>Poetic Justice</b><br>
For the man accused of being the Unabomber, there may be poetic justice in the statute under which federal prosecutors are most likely to seek an indictment. </P>

<P>18 U.S.C. 1716, a Postal Service measure, was signed into law in 1948, but was based on statutes dating back to 1909, before the modern-day technology the Unabomber rails against took hold. </P>

<P>Although the statute's criminal ban on mailing "injurious articles" covers explosives, it is first and foremost concerned with organic matter -- specifically poisons and poisonous animals, reptiles, and insects, and live scorpions in particular.</P>

<P>Each intentional violation of the statute that results in injury is punishable by a $10,000 fine or a 20-year prison sentence. The death penalty, carried out by lethal injection, or life in prison without parole is available if a victim is killed. </P>

<P>A five-year statute of limitation, however, means prosecution under the measure for much of the Unabomber's mail -bombing campaign is foreclosed. The statute would be available for two 1993 bombings, which injured a University of California geneticist and a Yale computer scientist, and for two fatal blasts in 1994 and 1995. The latter killed New Jersey public relations executive Thomas Mosser and California forestry industry representative Gilbert Murray. </P>

<P>To invoke the death penalty, the government also would be required to prove one of several aggravating factors established by the 1994 crime bill. Killings involving "substantial planning" is one factor the department would consider. </P>

<P>One former Republican Justice Department official is not yet sold that the government will, or even should, seek the death penalty for Kaczynski. </P>

<P>And no matter what the decision, says George Terwilliger, the second in command at the Justice Department during President George Bush's administration, federal prosecutors have no reason to rush. </P>

<P>Terwilliger says gauging the death penalty, as well as potential prison sentences set out in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, will be just two of many considerations in the government's prosecution strategy. </P>

<P>The primary question, he says, will be venue: "Where is the strongest case?" He adds that the department also would want to "preserve the options presented by multiple prosecutions," whether in various federal districts or by cooperating with state prosecutors. </P>

<P>Given the criminal penalties in the postal statute and related measures, "there seems enough evidence to convict him of serious crimes in the District of Montana, put him away for a long time, and vindicate the federal interest," Terwilliger says. </P>

<P>Terwilliger also parts company with many defense lawyers on the inevitability of politics coming to bear on the death penalty question. </P>

<P>"People died. Public opinion is relevant. He created terror. He killed purposely," Terwilliger says of the Unabomber. "But it is not a slam dunk. There is a political focus to any decision an attorney general makes. Yet, I would guess it would not be a major focus." </P>

<P>Although Justice Department officials declined comment for this article, a summary of recent death penalty cases released by its public affairs office suggests that Reno, who personally opposes capital punishment, has nonetheless not been reluctant to employ it as attorney general. </P>

<P>According to the figures, Reno authorized the federal death penalty for 38 defendants during her first three years on the job, which is more than half the total number approved since 1990. </P>

<P>In 1995, after passage of the 1994 crime bill, which expanded and established new evidentiary standards for the federal death penalty, Reno authorized it for nine new defendants. But she also moved to withdraw from seeking it against five defendants, according to the summary. None has actually been executed. </P>

<P>Paul Rothstein, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, says the figures suggest the department is deliberating carefully, and he applauds Reno for imposing a centralized mechanism that serves to insulate decisions from local passions and prejudice. </P>

<P>"I think it is inevitable there will be some political influence, and political influence is abominable in a death penalty decision," says Rothstein. </P>

<P>Rothstein agrees with Terwilliger that the death penalty question in the Unabomber case will not be a political test for Reno. </P>

<P>"Oklahoma City was a test, but Kaczynski is far more complicated," he says. "He is obviously nuts, which is a mitigating factor. I just don't think there is going to be the coalescence of public opinion. It's a vastly different case. I think the procedures will work." </P>

<P>Rothstein still sees a virtue in the procedural alternative offered by the lawyers for the accused Oklahoma City bombers, however. </P>

<P>"The best solution to political influence would be an independent commission or committee totally insulated, say with lifetime tenure, older folks with no reputation to make or break -- and made up of every conceivable shade," he says. </P>

<P>Yet with no such proposals on the horizon in Congress and with the Supreme Court having yet to hear an appeal of the new federal death penalty, the decision is certain to fall to Reno. </P>

<P>And that sets up the possibility of a peculiar first for the attorney general, if, in fact, Cleary, the New Jersey prosecutor leading the case, moves for the death penalty for Kaczynski. </P>

<P>Bisceglie, the white collar and civil litigator who is the Kaczynski family's go-between with the FBI, says he expects to participate in any formal Justice Department death penalty review on the case. It remains to be seen whether that would include an actual appearance at the review committee meetings.</P>

<h2>The 'Right Mix' for Prosecuting the Unabomber</h2>

<P>By Maureen Castellano<br>
<i>The New Jersey Law Journal</i><br>
April 15, 1996</P>

<P>Veteran New York defense attorney Ronald Fischetti still recalls the first and only time he went up against Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Cleary, now the second chair in the District of New Jersey, who was named last week as the lead prosecutor in the Unabomber investigation. </P>

<P>It was 1989, and Fischetti was counsel to a New York lawyer who was standing trial, with a colleague, for orchestrating a $1.6 billion tax fraud. Hundreds of unwitting clients, including actor Woody Allen, were defrauded in the phony tax-shelter operation. </P>

<P>"This was a very big, very complicated, yet very dry, tax case," says Fischetti, a partner in Manhattan's Fischetti & Russo. "I expected to try it against a heavy-hitter, and in walked this young pup who was new to the [U.S. attorney's] office and who nobody knew." </P>

<P>Fischetti says he was delighted to have a junior prosecutor handling the three-month trial -- until he saw Cleary in action. </P>

<P>"By the end of the case," Fischetti says, "he had me going through the roof with objections to what were really novel trial approaches. But he had earned my tremendous respect. I still think I would have won that case against a lesser lawyer."</P>

<P>He adds, jokingly, "Tell him I'm still smarting from losing." </P>

<P>In announcing Cleary as lead prosecutor of the six-member government team in the case, Justice Department officials stressed Thursday that no decision had been made about where Unabomb suspect Theodore Kaczynski might be charged, or what charges would be filed. </P>

<P>But New Jersey and California are considered the top choices for the first trial because the deaths of a Unabomber victim in each state occurred after the enactment of the most recent, and most expansive, federal death penalty law. </P>

<P>New Jersey advertising executive Thomas Mosser was killed in December 1994 when a mail bomb exploded in the kitchen of his West Caldwell home, while forestry industry lobbyist Gilbert Murray was killed in April 1995 by a mail bomb in Sacramento, Calif. The Unabomber also is suspected of murdering a third victim in Sacramento in 1985, but that was nine years before the expanded federal death penalty statute took effect. In addition, 23 people were injured in related incidents during the past 17 years.</P>

<P><B>Good Blend of Skills</B><BR> Regardless of where charges are brought in the case, Cleary will coordinate the investigation and serve as lead prosecutor, according to Justice Department spokesman Carl Stern. Stern said Cleary was chosen largely on the basis of experience.</P>

<P>Attorneys from New York and New Jersey, where Cleary, 40, has worked for his entire career, say the Justice Department could not have made a better choice.</P>

<P>U.S. Attorney Faith Hochberg, who recruited Cleary in October 1994 from the U.S. Attorney's office in the Southern District of New York, says he has the "legal and strategic skills" needed to handle the complex case. The investigation spans nine federal jurisdictions and requires the oversight of investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and local and state law enforcement officials.</P>

<P>"He [Cleary] combines an incisive legal mind with a very cool head and is the consummate team player," Hochberg says. "He has the right mix to handle this case."</P>

<P>Hochberg also notes that Cleary is intimately familiar with the requirements of the federal death penalty. When Christopher Green of East Orange was charged last year with killing four men and wounding a fifth during a robbery at the U.S. Post Office in Montclair, Cleary helped Hochberg determine that the law was inapplicable because of the absence of an aggravating factor. Under the statute, torture is considered a heinous and cruel crime, punishable by the death penalty, while a multiple execution- style murder is not. As a result, Green pleaded guilty and received a life sentence.</P>

<P><B>Justice Orchestrates Strategy</B> <BR> Justice Department officials and prosecutors, including Cleary and his boss, Hochberg, met last week for a strategy session to address how to proceed in the case against Kaczynski, 53, a reclusive former math professor who lived in a shack near Lincoln, Mont. To date, Kaczynski has been held on a single federal bomb-making charge. A grand jury is scheduled to convene this month to consider further charges. </P>

<P>Justice spokesman Stern says prosecutors expect the investigation of Kaczynski's Montana cabin to be completed early this week. Stern declined comment on reports Friday that investigators had discovered a typed copy of the 35,000-word Unabomber manifesto in a crawl space in the cabin. </P>

<P>Among the meeting participants were the five other members of the prosecution team: Assistant U.S. Attorneys Stephen Freccero of the Northern District of California in San Francisco, Robert Steven Lapham of the Eastern District of California in Sacramento and Bernard Hubley of Montana, and Justice Department attorneys E. Thomas Roberts of the terrorism and violent crime section and J. Douglas Wilson, of the appellate section. </P>

<P>The team will report to Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Merrick Garland, who last year took charge of the Oklahoma City bombing case. </P>

<P>Justice Department officials said a range of legal issues was discussed at the meeting last Monday: which bomb attack was substantiated by the most evidence, which judges and jurors might be found to hear the case in each vicinage, and even the differences between the circuit courts. The Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which might hear the case on appeal if the trial is held in New Jersey, is more conservative than the Ninth Circuit, which sits in California. </P>

<P><B>'Most-Senior Adviser'</B><BR> In Cleary's 18 months as first assistant in the District of New Jersey, he has tried no cases. Instead, he has served basically as chief administrator in Hochberg's office, which has about 100 assistants. Hochberg says Cleary, whom she calls her "most-senior adviser," has been involved in "every single decision that has been made." </P>

<P>Before coming to New Jersey, Cleary served as chief of the major-crimes unit in the Southern District in Manhattan, where he concentrated on complex white-collar cases. Cleary joined that office in 1987 and is best remembered for winning convictions in the $1.6 billion tax fraud case against New York attorneys Michael Oshatz and Leonard Messinger. </P>

<P>Ronald Fischetti, who represented Messinger, recalls that one of Cleary's novel trial strategies sparked a Second Circuit ruling barring prosecutors from cross-examining character witnesses. Cleary used that technique to great advantage, Fischetti says, in U.S. v. Oshatz, 89-1228. </P>

<P>"He basically used the character witnesses to go through the indictment step by step and hammer home each allegation," says Fischetti, who served as co-counsel on the case with Barry Slotnick of Manhattan's Slotnick & Shapiro. He says Cleary asked the witnesses whether their positive opinions of Oshatz and Messinger would change if the two men were found guilty of the charges against them. The technique, Fischetti says, proved to be a devastating one. "By the time he was done, our character witnesses' testimony was completely upended," he says. </P>

<P>In an August 1990 opinion, the Second Circuit condemned that line of questioning, saying it undermines the presumption of innocence. But the three-judge panel, in an opinion by Judge Jon Newman, found the error harmless and upheld the convictions, concluding there was overwhelming evidence establishing the defendants' guilt. </P>

<P>Fischetti says he "went through the roof" in objecting to the practice during the trial before Judge Robert Sweet of the Southern District. But, he concedes, even today, "That was lawyering." </P>

<P>Fischetti, who says he later became friends with Cleary, says the prosecutor demonstrated a remarkable ability to take "all kinds of disparate bits of evidence and put it together in one cohesive case." Fischetti says Cleary made that case an easy one -- despite the convoluted tax laws at issue -- for the jury to understand. </P>

<P>But, even more important, Fischetti says, the prosecutor showed great equanimity throughout the hotly contested trial, an approach for which Cleary won the U.S. Department of Justice Director's Award for Superior Performance. "He never lost his cool," Fischetti says. </P>

<P>Cleary, who lives in Manhattan, is a graduate of the College of William and Mary. He earned his law degree in 1980 from Fordham University School of Law. Cleary returned to Fordham in 1991 as an adjunct professor, teaching a semester-long seminar to second- and third-year law students selected to serve as interns with federal and New York state prosecutors. </P>

<P>Before joining the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District, Cleary worked in the Justice Department's Tax Division in Washington, D.C., for two-and-a-half years. </P>

<P>Previously, he was a litigation associate for four years with Manhattan's Hughes, Hubbard & Reed. James Kobak, a partner at the firm, recalls Cleary deftly handling a pro bono case on his own shortly after he joined the firm. "He had a natural rapport with the judge and jury," says Kobak.</P>

<H2>War Crimes Tribunal: Documents</H2>



<P><A HREF="dismissrule.html">Ruling on Motion to Dismiss Tadic Charges</A><BR>
Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic made a motion to dismiss all charges against him on the grounds that the war crimes tribunal, created by the United Nations, lacks jurisdiction and legitimacy. This is the August 8, 1995 opinion of the tribunal dismissing the motion.</P>

<P><A HREF="anonymity.html">Response to Anonymity Request</A><BR>
This is the defense's June 2, 1995 response to the prosecutor's motion requesting anonymity for certain witnesses and victims in the Dusko Tadic case. The prosecution wants the war crimes tribunal to withhold identities from the public including the defense. Since many of the witnesses have friends and family in areas controlled by Bosnian Serbs, the prosecution says that witnesses may be intimidated from testifying. The defense supports withholding identities from the public so long as it is privy to such information.</P>

<P><A HREF="protection.html">Witness and Victim Protection</A><BR>
In this May 18, 1995 motion, the prosecution requests protective measures to ensure the anonymity of the victims and witnesses in the case against Dusko Tadic.</P>

<P><A HREF="ruling.html">Ruling on Request to Bosnia</A><BR>
In this May 16 ruling,  The International War Crimes Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia grants a prosecution request to ask the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to defer the trial of three highly-placed Bosnian Serb officials to the tribunal.</P>

<P><A HREF="request.html">Request to Bosnia</A><BR>
In this April 21, 1995 application for deferral, the prosecutor asks the International war crimes tribunal to make a formal request to the Bosnian government to defer to the tribunal the criminal investigation of Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic, and Mico Stanisic. The prosecutor is investigating the individual responsibility of the three Bosnian leaders for alleged acts of genocide, violations of the customs of war, and crimes against humanity perpetrated during the conflict in the former Yugoslavia.</P>

<P><A HREF="await.html">Rules of Detention</A><BR>
In this March 16, 1995 document, the war crimes tribunal sets forth the rules for persons awaiting trial.</P>

<P><A HREF="assign.html">Assignment of Defense Counsel</A><BR>
In this January 30, 1995 directive, instructions are set forth regarding the assignment of defense counsel for defendants facing the tribunal for war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia.</P>

<P><A HREF="martic.html">Indictment of Milan Martic</A><BR>
In this July 24, 1995 indictment, Milan Martic, president of the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina, is charged with violations of the laws and customs of war in an attack on the Croatian city of Zagreb, which resulted in several civilian deaths.</P>

<P><A HREF="mladic.html">Indictment of Karadzic & Mladic</A><BR>
In this July 24, 1995 indictment, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and army commander General Ratko Mladic are charged with genocide, crimes against humanity, and violations of the customs of war.</P>

<P><A HREF="tadic.html">Prosecutor's Declaration Regarding Dusko Tadic</A><BR>
Serbian leader Dusko Tadic faces charges of crimes against humanity and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, all allegedly committed while he operated death camps in Bosnia.</P>

<P><A HREF="jelisic.html">Indictment of Goran Jelisic: The Serb Adolph?</A><BR>
Goran Jelisic, acting commander of Luka prison camp in the former Yugoslavia, allegedly introduced himself as "the Serb Adolph" before torturing and killing inmates, including children and the elderly.  In this June 30, 1995 indictment, Jelisic is charged with genocide, murder, and violations of the customs of war.</P>

<P><A HREF="miljkovic.html">Indictment of Slobadan Miljkovic</A><BR>
In this June 29, 1995 indictment, Slobodan Miljkovic, the Deputy Commander of a Serbian paramilitary unit, is charged with assault and murder. He is charged along with five other officers acting in his command. The charges relate to acts allegedly committed as part of a "campaign of terror" intended to force Bosnian Croats and Muslims to leave the area.</P>

<P><A HREF="sikirica.html">Indictment of Dusko Sikirica</A><BR>
From May 24, 1992 to August 30, 1992,  three thousand Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats were held under armed guard in what was previously a ceramics factory and storage area complex in the former Yugoslavia.

<H2>A Look Back At Nuremberg</H2> 

<P><A HREF="indictments.html">About the Indictments</A><BR>
In early October 1945, the four prosecuting nations -- the United States, Great Britain, France and Russia -- issued an indictment against 24 men and six organizations. The individual defendants were charged not only with the systematic murder of millions of people, but also with planning and carrying out the war in Europe.</P>

<P><A HREF="defendants.html">About the Defendants</A><BR>
On November 20, 1945, 21 Nazi defendants filed into the dock at the Palace of Justice in Nuremberg to stand trial for war crimes. The 22nd defendant, Martin Bormann, was believed to be dead.</P>

<P><A HREF="plead.html">The Indictments and the Entering of Pleas</A><BR>
Hermann Goering, Albert Speer and other top Nazi leaders listened from the Nuremberg courtroom prisoners' dock on Nov. 21, 1945 as their indictments were read. About eight months earlier, most of them were still under Adolph Hitler's command.</P>

<P>Prosecutors said the defendants carried out Nazi master race policies under the belief that Germans were accordingly entitled to subjugate, dominate, or exterminate other races and peoples.</P>

<P>After listening to prosecutors read a long list of atrocities in slave labor factories and concentration camps, each defendant pled not guilty to charges of crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. <I>Download a <A HREF="plead.zip">compressed version</A>.</I></P>

<P><A HREF="jackson.html">Robert Jackson's Opening Speech</A><BR>
In this opening speech, the chief U.S. prosecutor promised that a paper trail of official documents would prove the Nazis wreaked wanton violence at unprecedented levels, systematically murdering and enslaving millions of people. Although the accused tried to hide their atrocities at the end of the war, they "shared a Teutonic passion for thoroughness in putting things on paper." <I>Download a <A HREF="jackson.zip">compressed version</A>.</I></P>

<P>Jackson, a justice on leave from the U.S. Supreme Court, argued for the legitimacy and need for this trial, saying, "the wrongs which we seek to condemn and punish have been so calculated, so malignant, and so devastating, that civilization cannot tolerate their being ignored, because it cannot survive their being repeated."</P>

<P><A HREF="shawcross.html">Sir Hartley Shawcross's Opening Speech</A><BR>
In this opening speech, the chief British prosecutor described the Nazis' gross disregard of international treaties and their intention of worldwide conquest. He quoted Adolf Hitler saying, "I shall give a propagandist cause for starting the war, never mind whether it be true or not. The victor shall not be asked later on whether he told the truth or not."</P>

<P>The task for Nuremberg prosecutors would be two-part, Shawcross said. "The first is to demonstrate the nature and the basis of the crime against peace, which is constituted under the Charter of this Tribunal, by waging wars of aggression and in violation of treaties; and the second is to establish beyond all possibility of doubt that such wars were waged by these defendants." <I>Download a <A HREF="shawcrs.zip">compressed version</A>.</I></P>

<P><A HREF="ohlendorf.html">SS General Otto Ohlendorf</A><BR>
Testifying for the prosecution, SS General Otto Ohlendorf said that as the head of "Einsatzgruppe D" he led a 500-man division that "liquidated" 90,000 people, primarily Jews, between June 1941 and June 1942. Men, women and children were taken from their homes, stripped, lined up at the edge of a tank ditch and shot by firing squad. Victims would fall into a ditch, which would be plowed over to form a mass grave.</P>

<P>German troops complained about shooting women and children, the 38-year-old Ohlendorf testified. In reaction, Nazi commanders ordered only the men to be shot. The women and children, in groups of 15 to 25, were gassed to death in special vans on the way to the grave sites.</P>

<P>Ohlendorf, considered too minor a figure to be tried at the initial trials, was convicted of war crimes in 1951 and hanged along with three other Einsatzgruppen commanders.</P>

<P><A HREF="goeringa.html">The American Cross-Examination of Hermann Goering</A><BR>
The following is the cross-examination by chief U.S. prosecutor Robert Jackson of Hermann Goering, the man Adolf Hitler named as his successor. Though Hitler had called for Goering's arrest in the final days of the war, Goering was unapologetic, comparing the Germany's treatment of the Jews with the United States' treatment of Native Americans. When asked if it was true that the Nazis abolished democracy when they came to power, Goering said, "We found it no longer necessary." <I>Download a <A HREF="goeringa.zip">compressed version</A>.</I></P>

<P><A HREF="hoess.html">The Auschwitz Commandant</A><BR>
Rudolf Hoess wrote poetry about the beauty of Auschwitz, the concentration camp he commanded. At peak efficiency the camp had the capacity to "get rid of ten thousand people in 24 hours," he testified in this cross-examination. By the end of the war, the camp accounted for more than two million deaths, according to German estimates. Hoess was taken to Nuremberg too late to be included in the prosecution's case. He was called to testify in the defense of SS officer Ernst Kaltenbrunner. In 1947, Hoess was hanged at Auschwitz by Polish authorities. <I>Download a <A HREF="hoess.zip">compressed version</A>.</I></P>

<P><A HREF="katyn.html">The Katyn Forest Massacre</A><BR>
Sometime after 1939, when Germany and the Soviet Union attacked and divided Poland, 11,000 Polish soldiers disappeared. Soviet prosecutors claimed the Nazis were responsible. The Nazis said they found the soldiers' unmarked graves in Poland's Katyn forest after they invaded the Soviet Union in 1941.</P>

<P>In this testimony, German and Soviet experts contradict each other as to when the deaths occurred. More than four decades later, following Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's "Glasnost" policy, the Soviet Union released documents indicating that it was responsible for the Katyn massacre. <I>Download a <A HREF="katyn.zip">compressed version</A>.</I></P>

Adolf Hitler considered Albert Speer a fellow artist and friend.

<H2>Alaska v. LaParle (3/96)</H2>

<P>Gerard LaParle and Dennis Bump were no strangers to the courtroom.</P>

<P>LaParle was a prominent divorce attorney and Bump was a trial lawyer specializing in defense insurance cases and a partner in one of the Alaska's largest firms.</P>

<P>But the two found themselves in different roles when prosecutors charged LaParle with perjury, fraud and theft for hiding more than $77,000 from Bump's estranged wife during divorce negotiations in 1992. Bump also was charged but eventually pleaded no contest to one charge of fraud and agreed to testify against LaParle.</P>

<P>Bump testified that he first contacted LaParle in the late 1980s when his marriage was in trouble.  At the time, LaParle told Bump that he could take a large retainer, put it into a trust account that would never have to be disclosed to his wife, and return the unused portion.
 
But Bump and his wife would reconcile for a year. During that time, Bump opened four bank accounts in his name and began building assets because he was not sure about the future.</P>

<P>Bump's wife filed for divorce in 1992, and he hired LaParle. LaParle advised him to close an account with $77,856 and give him the money to deposit in a trust account. LaParle also told Bump to tell his wife about the other three accounts, which contained more than $100,000. </P>

<P>As the divorce settlement progressed, Bump signed sworn statements declaring that he had disclosed all assets, including bank accounts, to his wife. He testified that LaParle helped prepare and reviewed the documents before they were filed with the court.</P>

<P>Once the divorce was finalized, LaParle returned nearly $68,000 to Bump.</P>

<P>The defense contended that LaParle wanted  a large retainer because it appeared the Bumps faced a lengthy and bitter divorce fight. The defense also accused Bump of implicating LaParle in order to protect himself.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
LaParle was found guilty of first-degree theft, perjury and scheme to defraud. He was acquitted of one perjury count.</P>

ISMAP BORDER=0></A>
<BR>

<H2>Arizona v. Ring</H2>

<P>Timothy Ring, a former Arizona corrections officer and a self-described
bounty hunter, was one of three men accused of killing an armored van driver
and stealing more than $800,000. </P>

<P>The state claimed that on Nov. 28, 1994, Ring, along with two other former
law enforcement officials -- James Greenham and William Ferguson II -- shot and
killed 61-year-old John Magoch, the driver of a Wells Fargo armored van, as
Mogoch stopped to pick up a deposit at a Glendale, Arizona mall.</P>

<P>The three men allegedly stole $562,877 in cash and $270,921 in checks,
bringing Wells Fargo's total estimated loss to $833,798. Ring was the first of
the three men to be tried.</P>

<P>Witnesses reported seeing the white armored carrier van being driven by two
men and followed by a third in a small, red pick-up truck. Five hours later,
Magoch's body was found inside the van in a church parking lot with one hole in
his head. No bullet was found.</P>

<P><B>The Prosecution's Case:</B> About a month after the crime, Judy Espinoza,
Greenham's former girlfriend, identified Greenham as a potential suspect. She
thought another man she knew only as "Tim" was involved in the crime. She
believed Tim was a bond recovery agent who also worked for an FBI agent. </P>

<P>Shortly after, the FBI and Glendale police tapped the suspects' phones. In
conversations, the three men allegedly discussed the crime, sometimes spoke in
code, the state maintained.</P>

<P>In a search of Ring's home, police found $270,000 in cash, the barrel of a
.22 caliber rifle, a silencer, and a piece of paper containing what the state
says is a division of money under the initials F, Y and T. The state said that
"F" is for Ferguson; "T" is for (Timothy) Ring; and "Y" is for Greenham, who is
allegedly nicknamed "Yoda." The series of numbers under the three initials
totals $575,955, about $13,000 more than the amount of cash Wells Fargo
estimates was stolen</P>

<P>The state argued the silencer was used to shoot Magoch at midday in the
shopping center, which would explain why no witnesses heard a gunshot. The
state said that the .22 caliber weapon barrel is relevant because the victim
was shot with a small caliber weapon. But because the fatal bullet was not
recovered, it was not possible to prove that the gun was the murder weapon.</P>

<P>Investigators identified two other men -- Michael Sanders and Brian Robbins
-- as potential co-conspirators. Both reportedly cooperated with the police and
admitted to plotting with Ring and Greenham. But their testimony was not heard
because immunity deals could not be worked out.</P>

<P><B>Spending Sprees:</B> According to the state, the three men spent money
freely in the months between the robbery and the arrests. Prosecutor Alfred
Fenzel detailed the suspects' spending habits. Fenzel said Ring paid $7,495 in
cash on Christmas Eve 1994 for two all-terrain vehicles and six days later paid
$1,100 cash for a trailer. Fenzel said Ring also bought a motorcycle for $7,300
cash and placed $1,000 down on a new car for his wife.</P>

<P><B>The Defense's Case:</B> Ring denied all charges. His lawyer, Greg Clark,
theorized that Greenham, Robbins and Sanders may have committed the crime.
Greenham moved into Ring's house temporarily after the incident, Clark claimed.
Some of Greenham's belongings were stored in Ring's garage and were found
during the police search. Clark said some of the state's evidence against Ring
actually belonged to Greenham.</P>

<P>Ring had a weapon barrel, a silencer and a large amount of cash in his home
because he was a bounty hunter who occasionally works for the FBI, Clark
said.</P>

<P><B>The Charges:</B> Ring was charged with first-degree murder, armed
robbery, first-degree burglary, theft and conspiracy to commit murder -- or in
the alternative, conspiracy to commit armed robbery or conspiracy to commit
burglary.</P>

<P>Under Arizona law, Ring can only be convicted of one count of conspiracy.
For example, he could be found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder and
murder, but not conspiracy to commit murder and conspiracy to commit burglary.
Because of this, the state has charged him with alternative theories of
conspiracy to try to cover all their bases.</P>

<P><B>Legal Terms:</B>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><B>First-degree murder:</B> Premeditated killing. In Arizona, a
conviction on this charge carries a minimum sentenced of life imprisonment with
no possibility of release for 25 years. It could also mean the death penalty.

	<LI><B>First-degree burglary:</B> entering or remaining unlawfully in a
nonresidential structure with the intent to commit any felony while in the
knowing possession of a deadly weapon (Arizona Law).

	<LI><B>Accomplice:</B> a person with the intent to promote or facilitate
the commission of an offense (Arizona Law).
</UL>


<P><B>The Judge:</B> Greg Martin has served as a superior court judge since
1989. He was previously a criminal defense lawyer in private practice for 13
years.</P>

<P><B>The Prosecution:</B> Alfred Fenzel joined the county district attorney's
office in 1988, after several years in private practice. From 1974 to 1985, he
was an assistant district attorney in Westchester County, New York He has
prosecuted two defendants who are currently on Arizona's death row.</P>

<P><B>The Defense:</B> Greg Clark was appointed to the case after Ring was
declared indigent. Clark, a sole practitioner, has 14 years of experience in
criminal defense, defending in 21 capital cases.</P>

<P><B>The Verdict:</B> On Dec. 6, 1996, the jury found Ring guilty of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit armed robbery, burglary in the first-degree and theft. He will be sentenced Feb. 21, 1996 and faces either death by lethal injection or life in prison with the possibility of parole after 25 years. </P>

<H2>Arizona v. Salman (5/94)</H2>

<P>Frank Salman, 18, was charged with second-degree murder and three counts of aggravated assault and his cousin, John Salman, 20, was charged with four counts of aggravated assault for the shooting death of Larry Sanchez, one of several gang members who robbed the Salmans' family convenience store.</P>

<P>Frank and John Salman, who were working at the store on the night of the robbery, pursued and shot the fleeing thieves, killing Sanchez. The prosecution argued the cousins used "excessive force" in response to the crime. The defense contended the cousins acted in self-defense.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</B><br>
The judge deadlocked and the judge declared a mistrial.</P>

Ronald and Bonette Askew were experiencing problems after 15 years of marriage so they went to a marriage counselor. Bonette Askew revealed during a session that she never really loved her husband. He sued his estranged wife for fraud, claiming if she hadn't lied about loving him, he would not have married her and wouldn't be dividing their property as part of the divorce. Bonette Askew's attorney said Ronald was trying to get around California's no-fault divorce laws.<p>

<b>Verdict</b><br>
The jury found for Ronald Askew and awarded him $242,000 in damages.<P>

<H2>Boydston v. Link Management (3/96)</H2>

<P>Several days after Thanksgiving 1992, members of the Boydston family got together for a reunion. That night they went to a concert at Billy Bob's Texas in Ft. Worth, which bills itself as the largest honky tonk in the world.</P>

<P>The seven family members claimed they were accosted by bouncers as they were leaving the Sawyer Brown concert. Who started the altercation was unclear, but angry words were exchanged, punches were thrown and a nasty fight followed.</P>

<P>The Boydstons sued for assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence, claiming that Link Management was negligent in the hiring, training and supervision of the bouncers.</P>

<P>Here's the plaintiffs' version of what happened.</P>

<P>They were leaving the November 27, 1992, concert when bouncer William Loffland grabbed Tammy Boydston by the arm and accused her of throwing a drink at an usher. Tammy said she didn't throw a drink but Loffland wouldn't let go of her arm. Tammy's sister Gaylene then threw her hands up in Loffland's face and said, "we didn't do anything." Loffland pushed her away but she came back at him. Gaylene said Loffland then pushed her to the ground.</P>

<P>When Gayle's husband Stewart said, "let's get my wife," several Boydston men tried to intervene but the bouncers allegedly jumped Danny Boydston and began beating him up.  His brother Travis tried to help but also was beaten up. The fight finally ended when the bouncers hauled Travis to an alleyway outside the club and left him on the ground. Several days later, Travis had emergency surgery for a blood clot on his brain which he claimed was related to the fight.</P>

<P>The defense claimed the Boydstons started the fight by attacking the bouncers. It also said the Boydstons had been drinking and may have been drunk at the time of the altercation.</P>

<P>The defense version of events was that Gaylene had been arguing with the usher during the concert because she wanted to sit in the reserved section even though she only had a standing room only ticket.  The usher claimed she called security to deal with the situation and to make sure the Boydstons did not get out of control.</P>

<P>At this time, someone threw a drink on the usher. The defense claimed that Gaylene rushed Loffland, and that Danny threw the first punch. </P>

<P>The defense claimed Billy Bob's has extensive training for bouncers, who start out by checking IDs at the door. They then work the floor for several months with a more experienced person before being allowed to work alone.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
After several days of testimony, an out-of-court settlement was reached on March 27, 1996. The settlement was not disclosed.<!--- full_end---></P>

<H2>Cabey v. Goetz (4/96)</H2>

<P>Was Bernhard Goetz a racist or a helpless victim when he shot four teenagers on a New York City subway in December 1984? </P>

<P>That was the central issue in the civil lawsuit filed against Goetz by Darrell Cabey,  one of the victims in the attack. </P>

<P>Over the years, the Goetz case was seized by advocates on opposing sides of urban issues like crime, race, gun control, and vigilante justice. Much of the national attention surrounded his 1987 criminal trial. Goetz, who did not testify during the trial, was acquitted of attempted murder charges.  He was convicted on a weapons charge and served 8-1/2 months in jail.</P>

<P>The December 22, 1984, shooting left Cabey paralyzed and brain damaged. He sued for $25 million in compensatory damages and a similar amount in punitive damages.</P>

<P>Cabey's case was simple: Goetz was a racist who overreacted when he needlessly shot the four black youths. After wounding Cabey, Goetz walked up to the bleeding youth and delivered the paralyzing gunshot, announcing,  "You don't look too bad, here's another."</P>

<P>Goetz's defense was just as simple: He fired in self-defense when approached by four muggers who tried to shake him down for $5. </P>

<P>During the trial, Cabey's lawyer Ron Kuby bolstered his case by using Goetz's own words against him. </P>

<P>Goetz did not show much remorse when he testified for the first time about the shooting.</P>

<P>He  acknowledged he had thought about using his keys to gouge out the eyes of one of the wounded youths. And he was asked about his remark that Cabey's mother should have had an abortion, and that the shooting "could be looked on" as a public service. </P>

<P>"I was trying to get as many of them as I could," he also said.</P>

<P>After Goetz was called to the witness stand by Cabey's lawyers, he was expected to testify again when the defense presented its case. But he didn't. The defense presented only two witnesses.</P>

<P>Newspaper columnist Jimmy Breslin testified about an interview he had with Cabey almost a year after the shooting. Breslin said Cabey told him that three other young men on the train intended to rob Goetz because ''he looked like easy bait.''</P>

<P>The other witness was Dr. Bernard Yudowitz, a forensic psychiatrist, who testified about how intensely people can react if they believe their lives are in danger. </P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
On April 24, 1996, the jury found that Goetz acted recklessly and deliberately inflicted emotional distress on Cabey. The jury awarded Cabey $43 million in damages -- $18 million for past and future pain and suffering, and $25 million in punitive damages.  But Cabey is not likely to see anywhere near that amount since Goetz has little money. In such cases it is common for the court to garnish 10 percent of the defendant's wages for 20 years.</P>

<p><h2>California v. Bardo (10/91)</h2>
There was no doubt that Robert John Bardo fatally shot actress Rebecca Schaeffer on July 18, 1989. But was it a premeditated act of an obsessed fan, or the result of Bardo's irrational  perceptions about the actress?<p>

During the trial, prosecutors contended that Bardo tracked Schaeffer with help from a private investigator after a number of visits to Los Angeles, where he unsuccessfully tried to meet her. Bardo is from Arizona.<p>

On the day of the shooting, Bardo went to Schaeffer's apartment once and spoke briefly with her before returning about an hour later and killing her, the state argued. The prosecution claimed Bardo grew to hate Schaeffer when she neglected to answer all but the first of almost 40 letters he sent the co- star of the television series, ''My Sister Sam.''<p>

The defense argued that Bardo planned to kill Schaeffer only before their meeting. When he returned later to speak again to Schaeffer, Bardo believed her behavior was arrogant and like a little brat, and those irrational perceptions triggered an intent to kill, the defense argued.<p>

<b>Verdict</b><br>
A judge found Bardo guilty of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole.<p>

<H2>California v. Cummings (7/94)</H2>

<P>Debra Sue Cummings, a 36-year-old mother of two and respected member of the community, was charged in the death of a baby boy she was caring for in an unlicensed baby-sitting service. Cummings was being retried for the June 1990 death of 9-month-old Kevin Majoy-Young. He died from a severe blow to the head. Cummings testified that the boy was fatally injured when he accidentally struck his head against a living room table. She was charged with second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter and child absue. The first trial ended in a mistrial after the jury deadlocked 7-5 in favor of acquittal.</P>

<P><B>Verdict</B><BR>
Cummings was acquitted of all charges on July 28, 1994.</P>

<H2>California v. Marks (12/95)</H2>

<P>For several decades, Laura Marks and other women of the Gypsy family offered their psychic services to the people of San Diego. </P>

<P>But San Diego authorities filed criminal charges against six members of the Marks family, charging them with bilking customers of hundreds of thousands of dollars with phony promises about curing headaches and mending broken love  lives. The prosecution alleged that the Marks women illegally took money from their customers with promises they knew they could not fulfill.</P>

<P>One customer claimed he paid the women $675,000 over 11 years to reinvigorate his love life.  None of the predictions came true and he eventually complained to authorities.</P>

<P>The defense contended that Laura Marks, the first family member to stand trial, and the others did not commit grand theft. The attorneys raised concerns about  freedom of religion, the 1st Amendment and the need for society to respect cultural diversity.</P>

<P>The defense argued that the prayers and ceremonies used by the Marks women deserved the same protection as more widespread religions. They noted that the alleged victims voluntarily sought out the Marks' services which included chanting, candle lightings and exorcisms in addition to the more traditional psychic services of palm and card readings.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b> <br>
The trial ended in a hung jury on December 15, 1995.</P>

<H2>California v. Palm (6/96)</H2>

<P>A retired Navy commander was charged with murder in the shooting of a neighborhood bully.</P>

<P>Prosecutors claimed Daniel Palm was obsessed with ridding the Dictionary Hill community of John Harper that he took the law into his own hands. He was so obsessed that he kept diaries detailing Harper's activities in addition to taking surveillance photographs of Harper outside his house and around the neighborhood.</P>

<P>The state claimed Palm fired 13 shots into an unarmed Harper on November 28, 1995. </P>

<P>The defense contended that Palm acted in self-defense. </P>

<P>Palm testified that he remembered everything up until the time he pulled the trigger for the first time but did not remember anything after that.</P>

<P>What happened before the shooting, Palm said, terrified him. He said he saw Harper drive past his home and was afraid that Harper was coming to seek revenge because he had testified against Harper in a deadly assault trial. (The jury in the trial deadlocked and prosecutors decided to strike a deal with Harper. He  pleaded guilty to reckless driving, a misdemeanor with no jail time. Harper was ordered to pay a $500 fine and placed on probation.)</P>

<P>Palm said a neighbor called to warn him that Harper was driving up the hill toward Palm's house. Palm said he was afraid Harper would burn his house down by throwing a Molotov cocktail. He said he immediately grabbed his .45 semiautomatic, put on some pants and went outside. He said he saw Harper slowly drive down the hill towards another home. Palm feared Harper would harm someone else in the neighborhood. </P>

<P>Palm said he was in a state of panic. He got in his car and drove towards Harper. Then, Harper said he waved at Harper, signaling him to come down the road. Palm said he was terrified but drove up to Harper and decided to try to scare him by brandishing his weapon. He said he flashed his gun at Harper and then Harper said, "you and your family are good as dead."After that, Palm said, he did not remember anything.</P>

<P>He said several things contributed to his growing fear of Harper:  that he had testified against him at the assault trial and he feared Harper wanted to retaliate; that Harper had terrorized Palm and the entire neighborhood; that he believed Harper was a suspect in a suspicious fire that left Harper's wife dead; and that Harper had threatened to burn down other people's houses.</P>

<P>But the prosecution pointed out that Palm pursued Harper and that Harper did not pose a deadly threat to Palm at the time of the shooting. </P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
On June 5, 1996, Palm was found guilty of second-degree murder.</P>

<H2>California v. Simpson (10/95)</H2>

<P>O.J. Simpson, a former football player and celebrity, was accused of stabbing to death his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Goldman. Prosecutors said that after years of abusing his wife, Simpson surprised her at her home on June 12, 1994, overpowered her and slit her throat. Goldman, a waiter, had stopped by to return the eye glasses that her mother had left at a restaurant that evening. He unwittingly interrupted Simpson and was killed, prosecutors said.</P>

<P>No one witnessed the murders, but prosecutors said that blood evidence found at the crime scene, in Simpson's car, and his home, proved that he was the killer. Simpson claimed he was at home when the incident occurred, preparing for a business trip to Chicago. His lawyers said that racist police planted evidence. At the trial, they succeeded in producing witnesses and a taped interview that showed police detective Mark Fuhrman had a deep disdain for African-Americans and that he had lied about it on the witness stand. On the night of the murder, Fuhrman scaled the wall at Simpson's estate and found the bloody glove that was the centerpiece of the prosecution's case. Prosecutors claimed that hair, fiber, footprints and other circumstantial evidence all pointed to Simpson's guilt. But the defense maintained that police contaminated key evidence and rendered it unreliable.</P>

<P><b>Verdict:</b><br>
After nine months of testimony, the jury deliberated for about three hours and acquitted Simpson on October 2, 1995.</P>

<H2>California v. Tudor and Hookano (8/95)</H2>

<P>The trial of Joseph Tudor and Lance Hookano was more than a routine assault case. It offered a glimpse into the world of competitive surfing and the rivalries between local surfers and competitors and between Malibu surf locals and outsiders. </P>

<P>The incident took place on September 27, 1994, during the Oxbow Longboard World Championship in Malibu. The professional contest actually began a week earlier but was postponed for several days because of poor waves.</P>

<P>Also on the beach that day were numerous non-competitors. The local recreational surfers were aware of the competition. As the competition was preparing to begin, event organizers began making announcements to clear the waters.</P>

<P>Richard Ernsdorf said he had finished a morning of surfing and was drifting south intending to get out of the water. But some people on shore thought he was taking his time and intentionally blocking the start of the competition. Joel Tudor was among the first competitors and soon his father, Joseph, was paddling out in an apparent effort to remove Ernsdorf.</P>

<P>What happened next was in dispute.</P>

<P>Ernsdorf, 44, claimed he was attacked, first by the elder Tudor, 44, and then by Hookano, a 34-year-old world class professional. A videotape showed both men paddling out to Ernsdorf and delivering a series of punches. </P>

<P>But the defense presented witnesses in an attempt to prove self-defense. They suggested that Ernsdorf lashed out first, with one of his swim fins he had taken off his foot, or his hands, after he was asked to leave the water. </P>

<P>Ernsdorf suffered a dislocated shoulder and facial cuts that took 15 stitches to close.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
On August 16, 1995, after two days of deliberations, the jury found the defendants guilty of battery and assault with great bodily harm. Tudor and Hookano each were sentenced to three years probation and ordered to perform 300 hours of community service.</P>

<p><H2>Carter v. Williamson(8/96)</H2>

Do cigarette smokers choose to light up despite the risks, or are they addicted and powerless to stop?<p>

Grady Carter, a 65-year-old former air traffic controller, smoked for about 44 years. He started as a teenager and did not stop until he was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1991. <p>

<a href=/report/smoking.html> Carter and his wife sued the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co.</a> for $1.5 million damages. They claimed the company was liable because it did not warn consumers about the dangers of smoking.<p>

Carter claimed Brown & Williamson knew of the dangers of tobacco -- its connection to cancer and its addictive quality -- as early as 1939. Carter's lawyers tried to show that American Tobacco, the makers of Lucky Strikes cigarettes, knew in the 1950s that smoking caused lung cancer and did nothing to inform the public. Brown & Williamson owns American Tobacco.<P>

The key to the plaintiff's case was the introduction of some of the so-called <A href=http://www.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco/>Brown & Williamson documents.</a> It was the first time that the documents had been presented to a jury.<p>

Plaintiffs in tobacco litigation across the country claim these internal documents prove that Brown & Williamson executives knew more than 30 years ago that nicotine is addictive and conspired to hide the information from the government and the public.<p>

In a key document from July 17, 1963, the chief legal counsel for Brown & Williamson wrote: "Nicotine is addictive" and "we are, then, in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug effective in the release of stress mechanisms."<p>

Carter also claimed Lucky Strikes were defectively manufactured in that they caused cancer and that the tobacco company knew how to make a safer cigarette and chose not to. <p>

Brown & Williamson's position was that people have a personal responsibility to choose whether to smoke or not, and that the company could not be blamed for Carter's health problems. The company presented evidence suggesting Carter knew smoking was harmful but, at the same time, it insisted that the link between smoking and cancer had not been proved.<p>

The company also claimed it adequately warned consumers about the hazards of smoking on its cigarettes packages. <p>

Labels warning of the dangers of smoking went on cigaratte packages in 1966, and those warnings were strenghened in 1970. As a result, federal law protects cigarette manufacturers from being held liable for any alleged failure after 1970 to warn smokers of tobacco's hazards.<p>

The defense also insisted there is no alternative design available for making cigarettes. Under a traditional product defective design theory, the plaintiff had to prove that there is a defect in a product's design, that the defect could have been eliminated by an different design, and that the defect caused the plaintiff's injuries.<p>

<b>Verdict</b><br>
On August 9, 1996, a Jacksonville, Florida, jury found Brown & Williamson liable and awarded $750,000 to the Carters.<p>

The verdict was only the second time that a cigarette manufacturer had been ordered to pay damages in a liability case. In 1988, the family of a New Jersey woman, Rose Cipollone, was awarded $400,000. But the award was overtuned on appeal.<p>

<H2>Castillo v. DuPont & Pine Island Farms (6/96)</H2>

<P>Donna Castillo's life changed forever in November 1989, when a tractor in a South Florida field drenched the pregnant woman and her infant daughter with an agricultural chemical.</P>

<P>The chemical was Benlate 50 DF, a controversial fungicide, manufactured by Dupont.</P>

<P>Castillo and her husband claimed Benlate was responsible for her son John being born in June 1990 with a severe birth defect known as microphthalmia. Microphthalmia means small eyes but John was born with no discernible eyes -- he had sockets with small cysts where his eyes should have been.</P>

<P>Although DuPont has been involved in litigation over Benlate for several years, previous cases involved claims that the fungicide caused damage to crops and soil. This was the first personal injury case to go to trial, and the first to allege a birth defect due to prenatal exposure to Benlate.</P>

<P>While the Castillos saw this as a case of strict liability and negligence, DuPont and Pine Island Farms, whose tractor sprayed Castillo, saw the case as a battle over what they considered to be junk science. The defendants claimed there was no evidence that Castillo was exposed to Benlate, and, more importantly, no credible evidence that Benlate exposure results in birth defects.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
On June 7, 1996, the jury returned a verdict of $4 million against the defendants. DuPont was found 99.5 percent responsible and Pine Island Farms 0.5 percent responsible. This meant DuPont must pay $3,980,000 while the farm must pay $20,000. The jury found both defendants negligent and that DuPont put a defective product on the market. The jury awarded damages only to John Castillo. He received $2 million in future damages for medical expenses and lost earning ability and $2 million for pain and suffering. The jury did not award damages to his parents.</P>

<H2>Corkery v. Cosby (8/94)</H2>

<P>Richard Corkery, a photographer with the New York Daily News, sued Bill Cosby for $3 million in damages, claiming the television star assaulted him during a 1992 charity event at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He claimed Cosby dragged him out of the museum auditorium and threw him into the lobby. Cosby admitted getting into an altercation with Corkery but denied assaulting him. When his wife stood to receive an award from the Coalition of 100 Black Women, Cosby said Corkery snapped his picture without his permission. Cosby said he and a security guard then led Corkery into the museum lobby.</P>

<P><B>Verdict</B><BR>
On August 5, 1994, a federal court jury ruled Cosby must pay $2 to Corkery. The jury found Cosby liable for the assault but said Corkery was 90 percent responsible for provoking Cosby. On September 7, a judge reduced the award to 20 cents.</P>

<P><H2>DiPaolo v. New York Blood Center and Golinko (12/95)</H2>
In 1984, four-year-old Joey DiPaolo underwent heart surgery and contracted
the AIDS virus as a result of a blood transfusion. At that time, a test to
screen blood for the AIDS virus was several months away from FDA approval. </P></P>

<P>The DiPaolo family sued the New York Blood Center and Dr. Richard Golinko,
their cardiologist. They claimed that the blood center knew the disease posed
a threat to the blood supply but did not properly screen donors or take other
precautions to reduce the risk of providing tainted blood. They also claimed
that Dr. Golinko did not inform them of the benefit of delaying the surgery
until the blood screening test was available.</P></P>

<P>The doctor and the blood center maintained that they were following the
accepted medical standards at the time. </P></P>

<P>The DiPaolos also sued the Downstate Medical Center, where the surgery was
performed, and two other doctors. The medical center and the doctors settled
out of court in 1993, agreeing to pay the DiPaolo family $1.6 million.</P></P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
On December 19, 1995, a jury found the New York Blood Center 100% liable for
providing the tainted blood, absolving the three doctors and the medical
center. The DiPaolo family was awarded $1.5 million for pain and suffering to
date; future pain and suffering; loss of earning capacity; and future medical
expenses.</P></P>

<P>After the verdict, lawyers for the defendants argued that under New York
state law, the DiPaolos would not get any of the money awarded to them. They
said that the $1.5 million was offset by the money paid to the family in the
out of court settlement.</P></P>

<P>The DiPaolos' lawyer claimed that the award would come on top of the previous
settlement. Judge Alice Schlesinger said she would hear motions on the
matter.</P></P>

<p><H2>Florida v. Bowles  (7/96)</H2>

A jury in Jacksonville, Florida, had to decide whether Gary Bowles should be sentenced to life in prison without parole or death for the murder of his roommate.<p>

Bowles admitted killing Walter Jammel Hinton in November 1994 by slamming a 40-pound stepping stone onto his head as he slept. The blow didn't kill Hinton, who woke up and struggled for his life. Bowles eventually strangled Hinton, then stuffed toilet paper and a rag into a throat to make sure he was dead.<p>

The state claimed that once Hinton, 42, was dead, Bowles stole his fake Rolex watch, his stereo equipment and his Cadillac. Bowles even had the audacity to bring a woman to sleep at the trailer the next two nights, telling her to be extra quiet because his roommate was asleep in the other room.<p>

The state said Bowles killed Hinton for several reasons: Hinton was gay and Bowles didn't like homosexuals; Bowles was in danger of being kicked out of Hinton's home and he didn't want to go back to living on the streets; and because he needed money and a car.<p>

Although Bowles was a hustler who made money by agreeing to have sex with gay men in return for cash and a place to live, he actually hated homosexuals and blamed them for his problems with women and for an abortion that terminated a former girlfriend's pregnancy in 1985. Prosecutors said two women in the past broke up with Bowles because of his repeated hustling of gay men, so Bowles thought gays were responsible for all of his problems with women.<p>

The defense  contended Bowles was on drugs and drunk at the time of the murder. In his confession, the defendant said, "something just snapped."<p>

Defense attorneys said Bowles started drinking and sniffing glue when he was 10 years old. He ran away from home several years later and his family had not seen much of him in the past 20 years. The defense presented evidence that Bowles had an exceptionally difficult childhood that was full of beatings at the hands of two different stepfathers. <p>

The defense won a major pretrial ruling when the judge ruled the state could not present allegations that Bowles was suspected of the murders of six gay men in Florida, Georgia and Maryland.<p>

<b>Verdict</b><br>
The jury recommended that Bowles be sentenced to death.<p>

<H2>Florida v. Gayle (1/96)</H2>

<P>Audrey Gayle was fatally shot as she and her husband were driving home from a prayer meeting on April 13, 1995.</P>

<P>Matthew Gayle told police that an unidentified robber with a gun forced him to stop the car and hand over his wallet. The robber, he said, then shot his wife. </P>

<P>Police, however, were skeptical of Gayle's story. And, a few days later, began receiving information that Gayle had been looking for several months for someone to help him kill his wife. Gayle was eventually arrested and charged with first-degree murder. </P>

<P>During the trial, the prosecution contended that Gayle wanted his wife dead so he could pursue an old love interest and collect on a $150,000 life insurance policy. The state said Gayle did not want to divorce his wife because child support for the couple's two young children would cost too much money. Gayle already was paying $300 a month to his former wife for child support. </P>

<P>One of the state's main witnesses was Eugene Johnson, a former roommate of Gayle's brother. Johnson testified that Gayle asked him numerous times to kill his wife. Johnson also said Gayle told him that he was getting a life insurance policy for $100,000 and would give $10,000 to Johnson. </P>

<P>The defense countered that Gayle was only friends with his old girlfriend, and that Johnson owed Gayle money and wanted him dead. </P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
On January 12, 1996, a jury convicted Gayle of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. He was sentenced to life in prison.</P>

<H2>Florida v. Griffin</H2>

<P>Michael F. Griffin, a 32-year-old chemical plant worker, was charged with murder for the shooting death of Dr. David Gunn during an anti-abortion protest outside an abortion clinic in Pensacola, Florida in March of 1993.  The defense argued that Griffin, a fundamentalist Christian, was delusional and acted in the heat of passion, and therefore could not be convicted of premeditated murder.</P>

<P><B>Verdict:</B><BR>
Griffin was convicted on March 6, 1994 of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. He must serve 25 years before he's eligible for parole.</P>

<H2>Florida v. Gudinas (5/95)</H2>

<P>Thomas Gudinas was charged with the May 24, 1994 murder of Michele McGrath, a 27-year-old Martin Marietta Corp. clerk and former high school homecoming queen.

<P>Gudinas, a Massachusetts man in trouble with the law since about age 10, allegedly attacked McGrath as she walked to her car after a night on the club scene in downtown Orlando. The evidence included Gudinas' palm print on the alley gate, his fingerprints on a bank payment book in McGrath's car and several eyewitnesses who said they saw him near the murder scene in the morning.</P>

<P>The defense argued that the case against the 21-year-old Gudinas was circumstantial and filled with contradictions. Among other things, the defense pointed out that laboratory tests on blood, semen and saliva could not determine the killer's identity.</P>

<P><B>Verdict</B><BR>
Gudinas was found guilty of first-degree murder and two counts of sexual battery on May 4, 1995. The jury recommended that he be sentenced to die in the electric chair.</P>

<H2>Florida v. Lopez (9/95)</H2>

<P>Peter Lopez was charged with first-degree murder in the fatal shooting of Scott Haak outside of a Fort Lauderdale nightspot.</P>

<P>The incident began on January 20, 1994, when Lopez and two friends were caught trying to sneak into a concert at the Mud House, a Fort Lauderdale cafe. As they were thrown out, a crowd gathered, sparking a heated argument. Some of those involved threatened Lopez.</P>

<P>Lopez drove away from the club, only to return with a shotgun. When he found one of the men who had threatened him, Lopez, 19, brandished his weapon and told Haak: "Now beat my ass."</P>

<P>Haak started toward Lopez. The gun went off and Haak was shot. Though mortally wounded, Haak pulled a small caliber handgun from a holster in his pants and managed to fire several shots at Lopez. None of the shots hit Lopez or his companions.  </P>

<P>Lopez told police that he didn't mean to shoot anyone. He said he went back to the concert to scare the people who had told him to leave. He said he recognized Haak and several others and that was why he approached them.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
On September 7, 1995, a Broward County jury rejected the prosecutor's arguments that the killing was premeditated and convicted Lopez of manslaughter. Lopez was sentenced to seven years in prison.</P>

<H2>Florida v. Love (11/95)</H2>

<P>Rock star Courtney Love was accused of assaulting two teenagers during a March concert in Orlando.</P>

<P>Ryan O'Donell, an 18-year-old high school senior, testified that Love jumped from the stage at the Edge in downtown Orlando and punched him five times in the chest after demanding that men move back from the stage to let some women get closer to her band, Hole.</P>

<P>The other alleged victim, Robert Lukas, a 19-year-old college student, said Love punched him three times in the chest. </P>

<P>Love's attorney, Jim Russ, contended the two boys knew the concert could be dangerous and got what they paid for. Russ also said the teens accused Love of punching them so they could sue her.</P>

<P>Lukas testified that he has not contacted a lawyer but was  considering suing. O'Donell has met with lawyers, who Russ said have made a $40,000 claim.</P>

<P>Prosecutors argued that nobody had the right to come down off a concert stage and strike another person.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
On November 6, 1995, an Orange County judge dismissed the charges against Love. In ending the three-day trial, Judge Janis Halker said the teens weren't exposed to any greater amount of violence than could reasonably be expected at an alternative rock concert.</P>

<P>After the trial, Love, the widow of Nirvana band leader Kurt Cobain, said that because of the charges against her she may have to rethink whether she will continue to dive into crowds at concerts.</P>

<H2>Florida v. Puzio (Penalty Phase)</H2>

<P>David Puzio, a tattoo artist, was convicted of first-degree murder in the
deaths of Kelly Rae Cahill and Marleen Chillemi. The two women, who
were thinking of getting tattoos, met Puzio and four friends, crammed
into Chillemi's car and drove to Pompano Beach to purchase marijuana.
On their way, Puzio told Cahill to pull over. Puzio claimed that he did not
remember what happened after they pulled over. One of the passengers,
Elias Nieves, testified that Puzio pulled out a pistol, shot Chillemi and
Cahill and left the women on the ground and sped off. The prosecution
claimed that Puzio killed the women because he wanted to rob them. The
defense claimed it was Nieves who shot the women. </P>

<P>In the penalty phase of the trial, the prosecution argued that Puzio should face the death penalty because the murders were committed during a robbery. Out for financial gain, Puzio killed in cold blood, prosecutor Brian Cavanagh said. The defense focused on Puzio's age. He was only 16 years old, lawyer Steven Hammer said. A psychologist testified that Puzio suffered from emotional problems, related to depression, being abused as a child and his parents' alcoholism and divorce. </P>

<P><B>Verdict</B><BR>
On Dec. 18, 1996, Judge Paul Backman accepted the jury's recommendation that Puzio be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. </P>

<H2>Florida v. Trice (6/95)</H2>

<P>Charles Trice Jr., a former Florida state trooper, was charged with murder in the shooting death of his estranged wife, Darla, on April 24, 1994.</P>

<P>The prosecution presented numerous witnesses to show that Darla Trice feared her husband and who said that she told them many times that he threatened to kill her. Trice had been previously arrested for spousal abuse but was free after posting $30,000 bail. The murder occurred while he was out on bail.</P>

<P>Trice contended that he shot his wife after she attacked him with a knife and defense attorneys argued that he be acquitted on grounds of self-defense. Trice told detectives that he was on his knees hiding inside a closet when he grabbed his gun and shot his wife as she attempted to stab him again.</P>

<P><B>Verdict</B><BR>
On June 27, 1995, a jury found Trice guilty of first-degree murder, burglary with an assault or battery on a person and violation of a domestic violence injunction. He received a  mandatory life sentence, eligible for parole after 25 years.</P>

not survive, Blackwell ordered CPR stopped, and in full view of

minutes later.</P>

<P>Blackwell denied facilitating Chen's death, claiming he used his 
hands to determine whether Chen was breathing.</P>

<P><B>Verdict</B><br> 
On June 16, 1995, a jury acquitted Blackwell.</P>

<H2>Georgia v. Carrizales (11/94)</H2>

<P>Dr. Eva Carrizales was charged with hastening the death of terminally ill Omar Jimenez by holding the 39-day-old baby's mouth shut to smother him and pressing on the carotid artery to cut off blood flow to his brain.</P>

<P>The state argued that Carrizales was frustrated that she couldn't save the baby's life but could control the time of death. Several nurses testified to seeing Carrizales hold the child's mouth closed on October 16, 1993.</P>

<P>Carrizales did not assert a mercy-killing defense, and denied doing anything to speed the child's death. She insisted the nurses misinterpreted her actions as she cradled the infant in the hours before she pronounced his death.  Carrizlaes said she was checking for a pulse when a nurse saw her place her fingers on the baby's neck.  Several defense experts claimed Carrizales' care of  the infant was entirely proper, and that the child was clinically dead when the alleged smothering and pressure on the artery were said to have occurred. </P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
On November 4, 1994, the jury announced it was hopelessly deadlocked --  seven in favor of acquittal and five in favor of conviction.</P>

<H2>Georgia v. Chapel (9/95)</H2>

<P>Michael Chapel, a former Gwinnett County police officer, was charged with the April 15, 1993 murder of Emogene Thompson.</P>

<P>The state charged Chapel killed Thompson after luring her to a muffler shop to rob her of $7,000 in cash. Police never found Thompson's purse and money, nor the .38-caliber gun used to kill her.</P>

<P>Chapel had met Thompson several weeks earlier when she called police to report that $7,000 had been stolen from her trailer park in Sugar Hill. Thompson, a grandmother in her early 50s, had inherited $14,000 from the proceeds of a friend's life insurance policy. She hid the money in her home.</P>

<P>Chapel responded to the burglary call. He met with Thompson and allegedly concurred in her assessment that her son may have been responsible for the theft. Chapel, however, did not log the call or file a report . The state alleged that Chapel intentionally failed to document the robbery because he was planning to steal the remainder of Thompson's money.</P>

<P>On April 15, 1993, Chapel told Thompson that he had recovered some of the money. He asked her to meet him and bring the remaining money so he could compare serial numbers.</P>

<P>During the trial, DNA experts testified that a bloodstain on the seat of Chapel's squad car matched Thompson's blood. A DNA defense expert countered that the tests could not be interpreted.</P>

<P><B>Verdict</B><BR>
On September 8, 1995, a jury convicted Chapel of one count each of murder, felony murder, armed robbery and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. He was sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison plus five years -- the maximum sentence allowed by law short of the death penalty.</P>

<H2>Georgia v. DeYoung (10/95)</H2>

<P>Andrew DeYoung faced the death penalty for the brutal murders of his parents and sister during the early morning hours of June 14, 1993.</P>

<P>The state claimed DeYoung stabbed and slashed his victims in the hallway and master bedroom of his family's home in Marietta. Another intended victim, DeYoung's younger brother, Nathan, escaped. The state claimed DeYoung wanted to wipe out his entire family so that he could become sole heir to the DeYoungs' estate, valued at about $800,000.</P>

<P>During the trial, the state introduced evidence from DeYoung's accomplice, David Haggerty, who was present at the killings. His alleged role was to murder Nathan DeYoung.</P>

<P>Haggerty testified that he heard DeYoung killing his parents and sister and decided he could not go through with the murder of Nathan. He said he did not enter Nathan's room, but told DeYoung the room was locked.</P>

<P>The defense contended that the prosecution's case was built on the partnership between the state and Haggety, who lied about the crime to save himself. (Haggerty was sentenced to three concurrent life terms for his role in the murders.)</P>
<b>Verdict</b><br>
DeYoung was found guilty of three counts of murder. During the penalty phase of the trial, the defense asked the jury to sentence DeYoung to life in prison without the possibility of parole. DeYoung's grandparents testified on his behalf and urged the jury to spare his life. On October 13, 1995, the jury sentenced DeYoung to die for his crimes.<!--- full_end---></P>

<P><h2>Georgia v. Joyner (8/96)</h2>

Georgia businessman <a href=/report/joyner2.html>Lewis Joyner</a> was accused of murder in the deaths of wife and mistress.<p>

Joyner admitted killing his wife of 15 years in November 1995, but claimed it was self-defense. He said Ruby Joyner killed the other woman and then attacked him after learning about his alleged affair with Halima Jones.<p>

Lewis and Ruby Joyner had been married for about 15 years at the time of her death. In the early 1990s, the Joyners moved from New York to the Atlanta area. They purchased and operated the successful Gooch Moving and Storage Service. The Joyners and their business were the subject of a Black Enterprise magazine article in February 1994. <p>

"Our slogan is Pamper Plus -- going the extra mile to satisfy our customers," Joyner told the magazine. <p>

Several months later, however, they sold the business. Later that year, Joyner was in bankruptcy court and faced lawsuits claiming he owed more than $60,000 in credit card and business debts. He also was arrested on drug charges later that year.<p>

There were no assertions that the Joyners had any marital problems --other that the defense's claim that Joyner was having an affair with Jones, a school administrator and teacher.<p>

Jones was separated from the father of her two children. Shortly before her death, she and the children moved out of the apartment of her former boyfriend John Dunbar. Officials said they were told that Jones quit living with Dunbar because of domestic problems. <p>

<b>The Women Disappear</b><br>
The two women were last seen alive on November 15, 1995, after telling friends they were going shopping.<p>

The day after the killings, Joyner called Dunbar to ask him if he had seen his wife. Dunbar then started looking for Jones, and reported her missing that same day. Dunbar told police that he repeatedly urged Joyner to call the police to report his wife missing.<p>

Authorities became suspicious of Joyner when they discovered he had flown to New York City a fews days later without contacting police about his wife's disappearance.<p>

While in New York, Joyner called the Atlanta police several times and promised to return. Published reports credited Joyner's attorney, Steven Sadow, with saying that Joyner left Atlanta because he was afraid that if he went to the police he would have to reveal information implicating himself in drug activity.<p>

After arrest warrants were issued for Joyner in connection with the deaths, several Atlanta area police officers went to New York City to search for him.<p>

Police also searched Joyner's Peachtree City home and a rented storage space at least three times while he was in New York City, and after he returned home. The police seized cocaine, scales, packing supplies, substances used to dilute cocaine, ledgers and computers. The searches resulted in charges against Joyner of two counts of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and one count of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Police have speculated that the proceeds from his drug sales were intended to be used to pay off Joyner's debts. (The trial judge barred the prosecution from introducing the drug evidence during the murder trial.)<p>

<b>Bodies Found at Airport</b><br>
The two bodies were found on November 21, 1995, in Jones' mini-van, which was parked in a long-term lot at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport. A security guard making a routine check of the lot spotted the bodies on the floor in the back of the van. The back seats had been removed.<p>

Jones had been shot once in the head (neither the bullet nor the gun that killed her has been recovered). Ruby Joyner had been beaten about the head -- possibly with a blunt object -- and strangled. Both bodies were covered with a black comforter.<p>

After the bodies were discovered, police went to talk to Joyner's Atlanta friend Jeffrey Lester. Lester said he had received a call from Joyner in New York on November 20, 1996. Joyner allegedly asked Lester to meet him in Newark, New Jersey, which Lester did that night. Joyner told Lester he would return to Atlanta in a couple of days, but he was so upset about his wife's disappearance that he wanted to be near his family.<p>

Lester claimed Joyner told him what happened on the day of the shootings.<p>

Jones and Ruby Joyner -- who had been using cocaine -- called Joyner and asked him to go for a drive with them near the airport. Ruby Joyner found out about here husband's affair with Jones and she shot Jones in the van. Joyner jumped out of the parked van, and thought his wife was going to shoot him. They fought over the gun and he shot her. <p>

Lester said Joyner asked him to go to the crime scene because he had left his hat and beeper and his wife's jacket in the area, along the Camp Creek Parkway. Joyner also allegedly told Lester that he had put the gun someplace where no one would find it.<p>

Joyner was arrested on November 29, 1995, after a roof-top struggle with New York City housing police. He eventually waived extradition to Georgia, and pleaded not guilty to the murder charges.<P>

<b>Verdict</b><br>
On August 28, 1996, an Atlanta jury returned a split verdict. Joyner was convicted of murder, felony murder and aggravated murder in the death of his wife. He was acquitted of charges that he killed Jones. Joyner was sentenced to life in prison.

<P><H2>Georgia v. Smith(7/96)</H2>

Sexual assault in America is reaching epidemic levels.<p>

There are more than 100,000 rapes each year -- one every five minutes, according to the FBI. And that figure is misleadingly low. Many rapes and assaults go unreported because the victims are too traumatized, afraid or humiliated to reveal what happened to them. And those who do come forward often are reluctant to have their faces shown on camera or have their names revealed.<p>

But in Atlanta, four women went public. They met each other in the aftermath of the attacks. Three of the women claimed a man broke into their homes late at night and either tried or succeeded in raping them. A fourth woman said she was dragged into an abandoned home and raped.<p>

Anton Jermaine Smith, 23, was charged with the rapes of Kay Cross, Andrea Goode, and Lynda Denham, and the burglary of Lavon Skyers.

The prosecution contended that Smith's first victim was Cross, who was allegedly raped on May 15, 1995. Smith allegedly raped Goode on June 10, 1995. Just hours later Smith was arrested, accused of climbing into a window at Skyers' home. Skyers says she was able to fight him off because she woke up before her attacker got a weapon.<p>

Smith was mistakenly released from jail on October 19, 1995. During a hearing in September, prosecutors failed to inform the judge of the rape charges Smith faced -- the judge just was told about the burglary case. Smith was released on $10,000 bond. Less than three weeks later, he was arrested for the rape of Denham.<p>

During the trial, the victims identified Smith as their assailant. Prosecutors also introduced DNA evidence linking Smith to some of the crimes.<p>

The defense contended the victims were mistaken about their identifications of Smith and challenged the accuracy of the scientific evidence. But the defense did not try to explain why Smith admitted having contact with three of the four women on the nights they claimed he assaulted them. Smith claimed he sold drugs and read the Bible with Cross on the night she was attacked. He admitted being in Skyers' house, but he told police he didn't know what he was doing there. He also admitted having sex with Denham, but claimed he paid her $20.<p>

<b>Verdict</b><br>
Smith was found guilty on July 12, 1996. He was sentenced to three consecutive life terms.<p>

<H2>Georgia v. Strickland (5/96)</H2>

<P>In a pre-trial hearing, a special jury was asked to determine whether Danny Strickland was competent to stand trial for the murder of his father.</P>

<P>Police found the decomposing corpse of Willis Daniel Strickland Sr. in his Savannah home on October 31, 1994. On searching the house, police found handwritten notes, purportedly made by Danny Strickland, that prosecutors contended reflected plans to dispose of the body.</P>

<P>After his arrest, Strickland was ordered to undergo psychiatric testing. Dr. Donald Gibson of the Central State Hospital determined that he was incompetent to stand trial and was not responsible at the time of the murder.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
On May 2, 1996, the jury determined that Strickland was not competent to stand trial.</P>

<H2>Hansen v. Curaflex Health Services (6/95)</H2>

<P>Marc Hansen, a former employee of Curaflex Health Services Inc., sued the company for employment discrimination, saying he was fired because general manager Daniel Skidmore learned he was HIV positive. Hansen was hired in September 1992 as an office manager in Curaflex's Fort Lauderdale office and fired seven weeks later.</P>

<P>Witnesses offered conflicting testimony during the three-day trial, and frequently contradicted their own depositions and affidavits, leaving jurors wondering whom to believe.</P>

<P>Hansen's lawyer, William Porter, argued that Curaflex had a history of discrimination. Curaflex's lawyer, Ronald Rosengarten argued that Hansen was fired because he wasn't cut out for a high-profile sales position. He stressed employee comments that Hansen was "unpolished" and "loud" around the office.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
A Broward County jury ruled on June 16, 1995, that Curaflex Health Services did not discriminate against Hansen.</P>

<H2>Horn v. Highline Community Hospital (3/95)</H2>

<P>Highline Community Hospital and three doctors were sued for medical malpractice in connection with the withdrawal of life support (food and water) from patient Scott Horn for five days in December 1993.</P>

<P>Kate Kaemerle, Horn's ex-wife, alleged the doctors and the hospital illegally and improperly withdrew Horn's life support and sued for the suffering and fear Horn endured during the five days before food and water were restored.</P>

<P>Horn's family and the doctors had come to the conclusion that Horn was in a long-term vegetative state with very little hope of recovery. Kaemerle maintained that her ex-husband was conscious and cognitive, but only could communicate by blinking his eyes.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
On March 31, 1995, the jury found for the defendants on all counts.</P>

<p><h2>In Re Custody of Hennessy Children (5/95)</h2>
In one of the first cases of its kind in the country, a  homosexual sought custody of her deceased partner's three children. The case involved Pamela Hennessy against the children's grandmother Patricia Bartel.<p>

The boys' mother Michelle Notz Hennessy was fatally stabbed in April of 1994 in her Buffalo, New York, home. The home was heavily damaged by a fire that probably was set to cover the attack. The murder never was solved.<p>

Several weeks later, after a judge learned that Pamela Hennessy was a suspect in the murder, he ordered the boys placed in their grandmother's custody. <p>

The custody battle soon began.<p>

It was while Pamela Hennessy was living with the boys' mother that the children were conceived through artificial insemination. The two women also went through a marriage ceremony several years earlier, and Michelle changed her name from Notz to Hennessy.<p>

The relationship ended in 1990 but Pamela Hennessy maintained her involvement with the children and occasionally provided financial help to their mother as well as moving the family into a home she owned.<p>

Pamela Hennessy, who operated a lesbian bar, said during the trial that if she was given custody of the boys, she would sell the bar, move to the suburbs and open a different type of business.<p>

<b>Verdict</b><br>
Under a settlement,  Patricia Bartel and Pamela Hennessy agreed to be co-guardians of the children. The children will live mainly with their grandmother, and with Hennessy on alternate weekends and Wednesdays, holidays and during summer vacation. <p>

<H2>Jennings v. The Black Crowes (2/96)</H2>

<P>A simple pie chart diagram scrawled on notebook paper was at the center of a dispute between a tour manager and the successful Atlanta-based band The Black Crowes.</P>

<P>Kevin Jennings claimed the drawing showed that, before becoming famous, the Crowes had made him an equal partner. </P>

<P>Band members testified that they did no such thing. Most said they didn't even remember the diagram. Those who did said it was merely an off-the-cuff memento of friendship, drawn to ease Jennings' concerns that fame might end his friendship with the band. Two of them testified that the heading on the drawing, "Heavy Symbolism," was a private joke used to refer to something which was ridiculous or farcical. </P>

<P>Band members testified that they had wanted Jennings, a tour manager for various musical groups and performers, to be their road manager once their debut album had been released and they began to tour. Those plans fell through, they said, when Jennings' girlfriend gave birth and he told the band he could not serve as tour manager. </P>

<P>Jennings contended that he did not quit but simply took time off, only to find out later that he had been replaced and that The Black Crowes would have nothing to do with him. </P>

<P>Jennings, who claimed he booked performances and toted equipment for the Crowes in 1989 before they made it big the next year, sued the band for a one-sixth share of the profits from the group's lucrative first
album, Shake Your Money Maker. The album sold more five million copies.</P>

<P>The band's lawyers contended the pie chart was too vague to be a valid contract. They described it as  
was simply a souvenir that had been blown out of proportion. </P>

<P>The jury had to decide first whether a partnership was formed that included Jennings, and, if so, whether Jennings breached the agreement by failing to perform under its terms or whether he settled his claim at a later date by accepting $300 from a band member</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
The jury deadlocked six to six and a mistrial declared on February 16, 1996.</P>

<P>Two weeks later, Jennings and the band reached a settlement. The terms were not disclosed.</P>

<P>"Everybody is pleased to have this case at the end after four years and two weeks of trial," said Jennings attorney Scott Sanders.</P>

<P>Defense attorney  William M. Ragland Jr. said the Black Crowes "are extremely pleased with how the matter was resolved."</P>

<H2>Jocius v. Jocius (6/96)</H2>

<P>In January, three Milwaukee children took the unusual step of writing to the family court judge who had granted their parents' divorce. They asked the judge to sever their ties to their abusive father.</P>

<P>"We have come to a decision about our father and would like to know if you can help," the letter began. "Since the divorce in 1990 alot has happened. Our father has been back in prison several times and using drugs, alcohol and just being stupid.</P>

<P>"He has lived with us several times since the divorce. We have all tried to make things work, but nothing changes him. Our mother has been diagnosed with panic disorder, agoraphobia, depression, and too much stress. She feels like she has to keep trying to work things out with dad because she is afraid of him. He was abusive toward all of us during the marriage, more mentally than physically, but now we are all paying for it," the children wrote. "Us kids have decided that we don't want anything to do with our dad and we want to know if his rights can be taken away? We are 16, 14 and 7 now and we feel very clear about the decision."</P>

<P>Perhaps sensing the children's urgency, frustration and fear, Judge Dominic Amato acted quickly. (The judge who handled the divorce had died and the case was assigned to Judge Amato). He appointed a "guardian ad litem," attorney Hazel Washington, to investigate the allegations of physical and mental abuse reported by the children and, if substantiated, to represent the children's interests in a court proceeding.</P>

<P>Washington's investigation revealed that there, in fact, existed a history of abuse by Mark Jocius of his children, Matthew, Jennifer and Bryan, and ex-wife Victoria. There was the time Mark took his 16-year-old Matthew to a bar and smoked marijuana with him. He also taken his 7-year-old Bryan to a bar and has reportedly threatened to kill his ex-wife and the children.</P>

<P>Judge Amato issued a temporary restraining order and ordered Jocius to stay away from his former wife and  children. However, at a subsequent hearing, Victoria Jocius testified that he had made threatening phone calls to her and the children from jail in violation of the temporary restraining order. The judge then ordered a permanent injunction which will remain in effect for two years.</P>

<P>Jocius has been in and out of jail through the years (including as recently as early April, 1996) for forgery and writing bad checks as well as parole violations.</P>

<P>During a hearing in April, he said, "There was a lot of dysfunction because of alcohol abuse, but I've never left them. I've tried numerous alcoholic treatment programs without success. I never turned my back on them. I love them. I'm proud of them for stepping forward to protect themselves. I still love them. I will always love them. I don't want to lose them."</P>

<P>Washington, the children's guardian, then took an unusual and unprecedented step in this case.</P>

<P>Rather than terminate Mark Jocius's parental rights outright  (something that is not unheard of), the children wanted to terminate Jocius's visitation rights but not his obligation to pay child support. The children also did not want to lose inheritance rights. (Under current law, when parental rights are terminated, the slate is wiped clean. Not only are there no visitation rights but there is also no obligation to pay child support and the child loses inheritance rights.)</P>

<P>During the trial, Josius testified about his life and feelings towards his children. He said he only wanted what is best for his children, and praised his former wife for doing everything she could to help the children and his relationship with her. He told the court that he was abused as a child and  admitted having an alcohol and drug problem. But he said he never physically abused his own children.</P>

<P>A court-appointed psychologist who examined the children said it would be detrimental for them to have contact with their father "under circumstances where his behavior can not be modified."</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
The judge severed the ties between Jocius and the two older children. For the youngest child, now eight years old, the split was indefinite. The decision means no visitation or any other rights that go along with fatherhood. Jocius, however, must support his children until they are 18 years old.</P>

<H2>Johnson v. New York Health & Hospitals Corp. (2/96)</H2>

<P>When a pregnant doctor was found raped and murdered in a New York City hospital on January 8, 1989, then-Mayor Edward Koch called the death, "the number one case to be solved in New York."</P>

<P>Authorities quickly arrested Steven Smith for the murder of Dr. Kathryn Hinnant Johnson.  Smith, a homeless man with a history of psychiatric problems, was convicted and eventually sentenced to life in prison.</P>

<P>Dr. Hinnant's estate then sued the hospital where she worked for wrongful death and negligence. </P>

<P>Smith was a patient at Bellevue Hospital in the weeks before Dr. Hinnant's death. He was released on December 27, 1988. But instead of leaving, he made himself a home in the hospital.</P>

<P>He stole surgical clothes, a stethoscope and employee identification cards, which enabled him to roam the facility. He even had started sleeping on the 22nd floor of Bellevue behind some machinery in an engineering closet that was not monitored by hospital security.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs accused the New York City Health and Hospitals Corp., which operates Bellevue, of failing to keep the premises safe and secure. They maintained that the corporation had actual and constructive knowledge of Smith's whereabouts because he kept showing up at the hospital. He even was arrested for stealing a hypodermic needle and quartz clock from a 17th floor doctor's office just eight days before the murder. (The charges were later dropped.) They also contended that the hospital was negligent for releasing Smith.</P>

<P>The defense argued the hospital corporation was not liable because it was not responsible for Smith's actions after he was discharged from the hospital. Defense attorney Joshua Pollack contended the hospital properly treated and released Smith in December 1988. Pollack maintained Smith did not exhibit any homicidal tendencies during his treatment. </P>

<P>The hospital contended that it was not practical to expect Bellevue Hospital security to apprehend every potentially dangerous person who enters the facility.  The defense maintained that hospital security was adequate, not perfect.</P>

<P>The case took nearly six years to come to trial because the hospital initially claimed that Dr. Hinnant was an employee of the Health and Hospitals Corp.  If that was the case, civil litigation would have been limited to a workers' compensation claim. The plaintiffs claimed the doctor was an employee of  New York University Medical Center who worked at Bellevue Hospital. Dr. Hinnant was an assistant professor pathology at the  university. A New York appeals court ruled Dr. Hinnant was not an employee of Bellevue.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
On February 26, 1996, a jury found that the hospital was not responsible for Dr. Hinnant's death.</P>

<H2>Judge Vaughn Competency Hearing (5/95)</H2>

<P>Fulton (Georgia) State Court Judge Dorothy Vaughn faced 
disciplinary hearings based on five complaints filed with the 
Judicial Qualifications Commission.
The complaints -- four filed by attorneys and one by a litigant -- alleged professional 
incompetence, rude and hostile conduct toward those appearing 
before her, and absenteeism from the bench.
According to the 
complaints, Judge Vaughn acted incompetently by forfeiting bonds, 
issuing bench warrants and having defendants jailed, failing to 
grant jury trials upon request, and in one case forcing a 
defendant to plead guilty without the presence of his attorney.</P>

<P>The judge maintained she had acted properly and did not violate 
any judicial canons. She did acknowledge that her mannerisms and 
facial expressions might have inadvertently conveyed hostility.</P>

<P><B>Verdict</B><br>
The Judicial Qualifications Commission unanimously recommended 
that Judge Vaughn immediately be removed from office, calling her 
abusive and incompetent. In a harshly worded 37-page report, 
issued on May 26, 1995, the commission found that Judge Vaughn 
had violated the Canons of Judicial Ethics and was unfit to hold 
office.</P>

<P>The commission wrote that Judge Vaughn's "proven conduct can only be
described as a flagrant abuse and/or misuse of the power and prestige of
judicial office in a (sic) unsuccessful attempt to mask a professional
incompetence rarely seen in judges of her age and experience."</P>

<P>The Georgia Supreme Court accepted the commission's recommendation. Judge Vaughn was removed from office in October 1995.</P>

<H2>Kentucky v. Pleasant (1/94)</H2>

<P>Typhanie Pleasant, 21, was charged with the murder of her newborn son, who was born January 1, 1993. Pleasant, who lived at home but kept the pregnancy a secret from her parents, claimed the baby developed breathing problems shortly after birth. After her efforts to administer artificial respiration failed, she said she wrapped up the baby and placed him in a garbage can. The prosecution contended Pleasant suffocated the baby.</P>

<P><B>Verdict</B><BR>
A jury convicted Pleasant of second-degree murder on January 31, 1994.</P>

<H2>Kurgan v. Rollerblade Inc. (12/95)</H2>

<P>In 1991, Kenneth Kurgan, 19, was skating to the Paradise Valley Mall in Phoenix on his new pair of Rollerblade in-line skates. He stumbled over a gravel median, flipped over the curb and slammed headfirst into an oncoming truck. He was not wearing a helmet or any other protective equipment.</P>

<P>Kurgan suffered an open skull fracture and is permanently brain damaged. Paralyzed on one side, he is barely able to carry on a conversation and doctors say he will require constant medical supervision for the rest of his life.</P>

<P>Kurgan's parents say that at the time of the injury Rollerblade literature did not adequately warn users to wear a helmet and other protective gear. While the product handbook included the admonition to "wear protective safety equipment," other Rollerblade promotional material represented that the product could be safely used by persons of all ages without the use of a helmet, Kurgan's lawyers allege. </P>

<P>Kurgan's lawyers also claimed that the skates their son purchased were defective and unreasonably dangerous.</P>

<P>The Kurgans sued for monetary damages to provide for their son's needs for the rest of his life.</P>

<P>Rollerblade denied it was liable for Kurgan's accident. It maintained that the skates are responsibly marketed with adequate warnings and are not defective. Company lawyers said Kurgan freely chose to skate without such equipment and bears responsibility for his own injuries.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
On December 6, 1995, a jury found in favor of the defendants.</P>

<H2>Mahlum v. Dow Chemical (10/95)</H2>

<P>Like thousands of women, Charlotte Mahlum claimed her health problems were due to faulty silicone breast implants. Mahlum received the implants in 1985 after undergoing a double mastectomy. When a surgeon removed them several years later, she claimed the devices had ruptured and a surgeon was unable to remove all the silicone that had seeped into surrounding tissue.<br></P>
Mahlum, a 46-year-old resident of Nevada, sued Dow Chemical and Dow Corning in 1993, alleging the implants caused serious health problems including neurological diseases.</P>

<P>But by the time the case went to trial, Dow Corning was no longer a defendant. The company sought bankruptcy protection in May 1995, saying it lacked the resources to fight litigation filed on behalf of thousands of women who blame implants for health problems. Dow Corning is co-owned by Dow Chemical, based in Midland, Mich., and Corning Inc. of Corning, N.Y.</P>

<P>A federal judge ruled in September 1995 that the cases against Dow Chemical and Corning could proceed despite the Chapter 11 filing.</P>

<P>Dow Chemical is the defendant or co-defendant in more than 13,000 breast implant lawsuits. But before this case, the only other claim against it to reach trial was in Texas, where a jury ordered the company to pay 20 percent of a $5.2 million damage award to a woman who claimed injury from breast implants. But that decision was thrown out by the trial judge.</P>

<P>During the trial, the lawyers for Mahlum and her husband, Marvin, contended that Dow Chemical was as responsible for the safety of implants as Dow Corning, because the company performed studies on silicone for Dow Corning. They also said that Dow Chemical scientists were aware of the potential dangers of silicone.</P>

<P>Dow Chemical lawyers argued that the company never made or distributed silicone breast implants. They claimed they were made by Dow Corning, and Dow Chemical couldn't be held responsible for the actions of another company.</P>

<P>The company also presented evidence of recent statistical studies that failed to provide a link between silicone implants and immune system illnesses. Mahlum's lawyers questioned the methodology of the studies.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
On October 29, 1995, a jury found for Charlotte Mahlum and ordered Dow Chemical to pay her $3.9 million in compensatory damages. The jury also awarded $200,000 in compensatory damages to Marvin Mahlum.</P>

<P>The jury found that Dow Chemical "fraudulently concealed" the dangers of silicone and "substantially assisted" Dow Corning Inc. in testing materials used in breast implants.</P>

<P>The jury subsequently ordered Dow Chemical to pay $10 million in punitive damages, bringing the total damages to $14.1 million.</P>

<H2>Massachusetts v. Conkey (3/96)</H2>

<P>Mary Lou Sale was discovered dead in the bedroom of her suburban Boston home, strangled with a pair of pantyhose.  After an intensive investigation, police arrested a young man who lived a block away.  But was Craig Conkey the killer -- or was it Sale's landlord, whom the police originally suspected but never arrested? 
 
Prosecutors claimed Conkey was an experienced thief who once confided to a girlfriend that he got a thrill from robbing houses while the persons living there were present.  If the person living in the house wasn't home, Conkey allegedly said, it was too easy.  They theorized that he broke into Sale's house through her back door, and proceeded through the house, eventually making his way up the stairs to the master bedroom.  There, while Conkey was in the act of stealing Sale's jewelry and other property, police believe Sale woke up.  The two struggled and Conkey killed her.
 
The defense contended that there was no evidence directly linking Conkey to the murder. Conkey admitted that he went to Sale's home on the night of the murder after hearing screams and that she was dead when he found her.
Other than his finger and palm prints on the bedroom door -- which were compatible with his story -- there was no other physical evidence connecting him to the murder.  Police did not find his fingerprints anywhere else in the house and none of Sale's possessions were discovered during a search of his room.  
 
The defense also argued that there was evidence pointing to other suspects.  For example, three Caucasian head hairs were discovered on the white pajama top worn by Sale at the time of her killing.  Two of the hairs were brown, and appeared to be naturally shed.  But one, which was gray, showed signs of having been forcibly removed, and the defense argued that this could have occurred during a struggle.  None of the three hairs matched Conkey's head hairs or those of the victim.  And there were other fingerprints found in various places in the house which, despite the efforts of the police to get sample prints from everyone ever known to be present, were never identified.  
 
The defense also suggested that the murder could have been committed by someone else. The most likely suspect was Sale's landlord, Dr. Ronald Laing. The defense pointed out that Dr. Laing was the original suspect in the case, and that the police questioned him several times and even searched his house. 
The defense suggested that once the police began to focus their investigation on Conkey, they simply forgot about Dr. Laing, even though there were may have been inconsistencies in his version of the events of the case.  
<b>Verdict</b><br>  
Conkey was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison.</P>

<H2>Massachusetts v. Manning (6/94)</H2>

<P>The Rev. Paul Manning was charged with molesting an 11-year-old altar boy. The main witness against Manning was another priest, the Rev. Paul Sughrue. He testified that on Sept. 5, 1993, he heard several screams and climbed the stairs to Manning's study at the rectory of St. Charles Church in Woburn. He said Manning and the boy had their pants down and were clinging together and making a rocking motion.</P>

<P>Manning denied the charges, testifying there was no nudity and that he and the boy were only involved in horseplay.</P>

<P><B>Verdict</B><BR>
A jury acquitted Manning on June 25, 1994.</P>

<H2>Massachusetts v. McIntyre (6/96)</H2>

<P>On the evening of January 10, 1995, John McIntyre brought his girlfriend, bleeding from a chest wound to the hospital. When police and hospital personnel asked Meredith Coppola whether her boyfriend had stabbed her, she said no.</P>

<P>She died 20 minutes later.</P>

<P>McIntyre, 25, told police at the hospital that he and Coppola, 18, were together in his car before she was stabbed but that he was not  responsible for her death. He told police he left his car to buy some marijuana. And when he returned, he found Coppola bleeding.</P>

<P>But <A href=/report/coppola.html>prosecutors</A> contended McIntyre was lying, and charged him with first-degree murder.</P>

<P>During the trial, several witnesses testified that McIntyre and Coppola got into a fight shortly before her death. McIntyre also went to a friend's house and washed blood off a knife shortly after the murder. An expert witness testified that fibers found on a knife police said was the murder weapon were consistent with fibers from a sweater Coppola was wearing when she was stabbed. The defense argued that Coppola's dying declaration cleared McIntytre.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
On June 26, 1996, a jury found McIntyre guilty of first-degree murder. He faces a mandatory life sentence.</P>

<p><h2>McWherter v. City of Ann Arbor (9/95)</h2>
Lois McWherter, an Arbor Arbor, Michigan, parking official sued the city and two co-workers for sexual harassment. McWherter claimed a colleague, Dean Bowerbank, harassed her and when she complained to John Avendt, her supervisor, he forced her to work closely with Bowerbank and have her poor evaluations.<p>

Bowerbank maintained he did not harass her, despite the findings of an internal investigation, and the city and Avendt claimed Bowerbank was punished for his actions and behavior.<p>

<b>Verdict</b><br>
The jury found for McWherter and awarded her a total of $255,000 -- $35,000 from Avendt and $220,000 from the city. The jury found that Bowerbank did not harass her.<p>

<p><h2>Michigan v. Cato Riggs (5/94)</h2>

Toni Cato Riggs was charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy for her role in the death of her husband, Anthony Riggs, a serviceman who was fatally shot a few weeks after returning from the Persian Gulf War. Prosecutors claimed she had him killed to collect on a $150,000 insurance policy. After the murder, <a href=/report/catoriggs.html> Cato Riggs </a> allegedly got involved in a drug smuggling operation and confessed to undercover agents posing as drug dealers that she planned her husband's death. The defense claimed she made the statements in order to impress the agents she thought were tough drug kingpins.<p>

<b>Verdict</b><br>
Cato Riggs was found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. She was sentenced to life in prison without parole.<p>

<H2>Michigan v. Dr. Jack Kevorkian</H2>

<P>For the second time in two years, prosecutors in Michigan tried to convince a jury that Dr. Jack Kevorkain broke the law by helping people end their lives.</P>

<P>The 67-year-old retired pathologist went on trial for assisting in the 1993 deaths of Merian Frederick, 72, of Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Dr. Ali Khalili, 61, of Oak Brook, Illinois. Frederick suffered from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, better known as Lou Gehrig's disease, while Khalili suffered from bone cancer. Both died by inhaling poisonous carbon monoxide in Kevorkian's former apartment in the Detroit suburb of Royal Oak, Michigan. </P>

<P>The main issue of the trial was whether Kevorkian intended for them to die or set out only to relieve their pain.  </P>

<P>Michigan's assisted suicide said that a "person is not guilty of criminal assistance of suicide if that person was administering medications or procedures if the intent to relieve pain or discomfort and not to cause death," even if the medication or procedure "may hasten or increase the risk of death."  The law went into effect in February 1993 and expired in November 1994.</P>

<P>Kevorkian testified that he did not want either patient to die but that their deaths were an unfortunate consequence of relieving their suffering. The defense also presented evidence to show that Frederick and Khalili's   suffering was uncontrollable and that they had made rational decisions to end thier lives.</P>

<P>The prosecution tried to portray Kevorkian as a sinister man whose radical ideas included human experimentation. It also argued that carbon dioxide did not have any medical or therapeutic value.</P>

<P>The trial was the second time that authorities tried to convict Kevorkian. In May 1994, he was found not guilty in the death of Thomas Hyde, a 30-year-old landscaper, who also had Lou Gehrig's disease.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
The  jury acquitted Kevorkian on March 8, 1996. </P>

<H2>Michigan v. Price (2/96)</H2>

<P>Detroit police officer Glenn Price was charged with second-degree murder and a felony weapons charge in connection with the July 22, 1994, shooting death of 10-year-old Freddie Vela.</P>

<P>The shooting occurred after Price -- who was off-duty at the time -- was drinking with a friend David Kennedy at a topless bar. Price left the bar with the understanding that Kennedy would follow him home. But while leaving, Price crashed his truck into a utility pole. Unable to pry the truck loose,  Price transferred the items from his truck to Kennedy's, then returned to the bar. He then went back to his truck and accidentally set off the alarm.</P>

<P>At this point, John Collins, a resident of the neighborhood who admittedly had been drinking, went over to Price's truck and tried to disconnect the blaring alarm. Price and Collins got into an argument and    Price drew his department-issued weapon. </P>

<P>Price said the weapon accidentally fired, killing Vela who was standing about 20 yards away.</P>

<P>There was no doubt that Price did not intent to shoot Vela. But the prosecution claimed that Price, an eight-year police veteran who was trained in the use of firearms, knew that pulling his gun and firing it in a residential neighborhood was extremely dangerous. The state argued he was guilty of second-murder for willfully and wantonly creating a situation likely to result in death or great bodily harm.</P>

<P>The defense argued that no laws were broken because the shooting clearly was accidental. In addition, the defense said Price was right to draw his weapon because he had a legal duty to try and stop Collins from committing a crime or potential crime with the truck.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
On February 7, 1996, a jury found Price guilty of second-degree murder. Price was sentenced to 10-15 years in prison. He also was sentenced to a mandatory two years in prison for using a firearm during the commission of a felony.</P>

<H2>Michigan v. Welch (4/96)</H2>

<P>The incident stunned a nation. A woman plunges to her death in the Detroit River as a crowd of onlookers stands idly by as she is attacked.</P>

<P>Martell Welch was charged with murder in the August 19, 1995, drowning death of Deletha Word, who drowned after jumping into the river after Welch beat her up following a traffic accident.</P>

<P>The altercation began when Welch and Word were involved in a minor fender bender in the early morning hours while driving back from Belle Isle, a popular island park in the river between the United States and Canada.  Just before they got to the bridge to return to the mainland, Word's car hit Welch. </P>

<P>Several witnesses described a brutal beating that ended with Welch threatening Word with a tire jack and saying he was going to use it to "beat her brains out."</P>

<P>Prosecutors argued that Welch was guilty of  murder even though he did not push Word from the bridge and was standing several feet away when she jumped. They contended Word was so scared of Welch that she  jumped to escape being beaten again.</P>

<P>The defense case focused on two key pieces of information in the medical examiner's report. Word had traces of the hallucinogenic drug PCP or angel dust in her system at the time of her death. The defense suggested that she may have thought she could fly when she jumped off the bridge.  The defense also argued Word's body only had minor scratches and bruises, contradicting claims that Welch brutally beat her up.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
On April 29, 1996, a jury convicted Welch of second-degree murder. He was sentenced to 16 to 40 years in prison.</P>

<H2>Michigan v. Younes (4/96)</H2>

<P>Scott  Younes,  a Detroit gang member, was charged with first-degree murder in the fatal shooting of a Detroit police officer.</P>

<P>Prosecutors claimed he was seeking revenge for an earlier gang skirmish when he shot and killed Officer Jerry Philpot on May 25, 1995.</P>

<P>Here's what happened.</P>

<P>Mike Lopez  was visiting his friend Geneva Mendoza, when they decided to go to a neighborhood store to buy some gum. As they neared the store, they were confronted by four or five young men believed to be members of the Latin Counts gang. The gang members started beating up Lopez and Mendoza ran home to tell her father, Teddy McClellan. </P>

<P>After Philpot and his partner arrived at McClellan's house to investigate the incident, McClellan and his son, Teddy Mendoza, went out into the streets and located one of Lopez's assailants -- Victor Salinas.  Mendoza beat him up. The police officers heard about the fight and showed up the scene. Salinas was taken into custody.</P>

<P>In the meantime, gang members drove by McClellan's house, threatening to shoot his house down. The prosecution claimed Younes, who lived in the neighborhood, told McClellan,  "you shouldn't have gotten involved...your house will go down."</P>

<P>A short time later, some of Salinas' friends, including Younes, and family members showed up at the police station. It was then that Younes and John Kolniak decided to avenge Salinas' beating. Kolniak would shoot up McClellan's house and Younes would back him up in case there were problems, according to prosecutors.</P>

<P>The two police officers, in the meantime, realized that they had lost a flashlight and went back to McClellan's house to get it.  </P>

<P>When they got near the house, they heard gunshots. The officers spotted  Kolniak, carrying a long gun.   Kolniak faced the officers. Philpot and his partner drew their guns.  The officers fired as Kolniak tried to aim at the officers.  Kolniak was fatally wounded.</P>

<P>Then as the officers approached, Younes fired numerous shots with a semiautomatic assault rifle. One shot struck Philpot.</P>

<P>The defense conceded that Younes fired a shot. But it insisted there was no evidence that he planned to kill Philpot and therefore was not guilty of premeditated murder.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
On April 23, 1996, a jury found Younes guilty of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole.</P>

<TITLE>Court TV Casefiles: Michigan v. Schmitz</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<P>
<A HREF="/map/casefiles.map"><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/headers/casefiles.gif" ISMAP BORDER=0></A>
<BR>

<H2>Michigan v. Schmitz</H2>

Jonathan Schmitz, 26, agreed to appear on a secret admirers segment
of the <I>Jenny Jones</I> TV show expecting his admirer to be
a woman, not his gay neighbor. 
<P>
When Schmitz found Scott Amedure, a 32-year-old unemployed gay
man, telling a television audience about a fantasy that involved
Schmitz, some whipped cream, strawberries and champagne, he became
embarrassed and, his lawyers said, enraged.
<P>
Three days after the taping, on March 9, 1995, Schmitz received
an anonymous, sexually suggestive note on his doorstep and assumed
it came from Amedure.
<P>
Schmitz purchased a 12-gauge shotgun, went to Amedure's mobile
home, and fired two shots at close range into Amedure's chest.
A few minutes later, Schmitz dialed 911 from a pay phone at a
gas station near his sister's house. He said "I just walked
in the room and killed him."<P>
<B>The Charges<BR>
</B>Schmitz was charged with first-degree murder and committing
a felony with a firearm. To convict him of first-degree murder,
prosecutors must prove that the murder was premeditated. If convicted
of this charge, Schmitz faces life imprisonment without the possibility
of parole. The jury is alowed to consider lesser charges,
such as second-degree murder or manslaughter.
<P>
<B>The Prosecution's Case<BR>
</B>Though Schmitz may have been embarrassed by the <I>Jenny Jones</I>
taping, it did not justify his killing Amedure, the state argued.
Schmitz drove to one store to purchase a shotgun, drove to another
for ammunition, and drove to Amedure's home before firing the
fatal shots. That demonstrates premeditation, prosecutors said.
<P>
Prosecutors contended that when Schmitz went to Amedure's mobile
home, Schmitz became violent. They say that a police report indicating
an upturned chair at the crime scene shows that Amedure was trying
to defend himself.
<P>
The State had an oral confession and a videotaped confession.
In a pretrial hearing, however, the judge ruled that both confessions
were inadmissible because the oral confession was made without
Schmitz being read his Miranda rights and the videotaped
confession was made while his right to counsel was being violated.
<P>
<B>The Defense's Case<BR>
</B>Schmitz's attorneys argued the defense of diminished capacity.
They claimed Schmitz lacked the mental state required to have
committed premeditated murder when he shot Amedure.
<P>
According to the defense's theory, Schmitz simply snapped after
finding the note on his doorstep. Lawyers attributed Schmitz'
reaction to Grave's disease -- a thyroid gland disorder that can
cause irrational and violent behavior -- and manic depression.
<P>
<B>The Jenny Jones Show<BR>
</B>In Jones' Dec.11, 1995 deposition, she insisted that the show,
which never aired, had no connection to the shooting. She contended
that Schmitz was told that his admirer could be either male or
female, though the defense claimed the show's producers led Schmitz to believe his secret admirer was a woman.
<P>
<B>The Prosecution<BR>
</B>Roman Kalytiak, an assistant county prosecutor in Oakland
County, Michigan, graduated from the University of Notre Dame
School of Law in 1987. In 1994, he was appointed senior trial
attorney, responsible for high-profile prosecutions.
<P>
<B>The Defense<BR>
</B>The lead attorney, James Burdick, has been in private practice
since 1970. He previously served as an assistant prosecutor for
Wayne County, Detroit. He is a 1968 graduate of the University
of Michigan Law School.
<P>
Fred L. Gibson has been in private practice since 1978. A former
state trooper with the Michigan police department, he began his
legal career at a firm that represented the 4,000-member Detroit
Police Officer's Association. He left the firm to start his own
practice, representing police officers in both civil and criminal
matters. He graduated from the Detroit College of Law in 1986.
<P>
<B>The Judge<BR>
</B>Judge Francis X. O'Brien was elected to the Oakland County
Circuit Court in 1976 and re-elected in 1982, 1988, and 1994.
He earned his undergraduate and law school degrees from the University
of Detroit.
<P>
<B>Some Of The Key Evidence</B>
<UL>
<LI>An upturned chair found at crime scene -- a prosecution expert
apparently could not determine whether it was thrown offensively
or defensively;
<LI>A tape of Schmitz's 911 call;
<LI>A videotape of the Jenny Jones segment;
<LI>A note from a Jenny Jones staff member to Jenny Jones stating
that Schmitz is hoping that his crush is a woman. It then says
"Scott [Amedure] has an inkling that Jon [Schmitz] is bisexual"
and that Jon is "going to die when he sees it's Scott."
</UL>

<P>
<B>Legal Terms:<BR>
</B><UL>
<LI><B>First-degree murder:</B> Premeditated killing. In Michigan a conviction on this charge carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole.
<LI><B>Second-degree murder:</B> Deliberate, but not premeditated killing. 
<LI><B>Manslaughter:</B> Killing without malice.
<LI><B>Premeditation:</B> Considering an action before carrying it out. First-degree murder must be premeditated. 
<LI><B>Diminished capacity:</B> Lacking the mental state required to commit a crime. Typically, the result of a mental disorder or trauma.
</UL>

<P>
<B>The Verdict<BR>
</B>On Nov. 12, 1996, the jury opted against the most serious
charge, first-degree murder, and found Jon Schmitz guilty of second-degree
murder and illegal possession of a firearm in commission of a
felony. On Dec. 4, he received a 25 to 50 year sentence. Schmitz will serve at least 20 years before he is eligible for parole.<HR>

<H2>Mickler v. Southeastern Freight Lines (3/96)</H2>

<P>Belinda Mickler and her three young children sued for the alleged wrongful death of her husband who was killed in a motor vehicle accident involving a Southeastern Freight Lines truck. </P>

<P>Mickler sought damages for her husband's pain and suffering prior to his death and for the costs of his funeral and burial. The defendants denied any liability and claimed the fatal collision was the result of an unavoidable accident or sudden emergency, possibly caused by Mickler's negligence. </P>

<P>This is what happened.</P>

<P>During the early morning hours of October 20, 1993, Reginald Mickler parked his pickup truck in an emergency lane on Interstate 75, just south of the entrance from Georgia Highway 42, some 50 miles south of Atlanta. The owner of a small construction company, he was transporting materials in his truckbed. It was not known why he had stopped his truck, but the truck company suggested Mickler had failed to properly secure his load and had to stop to retrieve an object that had tumbled onto the road. </P>

<P>A Southeastern Freight Lines tractor-trailer collided with the left rear portion of Mickler's truck, scraped along the side of the pickup, passing it, then struck and climbed the guard rail. When it finally came to rest, it burst into flames.</P>

<P>Mickler's body was found behind his vehicle. He was dead at the scene. An eyewitness observed Mickler before impact and testified that he appeared to see the approaching tractor-trailer and tried to run away. </P>

<P>The truck driver, Mike Hall, denied allegations that he was speeding  or driving in the emergency lane. He said that as he pulled abreast of the pickup, his steering jerked sharply to the right and locked, causing him to swerve into Mickler. (A jury acquitted Hall of involuntary manslaughter in the case.)</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
The jury found the trucking company liable and awarded $5.2 million in damages.</P>

<H2>Missouri v. Feeney</H2>

<P>Jon Feeney, a former high school science teacher, was charged with three counts of first-degree murder for the bludgeoning death of his wife and six-year-old son and the strangulation of his 18-month-old daughter. 
Feeney said on the night of the killings he was about 100 miles away from his home, where the incident occurred, attending a teachers conference. Prosecutors presented a timeline that they said proved Feeney had the opportunity to return from his hotel and commit the crimes. They presented evidence to suggest that Feeney had stocked up on life insurance to benefit financially from the murders. They also attacked Feeney's character, calling several woman who said they had affairs with him. Defense attorney Shawn Askinosie questioned the integrity of the state's investigation and hammered away at the lack of physical evidence linking Feeney to the murders.</P>


<P><B>The Verdict</B><BR>
On Sunday, Oct. 6, 1996, after five hours of deliberations, the jury acquitted Feeney.

<H2>Missouri v. Neeley (11/94)</H2>

<P>Paul Neeley, 39, was charged with second-degree murder in the 
March 14, 1994 shooting of Mike Terrell, his former best friend. 
Neeley said he killed Terrell after his 16-year-old daughter told 
him that Terrell had raped her several years earlier. 
The prosecution claimed Neeley killed Terrell simply for revenge. 
The defense argued Neeley was not guilty because he was 
suffering from a mental disease or defect, or that, at the very 
least, Neeley's actions were the result of a sudden passion 
brought on by the news of the rape, and was therefore guilty only 
of voluntary manslaughter.</P>

<P><B>Verdict</B><BR>
On November 18, 1994, a jury found Neeley guilty of second-degree murder.</P>

<H2>Missouri v. Revelle (2/96)</H2>

<P>George Revelle appeared to have it all: a successful banking career, a nice home in an exclusive community, a wife and two children. But Revelle's world came crashing down in the early morning hours of  September 28, 1994, when his wife was killed in the couple's home.</P>

<P>Revelle told police that one or two masked men broke into the couple's home in Fremont Hills, a country club community south of Springfield, and shot his wife in the head during a bungled attempt to force him to get them money from his bank. At the time, Revelle was chief  financial officer and executive vice president of the Ozark Bank.</P>

<P>But authorities soon became suspicious of his story. They discovered that Revelle was deeply in debt and had taken out a $500,000 life insurance policy on his wife several months before the shooting. </P>

<P>The shooting also sparked an FBI investigation into suspected extortion and possible discrepancies in the Ozark Bank's finances. Revelle was subsequently indicted. In June 1995, he pleaded guilty to embezzling or misapplying more than $53,000 from the bank and was sentenced to 27 months in prison.</P>

<P>Revelle continued to maintain his innocence during the murder trial. He told the jury about the intruders and the alleged extortion attempt.</P>

<P>But prosecutors argued that Revelle couldn't be counted on to tell the truth. Among other witnesses, an alarm company technician testified that Revelle's account of house his house alarm went off on the night of the shootings was not possible. The prosecution also argued that Revelle stole money from the bank after the home he and his wife built went $150,000 over budget.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
On February 13, 1996, a jury found Revelle guilty of first-degree murder. The jury recommended that he be sentenced to life in prison.</P>

<H2>Montana v. Lilburn (3/95)</H2>

<P>In a case pitting the purported constitutional rights of protesters against the rights of hunters, John Lilburn was charged with hunter harassment in connection with his actions on March 13, 1990.</P>

<P>Lilburn, a 41-year-old animal rights activist, allegedly stood in front of hunter Hal Slemmer as Slemmer attempted to shoot a bison just outside of Yellowstone National Park.</P>

<P>The state claimed Lilburn's actions violated Montana's hunter harassment statute. Lilburn argued that his actions were protected by the First Amendment free speech rights and that the harassment statute was unjust.</P>

<P>Lilburn was originally tried and convicted in 1992. However, the charge was dismissed when a judge found the harassment statute to be unconstitutional. The Montana Supreme Court then reversed the ruling and ordered a new trial.</P>

<P><B>Verdict</B><BR>
Lilburn was found guilty on March 28, 1995. He received a 30-day sentence, suspended with the provision that he undergo 40 hours of community service. He also was ordered to pay an administrative fee of $15.</P>

<H2>New Mexico v. House (5/95)</H2>

<P>Gordon House stood trial a third time for vehicular homicide in 
connection with the deaths of four people in a car accident. On 
Christmas Eve, 1992, House was driving up to 90 miles per hour in 
the wrong lane of Interstate 40, west of Albuquerque, when he 
crashed into an oncoming car.  House was charged with vehicular 
homicide, drunk driving, great bodily injury and reckless driving.</P>

<P>The state argued that House never hit the brakes when he saw the 
car driven by Paul Cravens because he had been drinking for 
several hours before the accident. The defense argued that House 
was suffering a severe migraine headache which impaired his 
physical abilities and judgment. The migraine restricted the blood 
flow to House's brain, so even if  he did have a high blood 
alcohol content, he wouldn't feel the alcohol's effects as much as 
he would if his blood flow was not restricted. </P>

<P>The two previous trials ended in deadlocked juries. The fact that 
House, a native of the Navajo Nation, stood trial a third time was 
seen by some in the Navajo Nation as racist.</P>

<P><B>Verdict</B><br>
A jury found House guilty on all counts on May 26, 1995. He was 
sentenced to 22 years in prison.</P>

<H2>New Mexico v. Smith (12/95)</H2>

<P>William Smith was accused in the 1977 murders of two women, Kerry Tulton, 22, and Leslie MacDonnell, 18. He allegedly killed the women because of an earlier dispute over $50 worth of drugs.
 
Smith's 1977 trial ended in a hung jury but he was convicted of first-degree murder in a 1978 trial and sentenced to life in prison.  He spent 17 years in jail before a federal appeals court threw out the conviction because the prosecution had withheld evidence from the defense in the original trials. The police had found bloody clothes in the trunk of Tulton's husband's car, but the clothes were destroyed before the defense had a chance to test them.</P>

<P>The appeals court said that the state must release Smith or retry the case. Since all the physical evidence had been destroyed from the original trials, the state was ready to release Smith. But Lois Cooper, the mother of one of the victims, hired private investigators who were able to track down witnesses, and Smith was retried.</P>

<P>During the trial, the defense contended that Tultons husband, who had died of a drug overdose in 1978, was the killer. The states key witness was Harvey Bylsma, a former close friend of Smith. He was one of the original suspects in the case and spent four months in jail before he was released because of a lack of evidence. He testified that he saw Smith shoot the two women. </P>
<b>Verdict</b><br>
On December 14, 1995, the jury announced that it was deadlocked, 11-1 for acquittal.</P>

<H2>New York v. Cox</H2>

<P>Paul Cox, a 26-year-old carpenter, was charged with murdering two doctors who were living in his childhood home. The defense argued Cox was temporarily insane and not legally responsible in the 1989 New Year's Day deaths of Lakshman Rao Chevru and his wife Shanta Chevru. Defense experts testified that Cox was delusional and may have believed he was killing his parents. The prosecution argued that Cox, after drinking with friends, smashed up his mother's car and then intended to burglarize the Chevrus home.</P>

<P><B>Verdict:</B><BR>
A mistrial was declared on June 28, 1994 after the jury deadlocked 11-1 to find Cox guilty of intentional murder. Cox was retried, and a jury found him guilty of two counts of manslaughter on December 5, 1994. The jury determined that Cox intentionally killed the Chevrus while suffering from an "extreme emotional disturbance."</P>

<H2>New York v. Del-Debbio (3/96)</H2>

<P>A New York City police officer stood trial for shooting an undercover transit police officer in a crowded subway station during a moment of chaos and mistaken identity.</P>

<P>Peter Del-Debbio was charged with first- and second-degree assault in connection with the August 22, 1994, shooting of  Desmond Robinson.</P>

<P>The trial focused on whether Del-Debbio was justified in firing at Robinson.</P>

<P>The shooting occurred as Del-Debbio, a member of the Police Department's Organized Crime Control Bureau, was waiting for a subway train to take him home. At the same time, Robinson and other officers were chasing two teenagers, one of whom dropped a sawed-off shotgun inside the doorway of the last car of the train.</P>

<P>Del-Debbio put on his badge, took out his off-duty revolver and leaned over to get the shotgun. What happened next was the subject of conflicting testimony during the trial.</P>

<P>Del-Debbio testified that he saw a man with a gun running towards him. He suspected the man might be the person who dropped the shotgun. </P>

<P>When the man was about eight feet away,  Del-Debbio said he opened fire.</P>

<P>"At this point, I eliminated him from being a police officer so now I must shoot him to prevent him from shooting at me or anyone else," he testified. "I fired my weapon at the individual once, possibly twice. I continued to look at him and realized he was still coming at me. I thought I would be shot so I turned away and fired the remaining shots I had."</P>

<P>Del-Debbio's testimony on several important points differed sharply from Robinson's account of the shooting.<p.</P>

<P>Robinson testified that he was not running toward Del-Debbio but alongside the train. He also said he had his gun in both hands and pointed downward as he responded to the shotgun blast. </P>

<P>He said he never saw Del -Debbio and was past the open doors of the last car when he felt the first two shots in the back. He said he felt the other two as he lay on the subway platform, wondering why he was being shot and by whom. </P>

<P>Del-Debbio said he fired at Robinson as he faced him, and did not empty his gun into Robinson's back. </P>

<P>Robinson conceded that he was not wearing his badge or the color of the day, by which undercover officers can be recognized by fellow officers. But Del-Debbio said he never yelled to Robinson that he was a police officer because there was no time. </P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
On March 27, 1996, a jury concluded that Del-Debbio "recklessly caused serious physical injury to another person by means of a deadly weapon," and convicted him of second-degree assault. He was acquitted of first-degree assault. The judge sentenced Del-Debbio to five years probation and 200 hours of community service.</P>

<H2>New York v. Ferguson (2/95)</H2>

<P>Colin Ferguson was charged in the shooting rampage on a Long 
Island Rail Road commuter train that left six people dead and 19 
injured on December 7, 1993.  At his trial, Ferguson, 37, fired 
his lawyers, who wanted him to enter an insanity plea.  Ferguson 
represented himself and claimed that the shooter was a white man 
who stole his gun while he slept on the train.</P>

<P><B>Verdict</B><BR>
Ferguson was convicted of six counts of second-degree murder and 
19 counts of attempted murder on February 17, 1995.  He was 
sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison.</P>

<H2>New York v. Senko (3/96)</H2>

<P>Dmytro Senko, a New York City corrections department officer, was charged with grand larceny after  calling in sick for nearly two years with what he claimed was a debilitating injury. </P>

<P>Senko claimed a light fixture fell on his head and knocked him unconscious as he sat at a table writing in his logbook at the Riker's Island jail on December 30, 1992.  He did not return to work until November 1994.</P>

<P>The prosecution contended Senko faked the injuries and therefore was guilty of defrauding the city into paying his salary. During the trial, prosecutors presented evidence disputing Senko's version of the accident, and showed jurors surveillance videotapes of Senko going about his daily routine, including driving his car, and shoveling show and clearing ice near his home.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
A New York jury found Senko guilty of grand larceny. He was sentenced to six months in prison and 4-1/2 years probation. Senko also was ordered to pay $50,000 in restitution. </P>

<p><H2>Noonkester v. Kline (7/96)</H2>
Virgil Ray Noonkester knew that he was dying.<p>

So the 67-year-old San Diego man suffering from amyothrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou Gehrig's Disease, started planning for his own death.<p>

He made several arrangements -- for a memorial service and to donate his body to further Lou Gehrig's Disease research -- and he made plans to enter hospice care.<p>

One thing Noonkester did was go on "do not resuscitate" status. Since most ALS patients eventually die of lung failure, Noonkester said that if he lost his breathing ability, he did not want to be kept alive by being put on a respirator.<p>

Several months before he went on "dnr" status, he started seeing Dr. Lawrence Kline, a doctor of osteopathy. Dr. Kline helped him with breathing problems he had at night, and soon became Noonkester's primary care physician. It was under Dr. Kline's care that Noonkester enrolled in hospice care and went on "dnr" status.<p>

But on December 22, 1993, Noonkester began to have severe breathing problems. His health care aide called 911, and Noonkester was taken to the emergency room. He had a tube inserted in his throat to help him breathe. His family soon joined him at the hospital. The next day, Noonkester underwent a tracheotomy and was put on a respirator.<p>

Noonkester claimed he did not want to have surgery and that Dr. Kline was ware of this. He and his family claimed that at the time of the emergency, Noonkester tried to find out what his options were. They claim Dr. Kline said he must either have a tracheotomy or "suffocate to death." He said his consent to the surgery was a "coerced, uninformed consent under severe emotional duress."  He claimed Dr. Kline should have informed him of all his options and made him comfortable in his death. <p>

Dr. Kline contended that Noonkester changed his mind and when asked if he wanted the surgery, he gave a "thumbs up." He noted that Noonkester wasn't rushed into surgery and never indicated that he did not want it. Dr. Kline also made the point that "do not resuscitate" patients can change their status at any time and that's what Noonkester did.<p>

The jury had to decided whether Dr. Kline was negligent for not giving Noonkester the information needed for him to make an informed decision about his treatment.<p>

<b>Verdict</b><<br>
The jury found for Dr. Kline on July 8, 1996.<p>

<H2>North Carolina v. Crotts (12/95)</H2>

<P>Mark Crotts, a member of a prominent furniture family in Graham, North Carolina, stood trial a second time for the November 24, 1990, killings of  Willie and Alma Gilliam. The elderly couple was found dead in their farmhouse. </P>

<P>Arrested 10 months after the crime, Crotts was convicted in 1992 and given two life sentences. In 1993, his father, Paul Crotts, asked prominent attorney F. Lee Bailey to represent his son. </P>

<P>    
Bailey took the case, and was able to get the conviction overturned on appeal. Bailey argued that Crotts had been poorly represented at his first trial. He also argued that a jailmate of Crotts,  who testified that Crotts confessed the killings to him, had lied. </P>
During the retrial, the state's main witness again was jailmate Billy Joe Wilson. Wilson testified that Crotts visited his cell often to smoke a cigarette or marijuana. On one of those visits, Wilson said, he asked Crotts if he killed the Gilliams. </P>

<P>   
"I don't know if I did or not. I guess I did,'' Wilson recalled Crotts telling him. "I dressed up in my camouflage clothing, went down to where they live at and waited for them to go to sleep. I seen Mr. Gilliam sitting there in his chair. I went on him with my knife. I was stabbing him and his wife came in there screaming, 'Don't kill him! Don't kill him!' ''</P>
Crotts, 27, was suspected in the killings because he and Willie Gilliam had a long-standing dispute over some rental property. Crotts rented a building across the street from the Gilliam home and tried to start a taxidermy business.  But he and the Gilliams didn't get along and Crotts eventually moved the business out of the building. </P>
The defense attacked Wilson's credibility, and pointed out the lack of physical evidence linking Crotts to the killings.  Crotts had been arrested after authorities found a knife with a chipped blade in a trash pile on the former property of  Crotts' mother. The knife did not have any blood or fingerprints on it. The stab wounds suffered by the Gilliams were consistent with wounds that could have been caused by the knife. Crotts admitted that he had a knife like the one authorities discovered but said he had gotten rid of it several years earlier because the tip had broken off. </P>

<P><b> Verdict</b><br>
A mistrial was declared on December 22, 1995, after the jury reported that it was hopelessly deadlocked.</P>

<H2>Ohio v. Sutorius (6/96)</H2>

<P>Della Sutorius was the marrying type. Four of the marriages ended in divorce. The fifth ended with her husband's death.</P>

<P>She was charged with aggravated murder in the February 19, 1996,  shooting death of Dr. Darryl Sutorius, 55, a prominent heart surgeon. His body was found in the couple's suburban Symmes Township home. He had a gunshot wound to the head, and a 38-caliber handgun that Della Sutorius had bought just two days earlier was found near the body.</P>

<P>During the trial, the prosecution contended that Sutorius killed her husband because he planned to divorce her. She knew of his plans and shot him in order to inherit his estate and to collect on a $1 million life insurance policy.</P>

<P>The defense theory of the case was that Dr. Sutorius committed suicide. The jury heard from two psychiatrists who concluded that he suffered from major depression and exhibited other signs that could lead him to take his own life.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
On June 7, 1996, a jury found Sutorius guilty of aggravated murder. She was sentenced to life in prison.</P>

<H2>Random House v. Collins (2/96)</H2>

<P>It was lights, camera, action in a New York City courtroom when actress Joan Collins and publishing giant  Random House battled over a multi-million-dollar book deal.</P>

<P>The publishing firm wanted its $1.3 million advance back from Collins, claiming she failed to deliver "ready for press" books. Collins, best known for playing the scheming Alexis Carrington in the television series ''Dynasty  wanted Random House to hand over the rest of  money owed her under a $4 million deal.</P>

<P>She insisted that she turned in a novel tentatively titled "The Ruling Passion" in September 1991 and a second, "Hell Hath No Fury,'' the following  September, and that Random House never gave her the editorial assistance or guidance that it was required to provide. She also accused Random House of stringing her along, because her contract required she be paid within a year of a decision not to publish her work.</P>

<P>While most authors must return advances if a publisher rejects a manuscript. Collins's deal, negotiated by her legendary agent, the late Irving (Swifty) Lazar, contained an unusual clause -- Collins would be paid whether or not the completed manuscripts were published. </P>

<P>The dispute centered on a simple question:  what is a completed manuscript?</P>

<P>Collins's lawyers argued she had turned in the required number of words and therefore had complied with the contract.</P>

<P>At one point in her testimony, Collins described herself as the "queen of the adjectives and adverbs," but admitted that her work needed lots of editing.</P>

<P>Random House editors testified that a completed manuscript was expected to be an author's best, final effort, and should be ready for a final editing.</P>

<P>Former Random House editor Joni Evans testified that she was alarmed when she first read Collins's manuscript about two sisters fighting with one another. "It just wasn't working in any shape or form,'' said Evans, now a literary agent. ''It was no good. It was not something people on the street would read. It was dated. It wasn't grounded in reality,'' she added. ''It was dull. It was cliched in plot.''</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
On February 13, 1996, a jury decided that Collins had completed one manuscript in compliance with her contract. But Random House did not have to pay her for the second manuscript because it was merely a rehashing of the first and not a separate piece of work. </P>

<P>The verdict meant Collins could keep the advance and collect more from Random House, though how much more remained in dispute. Her lawyer, Kenneth Burroughs, said Random House should owe Collins hundreds of thousands of dollars. Random House lawyer Robert Callagy agreed that the publisher would have to pay Collins more money, but did not know how much. The contract was split evenly between the two books.</P>

<P>The trial judge subsequently ruled that Random House owed Collins an additional $1.3 million. Judge Ira Gammerman decided the publisher owed Collins $925,000 plus interest -- or a grand total of about $1.3 million. The interest was compounded from September 1991, when the actress delivered a 690-page manuscript to Random House.</P>

<H2>Roberts v. Scheriff (5/95)</H2>

<P>The atmosphere at the prestigious Denver Athletic Club turned nasty when several members of the 100-year-old facility started complaining about manager Glenn Roberts.</P>

<P>One thing led to another. First, a flier showed up in the members' lockers depicting Roberts as Hitler and Mickey Mouse.  Several subsequent fliers and cartoons accused him of racial and sexual discrimination and of financially benefiting from staff cuts at the facility.</P>

<P>Roberts, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who ran officers' clubs in the military before joining the Denver Athletic Club in 1988, sued Martin Scheriff for defamation. The suit sought $3 million in damages.</P>

<P>During the trial, Roberts testified that the fliers and cartoons harmed his reputation among club members and other club managers and caused him to develop medical problems, including high blood pressure. Roberts also accused Scheriff of calling the Internal Revenue Service suggesting that the agency investigate Roberts.</P>

<P>Scheriff, who represented himself, denied calling the IRS or having anything to do with the fliers and cartoons. He claimed Roberts targeted him because Scheriff circulated petitions calling for the disclosure of Roberts' salary and terms of his contract. In 1993, Scheriff and other members asked the club's board of directors to halt a vote to extend Roberts' contract and to obtain information on how he was paid. The board rejected the request and voted to extend Roberts' contact.</P>

<P>Several club members claimed that the athletic facilities, food and service at the club had deteriorated under Roberts' leadership.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
On June 2, 1995, a Denver district court jury awarded $5,000 to Roberts.</P>

<H2>Scholz v. Orlando Magic (2/96)</H2>

<P>George Scholz sued the Orlando Magic basketball team for racial discrimination and defamation, claiming he was fired in 1992 because the team wanted to replace him with a black assistant coach.</P>

<P>Scholz, who is white, maintained he was an assistant coach, but Magic executives insisted he was a scout and given the title of assistant coach only as a courtesy. They also maintained Scholz was paid a scout's salary. Team officials contended that they fired Scholz because he didn't get along with Magic coaches and complained about his primary task of scouting opponents.</P>

<P>About a year after Scholz was dismissed, the team hired former NBA center Tree Rollins, who is black, as an assistant coach. Rollins was picked to share his experience and playing skills with Magic star player Shaquille O'Neal, team officials said.</P>

<P>During the trial, Scholz's lawyers tried to portray the Magic as a company that plotted to fire Scholz because it was under community pressure to hire blacks. Magic executives, according to their depositions, prepared the list of NBA minority coaches and scouts after they met with the team's Community Advisory Board.</P>

<P>The advisory group had made diversity an issue because the Magic's front office and coaching staff at the time did not include any black employees.</P>
Scholz testified that former Magic coach Matt Goukas told him in July 1992 that the team fired him for racial reasons.</P>

<P>But Goukas offered a different version of the meeting. He testified that Scholz badgered him for four hours practically insisting that Guokas agree that the firing was over skin color. Guokas testified that Scholz "tried to put words in my mouth...I told him, 'Believe whatever makes you happy.' I said that in total sarcasm."</P>

<P>Guokas admitted that he was pleased with Scholz's work with the team. And Scholz's lawyers used testimony from Guokas' depositions to suggest that Magic executives pressured Guokas to fire him.</P>

<P>They pointed to one deposition in which Guokas said of the firing: "It was primarily their wish...and I had to eventually agree with it." Guokas responded that the team had legitimate reasons to fire Scholz and that he agreed with them. He said Scholz disrupted team chemistry by not getting along with the coaching staff and by complaining about his primary duty,  scouting opponents.</P>

<P>Goukas also was questioned about Scholz's job responsibilities. Goukas said Scholz was unquestionably hired as a scout and that the title of assistant coach was given only as an afterthought minutes before a news conference announcing the hiring.</P>

<P>But a former employee of the Magic's public-relations staff claimed he wrote the news release naming Scholz as an assistant coach at  least the night before the news conference.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
Judge Linda Gloeckner dismissed Scholz's lawsuit on February 9, 1996. She ruled that Scholz failed to provide enough evidence to support his claims of discrimination and defamation.</P>

<P>The judge ruled that Scholz failed to prove that race was the only cause for his termination. She said the Magic offered other explanations for the firing, and Scholz "couldn't prove that the other reasons were a pretext for racial discrimination."</P>

<P>The judge also threw out Scholz's allegation that a Magic executive made defamatory comments about him to the news media after his firing. The judge dismissed the charge, in part, because the comments did not "express malice."</P>

<P>Scholz, who now coaches at Jacksonville University in Florida, said he will appeal the judge's decision.</P>

<p><h2>St. Agathe and Wilson v. City of New York (1/95)</H2>

The estates of two teenagers who drowned at Rockaway Beach in New York sued the city and several municipal departments for negligence. The families of Anthony St. Agathe, 15, and Bugani Wilson, 14, claimed the lifeguard on duty the day the boys drowned was not properly trained or supervised.<p>

The teens and a friend Roger Vaughn went swimming on June 20, 1990. The three swam out to a depth of about chest height. But that was too far for the lifeguard on duty. Lifeguard Jack Jordan whistled to them and motioned them ashore. Vaughn heard the whistle and began to swim inland. Wilson, however, got into trouble. It was not clear whether he had a cramp, got caught in the undertow or experienced some other problem. St. Agathe, a strong swimmer, went to his assistance. Vaughn also noticed the problem and told Jordan.<p>

The plaintiffs claimed Vaughn asked Jordan to help his friends and that Jordan initially ignored the request, stating: "if they can't  f...ing swim, why did they come to the beach?"  Within minutes, St. Agathe and Wilson disappeared below the water's surface. Jordan then issued an emergency signal and the rescue effort began.<p>

The plaintiffs claimed Jordan's delay in taking appropriate action cost the teenagers their lives. The defense claimed the boys failed to heed the whistle to come in and therefore were partly responsible for their own deaths.<p>

<b>Verdict</b><br>
The jury found the city 100 percent liable and awarded the St. Agathe family $1,042,000 and the Wilsons $1,020,500.<p>

<H2>St. Claire Shores v. Provenzino (5/96)</H2>

<P>How far should society go in policing parents? Should we make parents pay for the crimes of their children? And isn't it possible for good parents to raise mixed-up kids?</P>

<P>Those were some of the questions raised in the trial of Anthony and Susan Provenzino. The working class couple was charged with violating a city of St. Claire Shores ordinance requiring them to be responsible parents. The city contended that 16-year-old Alex Provenzino got into drugs and became a burglar because his parents didn't keep a close eye on him.</P>

<P>The Provenzinos said they did the best they could under trying circumstances. They said their son started running with a bad crowd in the beginning of 1995, and his behavior immediately took a turn for the worse. He painted every wall in his room black. He started listening to different music. He started dressing all in black, and he began to show absolutely no respect for his parents. During the trial Alex testified that his parents did not know what he was doing because he took special measures to hide his criminal activitity.</P>

<P>But city attorneys wondered where the Provenzinos were when Alex was breaking into a church and his neighbors' homes. They also wondered how they did not know that he was using drugs and coming home with thousands of dollars in stolen property. The city maintained they should have gone into Alex's room when he wasn't there so they could see what he was up to. If they had done that, they clearly would have seen a live marijuana plant, a bag of marijuana and a stolen pistol.</P>

<P>Defense attorney William Buffalino countered that Provenzinos did not accompany Alex when he committed a string of burglaries, they didn't smoke marijuana with him, and they didn't condone any of his illicit activities. The only person responsible for Alex's action was Alex himself.</P>

<P><B>Verdict</B><BR>
On May 9, 1996, the jury deliberated for 30 minutes before finding the Provenzinos guilty of violating the ordinance. The Provenzinos each were ordered to pay a $100 fine and $1,000 in court costs. But the judge threw out the portion of the ordinance allowing for civil restitution. The judge determined that the ordinance was in conflict with state laws capping a parent's civil liability at $2,500 or $5,000. The city had sought $27,000 in restitution.</P>

<p><h2>Shanes-Hernandez v. Clementoni (11/94)</H2>
Gigi Shanes-Hernandez, a 37-year-old white woman employed as an employment coordinator in the Westchester (N.Y.) County Office of Employment and Training, claimed she was sexually harassed by her co-worker, Lawrence Cunningham, a black male. She said she reported each incident of harassment to her superior and to the county Office of Affirmative Action but that no action was taken. <p>

The county argued Cunningham's behavior may have been playful and inappropriate but it was not harassment. The defense also denied Shane-Hernandez's allegations that the county tried to fire her after she filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.<p>

<b>Verdict</b><br>
A federal court jury found for Shanes-Hernandez and awarded her $285,000 in compensatory damages.<p>

<H2>South Carolina v. Beckham</H2>

<P>On June 12, 1994, Vickie Lander-Beckham's body was found in her car on the
side of a road near Little Mountain, South Carolina. What first looked like a
car accident was soon discovered to be murder.</P>

<P>Beckham's car was found in a ditch just off of Mountain Road -- a place
known for having many accidents. And Beckham, 36, had died as a result of a
broken neck -- something that did not seem out of the ordinary in car wrecks. But for investigators, it just didn't fit together.</P>

<P>Her life-ending injuries appeared to be the result of a beating -- not a car crash. An autopsy revealed that Beckham had sustained several blows
to her neck. Also, police found several clues suggesting that the scene was set up to look like an accident.</P>

<P>After further examination, police thought that the car had been pushed in the ditch and that the woman had been killed before being brought there. The death was planned, and the killer must have been familiar enough with the area to know that Mountain Road was a notorious crash site -- a perfect place to stage an accident.</P>

<P>Vickie Beckham's death received a lot of media attention in her hometown of
Newberry, South Carolina. She was a mother of three children and the daughter of state Senator Jim Lander, the local Democratic representative.</P>

<P>Police arrested Richard George Anderson, 35, a bouncer at a Myrtle Beach
nightclub, and charged him with the crime. In April, Anderson pleaded guilty to
first-degree murder. He is now in prison, serving his life sentence, with the
possibility of parole after 20 years.</P>

<P>But Anderson said he didn't kill Vickie Beckham alone. Rather, he said he  was hired to do so by the victim's husband, 37-year-old Stephen Beckham. After
Anderson gave police this information, a warrant went out for Beckham's arrest.
Police could not find Beckham for three days. He allegedly took his three children on a trip through North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee and Kentucky. Police questioned Beckham's father, a prominent retired Episcopal bishop, about his son's whereabouts. He told them that his son was probably vacationing with his kids and wasn't aware of the warrant.</P>

<P>Police tracked Beckham down in Kentucky, where he and his children were
staying at the home of two Episcopalian ministers. His whereabouts were
discovered after these ministers called an ambulance because they suspected
Beckham had tried to overdose on pills. 

On July 15, 1995, Beckham surrendered to police in Kentucky, and he was brought back to South Carolina, where he was later charged with murdering his wife.</P>

<P><B>The Charges</B><BR>
Beckham faced charges of first-degree murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy to
commit murder.</P>

<P><B>The Prosecution's Case</B><BR>
Richard Anderson told the court about how Beckham allegedly approached him with the plan to kill his wife and how he carried out the murder. In detail, he described how he beat Vickie Beckham and tried to make the murder scene look like she had been killed in a car accident.</P>

<P>Crime reconstruction experts testified about how Anderson altered the
crime scene and how Vickie Beckham's injuries were not consistent with being
involved in an accident.</P>

<P>Police told the court about Beckham's claim that he was not avoiding arrest.
They said that no one who is on vacation hits six different states in two
days, as he did. Telephone, credit card, and bank
card records from these states made Beckham look like a man on the run, they said.</P>

<P>The coroner who examined the body talked about cause and time of death.
Investigators said Vickie Beckham was killed somewhere between 6 pm and 9:15 pm
on June 12, 1994 (her body was found that night at 9:30 pm). And while Stephen
Beckham claimed he was with his children during that time, investigators said his whereabouts were questionable for about 40 minutes during this time. This fact, along with Anderson's testimony, placed Beckham at the scene of the crime, they said.</P>

<P><B>The Defense's Case</B><BR>
Beckham claimed had nothing to do with his wife's death. Two of his children testified that he was at home at the hours when the police said the victim was murdered. 

<P>The defense also called DNA experts to testify that the blood found
under Vickie Beckham's fingernails did not match the blood of either Stephen
Beckham or Richard Anderson.</P>

<P><B>The Implications Of Publicity</B><BR>
Since the victim was the daughter South Carolina State Senator Jim Lander, a lot of publicity surrounded this case. A "gag order" was issued, preventing lawyers and family members from talking to the media about the case.</P>

<P><B>The Verdict</B><BR>
On Oct. 1, 1996, a jury of seven women and five men  convicted Stephen
Beckham of murder for killing his wife Vickie Beckham.</P>

<P>The verdict, which found Beckham guilty on all counts, came after the
sequestered jury deliberated for seven hours and listened to a full day of
closing arguments and jury instructions.</P> Two days later, the jury voted to
spare Beckham's life, after just over two hours of deliberation. <P>

<H2>South Carolina v. Mathis</H2>

<P>At about 2 a.m. on Oct. 20, 1995, Jerry James Brown, a carnival worker at
the annual Aiken County Jaycees' Fair, was found shot to death in a parking
lot.</P> 
<P>Nine days later, police arrested 22-year-old Troy Mathis on the basis of two
witnesses who said that Mathis left them shortly before the killing and
returned sometime later that night, allegedly admitting he had killed Brown
while he was out.</P>

<P>Mathis, who has been in jail for the last year, denied making that
statement.</P> 

<P>The only eyewitness to the shooting, Daniel O'Donnell, failed to identify
Mathis from a photo line-up after the crime. Instead, the witness identified
Terry Tyler, who was currently serving a five-year sentence for Third degree
burglary, as the shooter. The prosecution said Mathis was with Tyler that
evening. </P>

<H2>Sylvestre v. Alvarez (11/95)</H2>

<P>Wendy Sylvestre sued obstetrician Victor Alvarez and the Holmes (Florida) Regional Medical Center for negligence on behalf of her four-year-old brain-damaged daughter.</P>

<P>Sylvestre claimed the low blood sugar level that led to Ashley Gerber's brain damage was caused by an infection passed between her and her daughter prior to delivery. Sylvestre's lawyers claimed Alvarez should have warned the pediatrician caring for the child that a low- grade fever and vomiting Sylvestre had two days before she left the hospital might have been caused by an infection. If he had notified the pediatrician, they argued, Ashley could have been kept at the hospital longer and the blood sugar problem would have been detected before it caused brain damage.</P>

<P>Alvarez contended that Sylvestre and Ashley were healthy when they left the hospital, and it would have been impossible to predict the child's condition would deteriorate so quickly.</P>

<P>Sylvestre's lawsuit sought $13.45 million in damages -- enough to pay for her daughter's care for the rest of her life.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
Wendy Sylvestre received $850,000 from the Holmes Regional Medical Center. In early November, the hospital agreed to settle the case for $350,000 provided that the jury found Alvarez liable. If the jury found for Alvarez, the hospital obligated itself to pay an additional $500,000.</P>

<P>On November 15, 1995, the jury took less than an hour to decide that Alvarez was not responsible for Ashley Gerber's physical and mental retardation.</P>

<H2>Tennessee v. Ducker (10/95)</H2>

<P>Jennie Bain Ducker was charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of her children, Dustin, age 1, and Devin, age 23 months.</P>

<P>The children died of heat exposure after being left in Ducker's closed car for about eight hours on June 6, 1995. The state claimed the 20-year-old Ducker strapped the boys into their car seats and left them in the parked car while she partied with four men in a McMinnville hotel room.</P>

<P>Ducker was charged under a Tennessee statute which said a killing does not have to be deliberate or premeditated to qualify as first-degree murder if a child dies as the result of aggravated abuse. The law was subsequently changed.</P>

<P>Prosecutors argued that Ducker had made too many deliberate moves to claim her sons died by accident. For instance, she checked on the boys from the balcony of the motel room, she propped bottles in their car seats and she locked the car doors, but she did not tell anyone her boys were helplessly alone.</P>

<P>The defense argued that Ducker suffered from a mental disease which affected her judgment. A defense psychiatrist witness testified Ducker had a bipolar condition which caused major mood swings and a sleeping disorder. As a result, the defense argued, Ducker was not aware of the possible consequences of leaving her children in the car. Also, the sleeping disorder which prevented her from sleeping for more than 22 hours prior to June 6, caused her to go into a deep sleep in the motel.</P>

<P><b>Verdict:</b><br>
On October 3, 1995, a jury convicted Jennie Bain Ducker of the lesser charge -- two counts of aggravated child abuse. She was sentenced to 18 years in prison.</P>

<H2>Tennessee v. Frazier (9/95)</H2>

<P>Journalist Michael Frazier was charged with attempted murder in the "love triangle" attack on the allegedly abusive husband of his lover.</P>

<P>Frazier was accused of plotting with lover Lisa Whedbee - about whom he'd written an award-winning Mother's Day story in 1993 - to kill her husband, John Whedbee. </P>

<P>The two were arrested after Whedbee was attacked by a knife-wielding assailant as he was sleeping in his home on June 8, 1994. </P>

<P>During the trial, prosecutors tried to portray Frazier as someone who wanted another man's wife so badly he was willing to kill for her. </P>

<P>The defense contended that Frazier, 33, was in love with Lisa Whedbee, a member of the church choir that Frazier directed and the subject of an award-winning Mother's Day article he wrote in 1993 while a reporter for The Oak Ridger. </P>

<P>Because of that love, Frazier was driven to an admittedly "bizarre" extreme to protect her from alleged beatings and abuse by her husband. </P>

<P>There was conflicting testimony on abuse allegedly committed by Whedbee. He denied it in court. Police officers called to the Whedbee home failed to see signs of it. Friends of Lisa Whedbee saw bruises but not the abuse itself. </P>

<P>Prosecutors suggested that Frazier was manipulated by Lisa Whedbee, who didn't testify during the trial. She faces a separate trial on conspiracy and attempted- murder charges. The state argued that she was motivated by her husband's $1 million in life insurance and desire to keep her family, home and possessions. </P>

<P>During the trial, Frazier admitted to putting on surgical gloves and dark clothes, riding with Lisa Whedbee to her home and hiding in a closet for hours until she came for him, handed him a knife and led him to the bedroom of her sleeping husband. But Frazier testified that he never intended to kill John Whedbee.</P>

<P>"When I saw him in that light (from a window) I realized this was crazy, that I couldn't kill him. This wasn't the horrible monster. It was just a man lying in his bed. I couldn't kill him."</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
On September 16, 1995, a jury convicted Michael Frazier of attempted manslaughter. The jury's verdict was the least of three possible offenses before them, including attempted first-degree murder. Frazier received the maximum sentence, four years in prison.</P>

<P><h2>Tennessee v. Roe (7/96)</h2>
John Roe, a former Memphis police officer, was charged in the fatal shooting of his wife.<p>

Roe was accused of shooting Lisa Michelle Roe, 24, on September 16, 1994, at the couple's home. Lisa, a radiology student, had told friends that her husband was abusive and had threatened to kill her. The day before she was murdered, she told friends to call her parents and authorities if she did not show up for work the next day.<p>

The defense contended Roe was insane at the time of the shooting. Since Roe refused to cooperate with court orders concerning psychiatric evaluations the defense could not use expert testimony about Roe's mental state. Instead, it relied on the testimony of witnesses who said Roe looked and acted weird after the shooting.<p>

<b>Verdict</b><br>
Roe was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.<p>

<P><h2>Tennessee v. Tate and Blades (7/96)</h2>

<A href=/report/tate.html> George Tate and Rodney Blades</a> were charged with first-degree murder in the stabbing death of a prominent Memphis woman.<p>

Emily Klyce Fisher, who was well known in Memphis for her involvement in charities and the arts, died of multiple stab wounds on February 27, 1995, after she and her elderly maid were attacked in Fisher's home. <p>

The assailants ransacked the home and made off with money and Fisher's 1994 Ford Taurus. The car was found abandoned a day later in north Memphis. Blades's fingerprints reportedly were found in the car. Blades told police he took items from the car, but had nothing to do with the murder. Authorities never found the murder weapon.<p>

The maid, 81-year-old Leester Redmond, identified the defendants as the assailants through photographs and a line-up in a videotaped statement.<p>

But the judge that Redmond was not competent to testify at the trial, so prosecutors were forced to rely on the videotaped statement.<p>

The defense challenged the credibility of the identification. Defense lawyers also presented evidence that DNA of a blood sample taken from the crime scene did not belong to either defendant or the victims.<p>

<b>Verdict</b><br>
On July 24, 1996, Tate and Blades were acquitted of all charges.<P>

<H2>Texas v. Lucas (11/94)</H2>

<P>Steven Baker Lucas was retried for the June 5, 1988 murder of his 
millionaire mother. The state claimed Lucas bludgeoned 66-year-old Bette Lucas to death -- possibly with a brass candlestick -- for 
money. The state introduced evidence showing Lucas, 49, was having 
financial troubles at the time of his mother's death. He owed more 
than $500,000 to creditors and his oil company was going out of 
business. At the same time, Bette Lucas was refusing to lend her 
son anymore money and she controlled his father's estate.</P>

<P>The defense argued that Bette Lucas accidentally fell over a 
second-story banister and down a flight of steps in her home 
after she and her son struggled over a 30-pound plus 
videocassette recorder. The defense conceded that Lucas needed 
money but that his financial situation was not as serious as the 
state claimed. The first trial in 1991 ended in a mistrial after 
the jury deadlocked 8-4 to find him guilty of murder.</P>

<P><B>Verdict</B><BR>
On November 22, 1994, a jury found Lucas guilty of first-degree 
murder. He was sentenced to 35 years in prison and assessed the 
maximum fine of $10,000.</P>

<H2>Tuomala v. Regent University (8/95)</H2>

<P>Three professors asked a court to interpret their contracts with Regent University in Virgina Beach, Virginia. The professors claimed their contracts entitled them to annual renewal unless the university determined that they breached the contract. The university, a Christian school founded by Pat Robertson, claimed the three-year rolling contract permitted the school to change its terms.</P>

<P>In May 1994, the university offered the professors a contract significantly different from the one that they had been offered in the past. The three professors refused to sign the contarct and brought the legal action.</P>

<P>A judge was asked to determine whether the professors have a type of tenure entitling them to a renewal of the original contract or whether the university has the right to change the terms even if they are satisified with the professors' performance.</P>

<P><b>Verdict</b><br>
Judge Edward Hanson ruled in favor of the university on August 29, 1995.</P>

<H2>Turner v. Dolcefino</H2>



<P>In October 1991, Sylvester Turner was in a close race for mayor of Houston. He claimed that he was on the verge of becoming the city's first black mayor. But one week before the election Houston's KTRK-Channel 13's Wayne Dolcefino reported that an unidentified source had linked Turner to Sylvester Foster, a man who faked his own death in a 1986 insurance scheme.</P>



<P>Turner claimed the story was false and reported with reckless disregard for the truth. He said the story was designed to impeach his honesty, integrity, virtue and reputation and expose him to public hatred, contempt and ridicule. He asked for $10 million to $15 million in actual damages and a similar amount for exemplary damages.</P>



<P>The defense claimed the story was true and that Dolcefino properly researched it. The story merely asked questions about Turner's involvement and  did not definitively say Turner knew about the scam. The defense also said that other news organizations published and aired negative stories that may have damaged Turner's reputation and cost him the election.</P>



<P><B>The Verdict</B><BR>

On Oct. 14, 1996, a jury awarded Turner $5.5 million in damages.</P>

<p><H2>Twiggs v. Mays (8/93)</H2>

The custody battle over 14-year-old Kimberly Mays who was switched at birth with another child.<p>

Ernest and Regina Twigg asked a Florida judge to declare Kimberly their biological daughter and to award them visitation rights.

Kimberly wanted the judge to terminate the Twiggs' parental rights so that she could stay with Mays.<p>

<b>Verdict</b><br>
The judged ruled the Twiggs had no legal rights to Kimberly. The decision cleared the way for Mays to adopt her.<p>

<p><h2>Van Houten Parole Hearing (1992 and 1996)</H2>
Leslie Van Houten is considered a model prisoner. During her more than two decades in prison, she has earned a college degree, quit drugs and alcohol, received glowing reports from supervisors and psychiatrists and renounced any affiliation with Charles Manson and his family.<p>

But should she be released from prison?<p>

Van Houten, who is serving a life sentence, asked  the parole board to judge her on her actions in the last 25 years and not just those two nights in August 1969. She was convicted of first-degree murder in the slayings of Los Angeles businesssman Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary, and conspiracy in the deaths of Sharon Tate and four others.<p>

The state opposed parole, arguing the Manson murders were among the worst in this country's history and that society simply does not want anyone involved released from prison.<p>

<b>Verdict</b><br>
Van Houten was denied parole. <p>

<b>Verdict</b><br>
Brooks was found guilty of three counts of involuntary manslaughter. He was sentenced to four years in prison and six years probation.<p>

<H2>Weeks v. Baker & McKenzie and Greenstein (8/94)</H2>

<P>Rena Weeks sued the world's largest law firm and a former partner for sexual harassment. Weeks, who worked as Martin Greenstein's secretary in 1991, accused the intellectual property specialist of verbally and physically abusing her.  The incidents, she said, included his dropping candies in the pocket of her blouse and asking her which of her breasts was bigger. She claimed the firm of Baker & McKenzie ignored Greenstein's repeated harassment of other women.</P>

<P>Greenstein denied harassing Weeks but did concede during the trial that he believed two former female employees who said he harassed them. Baker & McKenzie argued that even if Weeks was abused, she suffered minimal damages. The defense also claimed Weeks' psychological problems are due more to a head injury she suffered as an adolescent than Greenstein's alleged behavior. Since Weeks voluntarily left the firm, the defense contended she was not entitled to economic damages due to job loss. The firm also claimed it asked Greenstein to resign because of the pattern of alleged abuse and because he was back-dating forms involving his copyright practice.</P>

<P><B>Verdict</b><br>
On August 26, 1994, a San Francisco jury ruled Greenstein had harassed Weeks, and the law firm failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the harassment. She was awarded $50,000 in compensatory damages.  On September 1, 1994, the jury awarded her $7.1 million in punitive damages. The law firm was ordered to pay  $6.9 million and Greenstein, $225,000. The award was believed to be the largest in a sexual harassment case in California.</P>

<P>In a post-trial ruling on November 28, Judge John Munter ruled that the jury's $6.9 million punitive damage award against the firm was excessive, but that he would affirm a $3.5 million punitive award if the plaintiff consented.  The judge, noting that Weeks' counsel Philip Kay had asked for $3.5 million in his closing argument, said he would order a new trial on punitive damages unless Weeks accepted the lesser amount.</P>

<H2>Zion v. New York Hospital (2/95)</H2>

<P>Sidney Zion sued New York Hospital and four doctors for medical 
malpractice for the alleged wrongful death of his daughter in 
1984. The plaintiff argued that Libby Zion's death was caused by 
the negligence of doctors who gave her the drug Demerol which can 
be fatal when taken with Nardil, an anti-depressant, that Libby 
Zion told doctors she was taking.  The defense argued Libby Zion 
failed to tell doctors that she used cocaine and other 
prescription drugs and that this prevented them from providing
appropriate care.</P>

<P><B>Verdict</B><BR>
On February 6, 1995, a New York jury found that three of the four doctors were
negligent by giving Demerol to Libby Zion. But the jury also found that Libby
Zion was 50 percent responsible for her own death because she did not tell
doctors that she had taken cocaine and other prescription drugs. The jury
ruled the doctors must pay $375,000 to the Zion family for pain and suffering
but did not award any punitive damages. The jury cleared New York Hospital of
any wrongdoing, saying its system of training and supervising  young doctors
did not depart from accepted medical practice.</P>

<P>In a post-trial ruling, Judge Elliott Wilk set aside part of the jury's
verdict. The judge ruled on May 1, 1995 that the jury improperly heard
evidence about Libby Zion's cocaine use. As a result, he threw out the jury's
finding that Libby Zion was 50 percent responsible for her death.</P>

<P>The judge upheld the portion of the verdict relating to the negligence of
the three New York Hospital doctors. While Zion said the judge's ruling
vindicated his daughter's reputation, the defendants also won a 50 percent
reduction in the jury's total award for Libby Zion's pain and suffering of
$750,000, which lawyers argued was excessive. Under the jury's verdict, only
half the award, $375,000, could be collected by Zion because Libby Zion was
found 50 percent responsible for her own death. By cutting the total damages
in half and clearing the family of liability, Judge Wilk maintained the
doctors' damage award at $375,000.</P>

Punitive damages awarded in a personal injury lawsuit  are taxable, 
according to this  Dec. 10, 1996, U.S. Supreme Court ruling. The case 
involved the family of a woman who died of toxic shock syndrome in 
1983. The family won a punitive damage award of $10 million  in a 
product liability suit against International Playtex  Inc, the manufacturer of 
the tampons the woman used.  At issue was a section of the Internal 
Revenue Code that excludes from its definition of gross income any 
damages received  "on account of personal injuries or sickness." The 
ruling  was a victory for the U.S. Justice Department, which argued that 
the damages should be taxed. </p>

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
Syllabus 
 
 
O'GILVIE ET AL., MINORS 
 
v. 
 
UNITED STATES 
 
 
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR 
THE TENTH CIRCUIT  
 
No. 95-966.   Argued October 9, 1996--Decided December 10, 1996*  
 
Petitioners, the husband and two children of a woman who died of toxic 
shock syndrome, received a jury award of $1,525,000 actual damages and 
$10 million punitive damages in a tort suit based on Kansas law against 
the maker of the product that caused decedent's death.  They paid federal 
income tax insofar as the award's proceeds represented punitive damages, 
but immediately sought a refund. Procedurally speaking, this litigation 
represents the consolidation of two cases brought in the same Federal 
District Court: the husband's suit against the Government for a refund, and 
the Government's suit against the children to recover the refund that the 
Government had made to the children earlier.  The District Court found for 
petitioners under 26 U. S. C. Sec. 104(a)(2), which, as it read in 1988, 
excluded from "gross income," the "amount of any damages received . . . 
on account of personal injuries or sickness."  (Emphasis added.)  The court 
held on the merits that the italicized language includes punitive damages, 
thereby excluding such damages from gross income. The Tenth Circuit 
reversed, holding that the exclusionary provision does not cover punitive 
damages.  
 
Held: 
 
1.  Petitioners' punitive damages were not received "on account of" 
personal injuries; hence the gross-income-exclusion provision does not 
apply and the damages are taxable.  Pp. 2-11.  
 
(a) Although the phrase "on account of" does not unambiguously define 
itself, several factors prompt this Court to agree with the Government 
when it interprets the exclusionary provision to apply to those personal 
injury lawsuit damages that were awarded by reason of, or because of, the 
personal injuries, and not to punitive damages that do not compensate 
injury, but are private fines levied by civil juries to punish reprehensible 
conduct and to deter its future occurrence.  For one thing, the 
Government's interpretation gives the phrase "on account of" a meaning 
consistent with the dictionary definition.  More important, in 
Commissioner v. Schleier, 515 U. S. ___, this Court came close to 
resolving the statute's ambiguity in the Government's favor when it said 
that the statute covers pain and suffering damages, medical expenses, and 
lost wages in an ordinary tort case because they are "designed to 
compensate . . . victims," id., at ___, n. 5, but does not apply to elements 
of damages that are "punitive in nature," id., at ___.  The Government's 
reading also is more faithful to the statutory provision's history and basic 
tax-related purpose of excluding compensatory damages that restore a 
victim's lost, nontaxable "capital." Petitioners suggest no very good reason 
why Congress might have wanted the exclusion to have covered these 
punitive damages, which are not a substitute for any normally untaxed 
personal (or financial) quality, good, or "asset" and do not compensate for 
any kind of loss.  Pp. 2-8.  
 
 
(b) Petitioners' three arguments to the 
contrary--that certain words or phrases in the original, or current, version 
of the statute work in their favor; that the exclusion of punitive damages 
from gross income may be justified by Congress' desire to be generous to 
tort victims and to avoid such administrative problems as separating 
punitive from compensatory portions of a global settlement or determining 
the extent to which a punitive damages award is itself intended to 
compensate; and that their position is supported by a 1989 statutory 
amendment that specifically says that the gross income exclusion does not 
apply to any punitive damages in connection with a case not involving 
physical injury or sickness--are not sufficiently persuasive to overcome the 
Government's interpretation.  Pp. 8-11.  
 
2.  Petitioners' two case-specific procedural arguments--that the 
Government's lawsuit was untimely and that its original notice of appeal 
was filed a few days late--are rejected.  Pp. 12-14. 66 F. 3d 1550, affirmed.  
 
BREYER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which REHNQUIST, 
C. J., and STEVENS, KENNEDY, SOUTER, and GINSBURG, JJ., 
joined.  SCALIA, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which O'CONNOR and 
THOMAS, JJ., joined.  
 
*Together with No. 95-977, O'Gilvie v. United States, also on certiorari to 
the same court.

95-977 
 
v. 
 
UNITED STATES 
 
 
ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 
APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT  
 
[December 10, 1996] 
 
JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.  
 
Internal Revenue Code Sec. 104(a)(2), as it read in 1988, excluded from 
"gross income," the "amount of any damages received (whether by suit or 
agreement and whether as lump sums or as periodic payments) on account 
of personal injuries or sickness."  26 U. S. C. Sec. 104(a)(2) (1988 ed.) 
(emphasis added).  
 
The issue before us is whether this provision applies to (and thereby 
makes nontaxable) punitive damages received by a plaintiff in a tort suit 
for personal injuries.  We conclude that the punitive damages received 
here were not received "on account of" personal injuries; hence the 
provision does not apply and the damages are taxable.  
 
 
Petitioners in this litigation are the husband and two children of Betty 
O'Gilvie, who died in 1983 of toxic shock syndrome.  Her husband, Kelly, 
brought a tort suit (on his own behalf and that of her estate) based on 
Kansas law against the maker of the product that caused Betty O'Gilvie's 
death.  Eventually, he and the two children received the net proceeds of a 
jury award of $1,525,000 actual damages and $10 million punitive 
damages.  Insofar as the proceeds represented punitive damages, 
petitioners paid income tax on the proceeds but immediately sought a 
refund.  
 
The litigation before us concerns petitioners' legal entitlement to that 
refund.  Procedurally speaking, the litigation represents the consolidation 
of two cases brought in the same Federal District Court: Kelly's suit 
against the Government for a refund, and the Government's suit against the 
children to recover the refund that the Government had made to the 
children earlier.  26 U. S. C. Sec. 7405(b) (authorizing suits by the United 
States to recover refunds erroneously made).  The Federal District Court 
held on the merits that the statutory phrase "damages. . . on account of 
personal injury or sickness," includes punitive damages, thereby excluding 
punitive damages from gross income and entitling Kelly to obtain, and the 
children to keep, their refund.  The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, 
however, reversed the District Court. Along with the Fourth, Ninth and 
Federal Circuits, it held that the exclusionary provision does not cover 
punitive damages.  Because the Sixth Circuit has held the contrary, the 
Circuits are divided about the proper interpretation of the provision.  We 
granted certiorari to resolve this conflict.  
 
 
Petitioners received the punitive damages at issue here "by suit,"--indeed 
"by" an ordinary "suit" for "personal injuries."  Contrast United States v. 
Burke, 504 U. S. 229 (1992) (Sec. 104(a)(2) exclusion not applicable to 
backpay awarded under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because 
the claim was not based upon "'tort or tort type rights,'" id., at 233); 
Commissioner v. Schleier, 515 U. S. ___ (1995) (alternative holding) (Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) claim is similar to 
Title VII claim in Burke in this respect).  These legal circumstances bring 
those damages within the gross-income-exclusion provision, however, 
only if the petitioners also "received" those damages "on account of " the 
"personal injuries."  And the phrase "on account of" does not 
unambiguously define itself.  
 
On one linguistic interpretation of those words, that of petitioners, they 
require no more than a "but-for" connection between "any" damages and a 
lawsuit for personal injuries.  They would thereby bring virtually all 
personal injury lawsuit damages within the scope of the provision, since: 
"but for the personal injury, there would be no lawsuit, and but for the 
lawsuit, there would be no damages."  
 
On the Government's alternative interpretation, however, those words 
impose a stronger causal connection, making the provision applicable only 
to those personal injury lawsuit damages that were awarded by reason of, 
or because of, the personal injuries.  To put the matter more specifically, 
they would make the section inapplicable to punitive damages, where 
those damages  
 
"'are not compensation for injury [but] [i]nstead . . . are private fines levied 
by civil juries to punish reprehensible conduct and to deter its future 
occurrence.'" Electrical Workers v. Foust, 442 U. S. 42, 48 (1979), quoting 
Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 350 (1974) (footnote omitted).  
 
The Government says that such damages were not "received . . . on 
account of" the personal injuries, but rather were awarded "on account of" 
a defendant's reprehensible conduct and the jury's need to punish and to 
deter it.  Hence, despite some historical uncertainty about the matter, see 
Rev. Rul. 75-45, 1975-1 Cum. Bull. 47, revoked by Rev. Rul. 84-108, 
1984-2 Cum. Bull. 32, the Government now concludes that these punitive 
damages fall outside the statute's coverage.  
 
We agree with the Government's interpretation of the statute.  For one 
thing, its interpretation gives the phrase "on account of" a meaning 
consistent with the dictionary definition.  See, e.g., Webster's Third New 
International Dictionary 13 (1981) ("for the sake of: by reason of: because 
of").  
 
More important, in Schleier, supra, we came close to resolving the statute's 
ambiguity in the Government's favor.  That case did not involve damages 
received in an ordinary tort suit; it involved liquidated damages and 
backpay received in a settlement of a lawsuit charging a violation of the 
Age Discrimination in Employment Act. Nonetheless, in deciding one of 
the issues there presented (whether the provision now before us covered 
ADEA liquidated damages), we contrasted the elements of an ordinary tort 
recovery with ADEA liquidated damages.  We said that pain and suffering 
damages, medical expenses, and lost wages in an ordinary tort case are 
covered by the statute and hence excluded from income "not simply 
because the taxpayer received a tort settlement, but rather because each 
element . . . satisfies the requirement . . . that the damages were received 
'on account of personal injuries or sickness.'"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6-7).  
 
In holding that ADEA liquidated damages are not covered, we said that 
they are not "designed to compensate ADEA victims," id., at ___, n. 5 
(slip op., at 9, n. 5); instead, they are "'punitive in nature,'" id., at ___ (slip 
op., at 8) (quoting Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 
125 (1985)).  
 
Applying the same reasoning here would lead to the conclusion that the 
punitive damages are not covered because they are an element of damages 
not "designed to compensate . . . victims," Schleier, 515 U. S., at ___ (slip 
op., at 9, n. 5); rather they are "'punitive in nature.'"  Ibid.  Although we 
gave other reasons for our holding in Schleier as well, we explicitly 
labeled this reason an "independent" ground in support of our decision, id., 
at ___ (slip op., at 11).  We cannot accept petitioners' claim that it was 
simply a dictum.  
 
We also find the Government's reading more faithful to the history of the 
statutory provision as well as the basic tax-related purpose that the history 
reveals.  That history begins in approximately 1918.  At that time, this 
Court had recently decided several cases based on the principle that a 
restoration of capital was not income; hence it fell outside the definition of 
"income" upon which the law imposed a tax.  E.g., Doyle v. Mitchell 
Brothers Co., 247 U. S. 179, 187 (1918); Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, 
247 U. S. 330, 335 (1918).  The Attorney General then advised the 
Secretary of the Treasury that proceeds of an accident insurance policy 
should be treated as nontaxable because they primarily "substitute . . . 
capital which is the source of future periodical income . . . merely tak[ing] 
the place of capital in human ability which was destroyed by the accident.  
They are therefore [nontaxable] 'capital' as distinguished from 'income' 
receipts."  31 Op. Atty. Gen. 304, 308 (1918).  
 
The Treasury Department added that 
 
"upon similar principles . . . an amount received by an individual as the 
result of a suit or compromise for personal injuries sustained by him 
through accident is not income [that is] taxable. . . ."  T. D.  
 
2747, 20 Treas. Dec. Int. Rev. 457 (1918).  
 
Soon thereafter, Congress enacted the first predecessor of the provision 
before us.  That provision excluded from income  
 
"[a]mounts received, through accident or health insurance or under 
workmen's compensation acts, as compensation for personal injuries or 
sickness, plus the amount of any damages received whether by suit or 
agreement on account of such injuries or sickness."  Revenue Act of 1918, 
ch. 18, Sec. 213(b)(6), 40 Stat. 1066.  
 
The provision is similar to the cited materials from the Attorney General 
and the Secretary of the Treasury in language and structure, all of which 
suggests that Congress sought, in enacting the statute, to codify the 
Treasury's basic approach.  A contemporaneous House Report, insofar as 
relevant, confirms this similarity of approach, for it says:  
 
"Under the present law it is doubtful whether amounts received through 
accident or health insurance, or under workmen's compensation acts, as 
compensation for personal injury or sickness, and damages received on 
account of such injuries or sickness, are required to be included in gross 
income.  The proposed bill provides that such amounts shall not be 
included in gross income."  H. R. Rep. No. 767, pp. 9-10 (1918).  
 
This history and the approach it reflects suggest there is no strong reason 
for trying to interpret the statute's language to reach beyond those damages 
that, making up for a loss, seek to make a victim whole, or, speaking very 
loosely, "return the victim's personal or financial capital."  
 
We concede that the original provision's language does go beyond what 
one might expect a purely tax-policy-related "human capital" rationale to 
justify.  That is because the language excludes from taxation not only 
those damages that aim to substitute for a victim's physical or personal 
well-being--personal assets that the Government does not tax and would 
not have taxed had the victim not lost them. It also excludes from taxation 
those damages that substitute, say, for lost wages, which would have been 
taxed had the victim earned them.  To that extent, the provision can make 
the compensated taxpayer better off from a tax perspective than had the 
personal injury not taken place.  
 
But to say this is not to support cutting the statute totally free from its 
original moorings in victim loss. The statute's failure to separate those 
compensatory elements of damages (or accident insurance proceeds) one 
from the other does not change its original focus upon damages that 
restore a loss, that seek to make a victim whole, with a tax-equality 
objective providing an important part of, even if not the entirety of, the 
statute's rationale.  All this is to say that the Government's interpretation of 
the current provision (the wording of which has not changed significantly 
from the original) is more consistent than is petitioners' with the statute's 
original focus.  
 
Finally, we have asked why Congress might have wanted the exclusion to 
have covered these punitive damages, and we have found no very good 
answer.  Those damages are not a substitute for any normally untaxed 
personal (or financial) quality, good, or "asset."  They do not compensate 
for any kind of loss.  The statute's language does not require, or strongly 
suggest, their exclusion from income.  And we can find no evidence that 
congressional generosity or concern for administrative convenience 
stretched beyond the bounds of an interpretation that would distinguish 
compensatory from noncompensatory damages.  
 
Of course, as we have just said, from the perspective of tax policy one 
might argue that noncompensatory punitive damages and, for example, 
compensatory lost wages are much the same thing.  That is, in both 
instances, exclusion from gross income provides the taxpayer with a 
windfall.  This circumstance alone, however, does not argue strongly for 
an interpretation that covers punitive damages, for coverage of 
compensatory damages has both language and history in its favor to a 
degree that coverage of noncompensatory punitive damages does not.  
Moreover, this policy argument assumes that coverage of lost wages is 
something of an anomaly; if so, that circumstance would not justify the 
extension of the anomaly or the creation of another.  See Wolfman, 
Current Issues of Federal Tax Policy, 16 U. Ark. Little Rock L. J. 543, 
549-550 (1994) ("[T]o build upon" what is, from a tax policy perspective, 
the less easily explained portion "of the otherwise rational exemption for 
personal injury," simply "does not make sense").  
 
Petitioners make three sorts of arguments to the contrary.  First, they 
emphasize certain words or phrases in the original, or current, provision 
that work in their favor.  For example, they stress the word "any" in the 
phrase "any damages."  And they note that in both original and current 
versions Congress referred to certain amounts of money received (from 
workmen's compensation, for example) as "amounts received . . . as 
compensation," while here they refer only to "damages received" without 
adding the limiting phrase "as compensation."  26 U. S. C. Sec. 104(a); 
Revenue Act of 1918, Sec. 213(b)(6), 40 Stat. 1066. They add that in the 
original version, the words "on account of personal injuries" might have 
referred to, and modified, the kind of lawsuit, not the kind of damages. 
And they find support for this view in the second sentence of the Treasury 
Regulation first adopted in 1958 which says:  
 
"The term 'damages received (whether by suit or agreement' means an 
amount received (other than workmen's compensation) through 
prosecution of a legal suit or action based upon tort or tort type rights, or 
through a settlement agreement entered into in lieu of such prosecution."  
26 CFR Sec. 1.104-1(c) (1996).  
 
These arguments, however, show only that one can reasonably read the 
statute's language in different ways--the very assumption upon which our 
analysis rests. They do not overcome our interpretation of the provision in 
Schleier, nor do they change the provision's history.  The help that the 
Treasury Regulation's second sentence gives the petitioners is offset by its 
first sentence, which says that the exclusion applies to damages received 
"on account of personal injuries or sickness," and which we have held sets 
forth an independent requirement.  Schleier, 515 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 
14).  See Appendix, infra, at 16.  
 
Second, petitioners argue that to some extent the purposes that might have 
led Congress to exclude, say, lost wages from income would also have led 
Congress to exclude punitive damages, for doing so is both generous to 
victims and avoids such administrative problems as separating punitive 
from compensatory portions of a global settlement or determining the 
extent to which a punitive damages award is itself intended to compensate.  
 
Our problem with these arguments is one of degree. Tax generosity 
presumably has its limits.  The administrative problem of distinguishing 
punitive from compensatory elements is likely to be less serious than, say, 
distinguishing among the compensatory elements of a settlement (which 
difficulty might account for the statute's treatment of, say, lost wages).  Cf. 
supra p. 8. And, of course, the problem of identifying the elements of an 
ostensibly punitive award does not exist where, as here, relevant state law 
makes clear that the damages at issue are not at all compensatory, but 
entirely punitive.  Brewer v. Home-Stake Production Co., 200 Kan. 96, 
100, 434 P. 2d 828, 831 (1967) ("[E]xemplary damages are not regarded 
as compensatory in any degree"); accord, Smith v. Printup, 254 Kan. 315, 
866 P. 2d 985 (1993); Folks v. Kansas Power & Light Co., 243 Kan. 57, 
755 P. 2d 1319 (1988); Nordstrom v. Miller, 227 Kan. 59, 605 P. 2d 545 
(1980).  
 
Third, petitioners rely upon a later enacted law.  In 1989, Congress 
amended the law so that it now specifically says the personal injury 
exclusion from gross income  
 
"shall not apply to any punitive damages in connection with a case not 
involving physical injury or physical sickness." 26 U. S. C. Sec. 104(a) 
(1994).  
 
Why, petitioners ask, would Congress have enacted this amendment 
removing punitive damages (in nonphysical injury cases) unless Congress 
believed that, in the amendment's absence, punitive damages did fall 
within the provision's coverage?  
 
The short answer to this question is that Congress might simply have 
thought that the then-current law about the provision's treatment of 
punitive damages--in cases of physical and nonphysical injuries--was 
unclear, that it wanted to clarify the matter in respect to nonphysical 
injuries, but it wanted to leave the law where it found it in respect to 
physical injuries.  The fact that the law was indeed uncertain at the time 
supports this view.  Compare Rev. Rul. 84-108, 1984-2 Cum. Bull. 32, 
with e.g., Roemer v. Commissioner, 716 F. 2d 693 (CA9 1983); Miller v. 
Commissioner, 93 T. C. 330 (1989), rev'd 914 F. 2d 586 (CA4 1990).  
 
The 1989 amendment's legislative history, insofar as relevant, offers 
further support.  The amendment grew out of the Senate's refusal to agree 
to a House bill that would have made all damages in nonphysical personal 
injury cases taxable.  The Senate was willing to specify only that the 
Government could tax punitive damages in such cases. Compare H. R. 
Rep. No. 101-247, p. 1355 (1989), with H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 101-386, pp. 
622-623 (1989).  Congress' primary focus, in other words, was upon what 
to do about nonphysical personal injuries, not upon the provision's 
coverage of punitive damages under pre-existing law.  
 
We add that, in any event, the view of a later Congress cannot control the 
interpretation of an earlier enacted statute.  United States v. Price, 361 U. 
S. 304 (1960); Higgins v. Smith, 308 U. S. 473 (1940).  But cf. Burke, 504 
U. S., at 235, n. 6 (including a passing reference to the 1989 amendment, 
in dicta, as support for a view somewhat like that of petitioners).  
 
(Although neither party has argued that it is relevant, we note in passing 
that Sec. 1605 of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, Pub. L. 
104-188, 110 Stat. 1838, explicitly excepts most punitive damages from 
the exclusion provided by Sec. 104(a)(2).  Because it is of prospective 
application, the section does not apply here. The Conference Report on the 
new law says that "[n]o inference is intended" as to the proper 
interpretation of section 104(a)(2) prior to amendment.  H. R. Conf. Rep. 
No. 104-737, p. 301 (1996).)  
 
The upshot is that we do not find petitioners' arguments sufficiently 
persuasive.  And, for the reasons set out above, supra, at 3-8, we agree 
with the Government's interpretation of the statute.  
 
 
Petitioners have raised two further issues, specific to the procedural 
posture of this litigation.  First, the O'Gilvie children point out that the 
Government had initially accepted their claim for a refund and wrote those 
checks on July 6, 1990.  The Government later changed its mind and, on 
July 9, 1992, two years plus three days later, filed suit against them 
seeking the return of a refund erroneously made.  26 U. S. C. Sec. 7405(b) 
(authorizing a "civil action brought in the name of the United States" to 
recover any "portion of a tax . . . which has been erroneously refunded").  
They add that the relevant statute of limitations specifies that recovery of 
the refund "shall be allowed only if such suit is begun within 2 years after 
the making of such refund."  Sec. 6532(b).  
 
The children concede that they received the refund checks on July 9, 1990, 
and they agree that if the limitation period runs from the date of receipt--if, 
as the Government argues, that is the date of the "making of" the refund--
the Government's suit was timely.  But the children say that the refund was 
made on, and the limitations period runs from, the date the Government 
mailed the checks (presumably July 6, 7, or 8) in which case the 
Government brought this suit one or two or three days too late.  
 
In our view, the Government is correct in its claim that its lawsuit was 
timely.  The language of the statute admits of both interpretations.  But the 
law ordinarily provides that an action to recover mistaken payments of 
money "accrues upon the receipt of payment," New Bedford v. Lloyd 
Investment Associates, Inc., 363 Mass. 112, 119, 292 N. E. 2d 688, 692 
(1973); accord Sizemore v. E. T. Barwick Industries, Inc., 225 Tenn. 226, 
233, 465 S. W. 2d 873, 876 (1971) ("'the time of making the . . . payment . 
. . was the date of actual receipt'"), unless, as in some States and in some 
cases, it accrues upon the still later date of the mistake's discovery, see 
Allen & Lamkin, When Statute of Limitations Begins to Run Against 
Action to Recover Money Paid By Mistake, 79 A. L. R. 3d 754, 766-769 
(1977). We are not aware of any good reason why Congress would have 
intended a different result where the nature of the claim is so similar to a 
traditional action for money paid by mistake--an action the roots of which 
can be found in the old common-law claim of "assumpsit" or "money had 
and received."  New Bedford, supra, at 118.  The lower courts and 
commentators have reached a similar conclusion.  United States v. Carter, 
906 F. 2d 1375 (CA9 1990); Akers v. United States, 541 F. Supp. 65, 67 
(M. D. Tenn. 1981); United States v. Woodmansee, 388 F. Supp. 36, 46 
(N. D. Cal. 1975), rev'd on other grounds, 578 F. 2d 1302 (CA9 1978); 14 
J. Mertens Law of Federal Income Taxation Sec. 54A.69 (1995); Kafka & 
Cavanagh, Litigation of Federal Civil Tax Controversies Sec. 20.03, p. 20-
15 (2d ed. 1995). That conclusion is consistent with dicta in an earlier case 
from this Court, United States v. Wurts, 303 U. S. 414, 417-418 (1938), as 
well as with this Court's normal practice of construing ambiguous statutes 
of limitations in Government action in the Government's favor.  E.g., 
Badaracco v. Commissioner, 464 U. S. 386, 391 (1984).  
 
We concede the children's argument that a "date of mailing" interpretation 
produces marginally greater certainty, for such a rule normally would refer 
the court to the postmark to establish the date.  But there is no indication 
that a "date of receipt" rule has proved difficult to administer in ordinary 
state or common-law actions for money paid erroneously.  The date the 
check clears, after all, sets an outer bound.  
 
Second, Kelly O'Gilvie says that the Court of Appeals should not have 
considered the Government's original appeal from the District Court's 
judgment in his favor because, in his view, the Government filed its notice 
of appeal a few days too late.  The Court of Appeals describes the 
circumstances underlying this case-specific issue in its opinion.  We agree 
with its determination of the matter for the reasons it has there set forth.  
 
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.  
 
 
APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT 
 
Section 104(a), in 1988, read as follows:  
 
"Compensation for injuries or sickness 
 
"(a)  In general.--Except in the case of amounts attributable to (and not in 
excess of) deductions allowed under section 213 (relating to medical, etc., 
expenses) for any prior taxable year, gross income does not include--  
 
"(1)  amounts received under workmen's compensation acts as 
compensation for personal injuries or sickness;  
 
"(2)  the amount of any damages received (whether by suit or agreement 
and whether as lump sums or as periodic payments) on account of personal 
injuries or sickness;  
 
"(3)  amounts received through accident or health insurance for personal 
injuries or sickness (other than amounts received by an employee, to the 
extent such amounts (A) are attributable to contributions by the employer 
which were not includible in the gross income of the employee, or (B) are 
paid by the employer);  
 
"(4)  amounts received as a pension, annuity, or similar allowance for 
personal injuries or sickness resulting from active service in the armed 
forces of any country or in the Coast and Geodetic Survey or the Public 
Health Service, or as a disability annuity payable under the provisions of 
section 808 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980; and  
 
"(5)  amounts received by an individual as disability income attributable to 
injuries incurred as a direct result of a violent attack which the Secretary 
of State determines to be a terrorist attack and which occurred while such 
individual was an employee of the United States engaged in the 
performance of his official duties outside the United States."  26 U. S. C. 
Sec. 104 (1988 ed.).  
 
In 1989, Sec. 104(a) was amended, adding, among other things, the 
following language:  
 
"Paragraph (2) shall not apply to any punitive damages in connection with 
a case not involving physical injury or physical sickness."  26 U. S. C. 
Sec. 104(a) (1994).  
 
Treasury Regulation Sec. 1.104-1(c) provides:  
 
"Section 104(a)(2) excludes from gross income the amount of any 
damages received (whether by suit or agreement) on account of personal 
injuries or sickness.  The term 'damages received (whether by suit or 
agreement)' means an amount received (other than workmen's 
compensation) through prosecution of a legal suit or action based upon tort 
or tort type rights, or through a settlement agreement entered into in lieu of 
such prosecution."  26 CFR Sec. 1.104-1(c) (1996).

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 
Nos. 95-966 AND 95-977 
 
 
KEVIN M. O'GILVIE AND STEPHANIE L. O'GILVIE, MINORS, 
PETITIONERS 95-966  
 
v. 
 
UNITED STATES 
 
 
KELLY M. O'GILVIE, PETITIONER 
95-977 
 
v. 
 
UNITED STATES 
 
 
ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 
APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT  
 
[December 10, 1996] 
 
JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE O'CONNOR and  
 
JUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting. 
 
Section 104(a)(2), as it stood at the time relevant to these cases, provided 
an exclusion from income for "any damages received . . . on account of 
personal injuries or sickness."  26 U. S. C. Sec. 104(a)(2) (1988 ed.).  The 
Court is of the view that this phrase, in isolation, is just as susceptible of a 
meaning that includes only compensatory damages as it is of a broader 
meaning that includes punitive damages as well.  Ante, at 3-4.  I do not 
agree.  The Court greatly understates the connection between an award of 
punitive damages and the personal injury complained of, describing it as 
nothing more than "but-for" causality, ante, at 3.  It seems to me that the 
personal injury is as proximate a cause of the punitive damages as it is of 
the compensatory damages; in both cases it is the reason the damages are 
awarded.  That is why punitive damages are called damages.  To be sure, 
punitive damages require intentional, blameworthy conduct, which can be 
said to be a coequal reason they are awarded.  But negligent (or 
intentional) conduct occupies the same role of coequal causality with 
regard to compensatory damages. Both types of damages are "received on 
account of" the personal injury.  
 
The nub of the matter, it seems to me, is this: If one were to be asked, by a 
lawyer from another legal system, "What damages can be received on 
account of personal injuries in the United States?" surely the correct 
answer would be "Compensatory damages and punitive damages--the 
former to compensate for the inflicting of the personal injuries, and the 
latter to punish for the inflicting of them."  If, as the Court asserts, the 
phrase "damages received on account of personal injuries" can be used to 
refer only to the former category, that is only because people sometimes 
can be imprecise.  The notion that Congress carefully and precisely used 
the phrase "damages received on account of personal injuries" to segregate 
out compensatory damages seems to me entirely fanciful.  That is neither 
the exact nor the ordinary meaning of the phrase, and hence not the one 
that the statute should be understood to intend.  
 
What I think to be the fair meaning of the phrase in isolation becomes 
even clearer when the phrase is considered in its statutory context.  The 
Court proceeds too quickly from its erroneous premise of ambiguity to 
analysis of the history and policy behind Sec. 104(a)(2). Ante, at 5-8.  
Ambiguity in isolation, even if it existed, would not end the textual 
inquiry.  Statutory construction, we have said, is a "holistic endeavor."  
United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 
484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988).  "A provision that may seem ambiguous in 
isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme."  Ibid.  
 
Section 104(a)(2) appears immediately after another provision, Sec. 
104(a)(1), which parallels Sec. 104(a)(2) in several respects but does not 
use the critical phrase "on account of":  
 
"(a) [G]ross income does not include-- 
 
"(1) amounts received under workmen's compensa-tion acts as 
compensation for personal injuries or sickness;  
 
"(2) the amount of any damages received . . . on account of personal 
injuries or sickness."  (Emphasis added.)  
 
Although Sec. 104(a)(1) excludes amounts received "as compensation for" 
personal injuries or sickness, while Sec. 104(a)(2) excludes amounts 
received "on account of" personal injuries or sickness, the Court reads the 
two phrases to mean precisely the same thing.  That is not sound textual 
interpretation.  "[W]hen the legislature uses certain language in one part of 
the statute and different language in another, the court assumes different 
meanings were intended."  2A N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory 
Construction Sec. 46.07 (5th ed. 1992 and Supp. 1996). See, e.g., Russello 
v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983).  This principle of construction 
has its limits, of course: Use of different terminology in differing contexts 
might have little significance.  But here the contrasting phrases appear in 
adjoining provisions that address precisely the same subject matter and 
that even have identical grammatical structure.  
 
The contrast between the two usages is even more striking in the original 
statute that enacted them.  The Revenue Act of 1918 combined 
subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of Sec. 104, together with (a)(3) (which 
provides an exclusion from income for amounts received through accident 
or health insurance for personal injuries or sickness), into a single 
subsection, which provided:  
 
"'Gross income' . . . [d]oes not include . . . :  
 
"(6) Amounts received, through accident or health insurance or under 
workmen's compensation acts, as compensation for personal injuries or 
sickness, plus the amount of any damages received . . . on account of such 
injuries or sickness." Sec. 213(b)(6) of the Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 
1065-66 (emphasis added).  
 
The contrast between the first exclusion and the second could not be more 
clear.  Had Congress intended the latter provision to cover only damages 
received "as compensation for" personal injuries or sickness, it could have 
written "amounts received, through accident or health insurance, under 
workmen's compensation acts, or in damages, as compensation for 
personal injuries or sickness."  Instead, it tacked on an additional phrase 
"plus the amount of, etc." with no apparent purpose except to make clear 
that not only compensatory damages were covered by the exclusion.  
 
The Court maintains, however, that the Government's reading of Sec. 
104(a)(2) is "more faithful to [its] history."  Ante, at 5.  The "history" to 
which the Court refers is not statutory history of the sort just discussed--
prior enactments approved by earlier Congresses and revised or amended 
by later ones to produce the current text.  Indeed, it is not "history" from 
within even a small portion of Congress, since the House Committee 
Report the Court cites, standing by itself, is uninformative, saying only 
that "[u]nder the present law it is doubtful whether . . . damages received 
on account of [personal] injuries or sickness are required to be included in 
gross income."  H. R. Rep. No. 767, 65th Cong., 2d Sess., 9-10 (1918).  
The Court makes this snippet of legislative history relevant by citing as 
pertinent an antecedent Treasury Department decision, which concludes 
on the basis of recent judicial decisions that amounts received from 
prosecution or compromise of a personal-injury suit are not taxable 
because they are a return of capital.  Ante, at 5-6 (citing T. D. 2747, 20 
Treas. Dec. Int. Rev. 457 (1918)).  
 
One might expect the Court to conclude from this that the Members of 
Congress (on the unrealistic assumption that they knew about the 
Executive-Branch opinion) meant the statutory language to cover only 
return of capital, the source of the "doubt" to which the Committee Report 
referred.  But of course the Court cannot draw that logical conclusion, 
since even if it is applied only to compensatory damages the statute 
obviously and undeniably covers more than mere return of "human 
capital," namely, reimbursement for lost income, which would be a large 
proportion (indeed perhaps the majority) of any damages award.  The 
Court concedes this is so, but asserts that this inconsistency is not enough 
"to support cutting the statute totally free from its original moorings," ante, 
at 7, by which I assume it means the Treasury Decision, however 
erroneous it might have been as to the "capital" nature of compensatory 
damages.  But the Treasury Decision was no more explicitly limited to 
compensatory damages than is the statute before us.  It exempted from 
taxation "an amount received by an individual as the result of a suit or 
compromise for personal injuries."  T. D. 2747, 20 Treas. Dec. Int. Rev. 
457 (1918).  The Court's entire thesis of taxability rests upon the 
proposition that this Treasury Decision, which overlooked the obvious fact 
that "an amount received . . . as the result of a suit or compromise for 
personal injuries" almost always includes compensation for lost future 
income, did not overlook the obvious fact that such an amount sometimes 
includes "smart-money."  
 
So, to trace the Court's reasoning: The statute must exclude punitive 
damages because the Committee Report must have had in mind a 1918 
Treasury Decision, whose text no more supports exclusion of punitive 
damages than does the text of the statute itself, but which must have meant 
to exclude punitive damages since it was based on the "return-of-capital" 
theory, though, inconsistently with that theory, it did not exclude the much 
more common category of compensation for lost income.  Congress 
supposedly knew all of this, and a reasonably diligent lawyer could figure 
it out by mistrusting the inclusive language of the statute, consulting the 
Committee Report, surmising that the Treasury Decision of 1918 underlay 
that Report, mistrusting the inclusive language of the Treasury Decision, 
and discerning that Treasury could have overlooked lost-income 
compensatories, but could not have overlooked punitives.  I think not.  The 
sure and proper guide, it seems to me, is the language of the statute, 
inclusive by nature and doubly inclusive by contrast with surrounding 
provisions.  
 
The Court poses the question, ante, at 7, "why Congress might have 
wanted the exclusion [in Sec. 104(a)(2)] to have covered . . . punitive 
damages."  If an answer is needed (and the text being as clear as it is, I 
think it is not), surely it suffices to surmise that Congress was following 
the Treasury Decision, which had inadvertently embraced punitive 
damages just as it had inadvertently embraced future-income 
compensatory damages. Or if some reason free of human error must be 
found, I see nothing wrong with what the Court itself suggests but rejects 
out of hand: Excluding punitive as well as compensatory damages from 
gross income "avoids such administrative problems as separating punitive 
from compensatory portions of a global settlement."  Ante, at 9. How 
substantial that particular problem is is suggested by the statistics which 
show that 73 percent of tort cases in state court are disposed of by 
settlement, and between 92 and 99 percent of tort cases in federal court are 
disposed of by either settlement or some other means (such as summary 
judgment) prior to trial.  See B. Ostrom & N. Kauder, Examining the 
Work of State Courts, 1994, p. 34 (1996);  Administrative Office of the 
United States, L. Mecham, Judicial Business of the United States Courts: 
1995 Report of the Director 162-164.  What is at issue, of course, is not 
just imposing on the parties the necessity of allocating the settlement 
between compensatory and punitive damages (with the concomitant 
suggestion of intentional wrongdoing that any allocation to punitive 
damages entails), but also imposing on the Internal Revenue Service the 
necessity of reviewing that allocation, since there would always be strong 
incentive to inflate the tax-free compensatory portion.  The Court's only 
response to the suggestion that this is an adequate reason (if one is 
required) for including punitive damages in the exemption is that "[t]he 
administrative problem of distinguishing punitive from compensatory 
elements is likely to be less serious than, say, distinguishing among the 
compensatory elements of a settlement."  Ante, at 9-10. Perhaps so; and it 
may also be more simple than splitting the atom; but that in no way refutes 
the point that it is complicated enough to explain the inclusion of punitive 
damages in an exemption that has already abandoned the purity of a 
"return-of-capital" rationale.  
 
The remaining argument offered by the Court is that our decision in 
Commissioner v. Schleier, 515 U. S. ___ (1995), came "close to 
resolving"--in the Government's favor--the question whether Sec. 
104(a)(2) permits the exclusion of punitive damages.  Ante, at 4.  I 
disagree. In Schleier we were faced with the question whether backpay 
and liquidated damages under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act 
of 1967 (ADEA) were "damages received . . . on account of personal 
injuries or sickness" for purposes of Sec. 104(a)(2)'s exclusion.  As the 
dissent accurately observed,  515 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (opinion of 
O'CONNOR, J.), "the key to the Court's analysis" was the determination 
that an ADEA cause of action did not necessarily entail "personal injury or 
sickness," so that the damages awarded for that cause of action could 
hardly be awarded "on account of personal injuries or sickness." See id., at 
__ (slip op., at 7).  In the case at hand, we said, "respondent's unlawful 
termination may have caused some psychological or 'personal' injury 
comparable to the intangible pain and suffering caused by an automobile 
accident," but "it is clear that no part of respondent's recovery of back 
wages is attributable to that injury." Ibid.  The respondent countered that at 
least "the liquidated damages portion of his settlement" could be linked to 
that psychological injury.  Ibid.  And it was in response to that argument 
that we made the statement which the Court seeks to press into service for 
today's opinion. ADEA liquidated damages, we said, were punitive in 
nature, rather than compensatory.  Id., at ___, and n. 5 (slip op., at 8-9, and 
n. 5).  
 
The Court recites this statement as though the point of it was that punitive 
damages could not be received "on account of" personal injuries, whereas 
in fact the point was quite different: Since the damages were punishment 
for the conduct that gave rise to the (non-personal-injury) cause of action, 
they could not be "linked to" the incidental psychological injury.  In the 
present cases, of course, there is no question that a personal injury 
occurred and that this personal injury is what entitled petitioners to 
compensatory and punitive damages.  We neither decided nor intimated in 
Schleier whether punitive damages that are indisputably "linked to" 
personal injuries or sickness are received "on account of" such injuries or 
sickness.  Indeed, it would have been odd for us to resolve that question 
(or even come "close to resolving" it) without any discussion of the 
numerous considerations of text, history and policy highlighted by today's 
opinion. If one were to search our opinions for a dictum bearing upon the 
present issue, much closer is the statement in United States v. Burke, 504 
U. S. 229 (1992), that a statute confers "tort or tort type rights" (qualifying 
a plaintiff's recovery for the Sec. 104(a)(2) exemption) if it entitles the 
plaintiff to "a jury trial at which 'both equitable and legal relief, including 
compensatory and, under certain circumstances, punitive damages' may be 
awarded."  Id., at 240 (quoting Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 
421 U. S. 454, 460 (1975)).  
 
But all of this is really by the way.  Because the statutory text 
unambiguously covers punitive damages that are awarded on account of 
personal injuries, I conclude that petitioners were entitled to deduct the 
amounts at issue here.  This makes it unnecessary for me to reach the 
question, discussed ante, at 12-13, whether the government's refund action 
against the O'Gilvie children was commenced within the two-year period 
specified by 26 U. S. C. Sec. 6532(b).  I note, however, that the Court's 
resolution of these cases also does not demand that this issue be addressed, 
except to the extent of rejecting the proposition that the statutory period 
begins to run with the mailing of a refund check.  So long as that is not the 
trigger, there is no need to decide whether the proper trigger is receipt of 
the check or some later event, such as the check's clearance.  
 
For the reasons stated, I respectfully dissent from the judgment of the 
Court.

v.

CHERYL J. HOPWOOD ET AL.

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

No. 95-1773. Decided July 1, 1996

The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.

Opinion of JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER
joins, respecting the denial of the petition for a writ of certiorari.

Whether it is constitutional for a public college or graduate school to
use race or national origin as a factor in its admissions process is an
issue of great national importance. The petition before us, however,
does not challenge the lower courts' judgments that the particular
admissions procedure used by the University of Texas Law School in
1992 was unconstitutional. Acknowledging that the 1992 admissions
program "has long since been discontinued and will not be reinstated,"
Pet. for Cert. 28, the petitioners do not defend that program in this
Court, see Reply to Brief in Opposition 1, 3; see also Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 14, n. 13 ("We agree that the 1992
[admissions] policy was constitutionally flawed . . . ."). Instead,
petitioners challenge the rationale relied on by the Court of Appeals.
"[T]his Court," however, "reviews judgments, not opinions."
Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,
467 U. S. 837, 842 (1984) (footnote omitted). Accordingly, we must
await a final judgment on a program genuinely in controversy before
addressing the important question raised in this petition. See Reply to
Brief in Opposition 2 ("[A]ll concede this record is inadequate to
assess definitively" the constitutionality of the law school's current
consideration of race in its admissions process.).

Appeals from the United States District Court
for the Western District of Texas

_________________________

March 18, 1996

Before SMITH, WIENER, and DeMOSS, Circuit Judges.

JERRY E. SMITH, Circuit Judge:


With the best of intentions, in order to increase the enrollment of
certain favored classes of minority students, the University of Texas
School of Law ("the law school") dis- criminates in favor of those
applicants by giving substantial racial preferences in its admissions
program. The beneficia- ries of this system are blacks and Mexican
Americans, to the detriment of whites and non-preferred minorities.
The ques- tion we decide today in No. 94-50664 is whether the
Fourteenth Amendment permits the school to discriminate in this
way.

We hold that it does not. The law school has presented no
compelling justification, under the Fourteenth Amendment or
Supreme Court precedent, that allows it to continue to elevate some
races over others, even for the wholesome purpose of correcting
perceived racial imbalance in the student body. "Racial preferences
appear to 'even the score' . . . only if one embraces the proposition
that our society is appropriately viewed as divided into races, making
it right that an injustice rendered in the past to a black man should be
com- pensated for by discriminating against a white."  City of
Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 528 (1989) (Scalia,
J., concurring in the judgment).

As a result of its diligent efforts in this case, the district court
concluded that the law school may continue to impose racial
preferences. See Hopwood v. Texas, 861 F. Supp. 551 (W.D. Tex.
1994). In No. 94-50664, we reverse and remand, concluding that
the law school may not use race as a factor in law school admissions.
Further, we instruct the court to reconsider the issue of damages in
accordance with the legal standards we now explain. In No. 94-
50569, regarding the denial of intervention by two black student
groups, we dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction.



I.

A.

The University of Texas School of Law is one of the nation's leading
law schools, consistently ranking in the top twenty. See, e.g.,
America's Best Graduate Schools, U.S. News & World Report Mar.
20, 1995, at 84 (national survey ranking of seventeenth).
Accordingly, admission to the law school is fiercely competitive,
with over 4,000 applicants a year competing to be among the
approximately 900 offered admission to achieve an entering class of
about 500 students. Many of these applicants have some of the
highest grades and test scores in the country.

Numbers are therefore paramount for admission. In the early
1990's, the law school largely based its initial admissions decisions
upon an applicant's so-called Texas Index ("TI") number, a
composite of undergraduate grade point average ("GPA") and Law
School Aptitude Test ("LSAT") score.  The law school used this
number as a matter of administrative convenience in order to rank
candidates and to predict, roughly, one's probability of success in
law school. Moreover, the law school relied heavily upon such
numbers to estimate the number of offers of admission it needed to
make in order to fill its first-year class.

Of course, the law school did not rely upon numbers alone. The
admissions office necessarily exercised judgment in interpreting the
individual scores of applicants, taking into consideration factors such
as the strength of a student's undergraduate education, the difficulty
of his major, and significant trends in his own grades and the
undergraduate grades at his respective college (such as grade
inflation). Admissions personnel also considered what qualities each
applicant might bring to his law school class. Thus, the law school
could consider an applicant's background, life experiences, and
outlook. Not surprisingly, these hard-to- quantify factors were
especially significant for marginal candidates.

Because of the large number of applicants and potential admissions
factors, the TI's administrative usefulness was its ability to sort
candidates. For the class entering in 1992** the admissions group at
issue in this case**the law school placed the typical applicant in one
of three categories according to his TI scores: "presumptive admit,"
"presumptive deny," or a middle "discretionary zone."  An
applicant's TI category determined how extensive a review his
application would receive.

Most, but not all, applicants in the presumptive admit category
received offers of admission with little review. Professor Stanley
Johanson, the Chairman of the Admissions Committee, or Dean
Laquita Hamilton, the Assistant Dean for Admissions, reviewed
these files and downgraded only five to ten percent to the
discretionary zone because of weaknesses in their applications,
generally a non-competitive major or a weak undergraduate
education.

Applicants in the presumptive denial category also received little
consideration. Similarly, these files would be reviewed by one or
two professors, who could upgrade them if they believed that the TI
score did not adequately reflect potential to compete at the law
school. Otherwise, the applicant was rejected.

Applications in the middle range were subjected to the most extensive
scrutiny. For all applicants other than blacks and Mexican
Americans, the files were bundled into stacks of thirty, which were
given to admissions subcommittees consisting of three members of
the full admissions committee. Each subcommittee member, in
reviewing the thirty files, could cast a number of votes**typically
from nine to eleven **among the thirty files. Subject to the
chairman's veto, if a candidate received two or three votes, he
received an offer; if he garnered one vote, he was put on the waiting
list; those with no votes were denied admission.

Blacks and Mexican Americans were treated differently from other
candidates, however. First, compared to whites and non-preferred
minorities,  the TI ranges that were used to place them into the three
admissions categories were lowered to allow the law school to
consider and admit more of them. In March 1992, for example, the
presumptive TI admission score for resident whites and non-
preferred minorities was 199.  Mexican Americans and blacks
needed a TI of only 189 to be presumptively admitted.  The
difference in the presumptive- deny ranges is even more striking.
The presumptive denial score for "nonminorities" was 192; the same
score for blacks and Mexican Americans was 179.

While these cold numbers may speak little to those unfamiliar with
the pool of applicants, the results demonstrate that the difference in
the two ranges was dramatic. According to the law school, 1992
resident white applicants had a mean GPA of 3.53 and an LSAT of
164. Mexican Americans scored 3.27 and 158; blacks scored 3.25
and 157. The category of "other minority" achieved a 3.56 and 160.



These disparate standards greatly affected a candidate's chance of
admission. For example, by March 1992, because the presumptive
denial score for whites was a TI of 192 or lower, and the
presumptive admit TI for minorities was 189 or higher, a minority
candidate with a TI of 189 or above almost certainly would be
admitted, even though his score was considerably below  the level at
which a white candidate almost certainly would be rejected. Out of
the pool of resident applicants who fell within this range (189-192
inclusive), 100% of blacks and 90% of Mexican Americans, but only
6% of whites, were offered admission.

The stated purpose of this lowering of standards was to meet an
"aspiration" of admitting a class consisting of 10% Mexican
Americans and 5% blacks, proportions roughly compara- ble to the
percentages of those races graduating from Texas colleges. The law
school found meeting these "goals" difficult, however, because of
uncertain acceptance rates and the variable quality of the applicant
pool.  In 1992, for example, the entering class contained 41 blacks
and 55 Mexican Americans, respectively 8% and 10.7% of the class.

In addition to maintaining separate presumptive TI levels for
minorities and whites, the law school ran a segregated application
evaluation process. Upon receiving an application form, the school
color-coded it according to race. If a candidate failed to designate his
race, he was presumed to be in a nonpreferential category. Thus,
race was always an overt part of the review of any applicant's file.

The law school reviewed minority candidates within the applicable
discretionary range differently from whites. Instead of being
evaluated and compared by one of the various discretionary zone
subcommittees, black and Mexican American applicants' files were
reviewed by a minority subcommittee of three, which would meet
and discuss every minority candidate. Thus, each of these
candidates' files could get extensive review and discussion. And
while the minority subcommittee reported summaries of files to the
admissions committee as a whole, the minority subcommittee's
decisions were "virtually final."

Finally, the law school maintained segregated waiting lists, dividing
applicants by race and residence. Thus, even many of those minority
applicants who were not admitted could be set aside in "minority-
only" waiting lists. Such separate lists apparently helped the law
school maintain a pool of potentially acceptable, but marginal,
minority candidates.



B.

Cheryl Hopwood, Douglas Carvell, Kenneth Elliott, and David
Rogers (the "plaintiffs") applied for admission to the 1992 entering
law school class. All four were white residents of Texas and were
rejected.

The plaintiffs were considered as discretionary zone candidates.
Hopwood, with a GPA of 3.8 and an LSAT of 39 (equivalent to a
three-digit LSAT of 160), had a TI of 199, a score barely within the
presumptive-admit category for resident whites, which was 199 and
up. She was dropped into the discretionary zone for resident whites
(193 to 198), however, because Johanson decided her educational
background overstated the strength of her GPA. Carvell, Elliott, and
Rogers had TI's of 197, at the top end of that discretionary zone.
Their applications were reviewed by admissions subcommittees, and
each received one or no vote.



II.

The plaintiffs sued primarily under the Equal Protection Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment; they also claimed deriva- tive statutory
violations of 42 U.S.C. 1981 and 1983 and of title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d ("title VI").  The plaintiffs'
central claim is that they were subjected to unconstitutional racial
discrimination by the law school's evaluation of their admissions
applications. They sought injunctive and declaratory relief and
compensatory and punitive damages.

After a bench trial, the district court held that the school had violated
the plaintiffs' equal protection rights. 861 F. Supp. at 579. The
plaintiffs' victory was pyrrhic at best, however, as the court refused
to enjoin the law school from using race in admissions decisions or
to grant damages beyond a one-dollar nominal award to each
plaintiff. The district court, however, did grant declaratory relief and
ordered that the plaintiffs be allowed to apply again without paying
the requisite fee. Id. at 583.

The district court began by recognizing the proper constitutional
standard under which to evaluate the admissions program: strict
scrutiny. Id. at 568. As it was undisputed that the school had treated
applicants disparately based upon the color of their skin, the court
asked whether the law school process (1) served a compelling
government interest and (2) was narrowly tailored to the achievement
of that goal. Under the first prong of the test, the court held that two
of the law school's five proffered reasons met constitutional muster:
(1) "obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a racially and
ethnically diverse student body" and (2) "the objective of overcoming
past effects of discrimination."  Id. at 571.

Significantly, on the second justification, the court rejected the
plaintiffs' argument that the analysis of past discrimination should be
limited to that of the law school; instead, the court held that the State
of Texas's "institutions of higher education are inextricably linked to
the primary and secondary schools in the system."  Id.
Accordingly, the court found that Texas's long history of racially
discriminatory practices in its primary and secondary schools in its
not-too-distant past had the following present effects at UT law: "the
law school's lingering reputation in the minority community,
particularly with prospective students, as a 'white' school; an
underrepresentation of minorities in the student body; and some
perception that the law school is a hostile environment for
minorities."  Id. at 572. The court also noted that "were the Court to
limit its review to the University of Texas, the Court would still find
a 'strong evidentiary basis for concluding that remedial action is
necessary.'"  Id. (citation omitted).

The court next evaluated whether the Texas program was narrowly
tailored to further these goals. Id. at 573. Applying a four-factor test
devised by the Supreme Court, the court held only part of the 1992
admissions scheme unconstitutional. Those parts that gave
minorities a "plus," that is, the component of the admissions program
that treated candidates' TI scores differently based upon race, was
upheld. Id. at 578.

The court held, however, that differential treatment was not allowed
where candidates of different races were not compared at some point
in the admission process. Thus, the court struck down the school's
use of separate admissions committees for applications in the
discretionary zone, id. at 578-79, and in dictum speculated that
presumptive denial lines would not pass muster, as many white
candidates would get no review, while similarly situated minorities
would, id. at 576 n.71.

Though it declared that the law school's 1992 admissions program
violated the plaintiffs' equal protection rights, the court granted little
relief. First, the court did not order that the plaintiffs be admitted to
the law school. Instead, it used what it saw as analogous title VII
caselaw on burden- shifting to hold that while the state had
committed a constitutional violation, the plaintiffs had the ultimate
burden of proving damages. Id. at 579-80. The court then found
that the defendants had proffered a legitimate, non- discriminatory
reason for denying the plaintiffs admission and that the plaintiffs had
not met their burden of showing that they would have been admitted
but for the unlawful system. Id. at 582.

Moreover, the court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to
prospective injunctive relief, because "of the law school's voluntary
change to a procedure, which on paper and from the testimony,
appears to remedy the defects the Court has found in the 1992
procedure."  Id.  To pass muster under the court's reasoning, the
law school simply had to have one committee that at one time during
the process reviewed all applications and did not establish separate TI
numbers to define the presumptive denial categories. In other words,
if the law school applied the same academic standards, but had
commingled the minority review in the discretionary zone with the
review of whites, its program would not have been struck down.
The same admissions result would occur, but the process would be
"fair."  Id.

Finally, the court determined that the only appropriate relief was a
declaratory judgment and an order allowing the plaintiffs to reapply
to the school without charge. Id. at 582-83. No compensatory or
punitive damages, the court reasoned, could be awarded where the
plaintiffs had proven no harm. Moreover, the court reasoned that as
the law school had promised to change its admissions program by
abandoning the two-committee system, no prospective injunctive
relief was justified.



III.

The central purpose of the Equal Protection Clause "is to prevent the
States from purposefully discriminating between individuals on the
basis of race."  Shaw v. Reno, 113 S. Ct. 2816, 2824 (1993) (citing
Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239 (1976)). It seeks
ultimately to render the issue of race irrelevant in governmental
decisionmaking. See Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 432 (1984)
("A core purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to do away with
all governmentally imposed discrimination.")(footnote omitted).

Accordingly, discrimination based upon race is highly suspect.
"Distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by
their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are
founded upon the doctrine of equality," and "racial discriminations
are in most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited . . . ."
Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 100 (1943). Hence,
"[p]referring members of any one group for no reason other than race
or ethnic origin is discrimination for its own sake. This the
Constitution forbids."  Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S.
265, 307 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.); see also Loving v. Virginia,
388 U.S. 1, 11 (1967); Brown v. Board of Educ., 347 U.S. 483,
493-94 (1954). These equal protection maxims apply to all races.
Adarand Constructors v. Pena, 115 S. Ct. 2097, 2111 (1995).

In order to preserve these principles, the Supreme Court recently has
required that any governmental action that expressly distinguishes
between persons on the basis of race be held to the most exacting
scrutiny. See, e.g., id. at 2113; Loving, 388 U.S. at 11.
Furthermore, there is now absolutely no doubt that courts are to
employ strict scrutiny  when evaluating all racial classifications,
including those characterized by their proponents as "benign" or
"remedial."

Strict scrutiny is necessary because the mere labeling of a
classification by the government as "benign" or "remedial" is
meaningless. As Justice O'Connor indicated in Croson:

Absent searching judicial inquiry into the justifications for such race-
based measures, there is simply no way of determining what
classifica- tions are "benign" or "remedial" and what classifications
are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or
simple racial politics. Indeed, the purpose of strict scrutiny is to
"smoke out" illegitimate uses of race by assuring that the legislative
body is pursuing a goal important enough to warrant use of a highly
suspect tool. The test also ensures that the means chosen "fit" this
compelling goal so closely that there is little or no possibility that the
motive for the classification was illegitimate racial prejudice or
stereotype.



Id. at 493 (plurality opinion).

Under the strict scrutiny analysis, we ask two questions:  (1) Does
the racial classification serve a compelling government interest, and
(2) is it narrowly tailored to the achievement of that goal? Adarand,
115 S. Ct. at 2111, 2117. As the Adarand Court emphasized, strict
scrutiny ensures that "courts will consistently give racial
classifications . . . detailed examination both as to ends and as to
means."  Id.

Finally, when evaluating the proffered governmental interest for the
specific racial classification, to decide whether the program in
question narrowly achieves that interest, we must recognize that "the
rights created by . . . the Fourteenth Amendment are, by its terms,
guaranteed to the individual. The rights established are personal
rights."  Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 22 (1948).  Thus, the
Court consistently has rejected arguments conferring benefits on a
person based solely upon his membership in a specific class of
persons.

With these general principles of equal protection in mind, we turn to
the specific issue of whether the law school's consideration of race as
a factor in admissions violates the Equal Protection Clause. The
district court found both a compelling remedial and a non-remedial
justification for the practice.

First, the court approved of the non-remedial goal of having a diverse
student body, reasoning that "obtaining the educational benefits that
flow from a racially and ethnically diverse student body remains a
sufficiently compelling interest to support the use of racial
classifications."  861 F. Supp. at 571. Second, the court determined
that the use of racial classifications could be justified as a remedy for
the "present effects at the law school of past discrimination in both
the University of Texas system and the Texas educational system as a
whole."  Id. at 573.



A.

1.

Justice Powell's separate opinion in Bakke provided the original
impetus for recognizing diversity as a compelling state interest in
higher education. In that case, Allan Bakke, a white male, was
denied admission to the Medical School of the University of
California at Davis, a state-run institution. Claiming that the State
had discriminated against him impermissibly because it operated two
separate admissions programs for the medical school, he brought suit
under the state constitution, title VI, and the Equal Protection Clause.

Under the medical school's admissions system, the white applicants,
who comprised the majority of the prospective students, applied
through the general admissions program. A special admissions
program was reserved for members of "minority groups" or groups
designated as "economically and/or educationally disadvantaged."
The university set aside sixteen of the one hundred positions in the
entering class for candidates from the special program.

The California Supreme Court struck down the program on equal
protection grounds, enjoined any consideration of race in the
admissions process, and ordered that Bakke be admitted. The United
States Supreme Court affirmed in part and reversed in part in an
opinion announced by Justice Powell. 438 U.S. at 271-72 (opinion
of Powell, J.). The Court reached no consensus on a justification for
its result, however. Six Justices filed opinions, none of which
garnered more than four votes (including the writer's). The two
major opinions**one four-Justice opinion by Justices Brennan,
White, Marshall, and Blackmun and one by Justice Stevens in which
Chief Justice Burger and Justices Stewart and Rehnquist
joined**reflected completely contrary views of the law.

While Justice Powell found the program unconstitutional under the
Equal Protection Clause and affirmed Bakke's admission, Justice
Stevens declined to reach the constitu- tional issue and upheld
Bakke's admission under title VI. Justice Powell also concluded that
the California Supreme Court's proscription of the consideration of
race in admissions could not be sustained. This became the judgment
of the Court, as the four-Justice opinion by Justice Brennan opined
that racial classifications designed to serve remedial purposes should
receive only intermediate scrutiny. These Justices would have
upheld the admissions program under this intermediate scrutiny, as it
served the substantial and benign purpose of remedying past societal
discrimination.

Hence, Justice Powell's opinion has appeared to represent the
"swing vote," and though, in significant part, see id. at 272 n.*, it
was joined by no other Justice, it has played a prominent role in
subsequent debates concerning the impact of Bakke.  In the present
case, the significance of Justice Powell's opinion is its discussion of
compelling state interests under the Equal Protection Clause. See id.
at 305- 15. Specifically, after Justice Powell recognized that the
proper level of review for racial classifications is strict scrutiny, id. at
305-06, he rejected and accepted respective justifications for the
school's program as "substantial enough to support the use of a
suspect classification," id. at 306. Notably, because the first step in
reviewing an affirmative action program is a determination of the
state's interests at stake,  it often is the determinative step. Justice
Powell outlined the four state interests proffered by the Bakke
defendants:

The special admissions program purports to serve the purposes of: (i)
"reducing the historic deficit of traditionally disfavored minorities in
medical schools and in the medical profession,"; (ii) countering the
effects of societal discrimination; (iii) increasing the number of
physicians who will practice in communities currently underserved;
and (iv) obtaining the educational benefits that flow from an
ethnically diverse student body.



Id. at 305-06 (emphasis added, citation and footnote omitted).

Justice Powell reasoned that the second and third
justifications**remedying societal discrimination and providing role
models**were never appropriate.  He determined that any remedial
justification was limited to eliminating "identified discrimination"
with "disabling effects."  Id. at 307 (citing the school desegregation
cases). He specifically emphasized that a particularized finding of a
constitutional or statutory violation must be present before a remedy
is justified. He determined not only that such findings were not
present in Bakke, but that the medical school was not even in a
position to make such findings. Id. at 309.

Justice Powell further reasoned that diversity is a sufficient
justification for limited racial classification. Id. at 311-16. "[The
attainment of a diverse student body] clearly is a constitutionally
permissible goal for an institution of higher education."  Id. at 311.
He argued that diversity of minorities' viewpoints furthered
"academic freedom," an interest under the Constitution. While
acknowledging that "academic freedom" does not appear as a
constitutional right, he argued that it had "long . . . been viewed as a
special concern of the First Amendment."  Id. at 312.

Justice Powell presented this "special concern" as in tension with the
Fourteenth Amendment. "Thus, in arguing that its universities must
be accorded the right to select those students who will contribute the
most to the 'robust exchange of ideas,' petitioner invokes a
countervailing constitutional interest, that of the First Amendment."
Id. at 313.  The Justice then concluded that

[a]n otherwise qualified medical student with a particular
backgroundAAwhether it be ethnic, geographic, culturally
advantaged or disadvantagedAAmay bring to a professional school of
medicine experiences, outlooks, and ideas that enrich the training of
its student body and better equip its graduates to render with
understanding their vital service to humanity.



Id. at 314 (footnote omitted). Justice Powell therefore approved of a
consideration of ethnicity as "one element in a range of factors a
university properly may consider in attaining the goal of a
heterogeneous student body."  Id.

The next step for Justice Powell was to decide whether the medical
school's program was necessary to further the goal of diversity. He
said it was not. As the program made race the only determining
factor for a certain number of the open spots that had been set aside,
it did not further full diversity but only a conception of that term
limited to race.

Justice Powell speculated that a program in which "race or ethnic
background may be deemed a 'plus' in a particular applicant's file,
yet does not insulate the individual from comparison with all the
other candidates for the available seats," might pass muster. Id. at
317. The Justice did not define what he meant by a "plus," but he
did write that a "plus" program would be one in which an

applicant who loses out to another candidate receiving a 'plus' on the
basis of ethnic background will not have been foreclosed from all
consideration for that seat simply because he was not the right color
or had the wrong surname. It would only mean that his combined
qualifications, which may have included similar nonobjective factors,
did not outweigh those of another appli- cant. His qualifications
would have been weighted fairly and competitively, and he would
have no basis to complaint of unequal treatment under the Fourteenth
Amendment.



Id. at 318.

Under this conception of the Fourteenth Amendment, a program that
considered a host of factors that include race would be constitutional,
even if an applicant's race "tipped the scales" among qualified
applicants. What a school could not do is to refuse to compare
applicants of different races or establish a strict quota on the basis of
race. In sum, Justice Powell found the school's program to be an
unconstitutional "quota" system, but he intimated that the
Constitution would allow schools to continue to use race in a wide-
ranging manner.



2.

Here, the plaintiffs argue that diversity is not a compelling
governmental interest under superseding Supreme Court precedent.
Instead, they believe that the Court finally has recognized that only
the remedial use of race is compel- ling. In the alternative, the
plaintiffs assert that the district court misapplied Justice Powell's
Bakke standard, as the law school program here uses race as a strong
determinant rather than a mere "plus" factor and, in any case, the
preference is not narrowly applied. The law school maintains, on the
other hand, that Justice Powell's formulation in Bakke is law and
must be followed**at least in the context of higher education.

We agree with the plaintiffs that any consideration of race or ethnicity
by the law school for the purpose of achieving a diverse student body
is not a compelling interest under the Fourteenth Amendment.
Justice Powell's argument in Bakke garnered only his own vote and
has never represented the view of a majority of the Court in Bakke or
any other case. Moreover, subsequent Supreme Court decisions
regarding education state that non-remedial state interests will never
justify racial classifications. Finally, the classification of persons on
the basis of race for the purpose of diversity frustrates, rather than
facilitates, the goals of equal protection.

Justice Powell's view in Bakke is not binding precedent on this
issue. While he announced the judgment, no other Justice joined in
that part of the opinion discussing the diversity rationale. In Bakke,
the word "diversity" is mentioned  nowhere except in Justice
Powell's single-Justice opinion. In fact, the four-Justice opinion,
which would have upheld the special admissions program under
intermediate scrutiny, implicitly rejected Justice Powell's position.
See 438 U.S. at 326 n.1 (Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun
JJ., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting) ("We also
agree with Mr. Justice POWELL that a plan like the "Harvard" plan .
. . is constitutional under our approach, at least so long as the use of
race to achieve an integrated student body is necessitated by the
lingering effects of past discrimination.") (emphasis added). Justice
Stevens declined to discuss the constitutional issue. See id. at 412
(Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in
part).

Thus, only one Justice concluded that race could be used solely for
the reason of obtaining a heterogenous student body. As the
Adarand Court states, the Bakke Court did not express a majority
view and is questionable as binding prece- dent. 115 S. Ct. at 2109
("The Court's failure in Bakke . . . left unresolved the proper
analysis for remedial race-based government action.").

Since Bakke, the Court has accepted the diversity rationale only once
in its cases dealing with race. Signifi- cantly, however, in that case,
Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. Federal Communications Comm'n, 497
U.S. 547, 564-65 (1990), the five-Justice majority relied upon an
intermediate scrutiny standard of review to uphold the federal
program seeking diversity in the ownership of broadcasting facilities.
In Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2112-13, the Court squarely rejected
intermediate scrutiny as the standard of review for racial
classifications, and Metro Broadcasting is now specifically overruled
to the extent that it was in conflict with this holding. Id. at 2113. No
case since Bakke has accepted diversity as a compelling state interest
under a strict scrutiny analysis.

Indeed, recent Supreme Court precedent shows that the diversity
interest will not satisfy strict scrutiny. Foremost, the Court appears
to have decided that there is essentially only one compelling state
interest to justify racial classifications: remedying past wrongs. In
Croson, 488 U.S. at 493 (plurality opinion), the Court flatly stated
that "[u]nless [racial classifications] are strictly reserved for remedial
settings, they may in fact promote notions of racial inferiority and
lead to a politics of racial hostility." (emphasis added).

Justice O'Connor, in her Adarand-vindicated dissent in Metro
Broadcasting, joined by Justices Rehnquist, Scalia, and Kennedy,
explained this position:

Modern equal protection has recognized only one [compelling state]
interest: remedying the effects of racial discrimination. The interest
in increasing the diversity of broadcast viewpoints is clearly not a
compelling interest. It is simply too amorphous, too insubstantial,
and too unrelated to any legitimate basis for employing racial
classifications.



497 U.S. at 612 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). Indeed, the majority in
Metro Broadcasting had not claimed otherwise and decided only that
such an interest was "important."  Justice Thomas, who joined the
Court after Metro Broadcasting was decided, roundly condemned
"benign" discrimination in his recent Adarand opinion, in which he
suggests that the diversity rationale is inadequate to meet strict
scrutiny. See Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2119 (Thomas, J., concurring
in part and concurring in judgment).

In short, there has been no indication from the Supreme Court, other
than Justice Powell's lonely opinion in Bakke, that the state's interest
in diversity constitutes a compelling justification for governmental
race-based discrimination. Subsequent Supreme Court caselaw
strongly suggests, in fact, that it is not.

Within the general principles of the Fourteenth Amendment, the use
of race in admissions for diversity in higher education contradicts,
rather than furthers, the aims of equal protection. Diversity fosters,
rather than minimizes, the use of race. It treats minorities as a group,
rather than as individuals. It may further remedial purposes but, just
as likely, may promote improper racial stereotypes, thus fueling
racial hostility.

The use of race, in and of itself, to choose students simply achieves a
student body that looks different. Such a criterion is no more rational
on its own terms than would be choices based upon the physical size
or blood type of applicants. Thus, the Supreme Court has long held
that governmental actors cannot justify their decisions solely because
of race. See, e.g., Croson, 488 U.S. at 496 (plurality opinion);
Bakke, 438 U.S. at 307 (opinion of Powell, J.).

Accordingly, we see the caselaw as sufficiently established that the
use of ethnic diversity simply to achieve racial heterogeneity, even as
part of the consideration of a number of factors, is unconstitutional.
Were we to decide otherwise, we would contravene precedent that
we are not authorized to challenge.

While the use of race per se is proscribed, state- supported schools
may reasonably consider a host of factorsAAsome of which may
have some correlation with raceAAin making admissions decisions.
The federal courts have no warrant to intrude on those executive and
legislative judgments unless the distinctions intrude on specific
provisions of federal law or the Constitution.                 A university
may properly favor one applicant over another be- cause of his ability
to play the cello, make a downfield tack- le, or understand chaos
theory. An admissions process may also consider an applicant's
home state or relationship to school alumni. Law schools specifically
may look at things such as unusual or substantial extracurricular
activities in college, which may be atypical factors affecting
undergraduate grades. Schools may even consider factors such as
whether an applicant's parents attended college or the applicant's
economic and social background.

For this reason, race often is said to be justified in the diversity
context, not on its own terms, but as a proxy for other characteristics
that institutions of higher education value but that do not raise similar
constitutional concerns.  Unfortunately, this approach simply
replicates the very harm that the Fourteenth Amendment was
designed to eliminate.

The assumption is that a certain individual possesses characteristics
by virtue of being a member of a certain racial group. This
assumption, however, does not withstand scrutiny. "[T]he use of a
racial characteristic to establish a presumption that the individual also
possesses other, and socially relevant, characteristics, exemplifies,
encourages, and legitimizes the mode of thought and behavior that
underlies most prejudice and bigotry in modern America."  Richard
A. Posner, The DeFunis Case and the Constitutionality of
Preferential Treatment of Racial Minorities, 1974 Sup. Ct. Rev. 12
(1974).

To believe that a person's race controls his point of view is to
stereotype him. The Supreme Court, however, "has remarked a
number of times, in slightly different contexts, that it is incorrect and
legally inappropriate to impute to women and minorities 'a different
attitude about such issues as the federal budget, school prayer,
voting, and foreign relations.'"  Michael S. Paulsen, Reverse
Discrimination and Law School Faculty Hiring:  The Undiscovered
Opinion, 71 Tex. L. Rev. 993, 1000 (1993) (quoting Roberts v.
United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 627-28 (1984)). "Social
scientists may debate how peoples' thoughts and behavior reflect
their background, but the Constitution provides that the government
may not allocate benefits or burdens among individuals based on the
assumption that race or ethnicity determines how they act or think."
Metro Broadcasting, 497 U.S. at 602 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).

Instead, individuals, with their own conceptions of life, further
diversity of viewpoint. Plaintiff Hopwood is a fair example of an
applicant with a unique background.  She is the now-thirty-two-
year-old wife of a member of the Armed Forces stationed in San
Antonio and, more significantly, is raising a severely handicapped
child. Her circumstance would bring a different perspective to the
law school. The school might consider this an advantage to her in
the application process, or it could decide that her family situation
would be too much of a burden on her academic performance.

We do not opine on which way the law school should weigh
Hopwood's qualifications; we only observe that "diversity" can take
many forms. To foster such diversity, state universities and law
schools and other governmental entities must scru- tinize applicants
individually, rather than resorting to the dangerous proxy of race.

The Court also has recognized that government's use of racial
classifications serves to stigmatize. See, e.g., Brown v. Board of
Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 494 (1954) (observing that classification on
the basis of race "generates a feeling of inferiority"). While one
might argue that the stigmatization resulting from so-called "benign"
racial classifications is not as harmful as that arising from invidious
ones,  the current Court has now retreated from the idea that so-called
benign and invidious classifications may be distinguished.  As the
plurality in Croson warned, "[c]lassifications based on race carry the
danger of stigmatic harm. Unless they are reserved for remedial
settings, they may in fact promote notions of racial inferiority and
lead to the politics of racial hostility."  488 U.S. at 493.

Finally, the use of race to achieve diversity undercuts the ultimate
goal of the Fourteenth Amendment:  the end of racially- motivated
state action. Justice Powell's conception of race as a "plus" factor
would allow race always to be a potential factor in admissions
decisionmaking. While Justice Blackmun recognized the tension
inherent in using race- conscious remedies to achieve a race-neutral
society, he nevertheless accepted it as necessary. Bakke, 438 U.S.
at 405. Several Justices who, unlike Justices Powell and Blackmun,
are still on the Court, have now renounced toleration of this tension,
however. See Croson, 488 U.S. at 495 (plurality opinion of
O'Connor, J.) ("The dissent's watered down version of equal
protection review effectively assures that race will always be relevant
in American life, and that the 'ultimate goal' of 'eliminat[ing] entirely
from government decisionmaking such irrelevant factors as a human
being's race . . . will never be achieved.") (quoting Wygant, 476
U.S. at 320 (Stevens, J., dissenting)).

In sum, the use of race to achieve a diverse student body, whether as
a proxy for permissible characteristics, simply cannot be a state
interest compelling enough to meet the steep standard of strict
scrutiny.  These latter factors may, in fact, turn out to be
substantially correlated with race, but the key is that race itself not be
taken into account. Thus, that portion of the district court's opinion
upholding the diversity rationale is reversibly flawed.



B.

We now turn to the district court's determination that "the remedial
purpose of the law school's affirmative action program is a
compelling government objective."  861 F. Supp. at 573. The
plaintiffs argue that the court erred by finding that the law school
could employ racial criteria to remedy the present effects of past
discrimination in Texas's primary and secondary schools. The
plaintiffs contend that the proper unit for analysis is the law school,
and the state has shown no recognizable present effects of the law
school's past discrimination. The law school, in response, notes
Texas's well-documented history of discrimination in education and
argues that its effects continue today at the law school, both in the
level of educational attainment of the average minority applicant and
in the school's reputation.

In contrast to its approach to the diversity rationale, a majority of the
Supreme Court has held that a state actor may racially classify where
it has a "strong basis in the evidence for its conclusion that remedial
action was neces- sary."  Croson, 488 U.S. at 500 (quoting Wygant,
476 U.S. at 277 (plurality opinion)). Generally, "[i]n order to justify
an affirmative action program, the State must show there are 'present
effects of past discrimination.'"  Hopwood v. Texas ("Hopwood I"),
21 F.3d 603, 605 (5th Cir. 1994) (per curiam) (quoting Podberesky
v. Kirwan, 956 F.2d 52, 57 (4th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct.
2001 (1995)); see also Wygant, 476 U.S. at 280 (opining that "in
order to remedy the effects of prior discrimination, it may be
necessary to take race into account") (opinion of Powell, J.).

Because a state does not have a compelling state interest in remedying
the present effects of past societal discrimination, however, we must
examine the district court's legal determination that the relevant
governmental entity is the system of education within the state as a
whole. Moreover, we also must review the court's identification of
what types of present effects of past discrimination, if proven, would
be sufficient under strict scrutiny review. Finally, where the state
actor puts forth a remedial jus- tification for its racial classifications,
the district court must make a "factual determination" as to whether
remedial action is necessary. Wygant, 476 U.S. at 277-78. We
review such factual rulings for clear error.



1.

The Supreme Court has "insisted upon some showing of prior
discrimination by the governmental unit involved before allowing
limited use of racial classifications in order to remedy such
discrimination."  Wygant, 476 U.S. at 274 (plurality opinion of
Powell, J.) (citing Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States, 433
U.S. 299 (1977)).  In Wygant, the Court analyzed a collective
bargaining agreement between a school board and a teacher's union
that allowed the board to give minorities preferential treatment in the
event of layoffs. A plurality rejected the theory that such a program
was justified because it provided minority role models. Id. at 274-77
(plurality opinion). Such a claim was based upon remedying
"societal discrimination," a rationale the Court consistently has
rejected as a basis for affirmative action. Accordingly, the state's use
of remedial racial classi- fications is limited to the harm caused by a
specific state actor.

Moreover, the plurality in Wygant held that before a state actor
properly could implement such a plan, it "must ensure that . . . it has
strong evidence that remedial action is warranted."  Id. at 277.
Accord id. at 289 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment). The plurality felt that "[i]n the absence of
particularized findings, a court could uphold remedies that are ageless
in their reach into the past, and timeless in their ability to affect the
future."  Id. at 276.

The Croson Court further discussed how to identify the relevant past
discriminator. Writing for the Court, Justice O'Connor struck down
a minority business set-aside program implemented by the City of
Richmond and justified on remedial grounds. While the district court
opined that sufficient evidence had been found by the city to believe
that such a program was necessary to remedy the present effects of
past discrimination in the construction industry, the Court held:

Like the "role model" theory employed in Wygant, a generalized
assertion that there had been past discrimination in an entire industry
provides no guidance for a legislative body to determine the precise
scope of the injury it seeks to remedy. It 'has no logical stopping
point.' Wygant, 476 U.S. at 275 (plurality opinion). 'Relief' for
such an ill-defined wrong could extend until the percentage of public
contracts awarded to [minority businesses] in Richmond mirrored the
percentage of minorities in the population as a whole.



488 U.S. at 498.  The Court refused to accept indicia of past
discrimination in anything but "the Richmond construction industry."
Id. at 505.

In addition, in a passage of particular significance to the instant case,
the Court analogized the employment contractor situation to that of
higher education and noted that "[l]ike claims that discrimination in
primary and secondary schooling justifies a rigid racial preference in
medical school admissions, an amorphous claim that there has been
past discrimination in a particular industry cannot justify the use of an
unyielding quota."  Id. at 499. Such claims were based upon "sheer
speculation" about how many minorities would be in the contracting
business absent past discrimination. Id.

Applying the teachings of Croson and Wygant, we conclude that the
district court erred in expanding the remedial justification to reach all
public education within the State of Texas. The Supreme Court
repeatedly has warned that the use of racial remedies must be
carefully limited, and a remedy reaching all education within a state
addresses a putative injury that is vague and amorphous. It has "no
logical stopping point."  Wygant, 476 U.S. at 275 (plurality
opinion).

The district court's holding employs no viable limiting principle. If a
state can "remedy" the present effects of past discrimination in its
primary and secondary schools, it also would be allowed to award
broad-based preferences in hiring, government contracts, licensing,
and any other state activity that in some way is affected by the
educational attainment of the applicants. This very argument was
made in Croson and rejected:

The "evidence" relied upon by the dissent, history of school
desegregation in Richmond and numerous congressional reports,
does little to define the scope of any injury to minority contractors in
Richmond or the necessary remedy. The factors relied upon by the
dissent could justify a preference of any size or duration.



488 U.S. at 505. The defendants' argument here is equally
expansive.

Strict scrutiny is meant to ensure that the purpose of a racial
preference is remedial. Yet when one state actor begins to justify
racial preferences based upon the actions of other state agencies, the
remedial actor's competence to determine the existence and scope of
the harm**and the appropriate reach of the remedy**is called into
question. The school desegregation cases, for example, concentrate
on school districts**singular government units**and the use of
interdistrict remedies is strictly limited. See Missouri v. Jenkins, 115
S. Ct. 2038, 2048 (1995); Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 745
(1974) ("[W]ithout an interdistrict violation and interdistrict effect,
there is no constitutional wrong calling for an interdistrict remedy.").
Thus, one justification for limiting the remedial powers of a state
actor is that the specific agency involved is best able to measure the
harm of its past discrimination.

Here, however, the law school has no comparative advantage in
measuring the present effects of discrimination in primary and
secondary schools in Texas. Such a task becomes even more
improbable where, as here, benefits are conferred on students who
attended out-of-state or private schools for such education. Such
boundless "remedies" raise a constitutional concern beyond mere
competence. In this situation, an inference is raised that the program
was the result of racial social engineering rather a desire to implement
a remedy.

No one disputes that in the past, Texas state actors have
discriminated against some minorities in public schools. In this
sense, some lingering effects of such discrimination is not "societal,"
if that term is meant to exclude all state action. But the very program
at issue here shows how remedying such past wrongs may be
expanded beyond any reasonable limits.

Even if, arguendo, the state is the proper government unit to
scrutinize, the law school's admissions program would not withstand
our review. For the admissions scheme to pass constitutional
muster, the State of Texas, through its legislature, would have to find
that past segregation has present effects; it would have to determine
the magnitude of those present effects; and it would need to limit
carefully the "plus" given to applicants to remedy that harm. A broad
program that sweeps in all minorities with a remedy that is in no way
related to past harms cannot survive constitutional scrutiny.
Obviously, none of those predicates has been satisfied here.

We further reject the proposition that the University of Texas
System, rather than the law school, is the appropriate governmental
unit for measuring a constitutional remedy. The law school operates
as a functionally separate unit within the system. As with all law
schools, it maintains its own separate admissions program. The law
school hires faculty members that meet the unique requirements of a
law school and has its own deans for administrative purposes. Thus,
for much the same reason that we rejected the educational system as
the proper measure**generally ensuring that the legally-imposed
racially discriminatory program is remedial**we conclude that the
University of Texas System is itself too expansive an entity to
scrutinize for past discrimination.

In sum, for purposes of determining whether the law school's
admissions system properly can act as a remedy for the present
effects of past discrimination, we must identify the law school as the
relevant alleged past discriminator. The fact that the law school
ultimately may be subject to the directives of others, such as the
board of regents, the university president, or the legislature, does not
change the fact that the relevant putative discriminator in this case is
still the law school. In order for any of these entities to direct a racial
preference program at the law school, it must be because of past
wrongs at that school.



2.

Next, the relevant governmental discriminator must prove that there
are present effects of past discrimination of the type that justify the
racial classifications at issue:

To have a present effect of past discrimination sufficient to justify the
program, the party seeking to implement the program must, at a
minimum, prove that the effect it proffers is caused by the past
discrimination and that the effect is of sufficient magnitude to justify
the program.



Podberesky v. Kirwan, 38 F.3d 147, 153 (4th Cir. 1994), cert.
denied, 115 S. Ct. 2001 (1995). Moreover, as part of showing that
the alleged present effects of past discrimination in fact justify the
racial preference program at issue, the law school must show that it
adopted the program specifically to remedy the identified present
effects of the past discrimination.

Here, according to the district court:  "The evidence presented at trial
indicates those effects include the law school's lingering reputation in
the minority community, particularly with prospective students, as a
"white" school; an underrepresentation of minorities in the student
body; and some perception that the law school is a hostile
environment for minorities."  861 F. Supp. at 572. Plaintiffs now
argue that these three alleged effects are at most examples of societal
discrimination, which the Supreme Court has found not to be a valid
remedial basis. "The effects must themselves be examined to see
whether they were caused by the past discrimination and whether
they are of a type that justifies the program."  Podberesky, 38 F.3d at
154.

As a legal matter, the district court erred in concluding that the first
and third effects it identified**bad reputation and hostile
environment**were sufficient to sustain the use of race in the
admissions process. The Fourth Circuit examined similar arguments
in Podberesky, a recent case that struck down the use of race-based
scholarships. The university in that case sought, in part, to justify a
separate scholarship program based solely upon race because of the
university's "poor reputation within the African-American
community" and because "the atmosphere on campus [was]
perceived as being hostile to African-American students."  Id. at 152.

The Podberesky court rejected the notion that either of these
rationales could support the single-race scholarship program. The
court reasoned that any poor reputation by the school "is tied solely
to knowledge of the University's discrimination before it admitted
African-American students."  Id. at 154. The court found that "mere
knowledge of histori- cal fact is not the kind of present effect that can
justify a race-exclusive remedy. If it were otherwise, as long as there
are people who have access to history books, there will be programs
such as this."  Id.

We concur in the Fourth Circuit's observation that knowledge of
historical fact simply cannot justify current racial classifications.
Even if, as the defendants argue, the law school may have a bad
reputation in the minority community, "[t]he case against race-based
preferences does not rest on the sterile assumption that American
society is untouched or unaffected by the tragic oppression of its
past."  Maryland Troopers Ass'n v. Evans, 993 F.2d 1072, 1079
(4th Cir. 1993). "Rather, it is the very enormity of that tragedy that
lends resolve to the desire to never repeat it, and find a legal order in
which distinctions based on race shall have no place."  Id.
Moreover, we note that the law school's argument is even weaker
than that of the university in Podberesky, as there is no dispute that
the law school has never had an admissions policy that excluded
Mexican Americans on the basis of race.

The Podberesky court rejected the hostile-environment claims by
observing that the "effects"**that is, racial tensions**were the result
of present societal discrimination. 38 F.3d at 155. There was
simply no showing of action by the university that contributed to any
racial tension. Similarly, one cannot conclude that the law school's
past discrimination has created any current hostile environment for
minorities. While the school once did practice de jure discrimination
in denying admission to blacks, the Court in Sweatt v. Painter, 339
U.S. 629 (1950), struck down the law school's program. Any other
discrimination by the law school ended in the 1960's. Hopwood,
861 F. Supp. at 555.

By the late 1960's, the school had implemented its first program
designed to recruit minorities, id. at 557, and it now engages in an
extensive minority recruiting program that includes a significant
amount of scholarship money. The vast majority of the faculty,
staff, and students at the law school had absolutely nothing to do
with any discrimination that the law school practiced in the past.

In such a case, one cannot conclude that a hostile environment is the
present effect of past discrimination. Any racial tension at the law
school is most certainly the result of present societal discrimination
and, if anything, is contributed to, rather than alleviated by, the overt
and prevalent consideration of race in admissions.

Even if the law school's alleged current lingering reputation in the
minority community**and the perception that the school is a hostile
environment for minorities**were considered to be the present
effects of past discrimination, rather than the result of societal
discrimination, they could not constitute compelling state interests
justifying the use of racial classifications in admissions. A bad
reputation within the minority community is alleviated not by the
consideration of race in admissions, but by school action designed
directly to enhance its reputation in that community.

Minority students who are aided by the law school's racial
preferences have already made the decision to apply, despite the
reputation. And, while prior knowledge that they will get a "plus"
might make potential minorities more likely to apply, such an
inducement does nothing, per se, to change any hostile environment.
As we have noted, racial preferences, if anything, can compound the
problem of a hostile environment.

The law school wisely concentrates only on the second effect the
district court identified:  underrepresentation of minorities because of
past discrimination. The law school argues that we should consider
the prior discrimination by the State of Texas and its educational
system rather than of the law school. The school contends that this
prior discrimination by the state had a direct effect on the educational
attainment of the pool of minority applicants and that the
discriminatory admissions program was implemented partially to
discharge the school's duty of eliminating the vestiges of past
segregation.

As we have noted, the district court accepted the law school's
argument that past discrimination on the part of the Texas school
system (including primary and secondary schools), reaching back
perhaps as far as the education of the parents of today's students,
justifies the current use of racial classifications.  No one disputes
that Texas has a history of racial discrimination in education. We
have already discussed, however, that the Croson Court
unequivocally restricted the proper scope of the remedial interest to
the state actor that had previously discriminated. 488 U.S. at 499.
The district court squarely found that "[i]n recent history, there is no
evidence of overt officially sanctioned discrimination at the
University of Texas."  861 F. Supp. at 572. As a result, past
discrimination in education, other than at the law school, cannot
justify the present consideration of race in law school admissions.

The law school now attempts to circumvent this result by claiming
that its racial preference program is really a "State of Texas" plan
rather than a law school program. Under the law school's reading of
the facts, its program was the direct result of the state's negotiations
with what was then the United States Department of Health,
Education and Welfare's Office for Civil Rights ("OCR"). To bring
the Texas public higher education system into compliance with title
VI, the state adopted the so-called "Texas Plan."

In light of our preceding discussion on the relevant governmental
unit, this argument is inapposite. Even if the law school were
specifically ordered to adopt a racial preference program, its
implementation at the law school would have to meet the
requirements of strict scrutiny.

Moreover, these alleged actions in the 1980's are largely irrelevant
for purposes of this appeal. There is no indication that the Texas
Plan imposed a direct obligation upon the law school. To the
contrary, the law school's admissions program was self-initiated.
Moreover, the current admissions program was formulated primarily
in the 1990's, and the district court did not hold otherwise. See 861
F. Supp. at 557 ("Against this historical backdrop [including Texas's
dealing with the OCR], the law school's commitment to affirmative
action in the admissions process evolved."). Thus it is no more
correct to say that the State of Texas implemented the program at
issue than it is to assert that the Commonwealth of Virginia, not the
City of Richmond, was responsible for the minority set-aside
program in Croson.

The district court also sought to find a remedial justification for the
use of race and, at the same time, attempted to distinguish Croson
using United States v. Fordice, 505 U.S. 717 (1992). The court
held that the law school had a compelling interest to "desegregate" the
school through affirmative action.                 The reliance upon
Fordice is misplaced, however. The district court held that Fordice's
mandate to schools "to eliminate every vestige of racial segregation
and discrimination" made Croson inapplicable, 861 F. Supp. at 571,
and reasoned that this mandate includes the effects of such prior
practices or policies.

Fordice does not overrule Croson. The central holding of Fordice is
that a state or one of its subdivisions must act to repudiate the
continuing "policies or practices" of discrimination. 505 U.S. at
731-32.  In other words, a state has an affirmative duty to remove
policies, tied to the past, by which it continues to discriminate. The
Fordice Court did not address, in any way, a state actor's duty to
counter the present effects of past discrimination that it did not cause.

In sum, the law school has failed to show a compelling state interest
in remedying the present effects of past discrimination sufficient to
maintain the use of race in its admissions system. Accordingly, it is
unnecessary for us to examine the district court's determination that
the law school's admissions program was not narrowly tailored to
meet the compelling interests that the district court erroneously
perceived.



IV.

While the district court declared the admissions program
unconstitutional, it granted the plaintiffs only limited relief. They had
requested injunctive relief ordering that they be admitted to law
school, compensatory and punitive damages, and prospective
injunctive relief preventing the school from using race as a factor in
admissions.



A.

We must decide who bears the burden of proof on the damages
issue. The district court refused to order the plaintiffs' admission (or
award any compensatory damages), as it found that they had not met
their burden of persuasion in attempting to show that they would
have been admitted absent the unconstitutional system. 861 F. Supp.
at 579-82.  The law school now argues that the plaintiffs had the
burden of persuasion on the issue of damages and that the district
court's findings are not clearly erroneous.  The plaintiffs maintain,
as they did in the district court, that once they had shown a
constitutional violation, the burden of persuasion shifted to the
school to show that the denial of admission was not caused by that
violation.

The well-established rule is that in order to collect money damages,
plaintiffs must prove that they have been injured. Carey v. Piphus,
435 U.S. 247, 254-57 (1978). Several Supreme Court cases,
however, allow for a transfer of burden upon proof of
discrimination. See Mt. Healthy City Sch., Dist. Bd. of Educ. v.
Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 284 (1977); City of Arlington Heights v.
Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265-66 (1977).

In Mt. Healthy, a discharged school teacher sued for reinstatement,
claiming his termination was a result of comments he had made on a
radio show, a violation of his First and Fourteenth Amendment
rights. The Court devised a test of "causation" that placed the burden
of proving no harm on the defendant:

Initially, . . . the burden was properly placed upon the respondent to
show that his conduct was constitutionally protected, and that this
conduct was a "substantial factor"AAor to put it in other words, that
it was a "motivating factor" in the Board's decision not to rehire him.
Respondent having carried that burden, however, the District Court
should have gone on to determine whether the Board had shown by a
preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same
decision as to the respondent's reemployment even in the absence of
the protected conduct.



429 U.S. at 287. In Arlington Heights, the Court applied a similar
rule where the decision of a zoning board was challenged as racially
discriminatory. See 429 U.S. at 270 n.21. In sum, these cases
allow a defendant, who intended to discriminate or otherwise act
unconstitutionally, to show that its action would have occurred
regardless of that intent.

Courts are split on whether the Mt. Healthy rubric applies in racial
preference cases.  We conclude that the Mt. Healthy methodology is
appropriate in the instant case. The Mt. Healthy plaintiff, like the
present plaintiffs, brought a constitutional challenge, and his injuries
were analogous to the injuries alleged here. As we have said, the title
VII burden-shifting scheme is designed to determine whether a
violation of law has occurred.

In this case, there is no question that a constitutional violation has
occurred (as the district court found) and that the plaintiffs were
harmed thereby. See Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2105 ("The injury in
cases of this kind is that a 'discriminatory classification prevent[s] the
plaintiff from competing on an equal footing.'") (citation omitted).
The Mt. Healthy burden-shifting exercise simply gives the defendant
law school a second chance of prevailing by showing that the
violation was largely harmless.

As the district court held, to the contrary, that plaintiffs had the
burden, it should revisit this issue in light of what we have said in
both the liability and remedial portions of this opinion.  In the event
that the law school is unable to show (by a preponderance of the
evidence) that a respective plaintiff would not have been admitted to
the law school under a constitutional admissions system, the court is
to award to that plaintiff any equitable and/or monetary relief it deems
appropriate.

Obviously, if the school proves that a plaintiff would not have gained
admittance to the law school under a race- blind system, that plaintiff
would not be entitled to an injunction admitting him to the school.
On the other hand, the law school's inability to establish a plaintiff's
non- admission**if that occurs on remand**opens a panoply of
potential relief, depending in part upon what course that plaintiff's
career has taken since trial in mid-1994. It then would be up to the
district court, in its able discretion, to decide whether money
damages  can substitute for an order of immediate admission**relief
that would ring hollow for a plaintiff for whom an education at the
law school now is of little or no benefit.

Additionally, the district court erred in holding that plaintiffs did not
prove that defendants had committed intentional discrimination under
title VI. "Intentional discrimination," as used in this context, means
that a plaintiff must prove "that the governmental actor, in adopting
or employing the challenged practices or undertaking the challenged
action, intended to treat similarly situated persons differently on the
basis of race."  Castaneda v. Pickard, 648 F.2d 989, 1000 (5th Cir.
Unit A June 1981); see also Franklin v. Gwinnett County Pub. Sch.,
503 U.S. 60 (1992);  Guardians Ass'n v. Civil Serv. Comm'n, 463
U.S. 582 (1983). While we agree with the district court's
conclusion that the various defendants acted in good faith, there is no
question that they intended to treat the plaintiffs differently on
account of their race.



B.

The plaintiffs argue that, because they proved a constitutional
violation, and further violations were likely to result, the district court
erred in denying them prospective injunctive relief. We review
denials of this sort of relief for an abuse of discretion. See, e.g.,
Peaches Entertainment Corp. v. Entertainment Repertoire, 62 F.3d
690, 693 (5th Cir. 1995).  The law school avers that the district
court was well within its equitable discretion in denying relief,
especially as the school had abandoned the practices that the district
court had found were unconstitutional**to- wit, the use of separate
admissions committees for whites and minorities.

We review denials of prospective injunctive relief as we would any
other denial of permanent injunctive relief under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65,
keeping in mind, however, the questions of mootness, ripeness, and
standing. See generally 11A Charles A. Wright et al., Federal
Practice and Procedure  2942 (2d ed. 1995). That treatise notes that

[p]erhaps the most significant single component in the judicial
decision whether to exercise equity jurisdiction and grant permanent
injunctive relief is the court's discretion. Of course, in some
situations the facts and relevant law may indicate that an injunction
clearly should be granted or denied. However, in most cases the
determination whether to issue an injunction involves a balancing of
interests of the parties who might be affected by the court's
decisionAAthe hardship on the plaintiff if relief is denied as
compared to the defendant if relief is granted and the extent to which
the latter hardship can be mitigated by requiring a security bond. Not
surprisingly, therefore, the court's decision depends on the
circumstances of each case.



Id. at 41-42. Accordingly, the usual practice upon reversal of a
denial of injunctive relief is to remand for a reweighing of the
equities. Id. 2962, at 448;  See, e.g., James v. Stockham Valves
& Fittings Co., 559 F.2d 310, 354-55 (5th Cir. 1977). In other
situations, the appellate court may order the district court to enter an
injunction. See, e.g., South- eastern Promotions, Ltd. v. City of
Mobile, 457 F.2d 340 (5th Cir. 1972).

According to the district court, the school had abandoned the
admissions procedure**consisting of the separate minority
subcommittee**that was used in 1992, 1993, and 1994. The court
reasoned that, as a new procedure was developed for 1995, a
prospective injunction against the school was inappropriate. We
conclude, however, that, while the district court may have been
correct in deciding that the new procedure eliminates the
constitutional flaws that the district court identified in the 1992
system, there is no indication that the new system will cure the
additional constitutional defects we now have explained.

The new system utilizes a small "administrative admissions group"
and does not use presumptive admission and denial scores. See
Hopwood, 861 F. Supp. at 582 n.87. Most significantly, there is no
indication that in employing the new plan, the law school will cease
to consider race per se in making its admissions decisions. To the
contrary, as the district court recognized, the law school continues to
assert that overt racial preferences are necessary to the attainment of
its goals. See Hopwood, 861 F. Supp. at 573-75.

The district court has already granted some equitable relief:  It
directed that the plaintiffs be permitted to re- apply to the law school
without incurring further adminis- trative costs. In accordance with
this opinion, the plaintiffs are entitled to apply under a system of
admissions that will not discriminate against anyone on the basis of
race. Moreover, the plaintiffs have shown that it is likely that the law
school will continue to take race into account in admissions unless it
receives further judicial instruction to the effect that it may not do so
for the purpose of (1) obtaining a diverse student body; (2) altering
the school's reputation in the community; (3) combating the school's
perceived hostile environment toward minorities; or (4) remedying
the present effects of past discrimination by actors other than the law
school.

It is not necessary, however, for us to order at this time that the law
school be enjoined, as we are confident that the conscientious
administration at the school, as well as its attorneys, will heed the
directives contained in this opinion. If an injunction should be
needed in the future, the district court, in its discretion, can consider
its parameters without our assistance. Accordingly, we leave intact
that court's refusal to enter an injunction.



C.

The plaintiffs contend that the district court's application of the
wrong standard causes it to deny punitive damages. The plaintiffs
aver that the court applied an animus standard, when it should have
asked whether the school acted with "reckless indifference" to their
constitutional rights. They ask for a remand on this issue.

It is not apparent, from the record, what standard the district court
applied in considering the punitive damages issue. The court did
determine, however, that the law school had always acted in good
faith. This is a difficult area of the law, in which the law school
erred with the best of intentions. As a result, the plaintiffs have not
met the federal standard for punitive damages as stated in Smith v.
Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 56 (1983). Thus, we agree with the district
court that punitive damages are not warranted. We note, however,
that if the law school continues to operate a disguised or overt racial
classification system in the future, its actors could be subject to actual
and punitive damages.



V.

Consolidated with the appeal of the merits issues of this appeal is
No. 94-50569, challenging the district court's denial of a motion to
intervene. The proposed intervenors** the Thurgood Marshall Legal
Society and the Black Pre-Law Association (the "associations")**ask
this court, for the second time, for the right to intervene. On their
first attempt, the associations moved to intervene prior to trial either
as of right or by permission. The district court denied intervention,
and we affirmed. See Hopwood v. Texas, 21 F.3d 603 (5th Cir.
1994) (per curiam) ("Hopwood I").

Now, following the trial, the associations believe they can show that
the law school has failed to assert one of their proposed defenses, a
circumstance they contend establishes their right to intervene. We
apply the law of the case doc- trine and dismiss No. 94-50569 for
want of jurisdiction.



A.

The proposed intervenors are black student organizations at the
University of Texas at Austin and its law school that, just prior to the
trial of the merits appeal, sought to intervene, arguing that the law
school would not effectively protect their interests in continuing racial
preferences at the law school. The district court denied the proposed
intervention on the ground that the law school and the two
associations had the same objective:  preservation of the status quo.

On expedited appeal, this court affirmed on the ground that the
associations had failed to show that the law school had an interest
different from theirs. We also commented that the two groups had
failed to show "a separate defense of the affirmative action plan that
the State has failed to assert."  Id. at 606. The panel implicitly
considered and rejected, as one potential divergence of interests, the
possibility that the law school would not raise a defense based upon
the legality of the use of TI scores under title VI, as the associations
argued that possibility as one basis for intervention.

After their first motion to intervene was denied, the associations
remained involved in the case. Throughout the course of the trial,
they acted as amici curiae. And, at the close of trial but before
judgment, the district court intimated that it would allow them to
submit information for the record. Accordingly, the associations
sought to introduce testimonial and documentary evidence supporting
their arguments that (1) the TI by itself was an unlawful basis for
admissions decisions under title VI and (2) that affirmative action at
the university was constitutionally required. The plaintiffs opposed
the introduction of evidence on these "new defenses," and the district
court agreed. The associations were allowed to submit amicus briefs
and highlight evidence that was already in the record but were not
allowed to raise new issues or supplement the record.

Shortly thereafter, the associations again sought to intervene under
Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2) (intervention as of right),  claiming that the
law school had failed to raise their two "new defenses" and,
accordingly, that events now showed that that representation
inadequately protected their interests. They sought to reopen the
record to introduce evidence supporting these arguments.

The district court summarily refused this request. That order is the
focus of this separate appeal, in which the associations present only
the title VI defense and ask to be allowed to present such evidence
only if we do not affirm the judgment.



B.

There is no caselaw in this circuit that directly addresses how to
review successive motions to intervene.  The parties direct us to
Hodgson v. United Mine Workers, 473 F.2d 118, 125-26 (D.C.
Cir. 1972); United States Envt'l Protection Agency v. City of Green
Forest, 921 F.2d 1394, 1401 (8th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 502 U.S.
956 (1991); and Meek v. Metropolitan Dade County, 985 F.2d 1471,
1477 (11th Cir. 1993). These courts, which were examining
whether the appeal from a successive motion was timely as per the
appellate requirements, devised the general rule that a second motion
would be treated as independent of the first if it was reached under
materially changed circumstances.

Here, the associations assume that their second intervention motion is
separate and distinct from their earlier failed attempt, because the law
school's failure to raise their proposed defense constitutes a changed
circumstance.  Thus, they ask that we engage in de novo review of
their motion.

The plaintiffs, however, note that this motion was entitled a
"renewed motion for intervention."  The plaintiffs argue that the
district court was reconsidering its previous denial order under its
Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) powers, and we should review merely for
abuse of discretion.



C.

While the "changed circumstances" test may have merit** an issue
we do not decide today**we do not find it applicable to this case.
Instead, the "law of the case" doctrine militates against
reconsideration of this motion. Normally, when a prior panel
discusses an issue on the merits, a later panel cannot reach a contrary
conclusion under the preclusive principle of law of the case. See
Williams v. City of New Orleans, 763 F.2d 667, 669 (5th Cir.
1985). There is no question that the Hopwood I panel addressed the
intervention as a matter of right de novo, on the merits, including the
potential that the law school would not raise every defense proposed
by the associations.

The question of whether we can rely upon the law of the case
doctrine, however, is clouded because of the "anomalous" rule that
exists in this circuit concerning the procedural posture of these
intervention cases. Under that rule, we have only provisional
jurisdiction to review a district court's denial of a motion to
intervene.

If we agree with the district court, our jurisdiction "evaporates."
Hence, the denial of leave to intervene when the party had a right to
intervene is immediately appealable. On appeal, however, our rule
"requires a merit review of any claim of intervention in order for [us]
to determine whether or not the district court's order is appealable."
Weiser v. White, 505 F.2d 912, 916 (5th Cir. 1975). If the claim is
without merit, then the order "is not appealable, the appellate court
has no jurisdiction, and the appeal should be dismissed."  Id. Thus,
despite the merits review, this is a dismissal for want of jurisdiction.

Our anomalous rule complicates the analysis of the preclusive effects
of the prior panel decision, because dismissals for lack of jurisdiction
normally do not have preclusive effect. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P.
41(b). Accordingly, while appellate courts review denials of
intervention motions on the merits, it is uncertain to what extent such
a review has preclusive effect. Nonetheless, we recognize the
possibility of issue preclusion on the question of jurisdiction itself.

While a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction does not operate as an
adjudication on the merits, "[t]his provision means only that the
dismissal permits a second action on the same claim that corrects the
deficiency found in the first action. The judgment remains effective
to preclude relitigation of the precise issue of jurisdiction or venue
that led to the initial dismissal."  7C Wright et al., supra,  4436, at
338.  Thus, a party is precluded from successively appealing the
same intervention motion.

Here, the record shows that the associations raised this same title VI
argument before the Hopwood I panel in both their brief and at oral
argument. That panel, reviewing de novo the merits of the
associations' claims, denied intervention. Accordingly, the last panel
implicitly addressed this issue, and we must respect its decision to
deny intervention. The law of the case doctrine prevents merits
review, and we dismiss No. 94-50569 for want of jurisdiction.



VI.

In summary, we hold that the University of Texas School of Law
may not use race as a factor in deciding which applicants to admit in
order to achieve a diverse student body, to combat the perceived
effects of a hostile environment at the law school, to alleviate the law
school's poor reputation in the minority community, or to eliminate
any present effects of past discrimination by actors other than the law
school. Because the law school has proffered these justifications for
its use of race in admissions, the plaintiffs have satisfied their burden
of showing that they were scrutinized under an unconstitutional
admissions system. The plaintiffs are entitled to reapply under an
admissions system that invokes none of these serious constitutional
infirmities. We also direct the district court to reconsider the question
of damages, and we conclude that the proposed intervenors properly
were denied intervention.

In No. 94-50569, the appeal is DISMISSED for want of jurisdiction.
In No. 94-50664, the judgment is REVERSED and REMANDED for
further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.



WIENER, Circuit Judge, specially concurring.



"We judge best when we judge least, particularly in controversial
matters of high public interest."   In this and every other appeal, we
should decide only the case before us, and should do so on the
narrowest possible basis. Mindful of this credo, I concur in part
and, with respect, specially concur in part.

The sole substantive issue in this appeal is whether the admissions
process employed by the law school for 1992 meets muster under the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The law
school  offers alternative justifications for its race-based admissions
process, each of which, it insists, is a compelling interest: (1)
remedying the present effects of past discrimination (present effects)
and (2) providing the educational benefits that can be obtained only
when the student body is diverse (diversity).          As to present
effects, I concur in the panel opinions analysis:  Irrespective of
whether the law school or the University of Texas system as a whole
is deemed the relevant governmental unit to be tested,  neither has
established the existence of present effects of past discrimination
sufficient to justify the use of a racial classification.  As to diversity,
however, I respectfully disagree with the panel opinions conclusion
that diversity can never be a compelling governmental interest in a
public graduate school. Rather than attempt to decide that issue, I
would  take a considerably narrower path *  and, I believe, a more
appropriate one * to reach an equally narrow result: I would assume
arguendo that diversity can be a compelling interest but conclude that
the admissions process here under scrutiny was not narrowly tailored
to achieve diversity.



I

THE LAW

A.       Equal Protection

The Equal Protection Clause provides that "[n]o State shall . . . deny
to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."
Accordingly, "all racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal,
state, or local governmental actor, must be analyzed by a reviewing
court under strict scrutiny."   Racial classifications will survive strict
scrutiny "only if they are narrowly tailored measures that further
compelling governmental interests."   Thus, strict scrutiny comprises
two inquiries of equal valence:  the "compelling interest" inquiry and
the "narrow tailoring" inquiry.  Moreover, these inquiries are
conjunctive: To avoid constitutional nullity, a racial classification
must satisfy both inquiries. Failure to satisfy either is fatal.



B.       Racial Classification

None dispute that the law school's admission process for 1992
employed a racial classification. Depending on an applicant's race,
his request for admission was considered under one of three different
(and, as explained in the panel opinion, often dispositive ) TI
admission ranges:  one for blacks only, a  second for Mexican
Americans only, and a third for all other races and nationalities,
including non-Mexican Hispanic Americans. In short, each applicant
for admission to the law school was classified by race, and his
application was treated differently  according into which of those
three  racial classifications it fell. Thus, the law school's 1992
admissions process, like all racial classifications by the government,
is subject to strict scrutiny.





C.       Strict Scrutiny

The law school contends that it employs a racially stratified
admissions process to obtain, inter alia, the educational benefits of a
diverse student body. Translated into the constitutional idiom, the
law school insists that achieving student body diversity in a public
graduate school is a compelling governmental interest. The law
school invokes the opinion of Justice Powell in Regents of the
University of California v. Bakke  to support that postulate. The
panel opinion rejects that support, concluding that from its inception
Bakke had little precedential value and now, post- Adarand, has
none. My fellow panelists thus declare categorically that "any
consideration of race or ethnicity by the law school for the purposes
of achieving a diverse student body is not a compelling interest under
the Fourteenth Amendment."

This conclusion may well be a defensible extension of recent
Supreme Court precedent, an extension which in time may prove to
be the Court's position. It admittedly has a simplifying appeal as an
easily applied, bright-line rule proscribing any use of race as a
determinant. Be that as it may, this position remains an extension of
the law--one that, in my opinion, is both overly broad and
unnecessary to the disposition of this case. I am therefore unable to
concur in the majority's analysis.

My decision not to embrace the ratio decidendi of the majority
opinion results from three premises:  First, if Bakke is to be declared
dead, the Supreme Court, not a three-judge panel of a circuit court,
should make that pronouncement. Second, Justice O'Connor
expressly states that Adarand is not the death knell of affirmative
action * to which I would add, especially not  in the framework of
achieving diversity in public graduate schools.  Third, we have no
need to decide the thornier issue of compelling interest, as the
narrowly tailored inquiry of strict scrutiny presents a more surgical
andAAit seems to meAAmore principled way to decide the case
before us.  I am nevertheless reluctant to proceed with a narrowly
tailored  inquiry without pausing to respond briefly to the panel
opinions treatment of  diversity in the context of the compelling
interest inquiry



D.       Is Diversity A Compelling Interest?

Along its path to a per se ban on any consideration of race in
attempting to achieve student body diversity, the panel opinion holds
(or strongly implies) that remedying vestigial effects of past
discrimination is the only compelling interest that can ever justify
racial classification.  The main reason that I cannot go along with the
panel opinion to that extent is that I do not read the applicable
Supreme Court precedent as having held squarely and unequivocally
either that remedying effects of past discrimination is the only
compelling state interest that can ever justify racial classification, or
conversely that achieving diversity in the student body of a public
graduate or professional school can never be a compelling
governmental interest. Indeed, the panel opinion itself hedges a bit
on whether the Supreme Court's square holdings have gone that far,
particularly in the realm of higher education.

Between the difficulty inherent in applying Bakke  and the minimal
guidance in Adarand,  the definition and application of the compelling
interest inquiry seems to be suspended somewhere in the interstices
of constitutional interpretation. Until further clarification issues from
the Supreme Court defining "compelling interest" (or telling us how
to know one when we see one), I perceive no "compelling" reason to
rush in where the Supreme Court  fears * or at least declines * to
tread.  Instead, I would pretermit any attempt at a compelling interest
inquiry and accept Justice O'Connor's invitation to apply the Court's
more discernible and less intrusive "narrow tailoring" precedent.
Thus, for the purpose of this appeal I assume, without deciding, that
diversity is a compelling interest,  and proceed to the narrowly
tailored inquiry.



F.       Test For Narrow Tailoring

When strictly scrutinizing a racial classification for narrow tailoring,
the first question is "What is the purpose of this racial classification?"
The present effects rationale having proven feckless in this case,
todays answer to that first question is a given: The law school's
purpose is diversity. Accordingly, I perceive the next question to be,
"Was the law school's 1992 admissions process, with one TI range
for blacks, another for Mexican Americans, and a third for other
races, narrowly tailored to achieve diversity?"  I conclude that it was
not. Focusing as it does on blacks and Mexican Americans only, the
law school's 1992 admissions process misconceived the concept of
diversity, as did California's in the view of Justice Powell: Diversity
which furthers a compelling state interest "encompasses a far broader
array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic
origin is but a single though important element."

When the selective race-based preferences of the law school's 1992
admissions process are evaluated under Justice Powells broad,
multi-faceted concept of diversity, that process fails to satisfy the
requirements of the Constitution.  The law school purported to
accomplish diversity by ensuring an increase in the numbers of only
blacks and Mexican Americans in each incoming class to produce
percentagesAAvirtually indistinguishable from quotas--of
approximately five and ten percent, respectively. Yet blacks and
Mexican Americans are but two among any number of racial or ethnic
groups that could and presumably should contribute to genuine
diversity. By singling out only those two ethnic groups,  the initial
stage of the law school's 1992 admissions process ignored altogether
non-Mexican Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and Native
Americans, to name but a few.

In this light, the limited racial effects of the law school's preferential
admissions process, targeting exclusively blacks and Mexican
Americans, more closely resembles a set aside or quota system for
those two disadvantaged minorities than it does an academic
admissions program narrowly tailored to achieve true diversity. I
concede that the law school's 1992 admissions process would
increase the percentages of black faces and brown faces in that years
entering class. But facial diversity is not true diversity, and a system
thus conceived and implemented simply is not narrowly tailored to
achieve diversity.

Accordingly,  I would find that the law school's race- based 1992
admissions process was not narrowly tailored to achieve  diversity
and hold it constitutionally invalid on that basis. By so doing I
would avoid the largely uncharted waters of  a compelling interest
analysis. Although I join my colleagues of the panel in their holding
that the law school's 1992 admissions process fails to pass strict
scrutiny,  on the question of diversity I follow the solitary path of
narrow tailoring rather than the primrose path of compelling interest
to reach our common holding.



II

REMEDY

Before concluding, I am compelled to add a few words about the
panel opinions commentary regarding the remedy to be imposed
by the district court on remand. Without employing the express
language of injunction or affixing that label to its holding, the panel
opinions discussion of the remedy on remand is  strongly
suggestive and has all of the substantive earmarks of an injunction:

[The] plaintiffs have shown that it is likely that the law school will
continue to take race into account in admissions unless it receives
further judicial instruction to the effect that it may not do so for the
purpose of (1) obtaining a diverse student body; (2) altering the
school's reputation in the community; (3) combating the school's
perceived hostile environment toward minorities; or (4) remedying
the present effects of past discrimination by actors other than the law
school.

It is not necessary, however, for us to
order at this time that the law school be enjoined, as we are confident
that the conscientious administration at the school, as well as its
attorneys, will heed the directives contained in this opinion. If an
injunction should be needed in the future, the district court, in its
discretion, can consider its parameters without our assistance.
Accordingly, we leave intact that court's refusal to enter an
injunction.



Essentially, the substance of  the quoted portion of the panel opinion
constitutes a de facto injunction * telling the district court precisely
what to tell the law school that it can and can't do * albeit without the
use of the word injunction. To me,  if it has feathers, swims,
waddles, and quacks like a duck, it is a duck; and I find such an un-
injunction inappropriate. If instead we were simply to reverse and
remand on the violation issue, we would stop short of finding de
novo that the law school had violated these four plaintiffs equal
protection rights. It seems unavoidable to me that until the district
court determines that there has been a violation, a  remedy cannot be
fashioned and should not be the subject of appellate speculation.

The district court denied the plaintiffs injunctive relief, but only after
assigning the burden of proof to the wrong party.    No member of
this panel questions that, in the initial stanza of  the burden-shifting
minuet of  Mt. Healthy Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,  the
plaintiffs met their burden. Once the plaintiffs did that, the burden
should have shifted to the law school. Instead, the district court left
it with the plaintiffs and concluded that they had failed to carry the
ultimate burden. The district courts failure to shift the burden to the
law school, and the conclusion of that court which followed, were
errors. Accordingly, like my colleagues of the panel, I would
remand the case to the district court with instructions to relieve the
plaintiffs of the misplaced burden while affording the law school the
opportunity to prove that the prima facie violation established by the
plaintiffs was essentially harmless. But it seems clear to me that this
is where our analysis should end. As a result, I  depart from the
commentary in the panel opinion regarding the precise elements of
the remedy to be fashioned by the district court if it should conclude
on remand that the law school shall have failed to bear its burden.



III

CONCLUSION

I end where I began:  We should only decide the issues necessarily
before this court, and then only on the narrowest bases upon which
our decision can rest. This is not a class action; nothing is before us
here save the claims of four individual plaintiffs. These four
individual plaintiffs properly challenge only the admissions process
employed by the law school in 1992 * not the admissions process
that was in place and employed in 1995, not the admissions process
that is being employed in 1996, and not the admissions process to be
applied in any future years. In sum, I would remand, and in the
process I  would take care not to eviscerate the discretion of the
district court with excessive commentary or implicit directions on
the precise nature of the remedy that must ensue. Rather, my remand
would simply instruct the district court to apply the correct burden-
shifting process articulated in Mt. Healthy, then see how the law
school deals with it. That way,  if  the Mt. Healthy application
should demonstrate the need for a remedy, the district court would be
free to fashion the appropriate reliefAAincluding injunctive if
necessaryAAfor those among the individual plaintiffs whose
individual cases warrant it. For this court to do anything beyond that
impresses me as overreaching. Thus I concur in the judgment of the
panel opinion but, as to its conclusion on the issue of strict scrutiny
and its gloss on the order of remand, I disagree for the reasons I have
stated and therefore concur specially.


The formulae were written by the Law School Data Assembly
Service according to a prediction derived from the success of first-
year students in preceding years. As the LSAT was determined to be
a better predictor of success in law school, the formulae for the class
entering in 1992 accorded an approximate 60% weight to LSAT
scores and 40% to GPA.

The formula for students with a three-digit LSAT, see infra note 5,
was calculated as:  LSAT + (10)(GPA) = TI. For students with a
two-digit LSAT, the formula was: (1.25)LSAT + (10)GPA = TI.
Notably, but of less significance to this appeal, residency also had a
strong, if not often determinant, effect. Under Texas law in 1992,
the law school was limited to a class of 15% non-residents, and the
Board of Regents required an entering class of at least 500 students.
The law school therefore had to monitor offers to non-residents
carefully, in order not to exceed this quota, while at the same time
maintaining an entering class of a manageable size. The number of
votes would change over the course of the admissions season in
order to achieve the appropriate number of offers.  As blacks and
Mexican Americans were the only two minority categories granted
preferential treatment in admissions, it is inaccurate to say that the
law school conducted separate admissions programs for "minorities"
and "non-minorities."  While the law school application form
segregated racial and ethnic classification into seven
categories**"Black/African American," "Native American," "Asian
American," "Mexican American," "Other Hispanic" (meaning non-
Mexican descent), "White," and "Other (describe)"**only American
blacks and Mexican Americans received the benefit of the separate
admissions track.

Thus, for example, the law school decided that a black citizen of
Nigeria would not get preferential treatment, but a resident alien from
Mexico, who resided in Texas, would. Likewise, Asians, American
Indians, Americans from El Salvador and Cuba, and many others did
not receive a preference.

It is important to keep the composition of these categories in mind.
For the sake of simplicity and readability, however, we sometimes
will refer to two broad categories:  "whites" (meaning Texas
residents who were whites and non-preferred minorities) and
"minorities" (meaning Mexican Americans and black Americans).
Because of a recent change in the grading scale of the LSAT, the law
school in 1992 had applicants who had taken an earlier LSAT scored
on a 10-to-48 scale and others who had taken a later one scored on a
120-to-180 scale. Equivalence calculations were used to compare
scores received on the two scales. For example, TI numbers of 199
(three-digit LSAT) and 87 (two-digit LSAT) were equivalent. For
the sake of simplicity, we use three-digit numbers throughout this
opinion. In March 1992, the resident Mexican American and black
presumptive admit lines were in parity, but they had not started that
way. The initial presumptive admit TI's were 196 for Mexican
Americans and 192 for blacks. Thus, initially, blacks received
preferential treatment over Mexican Americans by having a lower
hurdle to cross to get into the discretionary zone. In March,
Professor Johanson lowered the Mexican American TI in order to
admit more of this group. The median scores of the 1992 class are as
follows:


Ethnicity                                Resident                Nonresident

GPA/LSAT                GPA/LSAT

All students                        3.52/162                3.61/164
White                                        3.56/164                3.72/166
Black                                        3.30/158                3.30/156
Mexican American                        3.24/157                3.38/174*
Other minority                        3.58/160                3.77/157

*Only two matriculated applicants.


In 1992, the LSAT's national distribution was approximately as
follows:

LSAT                        Percentile                        2-Digit LSAT  166
94%                           43 164                           91%
41 162                           88%                           40 160
83%                           39 158                           78%
38 156                           71%                           36


On the basis of these percentiles, one-half of the law school's white
resident matriculants were in the top 9% of all test-takers, one-half of
the resident Mexican Americans were in approximately the top 25%
of test-takers, and one-half of the resident blacks were in the top 22%
of test-takers.  To illustrate this difference, we consider the four
plaintiffs in this case** Cheryl Hopwood, Douglas Carvell, Kenneth
Elliott, and David Rogers. For a student similarly situated to
Hopwood, with a GPA of 3.8, to avoid presumptive denial as a
white, i.e., to obtain a TI of 193 or above, her LSAT had to be at
least a 155, a score in approximately the top 32% of test-takers. If
she were black (thus, needing a 180 TI), she would have had to
score a 142 on the LSAT, ranking her only in the top 80%.
Likewise, a student similar to Carvell, who had a 3.28 GPA, would
have needed a "white" LSAT of 160 (top 17%) and a "black" 147
(top 63%). A student like Rodgers with a 3.13 would have needed
either a 162 (top 12%) as a white or 149 as a black (top 56%).
Finally, a student like Elliott with a 2.98 GPA would have needed a
163 (top 10%) or 150 (top 53%), respectively. According to the
plaintiffs, 600-700 higher-scoring white residents were passed over
before the first blacks were denied admission. There is no specific
finding on this assertion, and though the law school does not appear
to refute it, we do not rely upon it in making our decision. Thus, the
law school constantly had to adjust its TI range over the course of the
admissions season to reach a desired mix. See supra note 6.  The
district court did not find, nor is the record clear on, how these
different classes of waiting list candidates were compared in the event
the law school made last-minute admissions decisions. The record
does show that the school carefully monitored the race of applicants
in filling the last openings in late spring and early summer. The
district court discussed in detail the plaintiffs' qualifications and their
rejections. See 861 F. Supp. at 564-67. The defendants are the State
of Texas; the University of Texas Board of Regents; the members of
the board, named but sued in their official capacities; the University
of Texas at Austin; the President of the university, sued in his official
capacity; the University of Texas School of Law; the dean of the law
school, sued in his official capacity; and the Chairman of the
Admissions Committee, sued in his official capacity. Because of this
conclusion, the district court examined at length the history of race
relations in Texas and discrimination in its schools. 861 F. Supp. at
554-57. Shortly before trial, apparently in response to the filing of
this lawsuit, the law school modified its 1992 admissions practices to
fit the district court's view of the proper constitutional system. See
id. at 582 n.87. In their initial brief on appeal, the defendants argued
that intermediate scrutiny is appropriate here. In a supplemental brief
filed to address the subsequent opinion in Adarand, they now
acknowledge that strict scrutiny is the appropriate test. Adarand, 115
S. Ct. at 2112-13 (overruling Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. F.C.C.,
497 U.S. 547 (1990), insofar as it applied intermediate scrutiny to
con- gressionally mandated "benign" racial classifications); City of
Richmond v. J.ACroson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 495 (1989) (plurality
opinion) ("the standard of review under the Equal Protection Clause
is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by a
particular classification"); id. at 520 (Scalia, J., concurring in
judgment); Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 273
(1986) (plurality opinion) ("[T]he level of scrutiny does not change
merely because the challenged classification operates against a group
that historically has not been subject to government discrimination.").
While AdarandAAthe Supreme Court's most recent opinion on racial
pref- erencesAAdoes not directly address the application of the strict
scrutiny test, it underscores the presumptive unconstitutionality of
racial classifications. "By requiring strict scrutiny of racial
classifications, we require courts to make sure that a government
classification based on race, which 'so seldom provide[s] a relevant
basis for disparate treatment,' Fullilove [v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448,
534 (1980)], (Stevens, J., dissenting), is legitimate, before
permitting unequal treatment based on race."  115 S. Ct. at 2113.
See also Adarand, id. at 2111 ("[A]ny person, of whatever race, has
the right to demand that any government actor subject to the
Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to
unequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny.").  See, e.g.,
Croson, 488 U.S. at 498-500 (holding that past societal discrimina-
tion against a group confers no basis for local governments to
provide a specifically tailored remedy to current members of that
group); Wygant, 478 U.S. at 275-76 (reject- ing argument that
governmental discrimination in teacher layoffs is allowed to foster
role models within a group). See, e.g., Vincent Blasi, Bakke as
Precedent:  Does Mr. Justice Powell Have a Theory?, 67 CAL. L.
REV. 21, 24 (1979) (arguing that Bakke's precedential force is
governed by the common conclusions of Justices Powell and
Stevens, though it is erroneous to conclude that Powell's opinion has
"controlling significance on all questions"); Robert G. Dixon, Jr.,
Bakke:  A Constitutional Analysis, 67 CAL. L(1979) (Justice
Powell's  "tiebreaking opinion . . . has acquired wide pragmatic
appeal."). As affirmative action programs are by definition
purposeful classifications by race, they do not present the problem of
governmental action that is facially neutral but has a disparate impact
and is motivated by race. See City of Arlington Heights v.
Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977);
Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976). The Supreme Court
subsequently has agreed with that position. See Wygant, 476 U.S.
at 274-76 (plurality opinion). The district court a quo erred in
suggesting that societal discrimination is constitutionally cognizable.
See 861 F. Supp. at 570 n.56, 571 n.60. See also  Sweezy v. New
Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 263 (1957) (Frankfurter, J., concurring
in result) (recognizing four separate components of "academic
freedom").  Saying that a university has a First Amendment interest
in this context is somewhat troubling. Both the medical school in
Bakke and, in our case, the law school are state institutions. The
First Amendment generally protects citizens from the actions of
government, not government from its citizens.

Significantly, Sweezy involved a person who was called before the
Attorney General of New Hampshire to answer for alleged
subversive activities. He declined on First Amendment grounds to
answer questions about a lecture he had delivered at the University of
New Hampshire. While Justice Frankfurter spoke of a university's
interest in openness and free inquiry, it was plainly through the First
Amendment rights of individual scholars. 354 U.S. at 262, 266-67
(Frankfurter, J., concurring in result). See also Milwaukee County
Pavers Ass'n v. Fielder, 922 F.2d 419, 422 (7th Cir.) ("The whole
point of Croson is that disadvantage, diversity, or other grounds
favoring minorities will not justify governmental racial discrimination
. . .; only a purpose of remedying discrimination against minorities
will do so.") (emphasis added), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 954 (1991).

Notably, Justice Scalia rejected the use of racial classifications "in
order (in a broad sense) 'to ameliorate the effects of past
discrimination.'"  Croson, 488 U.S. at 520 (Scalia, J., concurring in
the judgment) (quoting Croson, 488 U.S. at 476-77). He, however,
suggested one other possible compelling state interest:  a social
emergency. He opined that "where state or local action is at issue,
only a social emergency rising to the level of imminent danger to life
and limb" will justify racial classifications. Croson, 488 U.S. at 521
(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). While such an interest is
probably consistent with the widely criticized holdings of
Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81 (1943), and Korematsu
v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944), plainly such an interest is not
presented in this case. The law school places much reliance upon
Justice O'Connor's concurrence in Wygant for the proposition that
Justice Powell's Bakke formulation is still viable. In her 1986
Wygant opinion, in the context of discussing Justice Powell's
opinion, Justice O'Connor noted that "although its precise contours
are uncertain, a state interest in the promotion of racial diversity has
been found sufficiently 'compelling,' at least in the context of higher
education, to support the use of racial considerations in furthering
that interest."  476 U.S. at 286 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and
concurring in the judgment).

The law school's argument is not persuasive. Justice O'Connor's
statement is purely descriptive and did not purport to express her
approval or disapproval of diversity as a compelling interest. Her
subsequent statements outlined above in Croson and Metro
Broadcasting suggest strongly that reliance upon this statement in
Wygant is unjustified. The law school's admissions program makes
no distinction among black and Mexican American applicants in an
effort to determine which of them, for example, may have been
culturally or educationally disadvantaged. For example, Justice
Powell apparently felt that persons with different ethnic backgrounds
would bring diverse "experiences, outlooks, and ideas" to the
medical school. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 314 (opinion of Powell, J.).
Thus, to put it simply, under the Equal Protection Clause

the distribution of benefits and costs by government on racial or
ethnic grounds is impermissible. Even though it is frequently
efficient to sort people by race or ethnic origin, because racial or
ethnic identity may be a good proxy for functional classifications,
efficiency is rejected as a basis for governmental action in this
context.

Posner, supra, at 22.
We recognize that the use of some factors such as economic or
educational background of one's parents may be somewhat correlated
with race. This correlation, however, will not render the use of the
factor unconstitutional if it is not adopted for the purpose of
discriminating on the basis of race. See McCleskey v. Kemp, 481
U.S. 279 (1987). As Justice O'Connor indicated in Hernandez v.
New York, 500 U(1991), which was a challenge under Batson v.
Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), based upon the prosecution's strike
of potential jurors who spoke Spanish:

No matter how closely tied or significantly correlated to race the
explanation for a peremptory strike may be, the strike does not
implicate the Equal Protection Clause unless it is based on race. That
is the distinction between disproportionate effect, which is not
sufficient to constitute an equal protection violation, and intentional
discrimination, which is.

500 U.S. at 375 (O'Connor, J., joined by Scalia, J., concurring in
the judgment). According to one of the four-Justice opinions in
Bakke, racial classifications stigmatize when "they are drawn on the
presumption that one race is inferior to another or because they put
the weight of government behind racial hatred and separation."  438
U.S. at 357-58 (Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ.,
concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part). In Bakke,
however, these Justices rejected strict scrutiny because the program
at issue could not be said to stigmatize as did other racial
classifications. These Justices nevertheless recognized that rational-
basis scrutiny would not be enough. Id. at 361 (Brennan, White,
Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in the judgment in part and
dissenting in part). As Judge Posner has indicated,

the proper constitutional principle is not, no "invidious" racial or
ethnic discrimination, but no use of racial or ethnic criteria to
determine the distribution of government benefits and burdens . . . .
To ask whether racial exclusion may not have overriding benefits for
both races in particular circumstances is to place the
antidiscrimination principle at the mercy of the vagaries of empirical
conjecture and thereby free the judge to enact his per- sonal values
into constitutional doctrine.

Posner, supra, at 25-26.
See also Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2119 (Thomas, J., concurring in
part and concurring in judgment) ("But there can be no doubt that
racial paternalism and its unintended consequences may be as
poisonous and pernicious as any other form of discrimination.").
One prominent constitutional commentator specifically has noted that
where programs involve lower and separate standards of selection, "a
new badge of implied inferiority, assigned as an incident of
governmental noblesse oblige," results.

Explicit in state, local, or federal plans using separate and lower
standards by race is a statement by government that certain persons
identified by race are in fact being placed in positions they may be
presumed not likely to hold but for their race (because they are
presumed to be unable to meet standards the government itself
requires to be met). The message from government is written very
large when these plans proliferate:  a double (and softer) standard for
admission, a double (and softer) standard for hiring, a double (and
softer) standard for promotion, a double (and softer) standard for
competitive bidding, and so on. Without question, this is a
systematic racial tagging by government**a communication to others
that the race of the individual they deal with bespeaks a race-related
probability, created solely by the government itself, of lesser
qualification than others holding equivalent positions.

William Van Alstyne, Rites of Passage:  Race, the Supreme Court,
and the Constitution, 46 U. CHI. L. REV. 775, 787 n.38 (1979). As
professor Van Alstyne has argued:

Rather, one gets beyond racism by getting beyond it now:  by a
complete, resolute, and credible commitment never to tolerate in
one's own lifeAAor in the life or practices of one's gov-
ernmentAAthe differential treatment of other human beings by race.
Indeed, that is the great lesson for government itself to teach:  in all
we do in life, whatever we do in life, to treat any person less well
than another or to favor any more than another for being black or
white or brown or red, is wrong. Let that be our fundamental law
and we shall have a Constitution universally worth expounding.

Van Alstyne, supra note 34, at 809-10.
Because we have determined that any consideration of race by the
law school is constitutionally impermissible if justified by diversity,
it is not necessary to determine whether, as plaintiffs argue, the
admissions system under which the plaintiffs applied operated as a de
facto "quota" system similar to the one struck down in Bakke. We
do note that even if a "plus" system were permissible, it likely would
be impossible to maintain such a system without degeneration into
nothing more than a "quota" program. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 378
("For purposes of constitutional adjudication, there is no difference
between [setting aside a certain number of places for minorities and
using minority status as a positive factor].") (Brennan, White,
Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in the judgment in part and
dissenting in part). Indeed, in this case, the law school appeared to
be especially adept at meet- ing its yearly "goals."  See Hopwood,
861 F. Supp. at 574 n.67.  Plaintiffs additionally have argued that
the law school's program was not narrowly tailored in the diversity
context because (1) it failed to award preferences to non-Mexican
Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, American Indians, or other
minorities, and (2) it failed to accord as much weight to non-racial
diversity factors, such as religion and socioeconomic background, as
it did to race. Hopwood I is the first appeal of the intervention issue
that we address infra. Unfortunately, the precise scope of allowable
state action is of somewhat undefined contours. Indeed, it is not
evident whether permitted remedial action extends to the "present
effects of past discrimination."  This language, derived from Justice
Brennan's opinion in Bakke, 438 U.S. at 362-66, appears intended
to present little resistance to wide-ranging affirmative action plans.

While Justice Brennan began by stating that schools have a duty
affirmatively to erase the vestiges of their past discriminatory
practices, he compared this duty to the power of Congress to enforce
1 of the Fourteenth Amendment through  5. He reasoned that
under that wide-ranging power, the beneficia- ries of such a program
need not present proof that they were discriminated against; a
showing that they were in the general class was sufficient. Id. at
363-64. Nor would a school need judicial findings of past
discrimination. Id. at 364. Finally, he argued that such beneficiaries
would not even have to show that that school had a history of past
discrimination, but need only suggest that they were the victims of
general societal discrimination that prevented them from being
otherwise qualified to enter the school. Id. at 365-66. Hence, under
this standard, almost any school could adopt an affirmative action
plan.

There is no question, however, that subsequent Supreme Court
opinions, notably Wygant and Croson, have rejected broad state
programs that purport to be remedial and that, presumably, would
have satisfied Justice Brennan's standard for meeting the "present
effects of past discrimination."  And some members of the Court
would limit any remedial purpose to the actual victims of
discrimination. See Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2118 (Scalia, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ("[G]overnment can
never have a 'compelling interest' in discriminating on the basis of
race in order to 'make up' for past racial discrimination in the
opposite direction."). Nevertheless, we will not eschew use of the
phrase "present effects of past discrimination," as we used this
language in Hopwood I, 21 F.3d at 605, and another circuit did so in
Podberesky v. Kirwan, 38 F.3d 147, 153 (4th Cir. 1994), cert.
denied, 115 S. Ct(1995). We will, however, limit its application in
accordance with Wygant and Croson.       See Wygant, 476 U.S. at
286 (opinion of O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment) ("The Court is in agreement that whatever the formulation
employed, remedying past or present racial discrimination by a state
actor is a sufficiently weighty state interest to warrant remedial use of
a carefully constructed affirmative action program."). See also id. at
288 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)
("I agree with the plurality that a government agency's interest in
remedying 'societal' discrimination, that is discrimination not
traceable to its own actions, cannot be deemed sufficiently
compelling to pass constitutional muster under strict scrutiny.").
Justice O'Connor was joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices
White, Stevens, and Kennedy in this portion of the opinion. The fact
that the plaintiffs named the State of Texas as one defendant does not
mean that it is proper to scrutinize the state as the relevant past
discriminator. This argument confuses a theory of liability with a
justification for a limited racial remedy. The State of Texas simply
may be responsible for the wrongs of the law school, which is a
governmental entity the state has created. The Supreme Court,
however, has limited the remedial interest to the harm wrought by a
specific governmental unit. And again, any such remedy here would
be grossly speculative. As the defendants concede and the district
court found, there is no recent history of overt sanctioned
discrimination at the University of Texas. Hopwood, 861 F. Supp.
at 572. Nor does the record even suggest such discrimination at any
of the other component schools of the University of Texas System.
Thus, any harm caused to the students of those institutions would be
the result of the present effects of past discrimination.

We do note that the law school is not autonomous. In Texas, the
management of higher education has been divided by the legislature
into different "systems."  See 12 TEX. JUR. 3D, Colleges and
Universities  2 (1993). The University of Texas at Austin, with
which the law school is associated, is part of the University of Texas
System. TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. 67.01 to 67.62 (West
1991)ingly, the legislature, which has ultimate control over the
school, has delegated its "management and control" to the regents of
the University of Texas System. Id. 67.02. Thus, the law school
is governed by both the legislature and the university's board of
regents.

Yet, while the state's higher authorities may have the power to
require the law school to remedy its past wrongs, they may do so
consistently with the Constitution only if the remedial actions are
directed at the law school. This requirement is what the Supreme
Court dictated by limiting the remedial purpose to the "governmental
unit involved."  Wygant, 476 U.S. at 274 (plurality opinion).  The
testimony of several minority students underscores this point. They
stated generally that they felt that other students did not respect them
because the other students assumed that minorities attained admission
because of the racial preference program. The argument is that
because the state discriminated in its primary and secondary school
systems, the students' educational attainment was adversely affected,
and this harm extended to their higher education, thus justifying
giving current applicants a "plus" based on race. This reasoning is
especially important in justifying benefits for Mexican Americans, as
there is no evidence that the law school implemented de jure (or even
de facto) discrimination against this group in its admissions process.
Because this logic ignores the relevant actions in this case, i.e.,
discrimination by the law school, it is not necessary for us to
examine the potential causational flaws in the argument.

Moreover, if we did find that the past wrongs of Texas school
districts were the sort of discrimination that the law school could
address, the school still would have to prove the present effects of
that past wrong. Without some strong evidence in the record
showing that today's law school applicants still bear the mark of
those past systems, such effects seem grossly speculative. The
district court simply assumed that "[t]his segregation has
handicapped the educational achievement of many minorities. . . ."
861 F. Supp. at 573. And we would still have to ask whether the
program was narrowly tailored to this goal. To the extent that the
OCR has required actions that conflict with the Con- stitution, the
directives cannot stand. The Supreme Court has addressed required
state compliance with federal law in the voting rights context. Miller
v. Johnson, 115 S. Ct. 2475, 2491 (1995) ("As we suggested in
Shaw[v. Reno, 113 S. Ct. 2816, 2830-31 (1993)], compliance with
federal antidiscrimination laws cannot justify race-based districting
where the challenged district was not reasonably necessary under a
constitutional reading and application of those laws.") (emphasis
added). In more detail, the Fordice Court said the following:

If the State perpetuates policies and practices traceable to its prior
system that continue to have segregative effectsAAwhether by
influencing student enrollment or by fostering segregation in other
facets of the university systemAAand such policies are without sound
educational justification and can be practicably eliminated, the State
has not satisfied its burden of proving that it has dismantled its prior
system.

505 U.S. at 731.
In Croson, Justice O'Connor did argue that a state may act to prevent
its powers from being used to support private discrimination. 488
U.S. at 491-92 (plurality opinion) ("[A] state or local subdivision, (if
delegated the authority from the State) has the authority to eradicate
the effects of private discrimination within its own legislative
jurisdiction.") (emphasis added). Hence, a specific state actor can act
to prevent the state from being used as a "passive participant" in
private discrimination. This power does not create wide-ranging
authority to remedy societal discrimination, however.  The plaintiffs
argue that indeed there is no narrow tailoring, for at least the
following reasons:  (1) In 1992, more than two-thirds of all
admission offers to blacks, and a majority of all blacks who
matriculated, involved out-of-state residents, thus undercutting the
law school's stated purpose of remedying past discrimination in
Texas. (2) The system of preferences has no termination date, thus
indicating that there is no connection between the plan and a bona
fide remedial purpose. (3) Preference is given even to blacks and
Mexican Americans who graduated from private secondary schools
and thus did not suffer from state-ordered racial discrimination.

The law school apparently chose admission goals of 5% blacks and
10% Mexican Americans because those are the respective percentages
of college graduates in Texas who are black and Mexican American.
Nothing in the record, however, establishes any probative correlation
between the degree of past discrimination and the percentage of
students from a minority group who graduate from college.

There is no history either of de jure discrimination against Mexican
Americans in education at any level in Texas or of de facto
discrimination against Mexican Americans by the law school.
Therefore, it is puzzling that the law school would set an admissions
goal for Mexican Americans that is twice that of blacks, as to whom
the history of de jure discrimination in Texas Education in general,
and by the law school in particular, is irrefutable.

If fashioning a remedy for past discrimination is the goal, one would
intuit that the minority group that has experienced the most
discrimination would have the lowest college graduation rate and
therefore would be entitled to the most benefit from the designed
remedy. The goals established by the law school are precisely the
reverse of that intuitive expectation and are more reflective of a goal
of diversity (which we hold is not compelling) than of a goal of
remedying past discrimination. This finding also affected the court's
analysis in denying prospective relief and compensatory damages.
The district court applied a burden-shifting scheme similar to the
methodology used in the title VII context. 861 F. Supp. at 579-80
(citing St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502 (1993)). The
law school concedes that the burden-shifting exercise was
unnecessary, but it maintains nonetheless that the "ultimate burden of
proof," including proof of damages, rests upon the plaintiffs. See
id. Some of Justice Powell's dicta in Bakke also squarely supports
the plaintiffs' claim that once discrimination is proved, the defendant
bears the burden of proving no damage. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 320
(opinion of Powell, J.). Compare Henson v. University of Ark., 519
F.2d 576, 577-78 (8th Cir. 1975) (per curiam) (placing burden of
persuasion on white applicant to show affirmative action program
prevented her admission) and Martin v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd.
of Educ., 475 F. Supp. 1318, 1345 (W.D.N.C. 1979) (holding that
plaintiff in non-class action bears burden of proving damages) with
Donnelly v. Boston College, 558 F.2d 634, 635 (1st Cir. 1977)
(dictum) (citing Bakke and Mt. Healthy, but finding no causation, as
evidence showed that plaintiff would not have been admitted
regardless of affirmative action) and Heit v. Bugbee, 494 F. Supp.
66, 66-67 (E.D. Mich. 1980) (adopting Bakke and Mt. Healthy
reasoning in toto for firefighter's reverse discrimination claims) and
United States v. McDonald, 553 F. Supp. 1003, 1006 (S.D. Tex.
1983) (dictum) (same for discriminatory criminal prosecution). The
district court concluded that the plaintiffs proved only that they had
been denied equal treatment but had failed to "prove an injury-in-
fact."  861 Fat 582. To the extent that the court felt that plaintiffs
failed to show injury-in- fact because they failed to prove that they
would have been admitted under a constitutional admissions system,
this conclusion should be revisited on remand, where the district
court must apply the proper burden and redetermine whether
plaintiffs would have been admitted. We do not opine on any
Eleventh Amendment immunity in this case. See, eUnited Carolina
Bank v. Board of Regents, 665 F.2d 553, 561 (5th Cir. Unit A
1982) (holding that the Eleventh Amendment barred a civil rights suit
brought by a professor against university officials in their official
capacities). This issue is simply not before us. For example, if the
school is unable to show that plaintiff Carvell would not have gained
admission even under a constitutional admissions system, he may be
entitled to be compensated for the difference, to which he testified,
between tuition at the law school and tuition at Southern Methodist
University School of Law, which he attended instead. The district
court should also consider the following paradox:  The law school
argued strenuously that plaintiff Elliott did not have standing to sue,
as he had been offered admission to the school**albeit at the last
moment**and had failed to accept that offer. The district court found
that this offer of admission had not been communicated to Elliott.
861 F. Supp. at 566. In considering damages, however, the court
held that "in all likelihood, the plaintiffs would not have been offered
admission even under a constitutionally permissible process."  Id. at
581. The district court should re-examine these contradictory results.
There is circuit law regarding successive motions, but the pertinent
opinions do not examine the standard of review explicitly. See, e.g.,
Kneeland v. National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 806 F.2d 1285 (5th
Cir.) (implicit application of de novo review without discussion of
standard), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 817 (1987); United States v.
Louisiana, 669 F.2d 314, 315 (5th Cir. 1982) (application of abuse
of discretion review for timeliness determination on second motion
where proposed in- tervenor failed to argue for first motion after
remand); Calvert Fire Ins. Co. v. Environs Dev. Corp., 601 F851,
857 (5th Cir. 1979) (implicit application of de novo review where
district court treated second motion as both a reconsideration of prior
motion and a new motion).  The associations ground this argument
in language taken from the prior appeal. One necessary element for
intervention is a showing that the present parties will inadequately
represent the proposed intervenors' interests. While the associations
lost on this ground on the last appeal, they now claim that the opinion
supports the argument that the law school's defense is inadequate. In
the last appeal, we cited Jansen v. City of Cincinnati, 904 F.2d 336
(6th Cir. 1990), as support for the following statement:  "Nor have
the proposed intervenors shown that they have a separate defense of
the affirmative action plan that the State has failed to assert."
Hopwood I, 21 F.3d at 606. Because the law school, now after
trial, still has not asserted the associations' title VI defense, the
associations maintain that they now can meet their burden.

In Jansen, however, the court found that the proposed intervenors
had an interest different from that of the defendant city. 904 F.2d at
343. This was the basis for that court's holding that the city's
representation was inadequate. See id. ("Proffering this alleged
violation of the consent decree as an affirmative defense is directly
counter to the City's interest.") (emphasis added). Here, we have
already found that the law school's and the associations' interests are
the same. Jansen therefore does not support intervention. At least
one set of commentators has eschewed this traditional rule. Their
position is that "[a]ny denial of intervention should be regarded as an
appealable final order."  7C WRIGHT ET AL., supra,  1923, at
508. Under this proposed rule, the federal court would "affirm
denial of intervention when previously, having determined on the
merits that the trial court was right, it would dismiss the appeal."
Id509. We have acknowledged that this would be the better rule.
See Korioth v. Briscoe, 523 F.2d 1271, 1279 n.26 (5th Cir. 1975)
(citing WRIGHT ET AL., supra). In fact, the Hopwood I panel
affirmed rather than dismissing for want of jurisdiction. Under the
suggested rule, because we would have a final order on the merits
from a previous panel on this issue, this case would probably be at
an end. Nonetheless, as the anomalous rule constitutes our circuit
caselaw, we are bound to follow it. A dismissal for want of
jurisdiction, however, leaves open the possibility that the deficiency
can be cured. If that occurs, no issue preclusion exists. See 7C
WRIGHT ET AL., supra,  4436, at 338. It is at this point in the
analysis that "changed circumstances" may become relevant.
Arguably, the "changed circumstances" analysis, in effect, "cures"
the earlier jurisdictional deficiency. Thus, if the circumstances of the
case change to such an extent that jurisdiction would lie, the
subsequent motion to intervene should not be dismissed for lack of
jurisdiction. In effect, the posture of the case has changed, as it
would any time a given jurisdictional problem is cured.   In
Hopwood I, we decided that (1) the interests of the associations were
adequately represented by the law school and the state, and (2) as a
practical matter, disposition in the principal suit would not impair or
impede either of those groups' interests. 21 F.3d at 605. The law of
the case doctrine militates against revisiting that decision here.

For purposes of any future litigation, however, we note a necessary
effect of our previous holding when coupled with the law school's
failure to raise a title VI argument:  Neither the district court's
decision nor ours in this appeal is binding on the associations as res
judicata, law of the case, collateral estoppel, or any other theoretical
bar.

In short, as the title VI issue has not been litigated, the associations
are not precluded from instituting a separate and independent title VI
challenge to the law school's use of the TI. We neither express nor
imply an opinion on the viability of such a challenge. League of
United Latin American Citizens, Council No. 4434 v. Clements, 999
F.2d 831, 931 (5th Cir. 1993)(Wiener, J., dissenting). See
Hopwood v. State of Tex., 861 F.Supp. 551, 570 (W.D. Tex.
1994). I agree with the  panel opinion that the defendants are
overreaching when they urge  that the State of Texas or its primary
and secondary school system should be the relevant governmental
unit.  Panel Opn. at 43 & n.44. U.S. Const., amend. 14,  1.

115 S.Ct. at 2115. 438 U.S. 265 (1978).        Justice Powell opens
his discussion of equal protection and diversity in Bakke by stating
that the "attainment of a diverse student body . . . clearly [is] a
constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher
education," id. at 311-12, and, in the unique context of institutions of
higher learning, he concludes that diversity is a compelling interest.
Id. at 312. Panel Opn. at 25 (emphasis added). Adarand, 115 S.Ct.
at 2117 ("When race-based action is necessary to further a
compelling interest, such action is within the constitutional
constraints if it satisfies the 'narrow tailoring' test this Court has set
out in previous cases."). See, e.g, Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173,
224 (1991)(O'Connor, J, dissenting)("It is a fundamental rule of
judicial restraint . . . that this Court will not reach constitutional
questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them.")(citing
Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold
Engineering, P.C., 467 U138, 157 (1984)). Panel Opn. at 26-29.
The Court appears to have decided that "there is essentially only one
compelling state interest to justify racial classification:  remedying
past wrongs."  Panel opn. at 27 (citing City of Richmond v. J.A.
Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493 (1989)(plurality opinion)(emphasis
added)).  Panel Opn. at 28 n.27, (quoting Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of
Educ., 476 U.S286 (1986) (O'Connor, J. concurring in part and
concurring in the judgment).  ([A]lthough its precise contours are
uncertain, a state interest in the promotion of racial diversity has been
found to be sufficiently `compelling at least in the context of higher
education to support the use of racial considerations in furthering that
interest.). I readily concede that problems are encountered when
efforts are made to apply the Supreme Court's Bakke decision.
Panel Opn. at 20, 25, & 26 (respectively pointing out that (1) Bakke
comprises multiple opinions and divergent analyses, (2) no Justice,
other than Justice Powell, discusses diversity, and (3) Bakke is
questioned in Adarand). The panel opinion fails to describe this last
problem with precise accuracy. That opinion's expurgated version of
the quotation at 26, lines 736-42 makes it appear as though the
Adarand majority questioned Bakke. In full, the sentence reads "[the
Court's] failure to produce a majority opinion in Bakke, Fullilove,
and Wygant left unresolved the proper analysis for remedial race-
based governmental action."  Thus, although the Court
acknowledges that Bakke et al. left things unresolved, I do not read
this quotation, (as the panel opinion suggests) as an order to throw
out Bakke--bath water, baby, and all.

Nevertheless, the fractured nature of Bakke's holding has left more
questions than answers in its wake. As observed in the instant panel
opinion, there has been "no [other] indication from the Supreme
Court, . . . [whether] the state's interest in diversity [in higher
education] constitutes a compelling justification for governmental
race-based classifications."   Panel Opn. at 28. I agree that Bakke is
the only indication that diversity is a compelling interest. But, unlike
the panel opinion, which jettisons Justice Powell's Bakke opinion
because of its singularity, I find that singularity to be precisely the
factor that makes Justice Powell's opinion the most pertinent
Supreme Court statement on this issue. Therefore, when and if  the
Supreme Court addresses this case or its analog, the Court will have
no choice but to go with, over, around, or through Justice Powell's
Bakke opinion. By assuming, as I do, that diversity is a compelling
interest, however, these problems are avoided altogether.  Recently,
in Adarand the Supreme Court stated that it had "altered the [equal
protection] playing field in some important respects."  115 S.Ct. at
2118. In her opinion for the majority, however, Justice O'Connor
repeatedly emphasizes that Adarand did not drive a stake through the
heart of affirmative action. To the contrary, she emphatically states,
"we wish to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is 'strict in theory,
but fatal in fact.'"   Id. at 2117 (quoting Fullilove, 448 U.S. 448,
519 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment). Moreover, "[w]hen
race-based action is necessary to further a compelling interest, such
action is within the constitutional constraints if it satisfies the 'narrow
tailoring' test this Court has set out in previous cases."  Id.

It seems to me that as a practical matter, Adarand resolves very
littlefact, the much heralded change is quite limited: Race-based
classifications, imposed by the federal government, are now subject
to strict scrutiny. Curiously (or perhaps not so curiously given the
enigmatic difficulty of the task), the Supreme Court declined to
define compelling interest or to tell us how to apply that term.
Indeed, the Court did not even decide the case before it, opting
instead to remand the case for further adjudication.  Id. ("[W]hen
race-based action is necessary to further a compelling interest, such
action is within the constitutional constraints if it satisfies the 'narrow
tailoring' test this Court has set out in previous cases."). Although I
assume without deciding that diversity is a compelling interest,  if I
had no choice but to address compelling interest I would do so in the
context in which the issue is presented, i.e., the constitutionally
permissible means of  constructing an entering a class at a public
graduate or professional school. This unique context, first identified
by Justice Powell, differs from the employment context, differs from
the minority business set aside context, and  differs from the re-
districting context;  it comprises only the public higher education
context and implicates the uneasy marriage of the First and
Fourteenth Amendments.  See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 311-12.
Consequently, we play with fire when we assume an easy crossover
of Fourteenth Amendment maxims pronounced in cases decided in
such other contexts.

The panel opinion concludes that this contextual distinction is
unimportant, holding that, whatever the context, remedying the past
effects of discrimination is the only compelling interest that can
justify a racial classification. Panel Opn. at 26-29. That opinion
acknowledges, however, that Supreme Court precedent does not go
this far: namely, the higher education context is different. Indeed the
panel opinion quotes Justice O'Connor's words expressly stating that
higher education is different. Panel Opn. at 28 n.27 (quoting
Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 286 (1986)
("[A]lthough its precise contours are uncertain, a state interest in the
promotion of racial diversity has been found to be sufficiently
'compelling' at least in the context of higher education to support the
use of racial considerations in furthering that interest.")).  United
States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 171 (1987). Bakke, 438 U.S. at
316. In the portion of his opinion that addresses narrow tailoring,
Justice Powell concluded that California's admission process
misconceived the concept of "diversity."  Id. California's
preferential program, focused as it was solely on aiding black
applicants, was not necessary to attain diversity. Id. In the instant
litigation, the law school created its own Catch-22 by advancing two
putative compelling interests that ultimately proved to produce so
much internal tension as to damage if not fatally wound each other.
Under the banner of prior discrimination, Texas had no choice but to
single out blacks and Mexican-Americans, for those two racial
groups were the only ones of which there is any evidence whatsoever
of de facto or de jure racial discrimination by the State of Texas in the
history of its educational system. But, by favoring just those two
groups and doing so with a virtual quota system for affirmative
action in admissions, the law school estops itself from proving that
its plan to achieve diversity is ingenuous, much less narrowly
tailored. I also concur in my colleagues' conclusion that intervention
by the two black student organizations is not mandated, and do so for
the same reasons. Panel Opn. at 59-60. Hay v. Waldron, 834 F.2d
481, 484 (5th Cir. 1987)(The law is well-settled that the grant or
denial of injunctive relief rests in the sound discretion of the district
court); Lubbock Civ. Lib. Union v. Lubbock Ind. Sch. Dist., 669
F.2d 1038, 1048 (5th Cir. 1982),  cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1155
(1983). Panel Opn. at 55 ("We conclude that the Mt. Healthy
methodology is appropriate in the instant case.").  On this point, I
agree with the panel majority that the Mt. Healthy burden-shifting
minuet should apply.  429 U.S. 274, 284 (1977).

<P>The Supreme Court ruled on July 1, 1996, that the government
can be held liable for a rule change that plunged savings and loans into
financial trouble. The 7-2 ruling said the government broke its
contracts with three S&Ls when it changed an accounting rule in
1989. The law that sought to restore the troubled thrift industry to
health by tightening rules and providing over $100 billion to close
insolvent S&Ls. Until then, the government had encouraged healthy
thrifts to take over insolvent ones by letting them count the insolvent
S&L's losses as ''goodwill'' assets. S&Ls also were allowed to
double-count as ''capital credit'' government funds provided to help
them take over ailing thrifts. But the 1989 law said S&Ls no longer
could count such assets toward their minimum capital requirements.
The rule change forced many previously healthy S&Ls into the red. A
number of them sued, including Winstar Corp. of Minnesota,
Statesman Savings Holding Group of Iowa and Glendale Federal
Bank of California.

v.

WINSTAR CORP. ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT

No. 95-865.  Argued April 24, 1996-Decided July 1, 1996

Realizing that the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation
(FSLIC) lacked the funds to liquidate all of the failing thrifts during
the savings and loan crisis of the 1980's, the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board encouraged healthy thrifts and outside investors to take
over ailing thrifts in a series of "supervisory mergers."  As
inducement, the Bank Board agreed to permit acquiring entities to
designate the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
identifiable assets as an intangible asset referred to as supervisory
goodwill, and to count such goodwill and certain capital credits
toward the capital reserve requirements imposed by federal
regulations. Congress's subsequent passage of the Financial
Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989
(FIRREA) forbade thrifts from counting goodwill and capital credits
in computing the required reserves. Respondents are three thrifts
created by way of supervisory mergers. Two of them were seized and
liquidated by federal regulators for failure to meet FIRREA's capital
requirements, and the third avoided seizure through a private
recapitalization. Believing that the Bank Board and FSLIC had
promised that they could count supervisory goodwill toward
regulatory capital requirements, respondents each filed suit against the
United States in the Court of Federal Claims, seeking damages for,
inter alia, breach of contract. In granting each respondent summary
judgment, the court held that the Government had breached its
contractual obligations, and rejected the Government's
``unmistakability defense''--that surrenders of sovereign authority,
such as the promise to refrain from regulatory changes, must appear in
unmistakable terms in a contract in order to be enforceable, see Bowen
v. Public Agencies Opposed to Social Security Entrapment, 477 U. S.
41, 52--and its ``sovereign act defense--that a ``public and general''
sovereign act, such as FIRREA's alteration of capital reserve
requirements, could not trigger contractual liability, see Horowitz v.
United States, 267 U. S. 458, 461. The cases were consolidated, and
the en banc Federal Circuit ultimately affirmed.


Held:  The judgment is affirmed, and the case is remanded. 64 F. 3d
1531, affirmed and remanded.

JUSTICE SOUTER, joined by JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE
O'CONNOR, and JUSTICE BREYER, concluded in Parts II, III, IV,
and IV-C, that the United States is liable to respondents for breach of
contract. Pp. 19-57; 66-72.

(a) There is no reason to question the Federal Circuit's conclusion that
the Government had express contractual obligations to permit
respondents to use goodwill and capital credits in computing their
regulatory capital reserves. When the law as to capital requirements
changed, the Government was unable to perform its promises and
became liable for breach under ordinary contract principles. Pp. 19-
30.

(b) The unmistakability doctrine is not implicated here because
enforcement of the contractual obligation alleged would not block the
Government's exercise of a sovereign power. The courts below did
not construe these contracts as binding the Government's exercise of
authority to modify its regulation of thrifts, and there has been no
demonstration that awarding damages for breach would be tantamount
to such a limitation. They read the contracts as solely risk-shifting
agreements, and respondents seek nothing more than the benefit of
promises by the Government to insure them against any losses arising
from future regulatory change. Applying the unmistakability doctrine
to such contracts would not only represent a conceptual expansion of
the doctrine beyond its historical and practical warrant, but would
compromise the Government's practical capacity to make contracts,
which is "of the essence of sovereignty" itself, United States v.
Bekins, 304 U. S. 27, 51-52. Pp. 31-48.

(c) The answer to the Government's unmistakability argument also
meets its two related ultra vires contentions: that, under the reserved
powers doctrine, Congress's power to change the law in the future
was an essential attribute of its sovereignty that the Bank Board and
FSLIC had no authority to bargain away; and that in any event no
such authority can be conferred without an express delegation to that
effect.  A contract to adjust the risk of subsequent legislative change
does not strip the Government of its legislative sovereignty, and the
contracts did not surrender the Government's sovereign power to
regulate. And there is no serious question that FSLIC (and the Bank
Board acting through it) lacked authority to guarantee respondents
against losses arising from subsequent regulatory changes. Pp. 49-
52.

(d) The facts of this case do not warrant application of the sovereign
act doctrine. That doctrine balances the Government's need for
freedom to legislate with its obligation to honor its contracts by asking
whether the sovereign act is properly attributable to the Government as
contractor. If the answer is no, the Government's defense to liability
depends on whether that act would otherwise release the Government
from liability under ordinary contract principles. Pp. 52-57.

(e) Even if FIRREA were to qualify as a "public and general" act, the
sovereign act doctrine cannot excuse the Government's breach here.
Since the object of the doctrine is to place the Government as
contractor on par with a private contractor in the same circumstances,
Horowitz v. United States, 267 U. S., at 461, the Government, like
any other defending party in a contract action, must show that passage
of the statute rendering its performance impossible was an event
contrary to the basic assumptions on which the parties agreed, and,
ultimately, that the language or circumstances do not indicate that the
Government should be liable in any case. The Government has not
satisfied these conditions. There is no doubt that some changes in the
regulatory structure governing thrift capital reserves were both
foreseeable and likely when the parties contracted with the
Government. In addition, any governmental contract that not only
deals with regulatory change but allocates the risk of its occurring
will, by definition, fail the further condition of a successful
impossibility defense, for it will indeed indicate that the parties'
agreement was not meant to be rendered nugatory by a change in the
regulatory law. That the Bank Board and FSLIC could not
themselves preclude Congress from changing the regulatory rules
does not stand in the way of concluding that those agencies assumed
the risk of such change, for determining the consequences of legal
change was the point of the agreements. Pp. 66-72.

JUSTICE SOUTER, joined by JUSTICE STEVENS and JUSTICE
BREYER, concluded in Parts IV-A and IV-B, that, since the
Government should not be excused by legislation when the substantial
effect of regulation was to help itself out of improvident agreements, it
is impossible to attribute the exculpatory "public and general"
character to FIRREA. That statute not only had the purpose of
eliminating the very accounting "gimmicks" that acquiring thrifts had
been promised, but the congressional debates indicate Congress's
expectation, which there is no reason to question, that FIRREA would
have a substantial effect on the Government's contractual obligations.
The evidence of Congress's intense concern with contracts like those
at issue is not neutralized by the fact that FIRREA did not formally
target particular transactions or by FIRREA's broad purpose to
advance the general welfare.  Pp. 58-65.

JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by JUSTICE KENNEDY and JUSTICE
THOMAS, agreed that the Government was contractually obligated to
afford respondents favorable accounting treatment, and violated its
obligations when it discontinued that treatment under FIRREA. The
Government's sovereign defenses cannot be avoided by characterizing
its obligations as not entailing a limitation on the exercise of sovereign
power; that approach, although adopted by the plurality, is novel and
fails to acknowledge that virtually every contract regarding future
conduct operates as an assumption of liability in the event of
nonperformance. Accordingly, it is necessary to address the
Government's various sovereign defenses, particularly its invocation
of the ``unmistakability'' doctrine. That doctrine simply embodies the
common-sense presumption that governments do not ordinarily agree
to curtail their sovereign or legislative powers. Respondents have
overcome that presumption here in establishing that the Government
promised, in unmistakable terms, to regulate them in a particular
fashion, into the future. The Government's remaining arguments are
readily rejected. The ``reserved powers'' doctrine cannot defeat a
claim to recover damages for breach of contract where subsequent
legislation has sought to minimize monetary risks assumed by the
Government. The ``express delegation'' doctrine is satisfied here by
the statutes authorizing the relevant federal bank regulatory agencies to
enter into the agreements at issue. Finally, the ``sovereign acts''
doctrine adds little, if anything, to the ``unmistakability'' doctrine, and
cannot be relied upon where the Government has attempted to
abrogate the essential bargain of the contract. Pp. 1-6.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES


No. 95-865


UNITED STATES, PETITIONER

v.

WINSTAR CORPORATION ET AL.

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT

[July 1, 1996]

JUSTICE SOUTER announced the judgment of the Court and
delivered an opinion, in which JUSTICE STEVENS and JUSTICE
BREYER join, and in which JUSTICE O'CONNOR joins except as
to Parts IV-A and IV-B.

The issue in this case is the enforceability of contracts between the
Government and participants in a regulated industry, to accord them
particular regulatory treatment in exchange for their assumption of
liabilities that threatened to produce claims against the Government as
insurer. Although Congress subsequently changed the relevant law,
and thereby barred the Government from specifically honoring its
agreements, we hold that the terms assigning the risk of regulatory
change to the Government are enforceable, and that the Government is
therefore liable in damages for breach.


We said in Fahey v. Mallonee, 332 U. S. 245, 250 (1947), that
"[b]anking is one of the longest regulated and most closely supervised
of public callings."  That is particularly true of the savings and loan,
or "thrift," industry, which has been described as "a federally-
conceived and assisted system to provide citizens with affordable
housing funds."  H. R. Rep. No. 101-54, pt. 1, p. 292 (1989).
Because the contracts at issue in today's case arise out of the National
Government's efforts over the last decade and a half to preserve that
system from collapse, we begin with an overview of the history of
federal savings and loan regulation.


The modern savings and loan industry traces its origins to the Great
Depression, which brought default on 40 percent of the Nation's $20
billion in home mortgages and the failure of some 1700 of the nation's
approximately 12,000 savings institutions. House Report, at 292-293.
In the course of the debacle, Congress passed three statutes meant to
stabilize the thrift industry. The Federal Home Loan Bank Act created
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (Bank Board), which was
authorized to channel funds to thrifts for loans on houses and for
preventing foreclosures on them. Ch. 522, 47 Stat. 725 (1932)
(codified as amended at 12 U. S. C. Sections 1421-1449 (1988 ed.));
see also House Report, at 292. Next, the Home Owners' Loan Act of
1933 authorized the Bank Board to charter and regulate federal
savings and loan associations. Ch. 64, 48 Stat. 128 (1933) (codified
as amended at 12 U. S. C. Sections 1461-1468 (1988 ed.)). Finally,
the National Housing Act created the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), under the Bank Board's authority,
with responsibility to insure thrift deposits and regulate all federally
insured thrifts. Ch. 847, 48 Stat. 1246 (1934) (codified as amended at
12 U. S. C. Sections 1701-1750g (1988 ed.)).

The resulting regulatory regime worked reasonably well until the
combination of high interest rates and inflation in the late 1970's and
early 1980's brought about a second crisis in the thrift industry.
Many thrifts found themselves holding long-term, fixed-rate
mortgages created when interest rates were low; when market rates
rose, those institutions had to raise the rates they paid to depositors in
order to attract funds. See House Report, at 294-295. When the costs
of short-term deposits overtook the revenues from long-term
mortgages, some 435 thrifts failed between 1981 and 1983. House
Report, at 296; see also General Accounting Office, Thrift Industry:
Forbearance for Troubled Institutions 1982-1986, p. 9 (May 1987)
(GAO, Forbearance for Troubled Institutions) (describing the origins
of the crisis).

The first federal response to the rising tide of thrift failures was
"extensive deregulation," including "a rapid expansion in the scope of
permissible thrift investment powers and a similar expansion in a
thrift's ability to compete for funds with other financial services
providers." House Report, at 291; see also id., at 295-297; Breeden,
Thumbs on the Scale: The Role that Accounting Practices Played in
the Savings and Loan Crisis, 59 Fordham L. Rev. S71, S72-S74
(1991) (describing legislation permitting nonresidential real estate
lending by thrifts and deregulating interest rates paid to thrift
depositors).1   Along with this deregulation came moves to weaken
the requirement that thrifts maintain adequate capital reserves as a
cushion against losses, see 12 CFR Section 563.13 (1981), a
requirement that one commentator described as "the most powerful
source of discipline for financial institutions." Breeden, supra, at S75.
The result was a drop in capital reserves required by the Bank Board
from five to four percent of assets in November 1980, see 45 Fed.
Reg. 76111, and to three percent in January of 1982, see 47 Fed.
Reg. 3543; at the same time, the Board developed new "regulatory
accounting principles" (RAP) that in many instances replaced
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for purposes of
determining compliance with its capital requirements.2   According to
the House Banking Committee, "[t]he use of various accounting
gimmicks and reduced capital standards masked the worsening
financial condition of the industry, and the FSLIC, and enabled many
weak institutions to continue operating with an increasingly inadequate
cushion to absorb future losses." House Report, at 298. The
reductions in required capital reserves, moreover, allowed thrifts to
grow explosively without increasing their capital base, at the same
time deregulation let them expand into new (and often riskier) fields of
investment. See Note, Causes of the Savings and Loan Debacle, 59
Fordham L. Rev. S301, S311 (1991); Breeden, supra, at S74-S75.

While the regulators tried to mitigate the squeeze on the thrift industry
generally through deregulation, the multitude of already-failed savings
and loans confronted FSLIC with deposit insurance liabilities that
threatened to exhaust its insurance fund. See Olympic Federal
Savings and Loan Assn. v. Director, Office of Thrift Supervision,
732 F. Supp. 1183, 1185 (DC 1990). According to the General
Accounting Office, FSLIC's total reserves declined from $6.46 billion
in 1980 to $4.55 billion in 1985, GAO, Forbearance for Troubled
Institutions 12, when the Bank Board estimated that it would take
$15.8 billion to close all institutions deemed insolvent under generally
accepted accounting principles. General Accounting Office, Troubled
Financial Institutions: Solutions to the Thrift Industry Problem 108
(Feb. 1989) (GAO, Solutions to the Thrift Industry Problem). By
1988, the year of the last transaction involved in this case, FSLIC was
itself insolvent by over $50 billion. House Report, at 304. And by
early 1989, the GAO estimated that $85 billion would be needed to
cover FSLIC's responsibilities and put it back on the road to fiscal
health. GAO, Solutions to the Thrift Industry Problem 43. In the
end, we now know, the cost was much more even than that. See,
e.g., Horowitz, The Continuing Thrift Bailout, Investor's Business
Daily, Feb. 1, 1996, p. A1 (reporting an estimated $140 billion total
public cost of the S&L crisis through 1995).

Realizing that FSLIC lacked the funds to liquidate all of the failing
thrifts, the Bank Board chose to avoid the insurance liability by
encouraging healthy thrifts and outside investors to take over ailing
institutions in a series of "supervisory mergers."  See GAO, Solutions
to the Thrift Industry Problem 52; L. White, The S&L Debacle: Public
Policy Lessons for Bank and Thrift Regulation 157 (1991) (White).3
Such transactions, in which the acquiring parties assumed the
obligations of thrifts with liabilities that far outstripped their assets,
were not intrinsically attractive to healthy institutions; nor did FSLIC
have sufficient cash to promote such acquisitions through direct
subsidies alone, although cash contributions from FSLIC were often
part of a transaction. See M. Lowy, High Rollers: Inside the Savings
and Loan Debacle 37 (1991) (Lowy). Instead, the principal
inducement for these supervisory mergers was an understanding that
the acquisitions would be subject to a particular accounting treatment
that would help the acquiring institutions meet their reserve capital
requirements imposed by federal regulations. See Investigation of
Lincoln Savings & Loan Assn.: Hearing Before the House Committee
on Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., pt.
5, p. 447 (1989) (testimony of M. Danny Wall, Director, Office of
Thrift Supervision) (noting that acquirers of failing thrifts were
allowed to use certain accounting methods "in lieu of [direct] federal
financial assistance").


Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) there are
circumstances in which a business combination may be dealt with by
the "purchase method" of accounting. See generally R. Kay & D.
Searfoss, Handbook of Accounting and Auditing 23-21 to 23-40 (2d
ed. 1989) (describing the purchase method); Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 16 (1970) (establishing rules as to what method
must be applied to particular transactions). The critical aspect of that
method for our purposes is that it permits the acquiring entity to
designate the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of all
identifiable assets acquired as an intangible asset called "goodwill."
Id., Paragraph 11, p. 284; Kay & Searfoss, supra, at 23-38.4 In the
ordinary case, the recognition of goodwill as an asset makes sense: a
rational purchaser in a free market, after all, would not pay a price for
a business in excess of the value of that business's assets unless there
actually were some intangible "going concern" value that made up the
difference. See Lowy 39.5   For that reason, the purchase method is
frequently used to account for acquisitions, see A. Phillips, J. Butler,
G. Thompson, & R. Whitman, Basic Accounting for Lawyers 121
(4th ed. 1988), and GAAP expressly contemplated its application to at
least some transactions involving savings and loans. See Financial
Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 9 (1976). Goodwill
recognized under the purchase method as the result of an FSLIC-
sponsored supervisory merger was generally referred to as
"supervisory goodwill."

Recognition of goodwill under the purchase method was essential to
supervisory merger transactions of the type at issue in this case.
Because FSLIC had insufficient funds to make up the difference
between a failed thrift's liabilities and assets, the Bank Board had to
offer a "cash substitute" to induce a healthy thrift to assume a failed
thrift's obligations. Former Bank Board Chairman Richard Pratt put it
this way in testifying before Congress:

"The Bank Board . . . . did not have sufficient resources to close all
insolvent institutions, [but] at the same time, it had to consolidate the
industry, move weaker institutions into stronger hands, and do
everything possible to minimize losses during the transition period.
Goodwill was an indispensable tool in performing this task."  Savings
and Loan Policies in the Late 1970's and 1980's: Hearings Before the
House Committee on Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs, 101st
Cong., 2d Sess., No. 101-176, p. 227 (1990).6

Supervisory goodwill was attractive to healthy thrifts for at least two
reasons. First, thrift regulators let the acquiring institutions count
supervisory goodwill toward their reserve requirements under 12 CFR
Section 563.13 (1981). This treatment was, of course, critical to
make the transaction possible in the first place, because in most cases
the institution resulting from the transaction would immediately have
been insolvent under federal standards if goodwill had not counted
toward regulatory net worth. From the acquiring thrift's perspective,
however, the treatment of supervisory goodwill as regulatory capital
was attractive because it inflated the institution's reserves, thereby
allowing the thrift to leverage more loans (and, it hoped, make more
profits). See White 84; cf. Breeden, 59 Fordham L. Rev., at S75-
S76 (explaining how loosening reserve requirements permits asset
expansion).

A second and more complicated incentive arose from the decision by
regulators to let acquiring institutions amortize the goodwill asset over
long periods, up to the forty-year maximum permitted by GAAP, see
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 17, Paragraph 29, p. 340
(1970). Amortization recognizes that intangible assets such as
goodwill are useful for just so long; accordingly, a business must
"write down" the value of the asset each year to reflect its waning
worth. See Kay & Searfoss, supra, at 15-36 to 15-37; Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 17, supra, Paragraph 27, at 339-340.7
The amount of the write down is reflected on the business's income
statement each year as an operating expense. See generally E. Faris,
Accounting and Law in a Nutshell Section 12.2(q) (1984) (describing
amortization of goodwill). At the same time that it amortizes its
goodwill asset, however, an acquiring thrift must also account for
changes in the value of its loans, which are its principal assets. The
loans acquired as assets of the failed thrift in a supervisory merger
were generally worth less than their face value, typically because they
were issued at interest rates below the market rate at the time of the
acquisition. See Black, Ending Our Forebearers' Forbearances:
FIRREA and Supervisory Goodwill, 2 Stan. L. & Policy Rev. 102,
104-105 (1990). This differential or "discount," J. Rosenberg,
Dictionary of Banking and Financial Services 233 (2d ed. 1985),
appears on the balance sheet as a "contra-asset" account, or a
deduction from the loan's face value to reflect market valuation of the
asset, R. Estes, Dictionary of Accounting 29 (1981). Because loans
are ultimately repaid at face value, the magnitude of the discount
declines over time as redemption approaches; this process, technically
called "accretion of discount," is reflected on a thrift's income
statement as a series of capital gains. See Rosenberg, supra, at 9;
Estes, supra, at 39-40.

The advantage in all this to an acquiring thrift depends upon the fact
that accretion of discount is the mirror image of amortization of
goodwill. In the typical case, a failed thrift's primary assets were
long-term mortgage loans that earned low rates of interest and
therefore had declined in value to the point that the thrift's assets no
longer exceeded its liabilities to depositors. In such a case, the
disparity between assets and liabilities from which the accounting
goodwill was derived was virtually equal to the value of the discount
from face value of the thrift's outstanding loans. See Black, 2 Stan.
L. & Policy Rev., at 104-105. Thrift regulators, however, typically
agreed to supervisory merger terms that allowed acquiring thrifts to
accrete the discount over the average life of the loans (approximately
seven years), see id., at 105, while permitting amortization of the
goodwill asset over a much longer period. Given that goodwill and
discount were substantially equal in overall values, the more rapid
accrual of capital gain from accretion resulted in a net paper profit over
the initial years following the acquisition. See ibid.;  Lowy 39-40.8
The difference between amortization and accretion schedules thus
allowed acquiring thrifts to seem more profitable than they in fact
were.

Some transactions included yet a further inducement, described as a
"capital credit."  Such credits arose when FSLIC itself contributed
cash to further a supervisory merger and permitted the acquiring
institution to count the FSLIC contribution as a permanent credit to
regulatory capital. By failing to require the thrift to subtract this
FSLIC contribution from the amount of supervisory goodwill
generated by the merger, regulators effectively permitted double
counting of the cash as both a tangible and an intangible asset. See,
e.g., Transohio Savings Bank v. Director, Office of Thrift
Supervision, 967 F. 2d 598, 604 (CADC 1992). Capital credits thus
inflated the acquiring thrift's regulatory capital and permitted
leveraging of more and more loans.

As we describe in more detail below, the accounting treatment to be
accorded supervisory goodwill and capital credits was the subject of
express arrangements between the regulators and the acquiring
institutions. While the extent to which these arrangements constituted
a departure from prior norms is less clear, an acquiring institution
would reasonably have wanted to bargain for such treatment.
Although GAAP demonstrably permitted the use of the purchase
method in acquiring a thrift suffering no distress, the relevant thrift
regulations did not explicitly state that intangible goodwill assets
created by that method could be counted toward regulatory capital. See
12 CFR Section 563.13(a)(3) (1981) (permitting thrifts to count as
reserves any "items listed in the definition of net worth"); 12 CFR
Section 561.13 (1981) (defining "net worth" as "the sum of all reserve
accounts . . . , retained earnings, permanent stock, mutual capital
certificates..., and any other non-withdrawable accounts of an insured
institution").9   Indeed, the rationale for recognizing goodwill stands
on its head in a supervisory merger: ordinarily, goodwill is recognized
as valuable because a rational purchaser would not pay more than
assets are worth; here, however, the purchase is rational only because
of the accounting treatment for the shortfall. See Black, supra, at 104
("GAAP's treatment of goodwill . . . assumes that buyers do not
overpay when they purchase an S&L"). In the end, of course, such
reasoning circumvented the whole purpose of the reserve
requirements, which was to protect depositors and the deposit
insurance fund. As some in Congress later recognized, "[g]oodwill is
not cash. It is a concept, and a shadowy one at that. When the
Federal Government liquidates a failed thrift, goodwill is simply no
good. It is valueless. That means, quite simply, that the taxpayer
picks up the tab for the shortfall." 135 Cong. Rec. 11795 (1989)
(Rep. Barnard); see also White 84 (acknowledging that in some
instances supervisory goodwill "involved the creation of an asset that
did not have real value as protection for the FSLIC"). To those with
the basic foresight to appreciate all this, then, it was not obvious that
regulators would accept purchase accounting in determining
compliance with regulatory criteria, and it was clearly prudent to get
agreement on the matter.

The advantageous treatment of amortization schedules and capital
credits in supervisory mergers amounted to more clear-cut departures
from GAAP and, hence, subjects worthy of agreement by those
banking on such treatment. In 1983, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (the font of GAAP) promulgated Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 72, which applied specifically to
the acquisition of a savings and loan association. SFAS 72 provided
that "[i]f, and to the extent that, the fair value of liabilities assumed
exceeds the fair value of identifiable assets acquired in the acquisition
of a banking or thrift institution, the unidentifiable intangible asset
recognized generally shall be amortized to expense by the interest
method over a period no longer than the discount on the long-term
interest-bearing assets acquired is to be recognized as interest
income."  Accounting Standards, Original Pronouncements (July
1973-June 1, 1989), p. 725. In other words, SFAS 72 eliminated any
doubt that the differential amortization periods on which acquiring
thrifts relied to produce paper profits in supervisory mergers were
inconsistent with GAAP. SFAS 72 also barred double-counting of
capital credits by requiring that financial assistance from regulatory
authorities must be deducted from the cost of the acquisition before the
amount of goodwill is determined. SFAS 72, Paragraph 9.10 Thrift
acquirers relying on such credits, then, had every reason for concern
as to the continued availability of the RAP in effect at the time of these
transactions.


Although the results of the forbearance policy, including the
departures from GAAP, appear to have been mixed, see GAO,
Forbearance for Troubled Institutions 4, it is relatively clear that the
overall regulatory response of the early and mid-1980's was
unsuccessful in resolving the crisis in the thrift industry. See, e.g.,
Transohio Savings Bank, 967 F. 2d, at 602 (concluding that
regulatory measures "actually aggravat[ed] the decline"). As a result,
Congress enacted the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and
Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), Pub. L. 101-73, 103 Stat. 183,
with the objects of preventing the collapse of the industry, attacking
the root causes of the crisis, and restoring public confidence.

FIRREA made enormous changes in the structure of federal thrift
regulation by (1) abolishing FSLIC and transferring its functions to
other agencies; (2) creating a new thrift deposit insurance fund under
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); (3) replacing the
Bank Board with the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), a Treasury
Department office with responsibility for the regulation of all federally
insured savings associations; and (4) establishing the Resolution Trust
Corporation (RTC) to liquidate or otherwise dispose of certain closed
thrifts and their assets. See note following 12 U. S. C. Section 1437,
Sections 1441a, 1821. More importantly for the present case,
FIRREA also obligated OTS to "prescribe and maintain uniformly
applicable capital standards for savings associations" in accord with
strict statutory requirements. 12 U. S. C. Section 1464(t)(1)(A).11
In particular, the statute required thrifts to "maintain core capital in an
amount not less than 3 percent of the savings association's total
assets," 12 U. S. C. Section 1464(t)(2)(A), and defined "core capital"
to exclude "unidentifiable intangible assets," 12 U. S. C. Section
1464(t)(9)(A), such as goodwill. Although the reform provided a
"transition rule" permitting thrifts to count "qualifying supervisory
goodwill" toward half the core capital requirement, this allowance was
phased out by 1995. 12 U. S. C. Section 1464(t)(3)(A). According
to the House Report, these tougher capital requirements reflected a
congressional judgment that "[t]o a considerable extent, the size of the
thrift crisis resulted from the utilization of capital gimmicks that
masked the inadequate capitalization of thrifts." House Report, at 310.

The impact of FIRREA's new capital requirements upon institutions
that had acquired failed thrifts in exchange for supervisory goodwill
was swift and severe. OTS promptly issued regulations implementing
the new capital standards along with a bulletin noting that FIRREA
"eliminates [capital and accounting] forbearances" previously granted
to certain thrifts. Office of Thrift Supervision, Capital Adequacy:
Guidance on the Status of Capital and Accounting Forbearances and
Capital Instruments held by a Deposit Insurance Fund, Thrift Bulletin
No. 38-2, Jan. 9, 1990. OTS accordingly directed that "[a]ll savings
associations presently operating with these forbearances... should
eliminate them in determining whether or not they comply with the
new minimum regulatory capital standards."  Ibid. Despite the
statute's limited exception intended to moderate transitional pains,
many institutions immediately fell out of compliance with regulatory
capital requirements, making them subject to seizure by thrift
regulators. See Black, 2 Stan. L. & Policy Rev., at 107 ("FIRREA's
new capital mandates have caused over 500 S&Ls... to report that
they have failed one or more of the three capital requirements").


This case is about the impact of FIRREA's tightened capital
requirements on three thrift institutions created by way of supervisory
mergers. Respondents Glendale Federal Bank, FSB, Winstar
Corporation, and The Statesman Group, Inc. acquired failed thrifts in
1981, 1984, and 1988, respectively. After the passage of FIRREA,
federal regulators seized and liquidated the Winstar and Statesman
thrifts for failure to meet the new capital requirements. Although the
Glendale thrift also fell out of regulatory capital compliance as a result
of the new rules, it managed to avoid seizure through a massive
private recapitalization. Believing that the Bank Board and FSLIC had
promised them that the supervisory goodwill created in their merger
transactions could be counted toward regulatory capital requirements,
respondents each filed suit against the United States in the Court of
Federal Claims, seeking monetary damages on both contractual and
constitutional theories. That court granted respondents' motions for
partial summary judgment on contract liability, finding in each case
that the Government had breached contractual obligations to permit
respondents to count supervisory goodwill and capital credits toward
their regulatory capital requirements. See Winstar Corp. v. United
States, 21 Cl. Ct. 112 (1990) (Winstar I) (finding an implied-in-fact
contract but requesting further briefing on contract issues); 25 Cl. Ct.
541 (1992) (Winstar II) (finding contract breached and entering
summary judgment on liability); Statesman Savings Holding Corp. v.
United States, 26 Cl. Ct. 904 (1992) (granting summary judgment on
liability to Statesman and Glendale). In so holding, the Court of
Federal Claims rejected two central defenses asserted by the
Government: that the Government could not be held to a promise to
refrain from exercising its regulatory authority in the future unless that
promise was unmistakably clear in the contract, Winstar I, 21 Cl. Ct.,
at 116; Winstar II, 25 Cl. Ct., at 544-549; Statesman, 26 Cl. Ct., at
919-920, and that the Government's alteration of the capital reserve
requirements in FIRREA was a sovereign act that could not trigger
contractual liability, Winstar II, 25 Cl. Ct., at 550-553; Statesman, 26
Cl. Ct., at 915-916. The Court of Federal Claims consolidated the
three cases and certified its decisions for interlocutory appeal.

A divided panel of the Federal Circuit reversed, holding that the
parties did not allocate to the Government, in an unmistakably clear
manner, the risk of a subsequent change in the regulatory capital
requirements. Winstar Corp. v. United States, 994 F. 2d 797, 811-
813 (1993). The full court, however, vacated this decision and agreed
to rehear the case en banc. After rebriefing and reargument, the en
banc court reversed the panel decision and affirmed the Court of
Federal Claims' rulings on liability. Winstar Corp. v. United States,
64 F. 3d 1531 (CA Fed. 1995) (en banc). The Federal Circuit found
that FSLIC had made express contracts with respondents, including a
promise that supervisory goodwill and capital credits could be counted
toward satisfaction of the regulatory capital requirements. Id., at
1540, 1542-1543. The court rejected the Government's
unmistakability argument, agreeing with the Court of Federal Claims
that that doctrine had no application in a suit for money damages. Id.,
at 1545-1548. Finally, the en banc majority found that FIRREA's
new capital requirements "single[d] out supervisory goodwill for
special treatment" and therefore could not be said to be a "public" and
"general act" within the meaning of the sovereign acts doctrine. Id., at
1548-1551. Judge Nies dissented, essentially repeating the arguments
in her prior opinion for the panel majority, id., at 1551-1552, and
Judge Lourie also dissented on the ground that FIRREA was a public
and general act, id., at 1552-1553. We granted certiorari, 516 U. S.
___ (1996), and now affirm.


We took this case to consider the extent to which special rules, not
generally applicable to private contracts, govern enforcement of the
governmental contracts at issue here. We decide whether the
Government may assert four special defenses to respondents' claims
for breach: the canon of contract construction that surrenders of
sovereign authority must appear in unmistakable terms, Bowen v.
Public Agencies Opposed to Social Security Entrapment, 477 U. S.
41, 52 (1986); the rule that an agent's authority to make such
surrenders must be delegated in express terms, Home Telephone &
Telegraph Co. v. City of Los Angeles, 211 U. S. 265 (1908); the
doctrine that a government may not, in any event, contract to
surrender certain reserved powers, Stone v. Mississippi, 101 U. S.
814 (1880); and, finally, the principle that a Government's sovereign
acts do not give rise to a claim for breach of contract, Horowitz v.
United States, 267 U. S. 458, 460 (1925).

The anterior question of whether there were contracts at all between
the Government and respondents dealing with regulatory treatment of
supervisory goodwill and capital credits, although briefed and argued
by the parties in this Court, is not strictly before us. See Yee v.
Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 535 (1992) (noting that "we ordinarily do
not consider questions outside those presented in the petition for
certiorari"); Sup. Ct. Rule 14.1(a). And although we may review the
Court of Federal Claims' grant of summary judgment de novo,
Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc., 504 U. S.
451, 465, n. 10 (1992), we are in no better position than the Federal
Circuit and the Court of Federal Claims to evaluate the documentary
records of the transactions at issue. Our resolution of the legal issues
raised by the petition for certiorari, however, does require some
consideration of the nature of the underlying transactions.


The Federal Circuit found that "[t]he three plaintiff thrifts negotiated
contracts with the bank regulatory agencies that allowed them to
include supervisory goodwill (and capital credits) as assets for
regulatory capital purposes and to amortize that supervisory goodwill
over extended periods of time."  64 F. 3d, at 1545. Although each of
these transactions was fundamentally similar, the relevant
circumstances and documents vary somewhat from case to case.


In September 1981, Glendale was approached about a possible merger
by the First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Broward
County, which then had liabilities exceeding the fair value of its assets
by over $734 million. At the time, Glendale's accountants estimated
that FSLIC would have needed approximately $1.8 billion to liquidate
Broward, only about $1 billion of which could be recouped through
the sale of Broward's assets. Glendale, on the other hand, was both
profitable and well capitalized, with a net worth of $277 million.12
After some preliminary negotiations with the regulators, Glendale
submitted a merger proposal to the Bank Board, which had to approve
all mergers involving savings and loan associations, see 12 U. S. C.
Section 1467a(e)(1)(A) and (B); 12 U. S. C. Section 1817(j)(1); that
proposal assumed the use of the purchase method of accounting to
record supervisory goodwill arising from the transaction, with an
amortization period of 40 years. The Bank Board ratified the merger,
or "Supervisory Action Agreement" (SAA), on November 19, 1981.

The SAA itself said nothing about supervisory goodwill, but did
contain the following integration clause:


"This Agreement . . . constitutes the entire agreement between the
parties thereto and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings
of the parties in connection herewith, excepting only the Agreement of
Merger and any resolutions or letters issued contemporaneously
herewith." App. 598-599.

The SAA thereby incorporated Bank Board Resolution No. 81-710,
by which the Board had ratified the SAA. That Resolution referred to
two additional documents: a letter to be furnished by Glendale's
independent accountant identifying and supporting the use of any
goodwill to be recorded on Glendale's books, as well as the resulting
amortization periods; and "a stipulation that any goodwill arising from
this transaction shall be determined and amortized in accordance with
[Bank Board] Memorandum R 31b."  Id., at 607. Memorandum R
31b, finally, permitted Glendale to use the purchase method of
accounting and to recognize goodwill as an asset subject to
amortization. See id., at 571-574.

The Government does not seriously contest this evidence that the
parties understood that goodwill arising from these transactions would
be treated as satisfying regulatory requirements; it insists, however,
that these documents simply reflect statements of then-current federal
regulatory policy rather than contractual undertakings. Neither the
Court of Federal Claims nor the Federal Circuit so read the record,
however, and we agree with those courts that the Government's
interpretation of the relevant documents is fundamentally implausible.
The integration clause in Glendale's Supervisory Action Agreement
(SAA) with FSLIC, which is similar in all relevant respects to the
analogous provisions in the Winstar and Statesman contracts,
provides that the SAA supersedes "all prior agreements and
understandings . . . excepting only . . . any resolutions or letters
issued contemporaneously" by the Board, id., at 598-599; in other
words, the SAA characterizes the Board's resolutions and letters not
as statements of background rules, but as part of the "agreements and
understandings" between the parties.

To the extent that the integration clause leaves any ambiguity, the other
courts that construed the documents found that the realities of the
transaction favored reading those documents as contractual
commitments, not mere statements of policy, see Restatement
(Second) of Contracts Section 202(1) (1981) ("Words and other
conduct are interpreted in the light of all the circumstances, and if the
principal purpose of the parties is ascertainable it is given great
weight"), and we see no reason to disagree. As the Federal Circuit
noted, "[i]t is not disputed that if supervisory goodwill had not been
available for purposes of meeting regulatory capital requirements, the
merged thrift would have been subject to regulatory noncompliance
and penalties from the moment of its creation."  64 F. 3d, at 1542.
Indeed, the assumption of Broward's liabilities would have rendered
Glendale immediately insolvent by approximately $460 million, but
for Glendale's right to count goodwill as regulatory capital. Although
one can imagine cases in which the potential gain might induce a party
to assume a substantial risk that the gain might be wiped out by a
change in the law, it would have been irrational in this case for
Glendale to stake its very existence upon continuation of current
policies without seeking to embody those policies in some sort of
contractual commitment. This conclusion is obvious from both the
dollar amounts at stake and the regulators' proven propensity to make
changes in the relevant requirements. See Brief for United States 26
("[I]n light of the frequency with which federal capital requirements
had changed in the past . . . , it would have been unreasonable for
Glendale, FSLIC, or the Bank Board to expect or rely upon the fact
that those requirements would remain unchanged"); see also infra, at
68-69. Under the circumstances, we have no doubt that the parties
intended to settle regulatory treatment of these transactions as a
condition of their agreement. See, e.g., The Binghamton Bridge, 3
Wall. 51, 78 (1866) (refusing to construe charter in such a way that it
would have been "madness" for private party to enter into it).13   We
accordingly have no reason to question the Court of Appeals's
conclusion that "the government had an express contractual obligation
to permit Glendale to count the supervisory goodwill generated as a
result of its merger with Broward as a capital asset for regulatory
capital purposes."  64 F. 3d, at 1540.


In 1983, FSLIC solicited bids for the acquisition of Windom Federal
Savings and Loan Association, a Minnesota-based thrift in danger of
failing. At that time, the estimated cost to the Government of
liquidating Windom was approximately $12 million. A group of
private investors formed Winstar Corporation for the purpose of
acquiring Windom and submitted a merger plan to FSLIC; it called for
capital contributions of $2.8 million from Winstar and $5.6 million
from FSLIC, as well as for recognition of supervisory goodwill to be
amortized over a period of 35 years.

The Bank Board accepted the Winstar proposal and made an
Assistance Agreement that incorporated, by an integration clause much
like Glendale's, both the Board's resolution approving the merger and
a forbearance letter issued on the date of the agreement. See App.
112. The forbearance letter provided that "[f]or purposes of reporting
to the Board, the value of any intangible assets resulting from
accounting for the merger in accordance with the purchase method
may be amortized by [Winstar] over a period not to exceed 35 years
by the straight-line method." Id., at 123. Moreover, the Assistance
Agreement itself contained an "Accounting Principles" section with the
following provisions:

"Except as otherwise provided, any computations made for the
purposes of this Agreement shall be governed by generally accepted
accounting principles as applied on a going concern basis in the
savings and loan industry, except that where such principles conflict
with the terms of this Agreement, applicable regulations of the Bank
Board or the [FSLIC], or any resolution or action of the Bank Board
approving or adopted concurrently with this Agreement, then this
Agreement, such regulations, or such resolution or action shall
govern. . . . If there is a conflict between such regulations and the
Bank Board's resolution or action, the Bank Board's resolution or
action shall govern. For purposes of this section, the governing
regulations and the accounting principles shall be those in effect on the
Effective Date or as subsequently clarified, interpreted, or amended by
the Bank Board or the Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB"), respectively, or any successor organization to either."  Id.,
at 108-109.

The Government emphasizes the last sentence of this clause, which
provides that the relevant accounting principles may be "subsequently
clarified . . . or amended," as barring any inference that the
Government assumed the risk of regulatory change. Its argument,
however, ignores the preceding sentence providing that the Bank
Board's resolutions and actions in connection with the merger must
prevail over contrary regulations. If anything, then, the accounting
principles clause tilts in favor of interpreting the contract to lock in the
then-current regulatory treatment of supervisory goodwill.

In any event, we do not doubt the soundness of the Federal Circuit's
finding that the overall "documentation in the Winstar transaction
establishes an express agreement allowing Winstar to proceed with the
merger plan approved by the Bank Board, including the recording of
supervisory goodwill as a capital asset for regulatory capital purposes
to be amortized over 35 years."  64 F. 3d, at 1544. As in the
Glendale transaction, the circumstances of the merger powerfully
support this conclusion: The tangible net worth of the acquired
institution was a negative $6.7 million, and the new Winstar thrift
would have been out of compliance with regulatory capital standards
from its very inception, without including goodwill in the relevant
calculations. We thus accept the Court of Appeals's conclusion that
"it was the intention of the parties to be bound by the accounting
treatment for goodwill arising in the merger."  Ibid.


Statesman, another nonthrift entity, approached FSLIC in 1987 about
acquiring a subsidiary of First Federated Savings Bank, an insolvent
Florida thrift. FSLIC responded that if Statesman wanted government
assistance in the acquisition it would have to acquire all of First
Federated as well as three shaky thrifts in Iowa. Statesman and
FSLIC ultimately agreed on a complex plan for acquiring the four
thrifts; the agreement involved application of the purchase method of
accounting, a $21 million cash contribution from Statesman to be
accompanied by $60 million from FSLIC, and (unlike the Glendale
and Winstar plans) treatment of $26 million of FSLIC's contribution
as a permanent capital credit to Statesman's regulatory capital.

The Assistance Agreement between Statesman and FSLIC included an
"accounting principles" clause virtually identical to Winstar's, see
App. 402-403, as well as a specific provision for the capital credit:

"For the purposes of reports to the Bank Board . . . , $26 million of
the contribution [made by FSLIC] shall be credited to [Statesman's]
regulatory capital account and shall constitute regulatory capital (as
defined in Section 561.13 of the Insurance Regulations)."  Id., at
362a.

As with Glendale and Winstar, the Agreement had an integration
clause incorporating contemporaneous resolutions and letters issued
by the Board. Id., at 407-408. The Board's Resolution explicitly
acknowledged both the capital credits and the creation of supervisory
goodwill to be amortized over 25 years, id., at 458-459, and the
Forbearance Letter likewise recognized the capital credit provided for
in the Agreement. Id., at 476. Finally, the parties executed a separate
Regulatory Capital Maintenance Agreement stating that, "[i]n
consideration of the mutual promises contained [t]herein," id., at 418,
Statesman would be obligated to maintain the regulatory capital of the
acquired thrifts "at the level . . . required by Section 563.13(b) of the
Insurance Regulations... or any successor regulation . . . ."  The
agreement further provided, however, that "[f]or purposes of this
Agreement, any determination of [Statesman's] Required Regulatory
Capital . . . shall include . . . amounts permitted by the FSLIC in the
Assistance Agreement and in the forbearances issued in connection
with the transactions discussed herein."  Id., at 418-419. Absent
those forbearances, Statesman's thrift would have remained insolvent
by almost $9 million despite the cash infusions provided by the parties
to the transaction.

For the same reasons set out above with respect to the Glendale and
Winstar transactions, we accept the Federal Circuit's conclusion that
"the government was contractually obligated to recognize the capital
credits and the supervisory goodwill generated by the merger as part
of the Statesman's regulatory capital requirement and to permit such
goodwill to be amortized on a straight line basis over 25 years."  64 F.
3d, at 1543. Indeed, the Government's position is even weaker in
Statesman's case because the capital credits portion of the agreement
contains an express commitment to include those credits in the
calculation of regulatory capital. The Government asserts that the
reference to Section 563.13 of FSLIC regulations, which at the time
defined regulatory capital for thrift institutions, indicates that the
Government's obligations could change along with the relevant
regulations. But, just as in Winstar's case, the Government would
have us overlook the specific incorporation of the then-current
regulations as part of the agreement.14   The Government also cites a
provision requiring Statesman to "comply in all material respects with
all applicable statutes, regulations, orders of, and restrictions imposed
by the United States or . . . by any agency of [the United States],"
App. 407, but this simply meant that Statesman was required to
observe FIRREA's new capital requirements once they were
promulgated. The clause was hardly necessary to oblige Statesman to
obey the law, and nothing in it barred Statesman from asserting that
passage of that law required the Government to take action itself or be
in breach of its contract.


It is important to be clear about what these contracts did and did not
require of the Government. Nothing in the documentation or the
circumstances of these transactions purported to bar the Government
from changing the way in which it regulated the thrift industry.
Rather, what the Federal Circuit said of the Glendale transaction is
true of the Winstar and Statesman deals as well: "the Bank Board and
the FSLIC were contractually bound to recognize the supervisory
goodwill and the amortization periods reflected" in the agreements
between the parties. 64 F. 3d, at 1541-1542. We read this promise
as the law of contracts has always treated promises to provide
something beyond the promisor's absolute control, that is, as a
promise to insure the promisee against loss arising from the promised
condition's nonoccurrence.15   Holmes's example is famous:

"[i]n the case of a binding promise that it shall rain to-morrow, the
immediate legal effect of what the promisor does is, that he takes the
risk of the event, within certain defined limits, as between himself and
the promisee."  Holmes, The Common Law (1881), in 3 The
Collected Works of Justice Holmes 268 (S. Novick ed. 1995).16
Contracts like this are especially appropriate in the world of regulated
industries, where the risk that legal change will prevent the bargained-
for performance is always lurking in the shadows. The drafters of the
Restatement attested to this when they explained that, "[w]ith the trend
toward greater governmental regulation... parties are increasingly
aware of such risks, and a party may undertake a duty that is not
discharged by such supervening governmental actions . . . ."
Restatement (Second) of Contracts Section 264, Comment a. "Such
an agreement," according to the Restatement, "is usually interpreted as
one to pay damages if performance is prevented rather than one to
render a performance in violation of law."  Ibid.17

When the law as to capital requirements changed in the present
instance, the Government was unable to perform its promise and,
therefore, became liable for breach. We accept the Federal Circuit's
conclusion that the Government breached these contracts when,
pursuant to the new regulatory capital requirements imposed by
FIRREA, 12 U. S. C. Section 1464(t), the federal regulatory agencies
limited the use of supervisory goodwill and capital credits in
calculating respondents' net worth. 64 F. 3d, at 1545. In the case of
Winstar and Statesman, the Government exacerbated its breach when
it seized and liquidated respondents' thrifts for regulatory
noncompliance. Ibid.

In evaluating the relevant documents and circumstances, we have, of
course, followed the Federal Circuit in applying ordinary principles of
contract construction and breach that would be applicable to any
contract action between private parties. The Government's case,
however, is that the Federal Circuit's decision to apply ordinary
principles was error for a variety of reasons, each of which we
consider, and reject, in the sections ahead.


The Government argues for reversal, first, on the principle that
"contracts that limit the government's future exercises of regulatory
authority are strongly disfavored; such contracts will be recognized
only rarely, and then only when the limitation on future regulatory
authority is expressed in unmistakable terms."  Brief for United States
16. Hence, the Government says, the agreements between the Bank
Board, FSLIC, and respondents should not be construed to waive
Congress's authority to enact a subsequent bar to using supervisory
goodwill and capital credits to meet regulatory capital requirements.

The argument mistakes the scope of the unmistakability doctrine. The
thrifts do not claim that the Bank Board and FSLIC purported to bind
Congress to ossify the law in conformity to the contracts; they seek no
injunction against application of FIRREA's new capital requirements
to them and no exemption from FIRREA's terms. They simply claim
that the Government assumed the risk that subsequent changes in the
law might prevent it from performing, and agreed to pay damages in
the event that such failure to perform caused financial injury. The
question, then, is not whether Congress could be constrained but
whether the doctrine of unmistakability is applicable to any contract
claim against the Government for breach occasioned by a subsequent
act of Congress. The answer to this question is no.


The unmistakability doctrine invoked by the Government was stated in
Bowen v. Public Agencies Opposed to Social Security Entrapment:
"`[S]overeign power . . . governs all contracts subject to the
sovereign's jurisdiction, and will remain intact unless surrendered in
unmistakable terms.'" 477 U. S., at 52 (quoting Merrion v. Jicarilla
Apache Tribe, 455 U. S. 130, 148 (1982)). This doctrine marks the
point of intersection between two fundamental constitutional concepts,
the one traceable to the theory of parliamentary sovereignty made
familiar by Blackstone, the other to the theory that legislative power
may be limited, which became familiar to Americans through their
experience under the colonial charters, see G. Wood, The Creation of
the American Republic 1776-1787, pp. 268-271 (1969).

In his Commentaries, Blackstone stated the centuries-old concept that
one legislature  may not bind the legislative authority of its successors:

"Acts of parliament derogatory from the power of subsequent
parliaments bind not. . . . Because the legislature, being in truth the
sovereign power, is always of equal, always of absolute authority: it
acknowledges no superior upon earth, which the prior legislature must
have been, if it's [sic] ordinances could bind the present parliament."
1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 90
(1765).18

In England, of course, Parliament was historically supreme in the
sense that no "higher law" limited the scope of legislative action or
provided mechanisms for placing legally enforceable limits upon it in
specific instances; the power of American legislative bodies, by
contrast, is subject to the overriding dictates of the Constitution and
the obligations that it authorizes. See Eule, Temporal Limits on the
Legislative Mandate: Entrenchment and Retroactivity, 1987 Am. Bar
Found. Research J. 379, 392-393 (observing that the English
rationale for precluding a legislature from binding its successors does
not apply in America). Hence, although we have recognized that "a
general law . . . may be repealed, amended or disregarded by the
legislature which enacted it," and "is not binding upon any subsequent
legislature," Manigault v. Springs, 199 U. S. 473, 487 (1905),19  on
this side of the Atlantic the principle has always lived in some tension
with the constitutionally created potential for a legislature, under
certain circumstances, to place effective limits on its successors, or to
authorize executive action resulting in such a limitation.

The development of this latter, American doctrine in federal litigation
began in cases applying limits on state sovereignty imposed by the
National Constitution. Thus Chief Justice Marshall's exposition in
Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87 (1810), where the Court held that the
Contract Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, Section 10, cl. 1, barred the
State of Georgia's effort to rescind land grants made by a prior state
legislature. Marshall acknowledged "that one legislature is competent
to repeal any act which a former legislature was competent to pass;
and that one legislature cannot abridge the powers of a succeeding
legislature." Id., at 135. "The correctness of this principle, so far as
respects general legislation," he said, "can never be controverted."
Ibid. Marshall went on to qualify the principle, however, noting that
"if an act be done under a law, a succeeding legislature cannot undo it.
The past cannot be recalled by the most absolute power."  Ibid. For
Marshall, this was true for the two distinct reasons that the intrusion
on vested rights by the Georgia legislature's act of repeal might well
have gone beyond the limits of "the legislative power," and that
Georgia's legislative sovereignty was limited by the Federal
Constitution's bar against laws impairing the obligation of contracts.
Id., at 135-136.

The impetus for the modern unmistakability doctrine was thus Chief
Justice Marshall's application of the Contract Clause to public
contracts. Although that Clause made it possible for state legislatures
to bind their successors by entering into contracts, it soon became
apparent that such contracts could become a threat to the sovereign
responsibilities of state governments. Later decisions were
accordingly less willing to recognize contractual restraints upon
legislative freedom of action, and two distinct limitations developed to
protect state regulatory powers. One came to be known as the
"reserved powers" doctrine, which held that certain substantive
powers of sovereignty could not be contracted away. See West River
Bridge Co. v. Dix, 6 How. 507 (1848) (holding that a State's
contracts do not surrender its eminent domain power).20   The other,
which surfaced somewhat earlier in Providence Bank v. Billings, 4
Pet. 514 (1830), and Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, 11 Pet.
420 (1837), was a canon of construction disfavoring implied
governmental obligations in public contracts. Under this rule that
"[a]ll public grants are strictly construed," The Delaware Railroad
Tax, 18 Wall. 206, 225 (1874), we have insisted that "[n]othing can
be taken against the state by presumption or inference," ibid., and that
"neither the right of taxation, nor any other power of sovereignty, will
be held . . . to have been surrendered, unless such surrender has been
expressed in terms too plain to be mistaken."  Jefferson Branch Bank
v. Skelly, 1 Black 436, 446 (1862).

The posture of the Government in these early unmistakability cases is
important. In each, a state or local government entity had made a
contract granting a private party some concession (such as a tax
exemption or a monopoly), and a subsequent governmental action had
abrogated the contractual commitment. In each case, the private party
was suing to invalidate the abrogating legislation under the Contract
Clause. A requirement that the government's obligation unmistakably
appear thus served the dual purposes of limiting contractual incursions
on a State's sovereign powers and of avoiding difficult constitutional
questions about the extent of State authority to limit the subsequent
exercise of legislative power. Cf. Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v.
Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S.
568, 575 (1988) ("[W]here an otherwise acceptable construction of a
statute would raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will
construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is
plainly contrary to the intent of Congress"); Ashwander v. TVA, 297
U. S. 288, 348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (same).

The same function of constitutional avoidance has marked the
expansion of the unmistakability doctrine from its Contract Clause
origins dealing with state grants and contracts to those of other
governmental sovereigns, including the United States. See Merrion v.
Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U. S., at 148 (deriving the unmistakability
principle from St. Louis v. United Railways Co., 210 U. S. 266
(1908), a Contract Clause suit against a state government).21
Although the Contract Clause has no application to acts of the United
States, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. v. R. A. Gray & Co., 467 U.
S. 717, 732, n. 9 (1984), it is clear that the National Government has
some capacity to make agreements binding future Congresses by
creating vested rights, see, e.g., Perry v. United states, 294 U. S.
330 (1935); Lynch v. United States, 292 U. S. 571 (1934). The
extent of that capacity, to be sure, remains somewhat obscure.
Compare, e.g., United States Trust Co. of N.Y. v. New Jersey, 431
U. S. 1, 26 (1977) (heightened Contract Clause scrutiny when States
abrogate their own contractual obligations), with Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corp., supra, at 733 (contrasting less exacting due process
standards governing federal economic legislation affecting private
contracts). But the want of more developed law on limitations
independent of the Contract Clause is in part the result of applying the
unmistakability canon of construction to avoid this doctrinal thicket, as
we have done in several cases involving alleged surrenders of
sovereign prerogatives by the National Government and Indian tribes.

First, we applied the doctrine to protect a tribal sovereign in Merrion
v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U. S. 130 (1982), which held that long-
term oil and gas leases to private parties from an Indian tribe,
providing for specific royalties to be paid to the tribe, did not limit the
tribe's sovereign prerogative to tax the proceeds from the lessees'
drilling activities. Id., at 148. Because the lease made no reference to
the tribe's taxing power, we held simply that a waiver of that power
could not be "inferred . . . from silence," ibid., since the taxing power
of any government remains "unless it is has been specifically
surrendered in terms which admit of no other reasonable
interpretation."  Ibid. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

In Bowen v. Public Agencies Opposed to Social Security Entrapment,
477 U. S. 41 (1986), this Court confronted a state claim that Section
103 of the Social Security Amendments Act of 1983, 97 Stat. 71, 42
U. S. C. Section 418(g) (1982 ed., Supp. II), was unenforceable to
the extent it was inconsistent with the terms of a prior agreement with
the National Government. Under the law before 1983, a State could
agree with the Secretary of Health and Human Services to cover the
State's employees under the Social Security scheme subject to a right
to withdraw them from coverage later. When the 1983 Act eliminated
the right of withdrawal, the State of California and related plaintiffs
sought to enjoin application of the new law to them, or to obtain just
compensation for loss of the withdrawal right (a remedy which the
District Court interpreted as tantamount to the injunction, since it
would mandate return of all otherwise required contributions, see 477
U. S., at 51). Although we were able to resolve the case by reading
the terms of a state-federal coverage agreement to reserve the
Government's right to modify its terms by subsequent legislation, in
the alternative we rested the decision on the more general principle
that, absent an "unmistakable" provision to the contrary, "contractual
arrangements, including those to which a sovereign itself is a party,
`remain subject to subsequent legislation' by the sovereign." Id., at 52
(quoting Merrion, supra, at 147). We thus rejected the proposal "to
find that a `sovereign forever waives the right to exercise one of its
sovereign powers unless it expressly reserves the right to exercise that
power in' the contract," Bowen, supra, at 52 (quoting Merrion, supra,
at 148), and held instead that unmistakability was needed for waiver,
not reservation.

Most recently, in United States v. Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, 480
U. S. 700 (1987), we refused to infer a waiver of federal sovereign
power from silence. There, an Indian tribe with property rights in a
river bed derived from a government treaty sued for just compensation
for damage to its interests caused by the Government's navigational
improvements to the Arkansas river. The claim for compensation
presupposed, and was understood to presuppose, that the
Government had conveyed to the tribe its easement to control
navigation; absent that conveyance, the tribe's property included no
right to be free from the Government's river bed improvements. Id.,
at 704. We found, however, that the treaty said nothing about
conveying the Government's navigational easement, see id., at 706,
which we saw as an aspect of sovereignty. This, we said, could be
"`surrendered [only] in unmistakable terms,'" id., at 707 (quoting
Bowen, supra, at 52), if indeed it could be waived at all.

Merrion, Bowen, and Cherokee Nation thus announce no new rule
distinct from the canon of construction adopted in Providence Bank
and Charles River Bridge; their collective holding is that a contract
with a sovereign government will not be read to include an unstated
term exempting the other contracting party from the application of a
subsequent sovereign act (including an act of Congress), nor will an
ambiguous term of a grant or contract be construed as a conveyance or
surrender of sovereign power. The cases extending back into the
19th-century thus stand for a rule that applies when the Government is
subject either to a claim that its contract has surrendered a sovereign
power22 (e.g., to tax or control navigation), or to a claim that cannot
be recognized without creating an exemption from the exercise of such
a power (e.g., the equivalent of exemption from social security
obligations). The application of the doctrine thus turns on whether
enforcement of the contractual obligation alleged would block the
exercise of a sovereign power of the Government.

Since the criterion looks to the effect of a contract's enforcement, the
particular remedy sought is not dispositive and the doctrine is not
rendered inapplicable by a request for damages, as distinct from
specific performance. The respondents in Cherokee Nation sought
nothing beyond damages, but the case still turned on the
unmistakability doctrine because there could be no claim to harm
unless the right to be free of the sovereign power to control navigation
had been conveyed away by the Government.23   So, too, in Bowen:
the sole relief sought was dollars and cents, but the award of damages
as requested would have been the equivalent of exemption from the
terms of the subsequent statute.

The application of the doctrine will therefore differ according to the
different kinds of obligations the Government may assume and the
consequences of enforcing them. At one end of the wide spectrum are
claims for enforcement of contractual obligations that could not be
recognized without effectively limiting sovereign authority, such as a
claim for rebate under an agreement for a tax exemption. Granting a
rebate, like enjoining enforcement, would simply block the exercise of
the taxing power, cf. Bowen, 477 U. S., at 51, and the
unmistakability doctrine would have to be satisfied.24   At the other
end are contracts, say, to buy food for the army; no sovereign power
is limited by the Government's promise to purchase and a claim for
damages implies no such limitation. That is why no one would
seriously contend that enforcement of humdrum supply contracts
might be subject to the unmistakability doctrine. Between these
extremes lies an enormous variety of contracts including those under
which performance will require exercise (or not) of a power peculiar
to the Government. So long as such a contract is reasonably
construed to include a risk-shifting component that may be enforced
without effectively barring the exercise of that power, the enforcement
of the risk allocation raises nothing for the unmistakability doctrine to
guard against, and there is no reason to apply it.

The Government argues that enforcement of the contracts in this case
would implicate the unmistakability principle, with the consequence
that Merrion, Bowen, and Cherokee Nation are good authorities for
rejecting respondents' claims. The Government's position is
mistaken, however, for the complementary reasons that the contracts
have not been construed as binding the Government's exercise of
authority to modify banking regulation or of any other sovereign
power, and there has been no demonstration that awarding damages
for breach would be tantamount to any such limitation.

As construed by each of the courts that considered these contracts
before they reached us, the agreements do not purport to bind the
Congress from enacting regulatory measures, and respondents do not
ask the courts to infer from silence any such limit on sovereign power
as would violate the holdings of Merrion and Cherokee Nation. The
contracts have been read as solely risk-shifting agreements and
respondents seek nothing more than the benefit of promises by the
Government to insure them against any losses arising from future
regulatory change. They seek no injunction against application of the
law to them, as the plaintiffs did in Bowen and Merrion, cf.
Reichelderfer v. Quinn, 287 U. S. 315 (1932), and they acknowledge
that the Bank Board and FSLIC could not bind Congress (and
possibly could not even bind their future selves) not to change
regulatory policy.

Nor do the damages respondents seek amount to exemption from the
new law, in the manner of the compensation sought in Bowen, see
supra, at 51. Once general jurisdiction to make an award against the
Government is conceded, a requirement to pay money supposes no
surrender of sovereign power by a sovereign with the power to
contract. See, e.g., Amino Bros. Co. v. United States, 178 Ct. Cl.
515, 525, 372 F. 2d 485, 491 ("The Government cannot make a
binding contract that it will not exercise a sovereign power, but it can
agree in a contract that if it does so, it will pay the other contracting
party the amount by which its costs are increased by the
Government's sovereign act"), cert. denied, 389 U. S. 846 (1967).25
Even if the respondents were asking that the Government be required
to make up any capital deficiency arising from the exclusion of
goodwill and capital credits from the relevant calculations, such relief
would hardly amount to an exemption from the capital requirements of
FIRREA;  after all, Glendale (the only respondent thrift still in
operation) would still be required to maintain adequate tangible capital
reserves under FIRREA, and the purpose of the statute, the protection
of the insurance fund, would be served. Nor would such a damages
award deprive the Government of money it would otherwise be
entitled to receive (as a tax rebate would), since the capital
requirements of FIRREA govern only the allocation of resources to a
thrift and require no payments to the Government at all.26

We recognize, of course, that while agreements to insure private
parties against the costs of subsequent regulatory change do not
directly impede the exercise of sovereign power, they may indirectly
deter needed governmental regulation by raising its costs. But all
regulations have their costs, and Congress itself expressed a
willingness to bear the costs at issue here when it authorized FSLIC to
"guarantee [acquiring thrifts] against loss" that might occur as a result
of a supervisory merger. 12 U. S. C. Section 1729(f)(2) (1988 ed.)
(repealed 1989). Just as we have long recognized that the Constitution
"`bar[s] Government from forcing some people alone to bear public
burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the
public as a whole,'"  Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U. S. ___, ___
(slip op., at 9) (quoting Armstrong v. United States, 364 U. S. 40, 49
(1960)), so we must reject the suggestion that the Government may
simply shift costs of legislation onto its contractual partners who are
adversely affected by the change in the law, when the Government has
assumed the risk of such change.

The Government's position would not only thus represent a
conceptual expansion of the unmistakability doctrine beyond its
historical and practical warrant, but would place the doctrine at odds
with the Government's own long-run interest as a reliable contracting
partner in the myriad workaday transaction of its agencies. Consider
the procurement contracts that can be affected by congressional or
executive scale-backs in federal regulatory or welfare activity; or
contracts to substitute private service-providers for the Government,
which could be affected by a change in the official philosophy on
privatization; or all the contracts to dispose of federal property,
surplus or otherwise. If these contracts are made in reliance on the
law of contract and without specific provision for default
mechanisms,27  should all the private contractors be denied a remedy
in damages unless they satisfy the unmistakability doctrine? The
answer is obviously no because neither constitutional avoidance nor
any apparent need to protect the Government from the consequences
of standard operations could conceivably justify applying the doctrine.
Injecting the opportunity for unmistakability litigation into every
common contract action would, however, produce the untoward result
of compromising the Government's practical capacity to make
contracts, which we have held to be "of the essence of sovereignty"
itself. United States v. Bekins, 304 U. S. 27, 51-52 (1938).28
From a practical standpoint, it would make an inroad on this power,
by expanding the Government's opportunities for contractual
abrogation, with the certain result of undermining the Government's
credibility at the bargaining table and increasing the cost of its
engagements. As Justice Brandeis recognized, "[p]unctilious
fulfillment of contractual obligations is essential to the maintenance of
the credit of public as well as private debtors."  Lynch v. United
States, 292 U. S., at 580.29

The dissent's only answer to our concern is to recognize that
"Congress may not simply abrogate a statutory provision obligating
performance without breaching the contract and rendering itself liable
for damages." Post, at 6 (citing Lynch, supra, at 580). Yet the only
grounds that statement suggests for distinguishing Lynch from the
present case is that there the contractual obligation was embodied in a
statute. Putting aside the question why this distinction should make
any difference, we note that the dissent seemingly does not deny that
its view would apply the unmistakability doctrine to the vast majority
of governmental contracts, which would be subject to abrogation
arguments based on subsequent sovereign acts. Indeed, the dissent
goes so far as to argue that our conclusion that damages are available
for breach even where the parties did not specify a remedy in the
contract depends upon "reading of additional terms into the contract."
Post, at 7. That, of course, is not the law; damages are always the
default remedy for breach of contract.30   And we suspect that most
government contractors would be quite surprised by the dissent's
conclusion that, where they have failed to require an express provision
that damages will be available for breach, that remedy must be
"implied in law" and therefore unavailable under the Tucker Act, post,
at 7-8.

Nor can the dissenting view be confined to those contracts that are
"regulatory" in nature. Such a distinction would raise enormous
analytical difficulties; one could ask in this case whether the
Government as contractor was regulating or insuring. The dissent
understandably does not advocate such a distinction, but its failure to
advance any limiting principle at all would effectively compromise the
Government's capacity as a reliable, straightforward contractor
whenever the subject matter of a contract might be subject to
subsequent regulation, which is most if not all of the time.31   Since
the facts of the present case demonstrate that Government may wish to
further its regulatory goals through contract, we are unwilling to adopt
any rule of construction that would weaken the Government's capacity
to do business by converting every contract it makes into an arena for
unmistakability litigation.

In any event, we think the dissent goes fundamentally wrong when it
concludes that "the issue of remedy for... breach" can arise only "[i]f
the sovereign did surrender its power unequivocally."  Post, at 6.
This view ignores the other, less remarkable possibility actually found
by both courts that construed these contracts: that the Government
agreed to do something that did not implicate its sovereign powers at
all, that is, to indemnify its contracting partners against financial
losses arising from regulatory change. We accordingly hold that the
Federal Circuit correctly refused to apply the unmistakability doctrine
here. See 64 F. 3d, at 1548. There being no need for an
unmistakably clear "second promise" not to change the capital
requirements, it is sufficient that the Government undertook an
obligation that it subsequently found itself unable to perform. This
conclusion does not, of course, foreclose the assertion of a defense
that the contracts were ultra vires or that the Government's obligation
should be discharged under the common-law doctrine of
impossibility, see infra, at 49-52, 52-72, but nothing in the nature of
the contracts themselves raises a bar to respondents' claims for
breach.32


The answer to the Government's unmistakability argument also meets
its two related contentions on the score of ultra vires: that the Bank
Board and FSLIC had no authority to bargain away Congress's power
to change the law in the future, and that we should in any event find
no such authority conferred without an express delegation to that
effect. The first of these positions rests on the reserved powers
doctrine, developed in the course of litigating claims that States had
violated the Contract Clause. See supra, at 34. It holds that a state
government may not contract away "an essential attribute of its
sovereignty," United States Trust, 431 U. S., at 23, with the classic
example of its limitation on the scope of the Contract Clause being
found in Stone v. Mississippi, 101 U. S. 814 (1880). There a
corporation bargained for and received a state legislative charter to
conduct lotteries, only to have them outlawed by statute a year later.
This Court rejected the argument that the charter immunized the
corporation from the operation of the statute, holding that "the
legislature cannot bargain away the police power of a State."  Id., at
817.33

The Government says that "[t]he logic of the doctrine... applies
equally to contracts alleged to have been made by the federal
government."  Brief for United States 38. This may be so but is also
beside the point, for the reason that the Government's ability to set
capital requirements is not limited by the Bank Board's and FSLIC's
promises to make good any losses arising from subsequent regulatory
changes. See supra, at 41-43. The answer to the Government's
contention that the State cannot barter away certain elements of its
sovereign power is that a contract to adjust the risk of subsequent
legislative change does not strip the Government of its legislative
sovereignty.34

The same response answers the Government's demand for express
delegation of any purported authority to fetter the exercise of
sovereign power. It is true, of course, that in Home Telephone &
Telegraph Co. v. City of Los Angeles, 211 U. S., at 273, we said that
"[t]he surrender, by contract, of a power of government, though in
certain well-defined cases it may be made by legislative authority, is a
very grave act, and the surrender itself, as well as the authority to
make it, must be closely scrutinized." Hence, where "a contract has
the effect of extinguishing pro tanto an undoubted power of
government," we have insisted that "both [the contract's] existence
and the authority to make it must clearly and unmistakably appear, and
all doubts must be resolved in favor of the continuance of the power."
Ibid. But Home Telephone & Telegraph simply has no application to
the present case, because there were no contracts to surrender the
Government's sovereign power to regulate.35

There is no question, conversely, that the Bank Board and FSLIC had
ample statutory authority to do what the Court of Federal Claims and
the Federal Circuit found they did do, that is, promise to permit
respondents to count supervisory goodwill and capital credits toward
regulatory capital and to pay respondents' damages if that performance
became impossible. The organic statute creating FSLIC as an arm of
the Bank Board, 12 U. S. C. Section 1725(c) (1988 ed.) (repealed
1989), generally empowered it "[t]o make contracts,"36  and Section
1729(f)(2), enacted in 1978, delegated more specific powers in the
context of supervisory mergers:

"Whenever an insured institution is in default or, in the judgment of
the Corporation, is in danger of default, the Corporation may, in order
to facilitate a merger or consolidation of such insured institution with
another insured institution . . . guarantee such other insured institution
against loss by reason of its merging or consolidating with or
assuming the liabilities and purchasing the assets of such insured
institution in or in danger of default."  12 U. S. C. Section 1729(f)(2)
(1976 ed. Supp. V) (repealed 1989).

Nor is there any reason to suppose that the breadth of this authority
was not meant to extend to contracts governing treatment of regulatory
capital. Congress specifically recognized FSLIC's authority to permit
thrifts to count goodwill toward capital requirements when it modified
the National Housing Act in 1987:

"No provision of this section shall affect the authority of the [FSLIC]
to authorize insured institutions to utilize subordinated debt and
goodwill in meeting reserve and other regulatory requirements."  12
U. S. C. Section 1730h(d) (1988 ed.) (repealed 1989).

See also S. Rep. No. 100-19, p. 55 (1987) ("It is expected that the
[Bank Board] will retain its own authority to determine . . . the
components and level of capital to be required of FSLIC-insured
institutions"); NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U. S. 267, 275
(1974) ("[S]ubsequent legislation declaring the intent of an earlier
statute is entitled to significant weight"). There is no serious question
that FSLIC (and the Bank Board acting through it) was authorized to
make the contracts in issue.


The Government's final line of defense is the sovereign acts doctrine,
to the effect that "`[w]hatever acts the government may do, be they
legislative or executive, so long as they be public and general, cannot
be deemed specially to alter, modify, obstruct or violate the particular
contracts into which it enters with private persons.'" Horowitz v.
United States, 267 U. S., at 461 (quoting Jones v. United States, 1
Ct. Cl. 383, 384 (1865)). Because FIRREA's alteration of the
regulatory capital requirements was a "public and general act," the
Government says, that act could not amount to a breach of the
Government's contract with respondents.

The Government's position cannot prevail, however, for two
independent reasons. The facts of this case do not warrant application
of the doctrine, and even if that were otherwise the doctrine would not
suffice to excuse liability under this governmental contract allocating
risks of regulatory change in a highly regulated industry.

In Horowitz, the plaintiff sued to recover damages for breach of a
contract to purchase silk from the Ordnance Department. The
agreement included a promise by the Department to ship the silk
within a certain time, although the manner of shipment does not
appear to have been a subject of the contract. Shipment was delayed
because the United States Railroad Administration placed an embargo
on shipments of silk by freight, and by the time the silk reached
Horowitz the price had fallen, rendering the deal unprofitable. This
Court barred any damages award for the delay, noting that "[i]t has
long been held by the Court of Claims that the United States when
sued as a contractor cannot be held liable for an obstruction to the
performance of the particular contract resulting from its public and
general acts as a sovereign."  267 U. S., at 461. This statement was
not, however, meant to be read as broadly as the Government urges,
and the key to its proper scope is found in that portion of our opinion
explaining that the essential point was to put the Government in the
same position that it would have enjoyed as a private contractor:

"`The two characters which the government possesses as a contractor
and as a sovereign cannot be thus fused; nor can the United States
while sued in the one character be made liable in damages for their acts
done in the other. Whatever acts the government may do, be they
legislative or executive, so long as they be public and general, cannot
be deemed specially to alter, modify, obstruct or violate the particular
contracts into which it enters with private persons. . . . In this court
the United States appear simply as contractors; and they are to be held
liable only within the same limits that any other defendant would be in
any other court. Though their sovereign acts performed for the
general good may work injury to some private contractors, such
parties gain nothing by having the United States as their defendants.'"
Ibid. (quoting Jones v. United States, supra, at 384).

The early Court of Claims cases upon which Horowitz relied
anticipated the Court's emphasis on the Government's dual and
distinguishable capacities and on the need to treat the government-as-
contractor the same as a private party. In Deming v. United States, 1
Ct. Cl. 190 (1865), the Court of Claims rejected a suit by a supplier of
army rations whose costs increased as a result of Congress's passage
of the Legal Tender Act. The Deming court thought it "grave error" to
suppose that "general enactments of Congress are to be construed as
evasions of [the plaintiff's] particular contract."  Id., at 191. "The
United States as a contractor are not responsible for the United States
as a lawgiver," the court said. "In this court the United States can be
held to no greater liability than other contractors in other courts." Ibid.
Similarly, Jones v. United States, supra refused a suit by surveyors
employed by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, whose performance
had been hindered by the United States's withdrawal of troops from
Indian country. "The United States as a contractor," the Claims Court
concluded, "cannot be held liable directly or indirectly for the public
acts of the United States as a sovereign." Id., at 385.

The Government argues that "[t]he relevant question [under these
cases] is whether the impact [of governmental action] . . . is caused by
a law enacted to govern regulatory policy and to advance the general
welfare." Brief for United States 45. This understanding assumes that
the dual characters of Government as contractor and legislator are
never "fused" (within the meaning of Horowitz) so long as the object
of the statute is regulatory and  meant to accomplish some public
good. That is, on the Government's reading, a regulatory object is
proof against treating the legislature as having acted to avoid the
Government's contractual obligations, in which event the sovereign
acts defense would not be applicable. But the Government's position
is open to serious objection.


As an initial matter, we have already expressed our doubt that a
workable line can be drawn between the Government's "regulatory"
and "nonregulatory" capacities. In the present case, the Government
chose to regulate capital reserves to protect FSLIC's insurance fund,
much as any insurer might impose restrictions on an insured as a
condition of the policy. The regulation thus protected the Government
in its capacity analogous to a private insurer, the same capacity in
which it entered into supervisory merger agreements to convert some
of its financial insurance obligations into responsibilities of private
entrepreneurs. In this respect, the supervisory mergers bear some
analogy to private contracts for reinsurance.37 On the other hand,
there is no question that thrift regulation is, in fact, regulation, and that
both the supervisory mergers of the 1980's and the subsequent
passage of FIRREA were meant to advance a broader public interest.
The inescapable conclusion from all of this is that the Government's
"regulatory" and "nonregulatory" capacities were fused in the
instances under consideration, and we suspect that such fusion will be
so common in the modern regulatory state as to leave a criterion of
"regulation" without much use in defining the scope of the sovereign
acts doctrine.38

An even more serious objection is that allowing the Government to
avoid contractual liability merely by passing any "regulatory statute,"
would flaunt the general principle that, "[w]hen the United States
enters into contract relations, its rights and duties therein are governed
generally by the law applicable to contracts between private
individuals." Lynch v. United States, 292 U. S., at 579.39   Careful
attention to the cases shows that the sovereign acts doctrine was meant
to serve this principle, not undermine it. In Horowitz, for example, if
the defendant had been a private shipper, it would have been entitled
to assert the common-law defense of impossibility of performance
against Horowitz's claim for breach. Although that defense is
traditionally unavailable where the barrier to performance arises from
the act of the party seeking discharge, see Restatement (Second) of
Contracts Section 261; 2 E. Farnsworth, Farnsworth on Contracts
Section 9.6, p. 551 (1990); cf. W. R. Grace & Co. v. Rubber
Workers, 461 U. S. 757, 767-768, n. 10 (1983), Horowitz held that
the "public and general" acts of the sovereign are not attributable to the
Government as contractor so as to bar the Government's right to
discharge. The sovereign acts doctrine thus balances the
Government's need for freedom to legislate with its obligation to
honor its contracts by asking whether the sovereign act is properly
attributable to the Government as contractor. If the answer is no, the
Government's defense to liability depends on the answer to the further
question, whether that act would otherwise release the Government
from liability under ordinary principles of contract law.40 Neither
question can be answered in the Government's favor here.


If the Government is to be treated like other contractors, some line has
to be drawn in situations like the one before us between regulatory
legislation that is relatively free of government self-interest and
therefore cognizable for the purpose of a legal impossibility defense
and, on the other hand, statutes tainted by a governmental object of
self-relief. Such an object is not necessarily inconsistent with a public
purpose, of course, and when we speak of governmental "self-
interest," we simply mean to identify instances in which the
Government seeks to shift the costs of meeting its legitimate public
responsibilities to private parties. Cf. Armstrong v. United States,
364 U. S., at 49 (The Government may not "forc[e] some people
alone to bear public burdens which . . . should be borne by the public
as a whole"). Hence, while the Government might legitimately
conclude that a given contractual commitment was no longer in the
public interest, a government seeking relief from such commitments
through legislation would obviously not be in a position comparable to
that of the private contractor who willy-nilly was barred by law from
performance. There would be, then, good reason in such
circumstance to find the regulatory and contractual characters of the
Government fused together, in Horowitz's terms, so that the
Government should not have the benefit of the defense.41

Horowitz's criterion of "public and general act" thus reflects the
traditional "rule of law" assumption that generality in the terms by
which the use of power is authorized will tend to guard against its
misuse to burden or benefit the few unjustifiably.42   See, e.g.,
Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516, 535-536 (1884) ("Law . . .
must be not a special rule for a particular person or a particular case,
but . . . `[t]he general law . . .' so `that every citizen shall hold his
life, liberty, property and immunities under the protection of the
general rules which govern society'") (citation omitted).43   Hence,
governmental action will not be held against the Government for
purposes of the impossibility defense so long as the action's impact
upon public contracts is, as in Horowitz, merely incidental to the
accomplishment of a broader governmental objective. See O'Neill v.
United States, 231 Ct. Cl. 823, 926 (1982) (noting that the sovereign
acts doctrine recognizes that "the Government's actions, otherwise
legal, will occasionally incidentally impair the performance of
contracts").44   The greater the Government's self-interest, however,
the more suspect becomes the claim that its private contracting partners
ought to bear the financial burden of the Government's own
improvidence, and where a substantial part of the impact of the
Government's action rendering performance impossible falls on its
own contractual obligations, the defense will be unavailable. Cf. Sun
Oil Co. v. United States, 215 Ct. Cl. 716, 768, 572 F. 2d 786, 817
(1978) (rejecting sovereign acts defense where the Secretary of the
Interior's actions were "`directed principally and primarily at
plaintiffs' contractual right'").45

The dissent would adopt a different rule that the Government's dual
roles of contractor and sovereign may never be treated as fused,
relying upon Deming's pronouncement that "[t]he United States as a
contractor are not responsible for the United States as a lawgiver."
Post, at 9 (quoting 1 Ct. Cl., at 191). But that view would simply
eliminate the "public and general" requirement, which presupposes
that the Government's capacities must be treated as fused when the
Government acts in a non-general way. Deming itself twice refers to
the "general" quality of the enactment at issue, 1 Ct. Cl., at 191, and
notes that "[t]he statute bears upon [the governmental contract] as it
bears upon all similar contracts between citizens, and affects it in no
other way."  Ibid. At the other extreme, of course, it is clear that any
benefit at all to the Government will not disqualify an act as "public
and general"; the silk embargo in Horowitz, for example, had the
incidental effect of releasing the Government from its contractual
obligation to transport Mr. Horowitz's shipment. Our holding that a
governmental act will not be public and general if it has the substantial
effect of releasing the Government from its contractual obligations
strikes a middle course between these two extremes.46


In the present case, it is impossible to attribute the exculpatory "public
and general" character to FIRREA. Although we have not been told
the dollar value of the relief the Government would obtain if insulated
from liability under contracts such as these, the attention given to the
regulatory contracts prior to passage of FIRREA shows that a
substantial effect on governmental contracts is certain. The statute not
only had the purpose of eliminating the very accounting gimmicks that
acquiring thrifts had been promised, but the specific object of
abrogating enough of the acquisition contracts as to make that
consequence of the legislation a focal point of the congressional
debate.47   Opponents of FIRREA's new capital requirements
complained that "[i]n its present form, [FIRREA] would abrogate
written agreements made by the U. S. government to thrifts that
acquired failing institutions by changing the rules in the middle of the
game." 135 Cong. Rec. H2783 (June 15, 1989) (Statement of Rep.
Ackerman). Several congressmen observed that, "[s]imply put,
[Congress] has reneged on the agreements that the government entered
into concerning supervisory goodwill." House Report, at 498
(additional views of Reps. Annunzio, Kanjorski, and Flake).48   A
similar focus on the supervisory merger contracts is evident among
proponents of the legislation; Representative Rostenkowski, for
example, insisted that "the Federal Government should be able to
change requirements when they have proven to be disastrous and
contrary to the public interest. The contracts between the savings and
loan owners when they acquired failing institutions in the early 1980's
are not contracts written in stone."  135 Cong. Rec., at H2717 (June
15, 1989).49

This evidence of intense concern with contracts like the ones before us
suffices to show that FIRREA had the substantial effect of releasing
the Government from its own contractual obligations. Congress
obviously expected FIRREA to have such an effect, and in the
absence of any evidence to the contrary we accept its factual judgment
that this would be so.50   Nor is Congress's own judgment
neutralized by the fact, emphasized by the Government, that FIRREA
did not formally target particular transactions. Legislation can almost
always be written in a formally general way, and the want of an
identified target is not much security when a measure's impact
nonetheless falls substantially upon the Government's contracting
partners. For like reason, it does not answer the legislative record to
insist, as the Government does, that the congressional focus is
irrelevant because the broad purpose of FIRREA was to "advance the
general welfare."  Brief for United States 45. We assume nothing less
of all congressional action, with the result that an intent to benefit the
public can no more serve as a criterion of a "public and general"
sovereign act than its regulatory character can.51   While our limited
enquiry into the background and evolution of the thrift crisis leaves us
with the understanding that Congress acted to protect the public in the
FIRREA legislation, the extent to which this reform relieved the
Government of its own contractual obligations precludes a finding that
the statute is a "public and general" act for purposes of the sovereign
acts defense.52


Even if FIRREA were to qualify as "public and general," however,
other fundamental reasons would leave the sovereign acts doctrine
inadequate to excuse the Government's breach of these contracts. As
Horowitz makes clear, that defense simply relieves the Government as
contractor from the traditional blanket rule that a contracting party may
not obtain discharge if its own act rendered performance impossible.
But even if the Government stands in the place of a private party with
respect to "public and general" sovereign acts, it does not follow that
discharge will always be available, for the common-law doctrine of
impossibility imposes additional requirements before a party may
avoid liability for breach. As the Restatement puts it,

"[w]here, after a contract is made, a party's performance is made
impracticable without his fault by the occurrence of an event the non-
occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract
was made, his duty to render that performance is discharged, unless
the language or the circumstances indicate the contrary."  Restatement
(Second) of Contracts Section 261.

See also 2 Farnsworth on Contracts Section 9.6, at 543-544 (listing
four elements of the impossibility defense). Thus, since the object of
the sovereign acts defense is to place the Government as contractor on
par with a private contractor in the same circumstances, Horowitz,
267 U. S., at 461, the Government, like any other defending party in
a contract action, must show that the passage of the statute rendering
its performance impossible was an event contrary to the basic
assumptions on which the parties agreed, and must ultimately show
that the language or circumstances do not indicate that the Government
should be liable in any case. While we do not say that these
conditions can never be satisfied when the Government contracts with
participants in a regulated industry for particular regulatory treatment,
we find that the Government as such a contractor has not satisfied the
conditions for discharge in the present case.


For a successful impossibility defense the Government would have to
show that the nonoccurrence of regulatory amendment was a basic
assumption of these contracts. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of
Contracts Section 261; 2 Farnsworth, supra, Section 9.6, at 549-550.
The premise of this requirement is that the parties will have bargained
with respect to any risks that are both within their contemplation and
central to the substance of the contract; as Justice Traynor said, "[i]f
[the risk] was foreseeable there should have been provision for it in
the contract, and the absence of such a provision gives rise to the
inference that the risk was assumed."  Lloyd v. Murphy, 25 Cal. 2d
48, 54, 153 P.2d 47, 50 (1944).53   That inference is particularly
compelling, where, as here, the contract provides for particular
regulatory treatment (and, a fortiori, allocates the risk of regulatory
change). Such an agreement reflects the inescapable recognition that
regulated industries in the modern world do not live under the law of
the Medes and the Persians, and the very fact that such a contract is
made at all is at odds with any assumption of regulatory stasis. In this
particular case, whether or not the reach of the FIRREA reforms was
anticipated by the parties, there is no doubt that some changes in the
regulatory structure governing thrift capital reserves were both
foreseeable and likely when these parties contracted with the
Government, as even the Government agrees. It says in its brief to
this Court that "in light of the frequency with which federal capital
requirements had changed in the past . . . , it would have been
unreasonable for Glendale, FSLIC, or the Bank Board to expect or
rely upon the fact that those requirements would remain unchanged."
Brief for United States 26; see also id., at 3, n. 1 (listing the
changes).54   The Federal Circuit panel in this case likewise found
that the regulatory capital requirements "have been the subject of
numerous statutory and regulatory changes over the years," and
"changed three times in 1982 alone."  994 F. 2d, at 801.55   Given
these fluctuations, and given the fact that a single modification of the
applicable regulations could, and ultimately did, eliminate virtually all
of the consideration provided by the Government in these
transactions, it would be absurd to say that the nonoccurrence of a
change in the regulatory capital rules was a basic assumption upon
which these contracts were made. See, e.g., Moncrief v. Williston
Basin Interstate Pipeline Co., 880 F. Supp. 1495, 1508 (DWyo.
1995); Vollmar v. CSX Transportation, Inc., 705 F. Supp. 1154,
1176 (EDVa. 1989), aff'd, 898 F. 2d 413 (CA4 1990).


Finally, any governmental contract that not only deals with regulatory
change but allocates the risk of its occurrence will, by definition, fail
the further condition of a successful impossibility defense, for it will
indeed indicate that the parties' agreement was not meant to be
rendered nugatory by a change in the regulatory law. See Restatement
(Second) of Contracts Section 261 (no impossibility defense where
the "language or the circumstances" indicate allocation of the risk to
the party seeking discharge).56   The mere fact that the Government's
contracting agencies (like the Bank Board and FSLIC) could not
themselves preclude Congress from changing the regulatory rules
does not, of course, stand in the way of concluding that those
agencies assumed the risk of such change, for determining the
consequences of legal change was the point of the agreements. It is,
after all, not uncommon for a contracting party to assume the risk of
an event he cannot control,57  even when that party is an agent of the
Government. As the Federal Circuit has recognized, "[government]
contracts routinely include provisions shifting financial responsibility
to the Government for events which might occur in the future. That
some of these events may be triggered by sovereign government
action does not render the relevant contractual provisions any less
binding than those which contemplate third party acts, inclement
weather and other force majeure."  Hughes Communications Galaxy,
Inc. v. United States, 998 F. 2d 953, 958-959 (CA Fed. 1993).58

As to each of the contracts before us, our agreement with the
conclusions of the Court of Federal Claims and the Federal Circuit
forecloses any defense of legal impossibility, for those courts found
that the Bank Board resolutions, Forbearance Letters, and other
documents setting forth the accounting treatment to be accorded
supervisory goodwill generated by the transactions were not mere
statements of then-current regulatory policy, but in each instance were
terms in an allocation of risk of regulatory change that was essential to
the contract between the parties. See supra, at 21-23. Given that the
parties went to considerable lengths in procuring necessary documents
and drafting broad integration clauses to incorporate their terms into
the contract itself, the Government's suggestion that the parties meant
to say only that the regulatory treatment laid out in these documents
would apply as an initial matter, subject to later change at the
Government's election, is unconvincing. See ibid. It would, indeed,
have been madness for respondents to have engaged in these
transactions with no more protection than the Government's reading
would have given them, for the very existence of their institutions
would then have been in jeopardy from the moment their agreements
were signed.


We affirm the Federal Circuit's ruling that the United States is liable to
respondents for breach of contract. Because the Court of Federal
Claims has not yet determined the appropriate measure or amount of
damages in this case, we remand for further proceedings consistent
with our opinion.

It is so ordered.


ENDNOTES

1 The easing of federal regulatory requirements was accompanied by
similar initiatives on the state level, especially in California, Florida,
and Texas. The impact of these changes was substantial, since as of
1980 over 50 percent of federally-insured thrifts were chartered by the
States. See House Report, at 297.

2 "Regulatory and statutory accounting gimmicks included permitting
thrifts to defer losses from the sale of assets with below market yields;
permitting the use of income capital certificates, authorized by
Congress, in place of real capital; letting qualifying mutual capital
certificates be included as RAP capital; allowing FSLIC members to
exclude from liabilities in computing net worth, certain contra-asset
accounts, including loans in process, unearned discounts, and
deferred fees and credits; and permitting the inclusion of net worth
certificates, qualifying subordinated debentures and appraised equity
capital as RAP net worth."  House Report, at 298. The result of these
practices was that "[b]y 1984, the difference between RAP and GAAP
net worth at S&L's stood at $9 billion," which meant "that the
industry's capital position, or . . . its cushion to absorb losses was
overstated by $9 billion." Ibid.

3 See also ibid. (noting that "[t]he FSLIC developed lists of
prospective acquirers, made presentations, held seminars, and
generally tried to promote the acquisitions of these insolvents");
Grant, The FSLIC: Protection through Professionalism, 14 Federal
Home Loan Bank Board Journal 9-10 (Feb. 1981) (describing the
pros and cons of various default-prevention techniques from FSLIC's
perspective). Over 300 such mergers occurred between 1980 and
1986, as opposed to only 48 liquidations. GAO, Forbearance for
Troubled Institutions 13. There is disagreement as to whether the
government actually saved money by pursuing this course rather than
simply liquidating the insolvent thrifts. Compare, e.g., Brief for
Franklin Financial Group, Inc., et al. as Amicus Curiae 7, quoting
Remarks by H. Brent Beasley, Director of FSLIC, before the
California Savings and Loan League Management Conference (Sept.
9, 1982) (concluding that FSLIC-assisted mergers have
"`[h]istorically . . . cost about 70% of [the] cost of liquidation'"), with
GAO, Solutions to the Thrift Industry Problem 52 ("FSLIC's cost
analyses may . . . understat[e] the cost of mergers to the
government").

4 See also Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 17, Paragraph
26, p. 339 (1970) (providing that "[i]ntangible assets acquired . . . as
part of an acquired company should... be recorded at cost," which for
unidentifiable intangible assets like goodwill is "measured by the
difference between the cost of the . . . enterprise acquired and the sum
of the assigned costs of individual tangible and identifiable intangible
assets acquired less liabilities assumed").

5 See Newark Morning Ledger Co. v. United States, 507 U. S. 546,
556 (1993) (describing "goodwill" as "the total of all the imponderable
qualities that attract customers to the business"). Justice Story defined
"good-will" somewhat more elaborately as "the advantage or benefit,
which is acquired by an establishment, beyond the mere value of the
capital, stock, funds, or property employed therein, in consequence of
the general public patronage and encouragement, which it receives
from constant or habitual customers, on account of its local position,
or common celebrity, or reputation for skill or affluence, or
punctuality, or from other accidental circumstances, or necessities, or
even from ancient partialities, or prejudices."  J. Story, Law of
Partnership Section 99, p. 139 (1841).

6 See also 135 Cong. Rec. H2703 (daily ed. June 16, 1989)
(statement of Rep. Hyde) (observing that FSLIC used goodwill as "an
inducement to the healthy savings and loans to merge with the sick
ones"); Brief of Franklin Financial Group, Inc., et al. as Amicus
Curiae 9, quoting Deposition of Thurman Connell, former official at
the Atlanta Federal Home Loan Bank, in Charter Federal Savings
Bank v. Office of Thrift Supervision, Joint Appendix Nos. 91-2647,
91-2708 (CA4), p. 224 (recognizing that treating supervisory
goodwill as regulatory capital was "`a very important aspect of [the
acquiring thrifts'] willingness to enter into these agreements,'" and
concluding that the regulators "`looked at [supervisory goodwill] as
kind of the engine that made this transaction go. Because without it,
there wouldn't have been any train pulling out of the station, so to
speak'").

7 In this context, "amortization" of an intangible asset is equivalent to
depreciation of tangible assets. See Newark Morning Ledger Co. v.
United States, 507 U. S., at 571, n. 1 (1993) (SOUTER, J.,
dissenting); Gregorcich, Amortization of Intangibles: A Reassessment
of the Tax Treatment of Purchased Goodwill, 28 Tax Lawyer 251,
253 (1975). Both the majority opinion and dissent in Newark
Morning Ledger agreed that "goodwill" was not subject to
depreciation (or amortization) for federal tax purposes, see 507 U. S.,
at 565, n. 13; id., at 573 (SOUTER, J., dissenting), although we
disagreed as to whether one could accurately estimate the useful life of
certain elements of goodwill and, if so, permit depreciation of those
elements under Internal Revenue Service regulations. Id., at 566-567;
id., at 576-577 (SOUTER, J., dissenting). Neither of the Newark
Morning Ledger opinions, however, denied the power of another
federal agency, such as the Bank Board or FSLIC, to decide that
goodwill is of transitory value and impose a particular amortization
period to be used for its own regulatory purposes.

8 See also National Commission on Financial Institution Reform,
Recovery and Enforcement, Origins and Causes of the S&L Debacle:
A Blueprint for Reform, A Report to the President and Congress of
the United States 38-39 (July 1993) (explaining the advantages of
different amortization and accretion schedules to an acquiring thrift).
The downside of a faster accretion schedule, of course, was that it
exhausted the discount long before the goodwill asset had been fully
amortized. As a result, this treatment resulted in a net drag on
earnings over the medium and long terms. See Lowy 40-41; Black,
Ending Our Forebearers' Forbearances: FIRREA and Supervisory
Goodwill, 2 Stan. L. & Policy Rev. 102, 104-105 (1990). Many
thrift managers were apparently willing to take the short term gain, see
Lowy 40-41, and others sought to stave off the inevitable losses by
pursuing further acquisitions, see Black, supra, at 105.

9 The 1981 regulations quoted above were in effect at the time of the
Glendale transaction. The 1984 regulations relevant to the Winstar
transaction were identical in all material respects, and although
substantial changes had been introduced into Section 563.13 by the
time of the Statesman merger in 1988, they do not appear to resolve
the basic ambiguity as to whether goodwill could qualify as regulatory
capital. See 12 CFR Section 563.13 (1988). Section 563.13 has since
been superseded by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and
Enforcement Act.

10 Although the Glendale transaction in this case occurred before the
promulgation of SFAS 72 in 1983, the proper amortization period for
goodwill under GAAP was uncertain prior to that time. According to
one observer, "when the accounting profession designed the purchase
accounting rules in the early 1970s, they didn't anticipate the case of
insolvent thrift institutions . . . . The rules for that situation were
simply unclear until September 1982," when the SFAS 72 rules were
first aired. Lowy 39-40.

11 See 135 Cong. Rec. 18863 (1989) (Sen. Riegle) (emphasizing that
these capital requirements were at the "heart" of the legislative reform);
id., at 18860 (Sen. Chafee) (describing capital standards as
FIRREA's "strongest and most critical requirement" and "the
backbone of the legislation"); id., at 18853 (Sen. Dole) (describing the
"[t]ough new capital standards [as] perhaps the most important
provisions in this bill").

12 Glendale's premerger net worth amounted to 5.45 percent of its
total assets, which comfortably exceeded the 4 percent capital/asset
ratio, or net worth requirement, then in effect. See 12 CFR Section
563.13(a)(2) (1981).

13 See also Appleby v. Delaney, 271 U. S. 403, 413 (1926) ("It is
not reasonable to suppose that the grantees would pay $12,000 . . .
and leave to the city authorities the absolute right completely to nullify
the chief consideration for seeking this property, . . . or that the
parties then took that view of the transaction").

14 As part of the contract, the Government's promise to count
supervisory goodwill and capital credits toward regulatory capital was
alterable only by written agreement of the parties. See App. 408.
This was also true of the Glendale and Winstar transactions. See id.,
at 112, 600.

15 To be sure, each side could have eliminated any serious contest
about the correctness of their interpretive positions by using clearer
language. See, e.g., Guaranty Financial Services, Inc. v. Ryan, 928
F. 2d 994, 999-1000 (CA11 1991) (finding, based on very different
contract language, that the Government had expressly reserved the
right to change the capital requirements without any responsibility to
the acquiring thrift). The failure to be even more explicit is perhaps
more surprising here, given the size and complexity of these
transactions. But few contract cases would be in court if contract
language had articulated the parties' postbreach positions as clearly as
might have been done, and the failure to specify remedies in the
contract is no reason to find that the parties intended no remedy at all.
The Court of Claims and Federal Circuit were thus left with the
familiar task of determining which party's interpretation was more
nearly supported by the evidence.

16 See also Day v. United States, 245 U. S. 159, 161 (1917)
(Holmes, J.) ("One who makes a contract never can be absolutely
certain that he will be able to perform it when the time comes, and the
very essence of it is that he takes the risk within the limits of his
undertaking").

998 F. 2d 953, 957-959 (CA Fed. 1993) (interpreting contractual
incorporation of then-current government policy on space shuttle
launches not as a promise not to change that policy, but as a promise
"to bear the cost of changes in launch priority and scheduling resulting
from the revised policy"); Hills Materials Co. v. Rice, 982 F. 2d 514,
516-517 (CA Fed. 1992) (interpreting contract to incorporate safety
regulations extant when contract was signed and to shift responsibility
for costs incurred as a result of new safety regulations to the
Government); see generally 18 W. Jaeger, Williston on Contracts
Section 1934, at 19-21 (3d ed. 1978) ("Although a warranty in effect
is a promise to pay damages if the facts are not as warranted, in terms
it is an undertaking that the facts exist. And in spite of occasional
statements that an agreement impossible in law is void there seems no
greater difficulty in warranting the legal possibility of a performance
than its possibility in fact.... [T]here seems no reason of policy
forbidding a contract to perform a certain act legal at the time of the
contract if it remains legal at the time of performance, and if not legal,
to indemnify the promisee for non-performance" (footnotes omitted));

21 United Railways is in the line of cases stretching back to
Providence Bank v. Billings, 4 Pet. 514 (1830), and Charles River
Bridge v. Warren Bridge, 11 Pet. 420 (1837). Justice Day's opinion
in United Railways relied heavily upon New Orleans City & Lake R.
Co. v. New Orleans, 143 U. S. 192 (1892), which in turn relied upon
classic Contract Clause unmistakability cases like Vicksburg S. & P.
R. Co. v. Dennis, 116 U. S. 665 (1886), Memphis Gas Light Co. v.
Taxing Dist. of Shelby Cty., 109 U. S. 398 (1883), and Piqua
Branch of State Bank of Ohio v. Knoop, 16 How. 369 (1854). And
Home Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U. S. 398 (1934),
upon which Merrion also relied, cites Charles River Bridge directly.
See 290 U. S., at 435; see also Note, Forbearance Agreements:
Invalid Contracts for the Surrender of Sovereignty, 92 Colum. L.
Rev. 426, 453 (1992) (linking the unmistakability principle applied in
Bowen v. Public Agencies Opposed to Social Security Entrapment,
477 U. S. 41 (1986), to the Charles River Bridge/Providence Bank
line of cases).

22 "Sovereign power" as used here must be understood as a power
that could otherwise affect the Government's obligation under the
contract. The Government could not, for example, abrogate one of its
contracts by a statute abrogating the legal enforceability of that
contract, government contracts of a class including that one, or simply
all government contracts. No such legislation would provide the
Government with a defense under the sovereign acts doctrine, see
infra, at 52-61.

23 The Government's right to take the tribe's property upon payment
of compensation, of course, did not depend upon the navigational
servitude; where it applies, however, the navigational easement
generally obviates the obligation to pay compensation at all. See,
e.g., United States v. Kansas City Ins. Co., 339 U. S. 799, 808
(1950) ("When the Government exercises [the navigational] servitude,
it is exercising its paramount power in the interest of navigation, rather
than taking the private property of anyone"); Scranton v. Wheeler,
179 U. S. 141, 163 (1900) ("Whatever the nature of the interest of a
riparian owner in the submerged lands in front of his upland bordering
on a public navigable water, his title is not as full and complete as his
title to fast land which has no direct connection with the navigation of
such water. It is a qualified title . . . to be held at all times subordinate
to such use of the submerged lands and of the waters flowing over
them as may be consistent with or demanded by the public right of
condemnation"). Because an order to pay compensation would have
placed the Government in the same position as if the navigational
easement had been surrendered altogether, the holding of Cherokee
Nation is on all fours with the approach we describe today.

24 The dissent is mistaken in suggesting there is question-begging in
speaking of what a government contract provides without first
applying the unmistakability doctrine, see post, at 6. A contract may
reasonably be read under normal rules of construction to contain a
provision that does not satisfy the more demanding standard of
unmistakable clarity. If an alleged term could not be discovered under
normal standards, there would be no need for an unmistakability
doctrine. It would, of course, make good sense to apply the
unmistakability rule if it was clear from the start that a contract plaintiff
could not obtain the relief sought without effectively barring exercise
of a sovereign power, as in the example of the promisee of the tax
exemption who claims a rebate.

25 See also Hughes Communications Galaxy, Inc. v. United States,
998 F. 2d, at 958 (finding the unmistakability doctrine inapplicable to
"the question of how liability for certain contingencies was allocated
by the contract"); Sunswick Corp. v. United States, 109 Ct. Cl. 772,
798, 775 F. Supp. 221, 228 ("We know of no reason why the
Government may not by the terms of its contract bind itself for the
consequences of some act on its behalf which, but for the contract,
would be nonactionable as an act of the sovereign. As shown in
Bostwick v. United States, 94 U. S. 53, 69 [(1877)], the liability of
the Government in such circumstances rests upon the contract and not
upon the act of the Government in its sovereign capacity"), cert.
denied, 334 U. S. 827 (1948); see generally Eule, Temporal Limits on
the Legislative Mandate: Entrenchment and Retroactivity, 1987 Am.
Bar Found. Research J. 379, 424 (observing that limiting the
Government's obligation to "compensating for the financial losses its
repudiations engender . . . . affords the current legislature the freedom
to respond to constituents' needs, while at the same time protecting
those whose contractual interests are impaired"); Note, A Procedural
Approach to the Contract Clause, 93 Yale L. J. 918, 928-929 (1984)
("A damage remedy is superior to an injunction because damages
provide the states with the flexibility to impair contracts retroactively
when the benefits exceed the costs. So long as the victims of contract
impairments are made whole through compensation, there is little
reason to grant those victims an injunctive remedy").

26 This point underscores the likelihood that damage awards will have
the same effect as an injunction only in cases, like Bowen, where a
private party seeks the return of payments to the Government. The
classic examples, of course, are tax cases like St. Louis v. United
Railways Co., 210 U. S. 266 (1908). Because a request for rebate
damages in that case would effectively have exempted the plaintiffs
from the law by forcing the reimbursement of their tax payments, the
dissent is quite wrong to suggest, see post, at 5-6, that the plaintiffs
could have altered the outcome by pleading their case differently.

27 See Posner & Rosenfield, Impossibility and Related Doctrines in
Contract Law: An Economic Analysis, 6 J. Leg. Stud. 83, 88-89
(1977) (noting that parties generally rely on contract law "to reduce the
costs of contract negotiation by supplying contract terms that the
parties would probably have adopted explicitly had they negotiated
over them").

28 See also Bowen v. Public Agencies Opposed to Social Security
Entrapment, 477 U. S., at 52 ("[T]he Federal Government, as
sovereign, has the power to enter contracts that confer vested rights,
and the concomitant duty to honor those rights . . ."); Perry v. United
States, 294 U. S. 330, 353 (1935) ("[T]he right to make binding
obligations is a competence attaching to sovereignty"); cf. H. L. A.
Hart, The Concept of Law 145-146 (1961) (noting that the ability to
limit a body's future authority is itself one aspect of sovereignty).

29 See also Logue, Tax Transitions, Opportunistic Retroactivity, and
the Benefits of Government Precommitment, 94 Mich. L. Rev. 1129,
1146 (1996) ("If we allowed the government to break its contractual
promises without having to pay compensation, such a policy would
come at a high cost in terms of increased default premiums in future
government contracts and increased disenchantment with the
government generally").

30 See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Contracts Section 346, cmt. a
("Every breach of contract gives the injured party a right to damages
against the party in breach" unless "[t]he parties . . . by agreement
vary the rules"); 3 Farnsworth on Contracts Section 12.8, at 185
(1990) ("The award of damages is the common form of relief for
breach of contract. Virtually any breach gives the injured party a claim
for damages").

31 The dissent justifies its all-devouring view of unmistakability not
by articulating any limit, but simply by reminding us that "Men must
turn square corners when they deal with the Government."  Post, at
14-15 (quoting Rock Island, A. & L.R. Co. v. United States, 254 U.
S. 141, 143 (1920) (Holmes, J.)). We have also recognized,
however, that "`[i]t is no less good morals and good law that the
Government should turn square corners in dealing with the people
than that the people should turn square corners in dealing with their
government.'"  Heckler v. Community Health Services of Crawford
County, Inc., 467 U. S. 51, 61 n. 13 (1984) (quoting St. Regis Paper
Co. v. United States, 368 U. S. 208, 229 (1961) (Black, J.,
dissenting). See also Federal Crop Insurance Corp. v. Merrill, 332
U. S. 380, 387-388 (1947) (Jackson, J., dissenting) ("It is very well
to say that those who deal with the Government should turn square
corners. But there is no reason why the square corners should
constitute a one-way street").

32 JUSTICE SCALIA offers his own theory of unmistakability, see
post, at 1-5, which would apply in a wide range of cases and so create
some tension with the general principle that the Government is
ordinarily treated just like a private party in its contractual dealings,
see, e.g., Perry v. United States, 294 U. S. 330, 352 (1935), but
which would be satisfied by an inference of fact and therefore offer a
only a low barrier to litigation of constitutional issues if a party
should, in fact, prove a governmental promise not to change the law.
JUSTICE SCALIA seeks to minimize the latter concern by quoting
Holmes's pronouncement on damages as the exclusive remedy at law
for breach of contract, see post, at 2, but this ignores the availability
of specific performance in a non-trivial number of cases, see, e.g.,
Restatement (Second) of Contracts Sections 357-359, including the
Contract Clause cases in which the unmistakability doctrine itself
originated. See, e.g., Carter v. Greenhow, 114 U. S. 317, 322
(1885) (stating that "the only right secured" by the Contract Clause is
"to have a judicial determination, declaring the nullity of the attempt to
impair [the contract's] obligation"); Zigler, Takings Law and the
Contract Clause: A Takings Law Approach to Legislative
Modifications of Public Contracts, 36 Stan. L. Rev. 1447, 1462
(1984) (suggesting that "analysis under the contract clause is limited to
declaring the statute unconstitutional. The provision does not
authorize the courts to award damages in lieu of requiring the state to
adhere to the original terms of the contract"); cf. C. Fried, Contract as
Promise 117-118 (1981) (arguing that "Holmes's celebrated dictum . .
. goes too far, is too simple"). Finally, we have no need to consider
the close relationship that JUSTICE SCALIA sees between the
unmistakability and sovereign acts doctrines, see post, at 6, because,
even considered separately, neither one favors the Government in this
case.

33 See also Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Goldsboro, 232 U. S. 548,
558 (1914) ("[T]he power of the State to establish all regulations that
are reasonably necessary to secure the health, safety, good order,
comfort, or general welfare of the community . . . can neither be
abdicated nor bargained away, and is inalienable even by express
grant"); West River Bridge Co. v. Dix, 6 How. 507 (1848) (State's
contracts do not relinquish its eminent domain power).

34 To the extent that JUSTICE SCALIA finds the reserved powers
doctrine inapplicable because "the private party to the contract does not
seek to stay the exercise of sovereign authority, but merely requests
damages for breach of contract," post, at 5, he appears to adopt a
distinction between contracts of indemnity and contracts not to change
the law similar to the unmistakability analysis he rejects. He also
suggests that the present case falls outside the "core governmental
powers" that cannot be surrendered under the reserved powers
doctrine, but this suggestion is inconsistent with our precedents. See
Stone v. Mississippi, 101 U. S. 814, 817 (1880) ("[T]he legislature
cannot bargain away the police power of a State"); Veix v. Sixth Ward
Building & Loan Assn. of Newark, 310 U. S. 32, 38 (1940)
(recognizing that thrift regulation is within the police power).

35 See Speidel, Implied Duties of Cooperation and the Defense of
Sovereign Acts in Government Contracts, 51 Geo. L. J. 516, 542
(1963) ("[W]hile the contracting officers of Agency X cannot
guarantee that the United States will not perform future acts of
effective government, they can agree to compensate the contractor for
damages resulting from justifiable acts of the United States in its
`sovereign capacity'" (footnotes omitted)).

36 See also 1 R. Nash & J. Cibinic, Federal Procurement Law 5 (3d
ed. 1977) ("The authority of the executive to use contracts in carrying
out authorized programs is . . . generally assumed in the absence of
express statutory prohibitions or limitations").

37 Nor is there any substance to the claim that these were contracts
that only the Government could make. The regulatory capital or net
worth requirements at issue applied only to thrifts choosing to carry
federal deposit insurance, see Federal Home Loan Bank System, A
Guide to the Federal Home Loan Bank System 69 (5th ed. 1987), and
institutions choosing to self-insure or to seek private insurance
elsewhere would have been free to make similar agreements with
private insurers.

38 Moreover, if the dissent were correct that the sovereign acts
doctrine permits the Government to abrogate its contractual
commitments in "regulatory" cases even where it simply sought to
avoid contracts it had come to regret, then the Government's
sovereign contracting power would be of very little use in this broad
sphere of public activity. We rejected a virtually identical argument in
Perry v. United States, 294 U. S. 330 (1935), in which Congress had
passed a resolution regulating the payment of obligations in gold. We
held that the law could not be applied to the Government's own
obligations, noting that "the right to make binding obligations is a
competence attaching to sovereignty."  Id., at 353.

39 See also Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, 318 U. S. 363, 369
(1943) ("`The United States does business on business terms'")
(quoting United States v. National Exchange Bank of Baltimore, 270
U. S. 527, 534 (1926)); Perry v. United States, supra, at 352 (1935)
("When the United States, with constitutional authority, makes
contracts, it has rights and incurs responsibilities similar to those of
individuals who are parties to such instruments. There is no
difference . . . except that the United States cannot be sued without its
consent") (citation omitted); United States v. Bostwick, 94 U. S. 53,
66 (1877) ("The United States, when they contract with their citizens,
are controlled by the same laws that govern the citizen in that behalf");
Cooke v. United States, 91 U. S. 389, 398 (1875) (explaining that
when the United States "comes down from its position of sovereignty,
and enters the domain of commerce, it submits itself to the same laws
that govern individuals there").

40 See Jones, 1 Cl. Ct., at 85 ("Wherever the public and private acts
of the government seem to commingle, a citizen or corporate body
must by supposition be substituted in its place, and then the question
be determined whether the action will lie against the supposed
defendant"); O'Neill v. United States, 231 Ct. Cl. 823, 826 (1982)
(sovereign acts doctrine applies where, "[w]ere [the] contracts
exclusively between private parties, the party hurt by such governing
action could not claim compensation from the other party for the
governing action"). The dissent ignores these statements (including
the statement from Jones, from which case Horowitz drew its
reasoning literally verbatim), when it says, post, at [7], that the
sovereign acts cases do not emphasize the need to treat the
government-as-contractor the same as a private party.

41 Our Contract Clause cases have demonstrated a similar concern
with governmental self-interest by recognizing that "complete
deference to a legislative assessment of reasonableness and necessity
is not appropriate because the State's self-interest is at stake." United
States Trust Co. of N. Y. v. New Jersey, 431 U. S. 1, 26 (1977); see
also Energy Reserves Group, Inc. v. Kansas Power & Light Co., 459
U. S. 400, 412-413, and n. 14 (1983) (noting that a stricter level of
scrutiny applies under the Contract Clause when a State alters its own
contractual obligations); cf. Perry, supra, at 350-351 (drawing a "clear
distinction" between Congress's power over private contracts and "the
power of the Congress to alter or repudiate the substance of its own
engagements").

42 The generality requirement will almost always be met where, as in
Deming, the governmental action "bears upon [the government's
contract] as it bears upon all similar contracts between citizens."
Deming v. United States, 1 Ct. Cl. 190, 191 (1865). Deming is less
helpful, however, in cases where, as here, the public contracts at issue
have no obvious private analogs.

43 The dissent accuses us of transplanting this due process principle
into alien soil, see post, at 9. But this Court did not even wait until
the term following Hurtado before applying its principle of generality
to a case that, like this one, involved the deprivation of property
rights. See Hagar v. Reclamation Dist. No. 108, 111 U. S. 701, 708
(1884). More importantly, it would be surprising indeed if the
sovereign acts doctrine, resting on the inherent nature of sovereignty,
were not shaped by fundamental principles about how sovereigns
ought to behave.

44 See also Speidel, 51 Geo. L. J., at 539-540 (observing that "the
commonly expressed conditions to the availability of the sovereign
acts defense" are not only that "the act . . . must have been `public and
general,'" but also that "the damage to the contractor must have been
caused indirectly"); cf. Exxon Corp. v. Eagerton, 462 U. S. 176,
191-192 (1983) (distinguishing between direct and incidental
impairments under the Contract Clause).

45 Cf. also Resolution Trust Corp. v. Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., 25 F.3d 1493, 1501 (CA10 1994) ("The limits of
this immunity [for sovereign acts] are defined by the extent to which
the government's failure to perform is the result of legislation targeting
a class of contracts to which it is a party"); South Louisiana Grain
Services, Inc. v. United States, 1 Cl. Ct. 281, 287, n. 6 (1982)
(rejecting sovereign acts defense where the government agency's
actions "were directed specifically at plaintiff's alleged contract
performance"). Despite the dissent's predictions, the sun is not, in
fact, likely to set on the sovereign acts doctrine. While an increase in
regulation by contract will produce examples of the "fusion" that bars
the defense, we may expect that other sovereign activity will continue
to occasion the sovereign acts defense in cases of incidental effect.

46 A different intermediate position would be possible, at least in
theory. One might say that a governmental action was not "public and
general" under Horowitz if its predominant purpose or effect was
avoidance of the Government's contractual commitments. The
difficulty, however, of ascertaining the relative intended or resulting
impacts on governmental and purely private contracts persuades us
that this test would prove very difficult to apply.

47 We note that whether or not Congress intended to abrogate
supervisory merger agreements providing that supervisory goodwill
would count toward regulatory capital requirements has been the
subject of extensive litigation in the Courts of Appeals, and that every
Circuit to consider the issue has concluded that Congress did so
intend. See Transohio Sav. Bank v. Director, Office of Thrift
Supervision, 967 F. 2d 598, 617 (CADC 1992); Carteret Sav. Bank
v. Office of Thrift Supervision, 963 F. 2d 567, 581-582 (CA3 1992);

(CA11 1991); Franklin Federal Sav. Bank v. Director, Office of Thrift
Supervision, 927 F. 2d 1332, 1341 (CA6), cert. denied, 502 U. S.
937 (1991); cf. Resolution Trust Corp. v. FSLIC, 25 F. 3d 1493,
1502 (CA10 1994) (observing that "FIRREA's structure leaves little
doubt that Congress well knew the crippling effects strengthened
capital requirements would have on mergers that relied on supervisory
goodwill," but concluding that Congress sought to mitigate the impact
by giving OTS authority to exempt thrifts until 1991); Charter Federal
Sav. Bank v. Office of Thrift Supervision, 976 F. 2d 203, 210 (CA4
1992) (accepting the conclusions of the other Circuits in dictum), cert.
denied, 507 U. S. 1004 (1993).

48 See also House Report, at 534 (additional views of Reps. Hiler,
Ridge, Bartlett, Dreier, McCandless, Saiki, Baker, and Paxon) ("For
the institutions with substantial supervisory goodwill, the bill radically
changes the terms of previously negotiated transactions"); id., at 507-
508 (additional views of Rep. LaFalce) ("Those institutions which
carry intangible assets on their books do so generally under written
agreements they have entered into with the U. S. government,
agreements which generally state that they cannot be superseded by
subsequent regulations"); id., pt. 5, at 27 (additional views of Rep.
Hyde) ("[Thrifts] were told that they would be able to carry this
goodwill on their books as capital for substantial periods of time. . . .
The courts could well construe these agreements as formal contracts.
Now, . . . Congress is telling these same thrifts that they cannot count
this goodwill toward meeting the new capital standards"); 135 Cong.
Rec. H2706 (June 15, 1989) (statement of Rep. Crane) (FIRREA
"would require these S&Ls to write off this goodwill in a scant 5
years. This legislation violates the present agreements that these
institutions made with the Federal Government"). Although there was
less of a focus on the impact of FIRREA on supervisory goodwill in
the Senate, at least two senators noted that the new capital
requirements would have the effect of abrogating government
contracts. See id., at S5533 (May 17, 1989) (statement of Sen.
Hatfield) ("The new tangible capital standards in the legislation
specifically exclude supervisory goodwill, and in doing so effectively
abrogate agreements made between the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, on behalf of the U. S. Government, and certain healthy thrift
institutions"); id., at S10213 (Aug. 4, 1989) (statement of Sen.
D'Amato) (asking "whether any future transactions involving failed or
failing institutions will be possible after this bill sanctions a wholesale
reneging of Federal agency agreements").

49 See also House Report, at 545 (Supplemental Views of Reps.
Schumer, Morrison, Roukema, Gonzalez, Vento, McMillen and
Hoagland) ("[A]n overriding public policy would be jeopardized by

into by the FSLIC"); 135 Cong. Rec. H2705 (June 15, 1989)
(statement of Rep. Gonzalez) ("[I]n blunt terms, the Bank Board and
FSLIC insurance fund managers entered into bad deals--I might even
call them steals"); id., at H2565 (June 14, 1989) (statement of Rep.
Saxton) ("In short[,] goodwill agreements were a mistake and as the
saying goes . . . `Two wrongs don't make a right'"). These
proponents defeated two amendments to FIRREA, proposed by Reps.
Quillen and Hyde, which would have given thrifts that had received
capital forbearances from thrift regulators varying degrees of
protection from the new rules. See Transohio Sav. Bank v. Director,
Office of Thrift Supervision, supra, at 616-617; see also 135 Cong.
Rec. H2710 (June 15, 1989) (statement of Rep. Price) ("[T]he
proponents of [the Hyde] amendment say a `Deal is a Deal' . . . . But
to claim that Congress can never change a regulator's decision . . . in
the future is simply not tenable"); Franklin Federal Savings Bank v.
Director, Office of Thrift Supervision, supra, at 1340-1341
(reviewing the House debate and concluding that "[n]obody expressed
the view that FIRREA did not abrogate forbearance agreements
regarding supervisory goodwill") (emphasis in original).

50 Despite the claims of the dissent, our test does not turn upon "some
sort of legislative intent," post, at 10. Rather, we view Congress's
expectation that the Government's own obligations would be heavily
affected simply as good evidence that this was, indeed, the case.

51 We have, indeed, had to reject a variant of this argument before.
See Lynch v. United States, 292 U. S. 571, 580 (1934)
(acknowledging a public need for governmental economy, but holding
that "[t]o abrogate contracts, in the attempt to lessen governmental
expenditure, would be not the practice of economy, but an act of
repudiation"); see also Speidel, 51 Geo. L.J., at 522 (noting that even
when "the Government's acts are motivated or required by public
necessity . . . [t]he few decisions on point seem to reject public
convenience or necessity as a defense, particularly where [the
Government's action] directly alters the terms of the contract").

52 The dissent contends that FIRREA must be a "public and general"
act because it "occupies 372 pages in the Statutes at Large, and under
12 substantive titles contains more than 150 numbered sections."
Post, at 11. But any act of repudiation can be buried in a larger piece
of legislation, and if that is enough to save it then the Government's
contracting power will not count for much. To the extent that THE
CHIEF JUSTICE relies on the fact that FIRREA's core capital
requirements applied to all thrift institutions, we note that neither he
nor the Government has provided any indication of the relative
incidence of the new statute in requiring capital increases for thrifts
subject to regulatory agreements affecting capital and those not so
subject.

against in the contract"); Barbarossa and Sons, Inc. v. Iten Chevrolet,
Inc., 265 N. W. 2d 655, 659 (Minn. 1978) (asking "whether the risk
of the given contingency was so unusual or unforeseen and would
have such severe consequences that to require performance would be
to grant the promisee an advantage for which he could not be said to
have bargained in making the contract"); Mishara Construction Co. v.
Transit-Mixed Concrete Corp., 365 Mass. 122, 129, 310 N. E. 2d

developed one which the parties could reasonably be thought to have
foreseen as a real possibility which could affect performance?"); Krell
v. Henry, 2 K. B. 740, 752 (1903) ("The test seems to be whether the
event which causes the impossibility was or might have been
anticipated and guarded against"); 18 W. Jaeger, Williston on
Contracts Section 1931, p. 8 (3d ed. 1978) ("The important question
is whether an unanticipated circumstance has made performance of the
promise vitally different from what should reasonably have been
within the contemplation of both parties when they entered into the
contract. If so, the risk should not fairly be thrown upon the
promisor"). Although foreseeability is generally a relevant, but not
dispositive, factor, see 2 E. Farnsworth, Farnsworth on Contracts
Section 9.6, pp. 555-556 (1990); Opera Company of Boston, Inc. v.
Wolf Trap Foundation for the Performing Arts, 817 F. 2d 1094, 1101
(CA4 1987), there is no reason to look further where, as here, the risk
was foreseen to be more than minimally likely, went to the central
purpose of the contract, and could easily have been allocated in a
different manner had the parties chosen to do so, see id., at 1099-
1102; 18 Williston on Contracts, supra, Section 1953, at 119.

54 The Government confirmed this point at oral argument. When
asked whether FIRREA's tightening of the regulatory capital
standards was "exactly the event that the parties assumed might
happen when they made their contracts," the Government responded
"Exactly. Congress had changed capital standards many times over
the years."  Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.

nonperformance"). This is no less true where the event that renders
performance impossible is a change in the governing law. See, e.g., 4
