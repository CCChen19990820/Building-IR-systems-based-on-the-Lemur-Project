ARKANSAS, PETITIONER

          v.

BOBBIE E. HILL et al.
on writs of certiorari to the supreme court of
arkansas

[May 22, 1995]

  Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.

  The Constitution sets forth qualifications for member-
ship in the Congress of the United States.  Article I, 2,
cl. 2, which applies to the House of Representatives,
provides:

      -No Person shall be a Representative who shall
not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years,
and been seven Years a Citizen of the United
States, and who shall not, when elected, be an
Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be
chosen.-

Article I, 3, cl. 3, which applies to the Senate, similarly
provides:

      -No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have
attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine
Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall
not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for
which he shall be chosen.-

  Today's cases present a challenge to an amendment to
the Arkansas State Constitution that prohibits the name
of an otherwise-eligible candidate for Congress from
appearing on the general election ballot if that candidate
has already served three terms in the House of Repre-
sentatives or two terms in the Senate.  The Arkansas
Supreme Court held that the amendment violates the
Federal Constitution.  We agree with that holding.  Such
a state-imposed restriction is contrary to the -fundamen-
tal principle of our representative democracy,- embodied
in the Constitution, that -the people should choose
whom they please to govern them.-  Powell v.
McCormack, 395 U. S. 486, 547 (1969) (internal quota-
tion marks omitted).  Allowing individual States to adopt
their own qualifications for congressional service would
be inconsistent with the Framers' vision of a uniform
National Legislature representing the people of the
United States.  If the qualifications set forth in the text
of the Constitution are to be changed, that text must be
amended.

                            I

  At the general election on November 3, 1992, the
voters of Arkansas adopted Amendment 73 to their State
Constitution. Proposed as a -Term Limitation Amend-
ment,- its preamble stated:

      -The people of Arkansas find and declare that
elected officials who remain in office too long become
preoccupied with reelection and ignore their duties
as representatives of the people.  Entrenched
incumbency has reduced voter participation and has
led to an electoral system that is less free, less
competitive, and less representative than the system
established by the Founding Fathers.  Therefore, the
people of Arkansas, exercising their reserved powers,
herein limit the terms of the elected officials.-

  The limitations in Amendment 73 apply to three
categories of elected officials.  Section 1 provides that no
elected official in the executive branch of the state
government may serve more than two 4-year terms.
Section 2 applies to the legislative branch of the state
government; it provides that no member of the Arkansas
House of Representatives may serve more than three 2-
year terms and no member of the Arkansas Senate may
serve more than two 4-year terms.  Section 3, the
provision at issue in these cases, applies to the Arkan-
sas Congressional Delegation.  It provides:

      -(a) Any person having been elected to three or
more terms as a member of the United States House
of Representatives from Arkansas shall not be
certified as a candidate and shall not be eligible to
have his/her name placed on the ballot for election
to the United States House of Representatives from
Arkansas.

        -(b) Any person having been elected to two or
more terms as a member of the United States
Senate from Arkansas shall not be certified as a
candidate and shall not be eligible to have his/her
name placed on the ballot for election to the United
States Senate from Arkansas.-

Amendment 73 states that it is self-executing and shall
apply to all persons seeking election after January 1,
1993.

  On November 13, 1992, respondent Bobbie Hill, on
behalf of herself, similarly situated Arkansas -citizens,
residents, taxpayers and registered voters,- and the
League of Women Voters of Arkansas, filed a complaint
in the Circuit Court for Pulaski County, Arkansas,
seeking a declaratory judgment that 3 of Amendment
73 is -unconstitutional and void.-  Her complaint named
as defendants then-Governor Clinton, other state officers,
the Republican Party of Arkansas, and the Democratic
Party of Arkansas.  The State of Arkansas, through its
Attorney General, petitioner Winston Bryant, intervened
as a party defendant in support of the amendment.
Several proponents of the amendment also intervened,
including petitioner U. S. Term Limits, Inc.

  On cross-motions for summary judgment, the Circuit
Court held that 3 of Amendment 73 violated Article I
of the Federal Constitution.

  With respect to that holding, in a 5-to-2 decision, the
Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed.  U. S. Term Limits,
Inc. v. Hill, 316 Ark. 251, 872 S. W. 2d 349, 351 (1994).
Writing for a plurality of three justices, Justice Robert
L. Brown concluded that the congressional restrictions in
Amendment 73 are unconstitutional because the States
have no authority -to change, add to, or diminish- the
requirements for congressional service enumerated in the
Qualifications Clauses.  Id., at 265, 872 S. W. 2d, at
356.  He noted:

-If there is one watchword for representation of the
various states in Congress, it is uniformity.  Federal
legislators speak to national issues that affect the
citizens of every state. . . . The uniformity in
qualifications mandated in Article 1 provides the
tenor and the fabric for representation in the
Congress.  Piecemeal restrictions by State would fly
in the face of that order.-  Ibid.

  Justice Brown's plurality opinion also rejected the
argument that Amendment 73 is -merely a ballot access
amendment,- concluding that -[t]he intent and the effect
of Amendment 73 are to disqualify congressional incum-
bents from further service.-  Id., at 265-266, 872 S. W.
2d, at 356-357.  Justice Brown considered the possibili-
ties that an excluded candidate might run for Congress
as a write-in candidate or be appointed to fill a vacancy
to be -glimmers of opportunity . . . [that] are faint
indeed-so faint in our judgment that they cannot
salvage Amendment 73 from constitutional attack.-  Id.,
at 266, 872 S. W. 2d, at 357.  In separate opinions,
Justice Dudley and Justice Gerald P. Brown agreed that
Amendment 73 violates the Federal Constitution.

  Two Justices dissented from the federal constitutional
holding.  Justice Hays started from -the premise that all
political authority resides in the people, limited only by
those provisions of the federal or state constitutions
specifically to the contrary.-  316 Ark., at 281, 872 S.W.
2d, at 367.  Because his examination of the text and
history of the Qualifications Clauses convinced him that
the Constitution contains no express or implicit restric-
tion on the States' ability to impose additional qualifica-
tions on candidates for Congress, Justice Hays concluded
that 3 is constitutional.  Special Chief Justice Cracraft,
drawing a distinction between a measure that -impose[s]
an absolute bar on incumbent succession,- and a mea-
sure that -merely makes it more difficult for an incum-
bent to be elected,-  id., at 284, 872 S. W. 2d, at 368,
concluded that Amendment 73 does not even implicate
the Qualifications Clauses, and instead is merely a
permissible ballot access restriction.

  The State of Arkansas, by its Attorney General, and
the intervenors petitioned for writs of certiorari.
Because of the importance of the issues, we granted both
petitions and consolidated the cases for argument.  See
512 U. S. __ (1994).  We now affirm.

                           II

  As the opinions of the Arkansas Supreme Court
suggest, the constitutionality of Amendment 73 depends
critically on the resolution of two distinct issues.  The
first is whether the Constitution forbids States from
adding to or altering the qualifications specifically
enumerated in the Constitution.  The second is, if the
Constitution does so forbid, whether the fact that
Amendment 73 is formulated as a ballot access restric-
tion rather than as an outright disqualification is of
constitutional significance.  Our resolution of these
issues draws upon our prior resolution of a related but
distinct issue: whether Congress has the power to add
to or alter the qualifications of its Members.

  Twenty-six years ago, in Powell v. McCormack, 395
U. S. 486 (1969), we reviewed the history and text of
the Qualifications Clauses in a case involving an
attempted exclusion of a duly elected Member of Con-
gress.  The principal issue was whether the power
granted to each House in Art. I, 5, to judge the
-Qualifications of its own Members- includes the power
to impose qualifications other than those set forth in the
text of the Constitution.  In an opinion by Chief Justice
Warren for eight Members of the Court, we held that
it does not.  Because of the obvious importance of the
issue, the Court's review of the history and meaning of
the relevant constitutional text was especially thorough.
We therefore begin our analysis today with a full
statement of what we decided in that case.

THE ISSUE IN POWELL

  In November 1966, Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., was
elected from a District in New York to serve in the
United States House of Representatives for the 90th
Congress.  Allegations that he had engaged in serious
misconduct while serving as a committee chairman
during the 89th Congress led to the appointment of a
Select Committee to determine his eligibility to take his
seat.  That Committee found that Powell met the age,
citizenship, and residency requirements set forth in Art.
I, 2, cl. 2.  The Committee also found, however, that
Powell had wrongfully diverted House funds for the use
of others and himself and had made false reports on
expenditures of foreign currency.  Based on those
findings, the House after debate adopted House Resolu-
tion 278, excluding Powell from membership in the
House, and declared his seat vacant.  See 395 U. S., at
489-493.

  Powell and several voters of the District from which
he had been elected filed suit seeking a declaratory
judgment that the House Resolution was invalid because
Art. I, 2, cl. 2, sets forth the exclusive qualifications for
House membership.  We ultimately accepted that
contention, concluding that the House of Representatives
has no -authority to exclude any person, duly elected
by his constituents, who meets all the requirements for
membership expressly prescribed in the Constitution.-
395 U. S., at 522 (emphasis in original); see also id., at
547.  In reaching that conclusion, we undertook a
detailed historical review to determine the intent of the
Framers.  Though recognizing that the Constitutional
Convention debates themselves were inconclusive, see
id., at 532, we determined that the -relevant historical
materials- reveal that Congress has no power to alter
the qualifications in the text of the Constitution, id., at
522.

POWELL'S RELIANCE ON HISTORY

  We started our analysis in Powell by examining the
British experience with qualifications for membership in
Parliament, focusing in particular on the experience of
John Wilkes.  While serving as a member of Parliament,
Wilkes had published an attack on a peace treaty with
France.  This literary endeavor earned Wilkes a convic-
tion for seditious libel and a 22-month prison sentence.
In addition, Parliament declared Wilkes ineligible for
membership and ordered him expelled.  Despite (or
perhaps because of) these difficulties, Wilkes was
reelected several times.  Parliament, however, persisted
in its refusal to seat him.  After several years of Wilkes'
efforts, the House of Commons voted to expunge the
resolutions that had expelled Wilkes and had declared
him ineligible, labeling those prior actions -`subversive
of the rights of the whole body of electors of this king-
dom.'-  Id., at 528, quoting 22 Parliamentary History
England 1411 (1782) (Parl. Hist. Eng.).  After reviewing
Wilkes' -long and bitter struggle for the right of the
British electorate to be represented by men of their own
choice,- 395 U. S., at 528, we concluded in Powell that
-on the eve of the Constitutional Convention, English
precedent stood for the proposition that `the law of the
land had regulated the qualifications of members to
serve in parliament' and those qualifications were `not
occasional but fixed.'-  Ibid., at 528, quoting 16 Parl.
Hist. Eng. 589, 590 (1769).

  Against this historical background, we viewed the
Convention debates as manifesting the Framers' intent
that the qualifications in the Constitution be fixed and
exclusive.  We found particularly revealing the debate
concerning a proposal made by the Committee of Detail
that would have given Congress the power to add
property qualifications.  James Madison argued that
such a power would vest -`an improper & dangerous
power in the Legislature,'- by which the Legislature
-`can by degrees subvert the Constitution.'-  395 U. S.,
at 533-534, quoting 2 Records of the Federal Convention
of 1787, pp. 249-250 (M. Farrand ed. 1911) (hereinafter
Farrand).  Madison continued: -`A Republic may be
converted into an aristocracy or oligarchy as well by
limiting the number capable of being elected, as the
number authorised to elect.'-  395 U. S., at 534, quoting
2 Farrand 250.  We expressly noted that the -parallel
between Madison's arguments and those made in Wilkes'
behalf is striking.-  395 U. S., at 534.

  The Framers further revealed their concerns about
congressional abuse of power when Gouverneur Morris
suggested modifying the proposal of the Committee of
Detail to grant Congress unfettered power to add
qualifications.  We noted that Hugh Williamson -ex-
pressed concern that if a majority of the legislature
should happen to be `composed of any particular descrip-
tion of men, of lawyers for example, . . . the future
elections might be secured to their own body.'-  Id., at
535, quoting 2 Farrand 250.  We noted too that Madison
emphasized the British Parliament's attempts to regulate
qualifications, and that he observed: -`[T]he abuse they
had made of it was a lesson worthy of our attention.'-
395 U. S., at 535, quoting 2 Farrand 250.  We found
significant that the Convention rejected both Morris'
modification and the Committee's proposal.

  We also recognized in Powell that the post-Convention
ratification debates confirmed that the Framers under-
stood the qualifications in the Constitution to be fixed
and unalterable by Congress.  For example, we noted
that in response to the antifederalist charge that the
new Constitution favored the wealthy and well-born,
Alexander Hamilton wrote:

-`The truth is that there is no method of securing to
the rich the preference apprehended but by prescrib-
ing qualifications of property either for those who
may elect or be elected.  But this forms no part of
the power to be conferred upon the national govern-
ment. . . . The qualifications of the persons who may
choose or be chosen, as has been remarked upon
other occasions, are defined and fixed in the Consti-
tution, and are unalterable by the legislature.'-  395
U. S., at 539, quoting The Federalist No. 60, p. 371
(C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (emphasis added) (hereinafter
The Federalist).

We thus attached special significance to -Hamilton's
express reliance on the immutability of the qualifications
set forth in the Constitution.-  395 U. S., at 540.
Moreover, we reviewed the debates at the state conven-
tions and found that they -also demonstrate the
Framers' understanding that the qualifications for
members of Congress had been fixed in the Constitu-
tion.-  Ibid.; see, e. g., id., at 541, citing 3 Debates on
the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 8 (J. Elliot ed.
1863) (hereinafter Elliot's Debates) (Wilson Carey
Nicholas, Virginia).

  The exercise by Congress of its power to judge the
qualifications of its Members further confirmed this
understanding.  We concluded that, during the first 100
years of its existence, -Congress strictly limited its
power to judge the qualifications of its members to those
enumerated in the Constitution.-  395 U. S., at 542.

  As this elaborate summary reveals, our historical
analysis in Powell was both detailed and persuasive.
We thus conclude now, as we did in Powell, that history
shows that, with respect to Congress, the Framers
intended the Constitution to establish fixed qualifications.

POWELL'S RELIANCE ON DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES

  In Powell, of course, we did not rely solely on an
analysis of the historical evidence, but instead comple-
mented that analysis with -an examination of the basic
principles of our democratic system.-  Id., at 548.  We
noted that allowing Congress to impose additional
qualifications would violate that -fundamental principle
of our representative democracy . . . `that the people
should choose whom they please to govern them.'-   Id.,
at 547, quoting 2 Elliot's Debates 257 (A. Hamilton, New
York).

  Our opinion made clear that this broad principle
incorporated at least two fundamental ideas.  First,
we emphasized the egalitarian concept that the opportu-
nity to be elected was open to all.  We noted in
particular Madison's statement in The Federalist that
-`[u]nder these reasonable limitations [enumerated in the
Constitution], the door of this part of the federal
government is open to merit of every description,
whether native or adoptive, whether young or old, and
without regard to poverty or wealth, or to any particular
profession of religious faith.'-   Powell, 395 U. S., at
540, n. 74, quoting The Federalist No. 52, at 326.
Similarly, we noted that Wilson Carey Nicholas defended
the Constitution against the charge that it -violated
democratic principles- by arguing: -`It has ever been
considered a great security to liberty, that very few
should be excluded from the right of being chosen to the
legislature.  This Constitution has amply attended to
this idea.  We find no qualifications required except
those of age and residence.'-  395 U. S., at 541, quoting
3 Elliot's Debates 8.

  Second, we recognized the critical postulate that sover-
eignty is vested in the people, and that sovereignty
confers on the people the right to choose freely their
representatives to the National Government.  For
example, we noted that -Robert Livingston . . . endorsed
this same fundamental principle: `The people are the
best judges who ought to represent them.  To dictate
and control them, to tell them whom they shall not
elect, is to abridge their natural rights.'-  395 U. S., at
541, n. 76, quoting 2 Elliot's Debates 292-293.  Simi-
larly, we observed that -[b]efore the New York conven-
tion . . . , Hamilton emphasized: `The true principle of
a republic is, that the people should choose whom they
please to govern them.  Representation is imperfect in
proportion as the current of popular favor is checked.
This great source of free government, popular election,
should be perfectly pure, and the most unbounded
liberty allowed.'-  395 U. S., at 540-541, quoting 2
Elliot's Debates 257.  Quoting from the statement made
in 1807 by the Chairman of the House Committee on
Elections, we noted that -restrictions upon the people to
choose their own representatives must be limited to
those `absolutely necessary for the safety of the soci-
ety.'-  395 U. S., at 543, quoting 17 Annals of Cong. 874
(1807).  Thus, in Powell, we agreed with the sentiment
expressed on behalf of Wilkes' admission to Parliament:
-`That the right of the electors to be represented by men
of their own choice, was so essential for the preservation
of all their other rights, that it ought to be considered
as one of the most sacred parts of our constitution.'-
395 U. S., at 534, n. 65, quoting 16 Parl. Hist. Eng.
589-590 (1769).

  Powell thus establishes two important propositions:
first, that the -relevant historical materials- compel the
conclusion that, at least with respect to qualifications
imposed by Congress, the Framers intended the qualifi-
cations listed in the Constitution to be exclusive; and
second, that that conclusion is equally compelled by an
understanding of the -fundamental principle of our
representative democracy . . . `that the people should
choose whom they please to govern them.'-  395 U. S.,
at 547.

POWELL'S HOLDING

  Petitioners argue somewhat half-heartedly that the
narrow holding in Powell, which involved the power of
the House to exclude a member pursuant to Art. I, 5,
does not control the more general question whether
Congress has the power to add qualifications.  Powell,
however, is not susceptible to such a narrow reading.
Our conclusion that Congress may not alter or add to
the qualifications in the Constitution was integral to our
analysis and outcome.  See, e. g., id., at 540 (noting
-Framers' understanding that the qualifications for
members of Congress had been fixed in the Constitu-
tion-).  Only two Terms ago we confirmed this under-
standing of Powell in Nixon v. United States, 506 U. S.
__ (1993).  After noting that the three qualifications for
membership specified in Art. I, 2, are of -a precise,
limited nature- and -unalterable by the legislature,- we
explained:

      -Our conclusion in Powell was based on the fixed
meaning of `[q]ualifications' set forth in Art I, 2.
The claim by the House that its power to `be the
Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of
its own Members' was a textual commitment of
unreviewable authority was defeated by the exis-
tence of this separate provision specifying the only
qualifications which might be imposed for House
membership.-  Id., at __ (slip op. at 12-13).
Unsurprisingly, the state courts and lower federal courts
have similarly concluded that Powell conclusively
resolved the issue whether Congress has the power to
impose additional qualifications.  See, e.g., Joyner v.
Mofford, 706 F. 2d 1523, 1528 (CA9 1983) (-In Powell
of the Qualifications Clause-at least as applied to
Congress-); Michel v. Anderson, 14 F. 3d 623 (CADC
1994) (citing Nixon's description of Powell's holding);
Stumpf v. Lau, 108 Nev. 826, 830, 839 P. 2d 120, 122
(1992) (citing Powell for the proposition that -[n]ot even
Congress has the power to alter qualifications for these
constitutional federal officers-).

  In sum, after examining Powell's historical analysis
and its articulation of the -basic principles of our
democratic system,- we reaffirm that the qualifications
for service in Congress set forth in the text of the
Constitution are -fixed,- at least in the sense that they
may not be supplemented by Congress.

                           III

  Our reaffirmation of Powell, does not necessarily
resolve the specific questions presented in these cases.
For petitioners argue that whatever the constitutionality
of additional qualifications for membership imposed by
Congress, the historical and textual materials discussed
in Powell do not support the conclusion that the Consti-
tution prohibits additional qualifications imposed by
States.  In the absence of such a constitutional prohibi-
tion, petitioners argue, the Tenth Amendment and the
principle of reserved powers require that States be
allowed to add such qualifications.

  Before addressing these arguments, we find it appro-
priate to take note of the striking unanimity among the
courts that have considered the issue.  None of the
overwhelming array of briefs submitted by the parties
and amici has called to our attention even a single case
in which a state court or federal court has approved of
a State's addition of qualifications for a member of
Congress.  To the contrary, an impressive number of
courts have determined that States lack the authority to
add qualifications.  See, e. g., Chandler v. Howell, 104
Wash. 99, 175 P. 569 (1918); Eckwall v. Stadelman, 146
Ore. 439, 446, 30 P. 2d 1037, 1040 (1934); Stockton v.
McFarland, 56 Ariz. 138, 144, 106 P. 2d 328, 330 (1940);
State ex rel. Johnson v. Crane, 65 Wyo. 189, 197 P. 2d
864 (1948); Dillon v. Fiorina, 340 F. Supp. 729, 731
(N.M. 1972); Stack v. Adams, 315 F. Supp. 1295,
1297-1298 (ND Fla. 1970); Buckingham v. State, 42 Del.
405, 35 A. 2d 903, 905 (1944); Stumpf v. Lau, 108 Nev.
826, 830, 839 P. 2d 120, 123 (1992); Danielson v.
Fitzsimmons, 232 Minn. 149, 151, 44 N. W. 2d 484, 486
(1950); In re Opinion of Judges, 79 S. D. 585, 587, 116
N. W. 2d 233, 234 (1962).  Courts have struck down
state-imposed qualifications in the form of term limits,
see, e. g., Thorsted v. Gregoire, 841 F. Supp. 1068, 1081
(WD Wash. 1994); Stumpf v. Lau, 108 Nev., at 830, 839
P. 2d, at 123, district residency requirements, see, e. g.,
Hellmann v. Collier, 217 Md. 93, 100, 141 A. 2d 908,
911 (1958); Dillon v. Fiorina, 340 F. Supp., at 731; Exon
v. Tiemann, 279 F. Supp. 609, 613 (Neb. 1968); State ex
rel. Chavez v. Evans, 79 N. M. 578, 581, 446 P. 2d 445,
448 (1968) (per curiam), loyalty oath requirements, see,
e. g., Shub v. Simpson, 196 Md. 177, 199, 76 A. 2d 332,
341, appeal dism'd, 340 U. S. 881 (1950); In re
O'Connor, 173 Misc. 419, 421, 17 N. Y. S. 2d 758, 760
(Super. Ct. 1940), and restrictions on those convicted of
felonies, see, e. g., Application of Ferguson, 57 Misc. 2d
1041, 1043, 294 N. Y. S. 2d 174, 176 (Super. Ct. 1968);
Danielson v. Fitzsimmons, 232 Minn., at 151, 44 N. W.
2d, at 486; State ex rel. Eaton v. Schmahl, 140 Minn.
219, 220, 167 N. W. 481 (1918) (per curiam).  Prior to
Powell, the commentators were similarly unanimous.
See, e. g., 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries Appendix 213
(S. Tucker ed. 1803) (-[T]hese provisions, as they require
qualifications which the constitution does not, may
possibly be found to be nugatory-); 1 Story 627 (each
member of Congress is -an officer of the union, deriving
his powers and qualifications from the constitution, and
neither created by, dependent upon, nor controllable by,
the states-); 1 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law
228, n. a (3d ed. 1836) (-the objections to the existence
of any such power [on the part of the States to add
qualifications are]. . . too palpable and weighty to admit
of any discussion-); G. McCrary, American Law of
Elections 322 (4th ed. 1897) (-It is not competent for

Constitution or laws of the United States-); T. Cooley,
General Principles of Constitutional Law 268 (2d ed.
1891) (-The Constitution and laws of the United States

to nor take away from them-); C. Burdick, Law of the
American Constitution 160 (1922) (-It is clearly the
intention of the Constitution that all persons not
disqualified by the terms of that instrument should be
eligible to the federal office of Representative-); id., at
165 (-It is as clear that States have no more right to
add to the constitutional qualifications of Senators than
they have to add to those for Representatives-); Warren
422 (-The elimination of all power in Congress to fix
qualifications clearly left the provisions of the Constitu-
tion itself as the sole source of qualifications-).  This
impressive and uniform body of judicial decisions and
learned commentary indicates that the obstacles con-
fronting petitioners are formidable indeed.

  Petitioners argue that the Constitution contains no
express prohibition against state-added qualifications,
and that Amendment 73 is therefore an appropriate
exercise of a State's reserved power to place additional
restrictions on the choices that its own voters may
make.  We disagree for two independent reasons.  First,
we conclude that the power to add qualifications is not
within the -original powers- of the States, and thus is
not reserved to the States by the Tenth Amendment.
Second, even if States possessed some original power in
this area, we conclude that the Framers intended the
Constitution to be the exclusive source of qualifications
for members of Congress, and that the Framers thereby
-divested- States of any power to add qualifications.

  The -plan of the convention- as illuminated by the
historical materials, our opinions, and the text of the
Tenth Amendment, draws a basic distinction between
the powers of the newly created Federal Government
and the powers retained by the pre-existing sovereign
States.  As Chief Justice Marshall explained, -it was
neither necessary nor proper to define the powers
retained by the States.  These powers proceed, not from
the people of America, but from the people of the several
States; and remain, after the adoption of the constitu-
tion, what they were before, except so far as they may
be abridged by that instrument.-  Sturges v.
Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122, 193 (1819).

  This classic statement by the Chief Justice endorsed
Hamilton's reasoning in The Federalist No. 32 that the
plan of the Constitutional Convention did not contem-
plate -[a]n entire consolidation of the States into one
complete national sovereignty,- but only a partial
consolidation in which -the State governments would
clearly retain all the rights of sovereignty which they
before had, and which were not, by that act, exclusively
delegated to the United States.-  The Federalist No. 32,
at 198.  The text of the Tenth Amendment unambigu-
ously confirms this principle:

      -The powers not delegated to the United States by
the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States,
are reserved to the States respectively, or to the
people.-

  As we have frequently noted, -[t]he States unquestion-
ably do retain a significant measure of sovereign
authority.  They do so, however, only to the extent that
the Constitution has not divested them of their original
powers and transferred those powers to the Federal
Government.-  Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan
Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 549 (1985) (internal
quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis added);
see also New York v. United States, 505 U. S. __, __
(slip op., at 8-9) (1992).

SOURCE OF THE POWER

  Contrary to petitioners' assertions, the power to add
qualifications is not part of the original powers of
sovereignty that the Tenth Amendment reserved to the
States.  Petitioners' Tenth Amendment argument
misconceives the nature of the right at issue because
that Amendment could only -reserve- that which existed
before.  As Justice Story recognized, -the states can
exercise no powers whatsoever, which exclusively spring
out of the existence of the national government, which
the constitution does not delegate to them. . . . No state
can say, that it has reserved, what it never possessed.-
1 Story 627.

  Justice Story's position thus echoes that of Chief
Justice Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat.
316 (1819).  In McCulloch, the Court rejected the
argument that the Constitution's silence on the subject
of state power to tax corporations chartered by Congress
implies that the States have -reserved- power to tax
such federal instrumentalities.  As Chief Justice Mar-
shall pointed out, an -original right to tax- such federal
entities -never existed, and the question whether it has
been surrendered, cannot arise.- id., at 430.  See also
Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35, 46 (1868).  In language
that presaged Justice Story's argument, Chief Justice
Marshall concluded: -This opinion does not deprive the
States of any resources which they originally possessed.-
4 Wheat., at 436.

  With respect to setting qualifications for service in
Congress, no such right existed before the Constitution
was ratified.  The contrary argument overlooks the
revolutionary character of the government that the
Framers conceived.  Prior to the adoption of the Consti-
tution, the States had joined together under the Articles
of Confederation.  In that system, -the States retained
most of their sovereignty, like independent nations
bound together only by treaties.-  Wesberry v. Sanders,
376 U. S. 1, 9 (1964).  After the Constitutional Conven-
tion convened, the Framers were presented with, and
eventually adopted a variation of, -a plan not merely to
amend the Articles of Confederation but to create an
entirely new National Government with a National
Executive, National Judiciary, and a National Legisla-
ture.-  Id., at 10.  In adopting that plan, the Framers
envisioned a uniform national system, rejecting the
notion that the Nation was a collection of States, and
instead creating a direct link between the National
Government and the people of the United States.  See,
e. g., FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 791 (1982)
(O'Connor, J., concurring in the judgment in part and
dissenting in part) (-The Constitution . . . permitt[ed]
direct contact between the National Government and the
individual citizen-).  In that National Government,
representatives owe primary allegiance not to the people
of a State, but to the people of the Nation.  As Justice
Story observed, each Member of Congress is -an officer
of the union, deriving his powers and qualifications from
the constitution, and neither created by, dependent upon,
nor controllable by, the states. . . . Those officers owe
their existence and functions to the united voice of the
whole, not of a portion, of the people.-  1 Story 627.
Representatives and Senators are as much officers of the
entire union as is the President.  States thus -have just
as much right, and no more, to prescribe new qualifica-
tions for a representative, as they have for a presi-
dent. . . . It is no original prerogative of state power to
appoint a representative, a senator, or president for the
union.-  Ibid.

  We believe that the Constitution reflects the Framers'
general agreement with the approach later articulated by
Justice Story.  For example, Art. I, 5, cl. 1 provides:
-Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections,
Returns and Qualifications of its own Members.-  The
text of the Constitution thus gives the representatives of
all the people the final say in judging the qualifications
of the representatives of any one State.  For this reason,
the dissent falters when it states that -the people of
Georgia have no say over whom the people of Massa-
chusetts select to represent them in Congress.- Post, at
16.

  Two other sections of the Constitution further support
our view of the Framers' vision.  First, consistent with
Story's view, the Constitution provides that the salaries
of representatives should -be ascertained by Law, and
paid out of the Treasury of the United States,- Art. I,
6, rather than by individual States.  The salary
provisions reflect the view that representatives owe their
allegiance to the people, and not to States.  Second, the
provisions governing elections reveal the Framers'
understanding that powers over the election of federal
officers had to be delegated to, rather than reserved by,
the States.  It is surely no coincidence that the context
of federal elections provides one of the few areas in
which the Constitution expressly requires action by the
States, namely that -[t]he Times, Places and Manner of
holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall
be prescribed in each State by the legislature thereof.-
This duty parallels the duty under Article II that -Each
State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature
thereof may direct, a Number of Electors.-  Art II., 1,
cl. 2.  These Clauses are express delegations of power to
the States to act with respect to federal elections.

  This conclusion is consistent with our previous recogni-
tion that, in certain limited contexts, the power to
regulate the incidents of the federal system is not a
reserved power of the States, but rather is delegated by
the Constitution.  Thus, we have noted that -[w]hile, in
a loose sense, the right to vote for representatives in
Congress is sometimes spoken of as a right derived from
the states, . . . this statement is true only in the sense
that the states are authorized by the Constitution, to
legislate on the subject as provided by 2 of Art. I.-
United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299, 315 (1941).  Cf.
Hawke v. Smith, 253 U. S. 221 (1920) (-[T]he power to
ratify a proposed amendment to the Federal Constitution
has its source in the Federal Constitution.  The act of
ratification by the State derives its authority from the
Federal Constitution to which the State and its people
have alike assented-).

  In short, as the Framers recognized, electing represen-
tatives to the National Legislature was a new right,
arising from the Constitution itself.  The Tenth Amend-
ment thus provides no basis for concluding that the
States possess reserved power to add qualifications to
those that are fixed in the Constitution.  Instead, any
state power to set the qualifications for membership in
Congress must derive not from the reserved powers of
state sovereignty, but rather from the delegated powers
of national sovereignty.  In the absence of any constitu-
tional delegation to the States of power to add qualifica-
tions to those enumerated in the Constitution, such a
power does not exist.

THE PRECLUSION OF STATE POWER

  Even if we believed that States possessed as part of
their original powers some control over congressional
qualifications, the text and structure of the Constitution,
the relevant historical materials, and, most importantly,
the -basic principles of our democratic system- all
demonstrate that the Qualifications Clauses were
intended to preclude the States from exercising any such
power and to fix as exclusive the qualifications in the
Constitution.

  Much of the historical analysis was undertaken by the
Court in Powell.  See supra, at 9-12.  There is, however,
additional historical evidence that pertains directly to
the power of States.  That evidence, though perhaps not
as extensive as that reviewed in Powell, leads unavoid-
ably to the conclusion that the States lack the power to
add qualifications.

The Convention and Ratification Debates

  The available affirmative evidence indicates the
Framers' intent that States have no role in the setting
of qualifications.  In Federalist Paper No. 52, dealing
with the House of Representatives, Madison addressed
the -qualifications of the electors and the elected.-  The
Federalist No. 52, at 325.  Madison first noted the
difficulty in achieving uniformity in the qualifications for
electors, which resulted in the Framers' decision to
require only that the qualifications for federal electors
be the same as those for state electors.  Madison argued
that such a decision -must be satisfactory to every State,
because it is comfortable to the standard already
established, or which may be established, by the State
itself.-  Id., at 326.  Madison then explicitly contrasted
the state control over the qualifications of electors with
the lack of state control over the qualifications of the
elected:

      -The qualifications of the elected, being less
carefully and properly defined by the State constitu-
tions, and being at the same time more susceptible
of uniformity, have been very properly considered
and regulated by the convention.  A representative
of the United States must be of the age of twenty-
five years; must have been seven years a citizen of
the United States; must, at the time of his election
be an inhabitant of the State he is to represent;
and, during the time of his service must be in no
office under the United States.  Under these reason-
able limitations, the door of this part of the federal
government is open to merit of every description,
whether native or adoptive, whether young or old,
and without regard to poverty or wealth, or to any
particular profession of religious faith.-  Ibid.

Madison emphasized this same idea in Federalist 57:

      -Who are to be the objects of popular choice?
Every citizen whose merit may recommend him to
the esteem and confidence of his country.  No
qualification of wealth, of birth, of religious faith, or
of civil profession is permitted to fetter the judgment
or disappoint the inclination of the people.-  The
Federalist No. 57, at 351 (emphasis added).

  The provisions in the Constitution governing federal
elections confirm the Framers' intent that States lack
power to add qualifications.  The Framers feared that
the diverse interests of the States would undermine the
National Legislature, and thus they adopted provisions
intended to minimize the possibility of state interference
with federal elections.  For example, to prevent discrimi-
nation against federal electors, the Framers required in
Art. I, 2, cl. 1, that the qualifications for federal
electors be the same as those for state electors.  As
Madison noted, allowing States to differentiate between
the qualifications for state and federal electors -would
have rendered too dependent on the State governments
that branch of the federal government which ought to be
dependent on the people alone.-  The Federalist No. 52,
at 326.  Similarly, in Art. I, 4, cl. 1, though giving the
States the freedom to regulate the -Times, Places and
Manner of holding Elections,- the Framers created a
safeguard against state abuse by giving Congress the
power to -by Law make or alter such Regulations.-  The
Convention debates make clear that the Framers'
overriding concern was the potential for States' abuse of
the power to set the -Times, Places and Manner- of
elections.  Madison noted that -[i]t was impossible to
foresee all the abuses that might be made of the
discretionary power.-  2 Farrand 240.  Gouverneur
Morris feared -that the States might make false returns
and then make no provisions for new elections.-  Id., at
241.  When Charles Pinckney and John Rutledge moved
to strike the congressional safeguard, the motion was
soundly defeated.  Id., at 240-241.  As Hamilton later
noted: -Nothing can be more evident than that an
exclusive power of regulating elections for the national
government, in the hands of the State legislatures,
would leave the existence of the Union entirely at their
mercy.-  The Federalist No. 59, at 363.  See also ibid.
(one justification for Times, Places and Manner Clause
is that -[i]f we are in a humor to presume abuses
of power, it is as fair to presume them on the part
of the State governments as on the part of the general
government-).

  The Framers' discussion of the salary of representa-
tives reveals similar concerns.  When the issue was first
raised, Madison argued that congressional compensation
should be fixed in the Constitution, rather than left to
state legislatures, because otherwise -it would create an
improper dependence.-  1 Farrand 216.  George Mason
agreed, noting that -the parsimony of the States might
reduce the provision so low that . . . the question would
be not who were most fit to be chosen, but who were

most willing to serve.-  Ibid.

  When the issue was later reopened, Nathaniel Gorham
stated that he -wished not to refer the matter to the
State Legislatures who were always paring down
salaries in such a manner as to keep out of offices men
most capable of executing the functions of them.-  Id.,
at 372.  Edmund Randolph agreed that -[i]f the States
were to pay the members of the Nat[ional] Legislature,
a dependence would be created that would vitiate the
whole System.-  Ibid.  Rufus King -urged the danger of
creating a dependence on the States,- ibid., and Hamil-
ton noted that -[t]hose who pay are the masters of those
who are paid,- id., at 373.  The Convention ultimately
agreed to vest in Congress the power to set its own
compensation.  See Art. I, 6.

  In light of the Framers' evident concern that States
would try to undermine the National Government, they
could not have intended States to have the power to set
qualifications.  Indeed, one of the more anomalous
consequences of petitioners' argument is that it accepts
federal supremacy over the procedural aspects of
determining the times, places, and manner of elections
while allowing the states carte blanche with respect
to the substantive qualifications for membership in
Congress.

  The dissent nevertheless contends that the Framers'
distrust of the States with respect to elections does not
preclude the people of the States from adopting eligibil-
ity requirements to help narrow their own choices.  See
post, at 47-48.  As the dissent concedes, post, at 53,
however, the Framers were unquestionably concerned
that the States would simply not hold elections for
federal officers, and therefore the Framers gave Con-
gress the power to -make or alter- state election regula-
tions.  Yet under the dissent's approach, the States
could achieve exactly the same result by simply setting
qualifications for federal office sufficiently high that no
one could meet those qualifications.  In our view, it is
inconceivable that the Framers would provide a specific
constitutional provision to ensure that federal elections
would be held while at the same time allowing States to
render those elections meaningless by simply ensuring
that no candidate could be qualified for office.  Given
the Framers' wariness over the potential for state abuse,
we must conclude that the specification of fixed qualifi-
cations in the constitutional text was intended to
prescribe uniform rules that would preclude modification
by either Congress or the States.

  We find further evidence of the Framers' intent in Art.
1, 5, cl. 1, which provides: -Each House shall be the
Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its
own Members.-  That Art. I, 5 vests a federal tribunal
with ultimate authority to judge a Member's qualifica-
tions is fully consistent with the understanding that
those qualifications are fixed in the Federal Constitution,
but not with the understanding that they can be altered
by the States.  If the States had the right to prescribe
additional qualifications-such as property, educational,
or professional qualifications-for their own representa-
tives, state law would provide the standard for judging
a Member's eligibility.  As we concluded in Murdock v.
Memphis, 20 Wall. 590 (1875), federal questions are
generally answered finally by federal tribunals because
rights which depend on federal law -should be the same
everywhere- and -their construction should be uniform.-
Id., at 632.  The judging of questions concerning rights
which depend on state law is not, however, normally
assigned to federal tribunals.  See id., at 636.  The
Constitution's provision for each House to be the judge
of its own qualifications thus provides further evidence
that the Framers believed that the primary source of
those qualifications would be federal law.

  We also find compelling the complete absence in the
ratification debates of any assertion that States had the
power to add qualifications.  In those debates, the
question whether to require term limits, or -rotation,-
was a major source of controversy.  The draft of the
Constitution that was submitted for ratification con-
tained no provision for rotation.  In arguments that
echo in the preamble to Arkansas' Amendment 73,
opponents of ratification condemned the absence of a
rotation requirement, noting that -there is no doubt that
senators will hold their office perpetually; and in this
situation, they must of necessity lose their dependence,
and their attachments to the people.-  Even propo-
nents of ratification expressed concern about the -aban-
donment in every instance of the necessity of rotation in
office.-  At several ratification conventions, partici-
pants proposed amendments that would have required
rotation.

  The Federalists' responses to those criticisms and
proposals addressed the merits of the issue, arguing that
rotation was incompatible with the people's right to
choose.  As we noted above, Robert Livingston argued:
-The people are the best judges who ought to repre-
sent them. To dictate and control them, to tell them
whom they shall not elect, is to abridge their
natural rights. This rotation is an absurd species of
ostracism.- 2 Elliot's Debates 292-293.

Similarly, Hamilton argued that the representatives'
need for reelection rather than mandatory rotation was
the more effective way to keep representatives respon-
sive to the people, because -[w]hen a man knows he
must quit his station, let his merit be what it may, he
will turn his attention chiefly to his own emolument.-
Id., at 320.

  Regardless of which side has the better of the debate
over rotation, it is most striking that nowhere in the
extensive ratification debates have we found any
statement by either a proponent or an opponent of
rotation that the draft constitution would permit States
to require rotation for the representatives of their own
citizens.  If the participants in the debate had believed
that the States retained the authority to impose term
limits, it is inconceivable that the Federalists would not
have made this obvious response to the arguments of the
pro-rotation forces.  The absence in an otherwise
freewheeling debate of any suggestion that States had
the power to impose additional qualifications unquestion-
ably reflects the Framers' common understanding that
States lacked that power.

  In short, if it had been assumed that States could add
additional qualifications, that assumption would have
provided the basis for a powerful rebuttal to the argu-
ments being advanced.  The failure of intelligent and
experienced advocates to utilize this argument must
reflect a general agreement that its premise was
unsound, and that the power to add qualifications was
one that the Constitution denied the States.

Congressional Experience

  Congress' subsequent experience with state-imposed
qualifications provides further evidence of the general
consensus on the lack of state power in this area.  In
Powell, we examined that experience and noted that
during the first 100 years of its existence, -Congress
strictly limited its power to judge the qualifications of
its members to those enumerated in the Constitution.-
395 U. S., at 542.  Congress first confronted the issue in
1807 when it faced a challenge to the qualifications of
William McCreery, a Representative from Maryland who
allegedly did not satisfy a residency requirement
imposed by that State.  In recommending that McCreery
be seated, the Report of the House Committee on

Elections noted:

      -`The committee proceeded to examine the Consti-
tution, with relation to the case submitted to them,
and find that qualifications of members are therein
determined, without reserving any authority to the
State Legislatures to change, add to, or diminish
those qualifications; and that, by that instrument,
Congress is constituted the sole judge of the qualifi-
cations prescribed by it, and are obliged to decide
agreeably to the Constitutional rules . . . .'- Powell,
395 U. S., at 542, quoting 17 Annals of Cong. 871
(1807) (emphasis added).

The Chairman of the House Committee on Elections
elaborated during debate:

-`The Committee of Elections considered the qualifi-
cations of members to have been unalterably deter-
mined by the Federal Convention, unless changed by
an authority equal to that which framed the Consti-
tution at first; that neither the State nor the
Federal Legislatures are vested with authority to
add to those qualifications, so as to change them.'-
Powell, 395 U. S., at 542-543, quoting from 17
Annals of Cong. 872 (1807).

As we noted in Powell, the congressional debate over the
Committee's recommendation tended to focus on the
-narrow issue of the power of the States to add to the
standing qualifications set forth in the Constitution,-
395 U. S., at 543.  The whole House, however, did not
vote on the Committee's report, and instead voted only
on a simple resolution: -Resolved, That William
McCreery is entitled to his seat in this House.-  17
Annals of Cong. 1238 (1807).  That resolution passed by
a vote of 89 to 18.  Ibid.

  Though the House Debate may be inconclusive,
commentators at the time apparently viewed the seating
of McCreery as confirmation of the States' lack of power
to add qualifications.  For example, in a letter to Joseph
Cabell, Thomas Jefferson noted the argument that -to
add new qualifications to those of the Constitution would
be as much an alteration as to detract from them-; he
then added: -And so I think the House of Represen-
tatives of Congress decided in some case; I believe that
of a member from Baltimore.-  Letter of Jan. 31, 1814
to Joseph C. Cabell, in 14 Writings of Thomas Jefferson
82 (A. Lipscomb ed. 1904).

  Similarly, for over 150 years prior to Powell, commen-
tators viewed the seating of McCreery as an expression
of the view of the House that States could not add to
the qualifications established in the Constitution.  Thus,
for example, referring to the McCreery debates, one
commentator noted, -By the decision in this case, [and
that in another contested election], it seems to have been
settled that the States have not a right to require
qualifications from members, different from, or in
addition to, those prescribed by the constitution.-  Cases
of Contested Elections in Congress 171 (M. Clarke & D.
Hall eds. 1834) (emphasis in original).  Other commen-
tators viewed the incident similarly.  See, e. g., G.
Paschal, The Constitution of the United States 66 (1876)
(citing McCreery to support the proposition that -[t]he
Constitution having fixed the qualifications of members,
no additional qualifications can rightfully be required by
the States-) (emphasis in original); G. McCrary, Ameri-
can Law of Elections 323 (4th ed. 1897) (citing
McCreery and stating -A state law requiring that a
Representative in Congress shall reside in a particular
town and country within the district from which he is
chosen is unconstitutional and void-); W. Sutherland,
Notes on the Constitution of the United States 40 (1904)
(citing McCreery to support statement that -[t]his clause
fixes the qualifications of members so far as state action
is concerned, and no additional qualifications can be
required by the state-); C. Burdick, Law of the American
Constitution 160 (1922) (citing McCreery to support the
proposition that state-imposed -limitations have been
held . . . not to be effective-).  Finally, it is clear that in
Powell we viewed the seating of McCreery as the
House's acknowledgment that the qualifications in the
Constitution were fixed.  See 395 U. S., at 542-543.

  The Senate experience with state-imposed qualifica-
tions further supports our conclusions.  In 1887, for
example, the Senate seated Charles Faulkner of West
Virginia, despite the fact that a provision of the West
Virginia Constitution purported to render him ineligible
to serve.  The Senate Committee on Privileges and
Elections unanimously concluded that -no State can
prescribe any qualification to the office of United States
Senator in addition to those declared in the Constitution
of the United States.-  S. Rep. No. 1, 50th Cong., 1st
Sess., 4 (1887).  The Senate Committee on Rules and
Administration reached the same conclusion in 1964
when faced with a challenge to Pierre Salinger, who had
been appointed to serve as Senator from California.  See
S. Rep. No. 1381, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 5 (-It is well
settled that the qualifications established by the U. S.
Constitution for the office of U. S. Senator are exclusive,
and a State cannot, by constitutional or statutory
provisions, add to or enlarge upon those qualifications-).

  We recognize, as we did in Powell, that -congressional
practice has been erratic- and that the precedential
value of congressional exclusion cases is -quite limited.-
Powell, 395 U. S., at 545-546.  Nevertheless, those
incidents lend support to the result we reach today.

Democratic Principles

  Our conclusion that States lack the power to impose
qualifications vindicates the same -fundamental principle
of our representative democracy- that we recognized in
Powell, namely that -the people should choose whom
they please to govern them.-  Id., at 547 (internal
quotation marks omitted).

  As we noted earlier, the Powell Court recognized that
an egalitarian ideal-that election to the National
Legislature should be open to all people of
merit-provided a critical foundation for the Constitu-
tional structure.  This egalitarian theme echoes through-
out the constitutional debates.  In The Federalist No. 57,
for example, Madison wrote:

      -Who are to be the objects of popular choice?
Every citizen whose merit may recommend him to
the esteem and confidence of his country.  No
qualification of wealth, of birth, of religious faith, or
of civil profession is permitted to fetter the judgment
or disappoint the inclination of the people.-  The
Federalist No. 57, at 351.

  Similarly, hoping to persuade voters in New York that
the Constitution should be ratified, John Stevens, Jr.,
wrote: -[N]o Government, that has ever yet existed in
the world, affords so ample a field, to individuals of all
ranks, for the display of political talents and abili-
ties. . . . No man who has real merit, let his situation
be what it will, need despair.-  1 Bailyn 487, 492.  And
Timothy Pickering noted that, -while several of the state
constitutions prescribe certain degrees of property as
indispensable qualifications for offices, this which is
proposed for the U. S. throws the door wide open for the
entrance of every man who enjoys the confidence of his
fellow citizens.-  Letter from T. Pickering to C.
Tillinghast (Dec. 24, 1787), 1 Bailyn 289, 290 (emphasis
in original).  Additional qualifications pose the same
obstacle to open elections whatever their source.  The
egalitarian ideal, so valued by the Framers, is thus
compromised to the same degree by additional quali-
fications imposed by States as by those imposed by
Congress.

  Similarly, we believe that state-imposed qualifications,
as much as congressionally imposed qualifications, would
undermine the second critical idea recognized in Powell:
that an aspect of sovereignty is the right of the people
to vote for whom they wish.  Again, the source of the
qualification is of little moment in assessing the qualifi-
cation's restrictive impact.

  Finally, state-imposed restrictions, unlike the congres-
sionally imposed restrictions at issue in Powell, violate
a third idea central to this basic principle: that the right
to choose representatives belongs not to the States, but
to the people.  From the start, the Framers recognized
that the -great and radical vice- of the Articles of
Confederation was -the principle of LEGISLATION for
STATES or GOVERNMENTS, in their CORPORATE or
COLLECTIVE CAPACITIES, and as contradistinguished
from the INDIVIDUALS of whom they consist.-  The
Federalist No. 15, at 108 (Hamilton).  Thus the Fram-
ers, in perhaps their most important contribution,
conceived of a Federal Government directly responsible
to the people, possessed of direct power over the people,
and chosen directly, not by States, but by the people.
See, e. g., supra, at 22-23.  The Framers implemented
this ideal most clearly in the provision, extant from the
beginning of the Republic, that calls for the Members of
the House of Representatives to be -chosen every second
Year by the People of the several States.-  Art. I, 2, cl.
1.  Following the adoption of the 17th Amendment in
1913, this ideal was extended to elections for the Senate.
The Congress of the United States, therefore, is not a
confederation of nations in which separate sovereigns are
represented by appointed delegates, but is instead a
body composed of representatives of the people.  As
Chief Justice John Marshall observed: -The government
of the union, then, . . . is, emphatically, and truly, a
government of the people.  In form and in substance it
emanates from them.  Its powers are granted by them,
and are to be exercised directly on them, and for their
benefit.-  McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat., at
404-405.  Ours is a -government of the people, by the
people, for the people.-  A. Lincoln, Gettysburg Address
(1863).

  The Framers deemed this principle critical when they
discussed qualifications.  For example, during the
debates on residency requirements, Morris noted that in
the House, -the people at large, not the States, are
represented.-  2 Farrand 217 (emphasis in original)
(footnote omitted).  Similarly, George Read noted that
the Framers -were forming a Nati[ona]l Gov[ernmen]t
and such a regulation would correspond little with the
idea that we were one people.-  Ibid. (Emphasis in
original.)  James Wilson -enforced the same consider-
ation.-  Ibid.

  Consistent with these views, the constitutional struc-
ture provides for a uniform salary to be paid from the
national treasury, allows the States but a limited role in
federal elections, and maintains strict checks on state
interference with the federal election process.  The
Constitution also provides that the qualifications of the
representatives of each State will be judged by the
representatives of the entire Nation.  The Constitution
thus creates a uniform national body representing the
interests of a single people.

  Permitting individual States to formulate diverse
qualifications for their representatives would result in a
patchwork of state qualifications, undermining the
uniformity and the national character that the Framers
envisioned and sought to ensure.  Cf. McCulloch v.
Maryland, 4 Wheat., at 428-429 (1819) (-Those means
are not given by the people of a particular State, not
given by the constituents of the legislature, . . . but by
the people of all the States.  They are given by all, for
the benefit of all-and upon theory should be subjected
to that government only which belongs to all-).  Such a
patchwork would also sever the direct link that the
Framers found so critical between the National Govern-
ment and the people of the United States.

State Practice

  Petitioners attempt to overcome this formidable array
of evidence against the States' power to impose qualifica-
tions by arguing that the practice of the States immedi-
ately after the adoption of the Constitution demonstrates
their understanding that they possessed such power.
One may properly question the extent to which the
States' own practice is a reliable indicator of the
contours of restrictions that the Constitution imposed on
States, especially when no court has ever upheld a state-
imposed qualification of any sort.  See supra, at 18-19.
But petitioners' argument is unpersuasive even on its
own terms.  At the time of the Convention, -[a]lmost all
the State Constitutions required members of their
Legislatures to possess considerable property.-  See
Warren 416-417.  Despite this near uniformity, only
one State, Virginia, placed similar restrictions on
members of Congress, requiring that a representative be,
inter alia, a -freeholder.-  See 1788 Va. Acts, ch. 2,
2.  Just 15 years after imposing a property qualifica-
tion, Virginia replaced that requirement with a provision
requiring that representatives be only -qualified accord-
ing to the constitution of the United States.-  1813 Va.
Acts, ch. 23, 2.  Moreover, several States, including
New Hampshire, Georgia, Delaware, and South Carolina,
revised their Constitutions at around the time of the
Federal Constitution.  In the revised Constitutions, each
State retained property qualifications for its own state
elected officials yet placed no property qualification on
its congressional representatives.

  The contemporaneous state practice with respect to
term limits is similar.  At the time of the Convention,
States widely supported term limits in at least some
circumstances.  The Articles of Confederation contained
a provision for term limits.  As we have noted, some
members of the Convention had sought to impose term
limits for Members of Congress.  In addition, many
States imposed term limits on state officers, four
placed limits on delegates to the Continental Con-
gress, and several States voiced support for term
limits for Members of Congress.  Despite this wide-
spread support, no State sought to impose any term
limits on its own federal representatives.  Thus, a
proper assessment of contemporaneous state practice
provides further persuasive evidence of a general
understanding that the qualifications in the Constitution
were unalterable by the States.

  In sum, the available historical and textual evidence,
read in light of the basic principles of democracy
underlying the Constitution and recognized by this Court
in Powell, reveal the Framers' intent that neither
Congress nor the States should possess the power to
supplement the exclusive qualifications set forth in the
text of the Constitution.

                           IV

  Petitioners argue that, even if States may not add
qualifications, Amendment 73 is constitutional because
it is not such a qualification, and because Amendment
73 is a permissible exercise of state power to regulate
the -Times, Places and Manner of Holding Elections.-
We reject these contentions.

  Unlike 1 and 2 of Amendment 73, which create
absolute bars to service for long-term incumbents
running for state office, 3 merely provides that certain
Senators and Representatives shall not be certified as
candidates and shall not have their names appear on
the ballot.  They may run as write-in candidates and, if
elected, they may serve.  Petitioners contend that only
a legal bar to service creates an impermissible qualifica-
tion, and that Amendment 73 is therefore consistent
with the Constitution.

  Petitioners support their restrictive definition of
qualifications with language from Storer v. Brown, 415
U. S. 724 (1974), in which we faced a constitutional
challenge to provisions of the California Elections Code
that regulated the procedures by which both independent
candidates and candidates affiliated with qualified
political parties could obtain ballot position in general
elections.  The Code required candidates affiliated with
a qualified party to win a primary election, and required
independents to make timely filing of nomination papers
signed by at least 5% of the entire vote cast in the last
general election.  The Code also denied ballot position to
independents who had voted in the most recent primary
election or who had registered their affiliation with a
qualified party during the previous year.

  In Storer, we rejected the argument that the chal-
lenged procedures created additional qualifications as
-wholly without merit.-  Id., at 746, n. 16.  We noted
that petitioners -would not have been disqualified had
they been nominated at a party primary or by an
adequately supported independent petition and then
elected at the general election.-  Ibid.  We concluded
that the California Code -no more establishes an
additional requirement for the office of Representative
than the requirement that the candidate win the
primary to secure a place on the general ballot or
otherwise demonstrate substantial community support.-
Ibid.  See also Joyner v. Mofford, 706 F. 2d, at 1531;
Hopfmann v. Connolly, 746 F. 2d 97, 103 (CA1 1984),
vacated in part on other grounds, 471 U. S. 459 (1985).
Petitioners maintain that, under Storer, Amendment 73
is not a qualification.

  We need not decide whether petitioners' narrow under-
standing of qualifications is correct because, even if it is,
Amendment 73 may not stand.  As we have often noted,
-`[c]onstitutional rights would be of little value if they
could be . . . indirectly denied.'-  Harman v. Forssenius,
380 U. S. 528, 540 (1965), quoting Smith v. Allwright,
321 U. S. 649, 664 (1944).  The Constitution -nullifies
sophisticated as well as simple-minded modes- of
infringing on Constitutional protections.  Lane v. Wilson,
307 U. S. 268, 275 (1939); Harman v. Forssenius, 380
U. S., at 540-541.

  In our view, Amendment 73 is an indirect attempt to
accomplish what the Constitution prohibits Arkansas
from accomplishing directly.  As the plurality opinion of
the Arkansas Supreme Court recognized, Amendment 73
is an -effort to dress eligibility to stand for Congress in
ballot access clothing,- because the -intent and the effect
of Amendment 73 are to disqualify congressional incum-
bents from further service.-  316 Ark., at 266, 872 S. W.
2d, at 357.  We must, of course, accept the State
Court's view of the purpose of its own law: we are thus
authoritatively informed that the sole purpose of 3 of
Amendment 73 was to attempt to achieve a result that
is forbidden by the Federal Constitution.  Indeed, it
cannot be seriously contended that the intent behind
Amendment 73 is other than to prevent the election of
incumbents.  The preamble of Amendment 73 states
explicitly: -[T]he people of Arkansas . . . herein limit the
terms of elected officials.-  Sections 1 and 2 create
absolute limits on the number of terms that may be
served.  There is no hint that 3 was intended to have
any other purpose.

  Petitioners do, however, contest the Arkansas Supreme
Court's conclusion that the Amendment has the same
practical effect as an absolute bar.  They argue that the
possibility of a write-in campaign creates a real possibil-
ity for victory, especially for an entrenched incumbent.
One may reasonably question the merits of that conten-
tion.  Indeed, we are advised by the state court that
there is nothing more than a faint glimmer of possibility
that the excluded candidate will win.  Our prior
cases, too, have suggested that write-in candidates have
only a slight chance of victory.  But even if petition-
ers are correct that incumbents may occasionally win
reelection as write-in candidates, there is no denying
that the ballot restrictions will make it significantly
more difficult for the barred candidate to win the
election.  In our view, an amendment with the avowed
purpose and obvious effect of evading the requirements
of the Qualifications Clauses by handicapping a class of
candidates cannot stand.  To argue otherwise is to
suggest that the Framers spent significant time and
energy in debating and crafting Clauses that could be
easily evaded.  More importantly, allowing States to
evade the Qualifications Clauses by -dress[ing] eligibility
to stand for Congress in ballot access clothing- trivial-
izes the basic principles of our democracy that underlie
those Clauses.  Petitioners' argument treats the Qualifi-
cations Clauses not as the embodiment of a grand
principle, but rather as empty formalism.  -`It is
inconceivable that guaranties embedded in the Constitu-
tion of the United States may thus be manipulated out
of existence.'-  Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339,
345 (1960), quoting Frost & Frost Trucking Co. v.
Railroad Comm'n of California, 271 U. S. 583, 594
(1926).

  Petitioners make the related argument that Amend-
ment 73 merely regulates the -Manner- of elections, and
that the Amendment is therefore a permissible exercise
of state power under Article I, 4, cl. 1 (the Elections
Clause) to regulate the -Times, Places and Manner- of
elections.  We cannot agree.

  A necessary consequence of petitioners' argument is
that Congress itself would have the power to -make or
alter- a measure such as Amendment 73.  Art. I, 4, cl.
1.  See Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355, 366-367 (1932)
(-[T]he Congress may supplement these state regulations
or may substitute its own-).  That the Framers would
have approved of such a result is unfathomable.  As our
decision in Powell and our discussion above make clear,
the Framers were particularly concerned that a grant to
Congress of the authority to set its own qualifications
would lead inevitably to congressional self-aggrandize-
ment and the upsetting of the delicate constitutional
balance.  See supra, at 9-11, and n. 10, supra.  Petition-
ers would have us believe, however, that even as the
Framers carefully circumscribed congressional power to
set qualifications, they intended to allow Congress to
achieve the same result by simply formulating the
regulation as a ballot access restriction under the
Elections Clause.  We refuse to adopt an interpretation
of the Elections Clause that would so cavalierly disre-
gard what the Framers intended to be a fundamental
constitutional safeguard.

  Moreover, petitioners' broad construction of the
Elections Clause is fundamentally inconsistent with the
Framers' view of that Clause.  The Framers intended
the Elections Clause to grant States authority to create
procedural regulations, not to provide States with license
to exclude classes of candidates from federal office.
During the Convention debates, for example, Madison il-
lustrated the procedural focus of the Elections Clause by
noting that it covered -[w]hether the electors should vote
by ballot or viv- voce, should assemble at this place or
that place; should be divided into districts or all meet at
one place, sh[oul]d all vote for all the representatives; or
all in a district vote for a number allotted to the
district.-  2 Farrand 240.  Similarly, during the ratifica-
tion debates, proponents of the Constitution noted:
-[T]he power over the manner only enables them to
determine how these electors shall elect-whether by
ballot, or by vote, or by any other way.-  4 Elliot's
Debates 71 (Steele statement at North Carolina ratifying
convention) (emphasis in original).

  Hamilton made a similar point in The Federalist No.
60, in which he defended the Constitution's grant to
Congress of the power to override state regulations.
Hamilton expressly distinguished the broad power to set
qualifications from the limited authority under the Elec-
tions Clause, noting that

-there is no method of securing to the rich the
preference apprehended but by prescribing qualifica-
tions of property either for those who may elect or
be elected.  But this forms no part of the power to
be conferred upon the national government.  Its
authority would be expressly restricted to the
regulation of the times, the places, and the manner
of elections.-  The Federalist No. 60, at 371 (empha-
sis in original).

As Hamilton's statement suggests, the Framers under-
stood the Elections Clause as a grant of authority to
issue procedural regulations, and not as a source of
power to dictate electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor
a class of candidates, or to evade important constitu-
tional restraints.

  Our cases interpreting state power under the Elections
Clause reflect the same understanding.  The Elections
Clause gives States authority -to enact the numerous
requirements as to procedure and safeguards which
experience shows are necessary in order to enforce the
fundamental right involved.-  Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S.,
at 366.  However, -[t]he power to regulate the time,
place, and manner of elections does not justify, without
more, the abridgement of fundamental rights.-  Tashjian
v. Republican Party of Connecticut, 479 U. S. 208, 217
(1986).  States are thus entitled to adopt -generally
applicable and evenhanded restrictions that protect the
integrity and reliability of the electoral process itself.-
Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 788, n. 9 (1983).
For example, in Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S. 724 (1974),
the case on which petitioners place principal reliance, we
upheld the validity of certain provisions of the California
Election Code.  In so doing, we emphasized the States'
interest in having orderly, fair, and honest elections
-rather than chaos.-  Id., at 730.  We also recognized
the -States' strong interest in maintaining the integrity
of the political process by preventing interparty raiding,-
id., at 731, and explained that the specific requirements
applicable to independents were -expressive of a general
state policy aimed at maintaining the integrity of the
various routes to the ballot,- id., at 733.  In other cases,
we have approved the States' interests in avoiding -voter
confusion, ballot overcrowding, or the presence of
frivolous candidacies,- Munro v. Socialist Workers Party,
479 U. S. 189, 194-195 (1986), in -seeking to assure
that elections are operated equitably and efficiently,-
Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S., at __ (slip op. at 5), and
in -guard[ing] against irregularity and error in the
tabulation of votes,- Roudebush v. Hartke, 405 U. S. 15,
25 (1972).  In short, we have approved of state regula-
tions designed to ensure that elections are -`fair and
honest and  . . . [that] some sort of order, rather than
chaos, . . . accompan[ies] the democratic processes.'-
Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S., at __ (slip op. at 4),
quoting Storer, 415 U. S., at 730.

  The provisions at issue in Storer and our other
Elections Clause cases were thus constitutional because
they regulated election procedures and did not even
arguably impose any substantive qualification rendering
a class of potential candidates ineligible for ballot posi-
tion.  They served the state interest in protecting the
integrity and regularity of the election process, an
interest independent of any attempt to evade the
constitutional prohibition against the imposition of
additional qualifications for service in Congress.  And
they did not involve measures that exclude candidates
from the ballot without reference to the candidates'
support in the electoral process.  Our cases upholding
state regulations of election procedures thus provide
little support for the contention that a state-imposed
ballot access restriction is constitutional when it is
undertaken for the twin goals of disadvantaging a
particular class of candidates and evading the dictates
of the Qualifications Clauses.

  We do not understand the dissent to contest our
primary thesis, namely that if the qualifications for
Congress are fixed in the Constitution, then a State-
passed measure with the avowed purpose of imposing
indirectly such an additional qualification violates the
Constitution.  The dissent, instead, raises two objections,
challenging the assertion that the Arkansas amendment
has the likely effect of creating a qualification, post, at
79, and suggesting that the true intent of Amendment
73 was not to evade the Qualifications Clause but rather
to simply -level the playing field,- post, at 83.  Neither
of these objections has merit.

  As to the first, it is simply irrelevant to our holding
today.  As we note above in n. 45, supra, our prior cases
strongly suggest that write-in candidates will have only
a slim chance of success, and the Arkansas plurality
agreed.  However, we expressly do not rest on this
Court's prior observations regarding write-in candidates.
Instead, we hold that a state amendment is unconstitu-
tional when it has the likely effect of handicapping a
class of candidates and has the sole purpose of creating
additional qualifications indirectly.  Thus, the dissent's
discussion of the evidence concerning the possibility that
a popular incumbent will win a write-in election is
simply beside the point.

  As to the second argument, we find wholly unpersua-
sive the dissent's suggestion that Amendment 73 was
designed merely to -level the playing field.-  As we have
noted, supra, at 52, it is obvious that the sole purpose
of Amendment 73 was to limit the terms of elected offi-
cials, both State and federal, and that Amendment 73,
therefore, may not stand.

                            V

  The merits of term limits, or -rotation,- have been the
subject of debate since the formation of our Constitution,
when the Framers unanimously rejected a proposal to
add such limits to the Constitution.  The cogent argu-
ments on both sides of the question that were articu-
lated during the process of ratification largely retain
their force today.  Over half the States have adopted
measures that impose such limits on some offices either
directly or indirectly, and the Nation as a whole, notably
by constitutional amendment, has imposed a limit on the
number of terms that the President may serve.  Term
limits, like any other qualification for office, unquestion-
ably restrict the ability of voters to vote for whom they
wish.  On the other hand, such limits may provide for
the infusion of fresh ideas and new perspectives, and
may decrease the likelihood that representatives will
lose touch with their constituents.  It is not our province
to resolve this longstanding debate.

  We are, however, firmly convinced that allowing the
several States to adopt term limits for congressional
service would effect a fundamental change in the
constitutional framework.  Any such change must come
not by legislation adopted either by Congress or by an
individual State, but rather-as have other important
changes in the electoral process-through the Amend-
ment procedures set forth in Article V.  The Framers
decided that the qualifications for service in the Con-
gress of the United States be fixed in the Constitution
and be uniform throughout the Nation.  That decision
reflects the Framers' understanding that Members of
Congress are chosen by separate constituencies, but that
they become, when elected, servants of the people of the
United States.  They are not merely delegates appointed
by separate, sovereign States; they occupy offices that
are integral and essential components of a single
National Government.  In the absence of a properly
passed constitutional amendment, allowing individual
States to craft their own qualifications for Congress
would thus erode the structure envisioned by the
Framers, a structure that was designed, in the words of
the Preamble to our Constitution, to form a -more
perfect Union.-

  The judgment is affirmed.

                                      It is so ordered.

PROCEDURAL SUGGESTIONS FOR RAISING THE BIRTH CONTROL ISSUE
(Brodley - Etherington - Yale Law School) May 25, 1950


Raising the Issue in the Court

Little chance of raising it directly--Injunction would be of
little help, especially if it were wished to get case to
Supreme Court--Declaratory judgment might be worth trying
again, making sure that threat of State's Attorney was
unequivocal-- New possibility is to raise issue by
Mandamus--Non-profit corporation would apply to Secretary of
State for charter, and bring mandamus when Secretary refused
to grant charter--Doesn't appear to be executive discretion
in granting such charter--Would not be corporate practice of
medicine--Lack of good faith objection could be met--Most
difficult problem would be meeting argument that legislature
in its discretion chose not to license corporation of this
sort, legal or illegal--But strong counter argument to
this--Improbable that legislature would have intended this
and not said so.

With such large political reasons opposing the
change of the Act in the Legislature, and with
such grave legal doubts hovering over a
referendum, it may be that the best chance of an
alteration in the law is through the
courts.

Even the bare raising of the birth control
issue in the courts represents a very ticklish    
question. There seems little chance of raising
it directly. A citizen would not wish to suffer
the sensationalism which might be attached to him  
were he to violate the law. This would be
especially true of one who is sick, whose life
is in danger--the very person who would be able
to bring the strongest case. Similarly, a doctor,
fearing the harm that might be done to his
reputation, would be reluctant to participate
as a defendent.

A possible way around this difficulty would be
to find a crusader of the Margaret Sanger ilk, who
would perhaps welcome the martyrdom. She might set
up a booth outside the State Attorney's office and
make appointments for married women at her birth
control clinic; or she might sell prophylactic
kits marked "For prevention of disease."
(This would force the Connecticut Court to meet
the issue raised by the case of Commonwealth v.
Corbett in Massachusetts.

But the best hopes of attach are by less direct
methods: There are three possibilities here:
injunction, declaratory judgment, mandamus. In the
past the Connecticut Court has not, on this issue,
been overly strict on procedural.

[Document 2.]

REQUIREMENTS FOR A TEST CASE
(firm of Wiggin & Dana)


It is essential that:


1. She must have used contrceptives in this state in the
recent past.

2. She must be willing to be a defendant in criminal
proceedings against her. This means she would go through the
form of arrest, but would be forthwith released on bail.


3. She must be willing to confess to the State's Attorney
that she has used contraceptives and to so testify in open
court.

4. She must be willing to risk the possibility that, if the
case is ultimately decided against her, she might at that
time be sentenced to not less than sixty days in jail. A
jail sentence is unlikely, but it could be imposed.

5. She must have used contraceptives on the advice of a
physician that a pregnancy within three years would be
seriously detrimental to her health, or, possibly on the
advice of a physician that if she became pregnant within
three years, her child would be abnormal.

6. The physician must be willing to testify in court as to
his opinion and advice.


   It would be desirable if:

7. She had procured her instruction in the use of
contraceptives prior to March 6, 1940 or from an
out-of-state doctor.

8. Her husband were willing to tell the State's Attorney
that she had used contraceptives, and possibly to so testify
in open court.

9. She already had one or more children.

Riege and Buist Anderson to the Planned Parenthood League of
Connecticut, Inc., re: possible legal actions; 1955]

MEMORANDUM

To: Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut, Inc.

Re: Recommendations Concerning Possible Legal Actions.

I. THE QUESTION

You have asked us to make a study of the possible legal
actions which might accomplish the objective of revoking or
limiting the present Birth Control Law in Connecticut and to
analyze the probability of success in each case,
recommending a case or cases which, in our opinion, would
offer the best chance of success. This study does not
include in its scope other possible means of accomplishing
this end, such as political action, nor does this study
consider in detail the practical problems that may present

themselves in certain of the cases; for example, obtaining
an actual patient or patients as parties in these cases.

II. THE STATUTES INVOLVED

The Birth Control statute in Connecticut with which we are
dealing is Section 8568 of the General Statutes of
Connecticut, revision of 1949, which provides as follows:

``Any person who shall use any drug, medicinal article or
instrument for the purpose of preventing conception shall be
fined not less that $50.00 or imprisoned not less than 60
days nor more than one year, or be both fined and
imprisoned.''

In connection with the types of action we are recommending,
we are also concerned with the following general provisions
of the General Statutes of Connecticut, Revision of 1949:

``Sec. 8875. Accessories. Any person who shall assist, abet,
counsel, cause, hire or command another to commit any
offense may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the
principal offender.''

``Sec. 8876. Conspiracy. Any person who shall combine,
confederate or agree with another or others to accomplish
any unlawful object by lawful means, or any lawful object by
unlawful means, or an unlawful object by unlawful means, if
one or more of such persons shall do any act in furtherance
of such combine, confederation or agreement shall be fined
not more than five thousand dollars or imprisoned not more
than 15 years, or both. No member or officer of any lawful
organization shall be held liable for the unlawful acts of

III. BACKGROUND

The present Birth Control Law was originally passed as part
of a general obscenity law adopted by the Connecticut
General Assembly in 1879. This law has since been broken
down into sections of which the present Sections of which
the present Section 8568 is one.

There were no legal developments with respect to the Birth
Control Law in Connecticut until 1939. During this period,
however, the Federal Courts handed down a number of
decisions which in effect said that the Federal Birth
Control Law should not be interpreted to apply to doctors
who prescribed contraceptives for health reasons. The
Federal statute was quite similar to the Connecticut Law,
particularly in that it did not specifically make any
exception for prescriptions by doctors.


In 1938 the Massachusetts Supreme Court upheld a
Massachusetts Birth Control Law which prohibited generally
the Sale of contraceptives. Gardner V. Massachusetts, 300
Mass. 372. The appeal from this case was dismissed by a
unanimous decision of the United States Supreme Court which
simply said that no substantial federal question was
involved. 305 U.S. 559.

In 1939 the first legal action concerning this statute arose
in Connecticut when two doctors and a nurse who were
attached to the Waterbury Clinic were arrested for violating
the Connecticut Birth Control statute, on the grounds that
they were aiding and abetting in the commission of a crime
under the present statute, Section 8875. Upon appeal to the
Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors the Court held that
there was no implied exception in the Connecticut law which
would permit a doctor to prescribe contraceptives for a
patient in the absence of anything beyond danger to the
general health of the patient, and further that the statute
so interpreted was constitutional. State v. Nelson, 126
Conn. 412 (1940). Judges Maltbie and Brown concurred in
Judge Hinman's majority opinion, while Judges Avery and
Jennings dissented. Because of a procedural technicality
this case could not be appealed to the United States Supreme
Court.

In 1942 the case of Tileston v. Ullman, 129 Conn. 84, was
brought as a test case in the form of a declaratory judgment
action. This case was designed to test the law in a
situation where the patient's life was actually in danger.
In another 3-2 decision the Supreme Court of Errors held
that no exception of any kind could be read into the
Connecticut Birth Control Law, even where life or serious
injury to health was involved. Judges Maltbie and Brown
concurred in Judge Ells' majority opinion, while Judges
Avery and Jennings again dissented. This case was appealed
to the United States Supreme Court where the appeal was
dismissed on the procedural issue that the doctor was not
the proper party to raise the question of the patient's life
or health. The court was careful to point out in its opinion
that it was not considering the question of whether or not
there was a genuine case or controversy such as is essential
to the exercise of jurisdiction by the United States Supreme
Court. 318 U.S. 44 (1942)

Since 1942 an attempt has been made in each session of the
legislature to modify or revoke the Birth Control Law. In
spite of careful planning and the expenditure of
considerable time and money, all of the proposed bills have
been defeated or allowed to die in committee. In the face of
this reaction the League has decided once again to consider
the advisability of Court action.


IV. OPINION

In our opinion there are three types of cases which offer
the greatest probability of accomplishing your purpose. They
all involve a direct attack upon the constitutionality of
the Birth Control Law and would all squarely present the
issues to the courts. These action are, first, a criminal
case involving the actual arrest of a doctor and named
patients; secondly, a declaratory judgement action brought
in the Connecticut courts by a doctor and named patients;
and thirdly, an action by a doctor and named patients in the
Federal District Court to enjoin the State's Attorney, the
local prosecuting attorney and possibly the Attorney General
from enforcing the Birth Control Law.

     (a) Criminal Action. There is little doubt that the
criminal action would present your case most forcefully
and would be the most difficult for the courts,
particularly the United States Supreme Court, to
sidestep. The case could arise in any one of a variety
of ways, and might, for example, result from the opening
of a Birth Control Clinic by a doctor who offers birth
control information only to patients whose lives would
be endangered by pregnancy. A patient, or preferably
patients, would be referred to the clinic by other
doctors and the statute would subsequently be violated
by the doctor and patients. At this point the local
prosecuting officer would presumably step in, make the
arrests, the defendants would be bound over to the
Superior Court and the State's Attorney would enter the
picture. A full trial should be had in the Superior
Court, rather than moving the case up to the Supreme
Court on reservations, so that all the necessary facts
will be developed fully.

As we will point out more fully later on, there is no
accurate way of predicting the decision of the
Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors. We must assume,
therefore, that the case will be lost and appealed to
the United States Supreme Court. It is our feeling that
the United States Supreme Court should decide the case
and that if they do so, the case would probably be won
(See Section V. below). It is possible, perhaps even
probable, however, that the Court would refuse to decide
the case, dismissing it for lack of a substantial
federal question, as was done in the earlier
Massachusetts case (Gardner v. Massachusetts, 305 U.S.
559, 1938). It does not seem to us that the Court could
duck the case on the grounds of ``improper parties'', as
in the Tileston Case, nor on the grounds that there was
no real ``case or controversy'' but the ``federal
question'' argument is a real possibility. To be sure,
the Gardner case can be distinguished. In addition, the
fact that the Tileston case was not dismissed for lack
of a federal question, even though this was urged by
State's Attorney Ullman in his statement against
jurisdiction, can be said to indicate that the court
recognized the presence of a federal question. We feel
it is more likely that the court merely took the easiest
way out and still has the ``federal question'' as
ammunition to use should another case be submitted to
them.

Actually, in view of the character of the present United
States Supreme Court, we cannot safely predict that the
case would be decided by that Court although it is our
opinion that there is a substantial federal question
involved and also that all of the other prerequisites
for jurisdiction would be present.

Regardless of the above questions, however, we must
hesitate to recommend this type of action because of the
danger of prosecution of the parties under the
Connecticut Conspiracy statute, particularly since we
feel there is another possibility open to you. It is our
opinion that the prosecution in this criminal case could
be made under either or both of the Accessory and the
Conspiracy laws. In Connecticut there is no merger of
the Conspiracy charge in the crime once committed, and,
in fact, it is recognized that the penalty under the
Conspiracy statute may be greater than the penalty for
the crime committed. We do not wish to overemphasize
this danger, and if a doctor and patients an be found
who are willing to assume whatever risk is involved,
this type of case would still present your strongest
argument. In a situation such as you are confronted
with, however, where the statute has been interpreted by
the highest state court in a decision which leaves
little question as to what constitutes a violation, and
where the State's Attorney may be under pressure to
prosecute vigorously, we feel there is sufficient danger
to all the parties involved in the case so that we
cannot recommend the criminal action.

(b) Declaratory Judgment Action. Although the Tileston
case involved a declaratory judgment action and failed
to evoke a decision from the United States Supreme
Court, we do not feel this necessarily precludes the
successful use of this type of action. If such a case is
brought, both a doctor and named patients should bring
the action. The strongest part of the case, in fact,
would probably be built around the claims of the
patients. The opportunity for the type of dismissal
which occurred in the Tileston case would, we believe,
be eliminated by thus joining the actual patients whose
lives would be endangered by pregnancy.

In this type of action, as in the criminal case, we must

assume that the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors will
decide against the doctor and patients. This is not to
say that there is no possibility of a favorable decision
in the Connecticut court. With the precedent established
by the Nelson and Tileston cases, however, the present
court would be reluctant to render an opinion which
would overrule the earlier decisions. The power to
overrule is used sparingly and the doctrine of stare
decisis - the reliance on decisions in earlier cases -
is an important one. It played, in fact a prominent part
in Judge Ells' decision in the Tileston case. With the
substantial change in the court personnel, however,
which has occurred since 1942, there is more room for
optimistic speculation as to the outcome of such
proposed action and even though, as Judge Ells stated,
``a change in personnel of the court affords no grounds
for reopening a question which has been authoritatively
settled'' we do feel there is some slight chance of the
present court overruling the Tileston decision.

There is, of course, the possibility that the
Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors would decide that a
declaratory judgment type of action is not the proper
procedure to test the law. This possibility was in fact
raised and left undecided in the Tileston case. It seems
to us that all of the necessary elements for a
declaratory judgment as established by the Connecticut
Statute and Rules as well as prior cases could be
present in such a case, but in view of the question
raised by Judge Ells in the Tileston case, the
possibility does exist that the court would hold that
there is no ``actual bona fide and substantial question
or issue in dispute or substantial uncertainty of legal
relations which requires settlement between the
parties''.

The possibility that the United States Supreme Court
would duck the issues involved as presented in a
declaratory judgment action, we believe, is somewhat
greater than in the criminal action. There is the same
possibility of side-stepping the case on the grounds
that no substantial federal question in involved as in
the criminal case. If the court believes the issues are
similar enough to those raised in the Gardner case, and
that their decisions in the four cases cited in the
dismissal of that case constitute authority for such a
dismissal, the court could again dismiss this action on
that ground. (see Powell v. Pennsylvania, 127 U.S. 678,
685; Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 26-27;
Groves v. Minnesota, 272 U.S. 425, 248; Lambert v.
Kellowhey, 272 U.S. 581, 596.)

In addition, there is the possibility that the United
States Supreme Court would dismiss the appeal on the

grounds that it does not involve a ``case or
controversy'' such as is a prerequisite to the exercise
of its jurisdiction. This possibility was definitely
considered by the United States Supreme Court in
dismissing the Tileston case when it stated that ``since
the appeal must be dismissed on the ground that
appellant has no standing to litigate the constitutional
question which the record presents, it is unnecessary to
consider whether the records show the exercise of the
jurisdiction of this court''. 318U.S. 44, 46. This
gratuitous statement may have had reference to the fact
that the record indicated only that the State's Attorney
``claims or may claim'' that the actions of the doctor
would constitute a violation of the law, and the Court
may have felt this was more in the nature of a
hypothetical question inasmuch as there was no actual
threat that the State's Attorney would claim a
violation. The declaratory judgment action has received
rough treatment at the hands of the United States
Supreme Court, and although the decisions of that court
in these types of cases have been severely criticized,
this attitude must still be recognised in assessing the
possibilities of a decision in this particular action.
The United States Supreme Court is particularly strict
in its requirements when a constitutional question is
involved, as would be the situation in this case. We
believe the case could be arranged in such a way that
all of the necessary elements would be present,
including an actual threat of prosecution, but we also
feel that it is impossible to be certain that the United
States Supreme Court will not refuse to exercise
jurisdiction in an arbitrary manner.

It is our opinion, therefore, that although the
declaratory judgment action is a safer way to test to
the law than the criminal case, it offers the United
States Supreme Court, and perhaps also the Connecticut
courts, a greater opportunity to avoid rendering a
decision.

Gentlemen:

        Early in 1953 your organization, acting through Mrs.
George P. Milmine and others in office at that time, retained
us to bring an action in the Superior Court to test the
constitutionality of the Connecticut Statute proscribing the
dissemination of bith control information, Sections 8568 and
8875 of the General Statutes.

        After considerable study and discussion it was
decided that we would proceed immediately when the League had
found suitable persons to act as paries plaintiff. Efforts
were made in this connection by your organization but you
were unable to procure any suitable plaintiff who was willing
to undergo the publicity attendant upon a court action.
Efforts were continued and pending the results we withheld
submission of our statement.

        We have now been informed through the newspapers that
four plaintiffs have brought action in New Haven County, all
for the purpose of testing the constitutionality of birth
control law, from which we that our services are no longer
required. Accordingly, we submit our statement herewith, the
amount has been substantially reduced because of your status
as a non-profit, public welfare organization.

Sincerly yours,

Bruce Manternach

Professor Fowler V. Harper
Yale University Law School
New Haven, Connecticut

Dear Fowler:

Thanks for your letter of June 18th. We shall be most
interested to see the state's briefs and gather they have not yet arrived. And, of course, we continue to stand ready to help with the reply in any way we canst
talk with you. Please let us know if there is anything
further we can do at this time.

So far as the Buxton brief is concerned, may I recapitulate
and to some degree repeat what we have said at various
previous times in conferences and letters. The thrust of
attack in this case, the due process attack, must be grounded
on the arbitrary and irrational impact of the law. This, we
feel, calls first and foremose for a factual presentation, to
establish the medical signifigance of availability of
contraceptive advice for health purposes. If we were doing
it, we would endeavor to make as impressive as possible a
showing on this ground. We would precede this by reference to
Butler v. Michigan, England v. Louisiana State Board,
Consumers Union v. Walker, the federal contraception cases
and others which create an appropriate frame of reference.
Someof these cases are cited in the present brief, but they
aren't argued or developed in such a way as to move the
reader. It is imparitive, in our opinion, to use all possible
case and factual material to prove the arbitrary impact of
this law.

In this connection, we think that you might also be able to
bring in the malpractice point. I attach a copy of a memo on
malpractice which we drafted in connection with the New York
hospital birth control controversy. This material is
adaptable, we think, to the purposes of the Buxton brief on
the following principle: if failure to prescribe bith control
in a proper case could subject a physican to malpractice
charges in a state which does not forbid prescription of
contraception, it is prima facie arbitrary for a state to
forbid such presciption.


                   -2-

Professor Fowler V. Harper            July 6, 1959


We have previously discussed the relevance of the community
standards argument derived from Roth v. United States. This
approach depends, on showing that notwithstanding the
Tileston case, this statute does derive from the obscenity
law. In any event, we think that the community standards
concept can be brought in as one of the bases for the court's
consideration of the factual material- support by medical
opinion, religious groups, etc. The argument could be, in
part, that where the most of society and most medical
specialists concur, the foundation for legislative
prohibition is dubious.


The chief point we urge about the Buxton brief is the need
for development of the argument - factually and case-wise -
and for a full presentation in appropriate places.

As to the ministers' complaints. We went over some of this
when we talked but again I put it down as I remember it:

1. For the reasons we discussed, the inclusion or reference
to specific texts would be helpful. I mentioned the Consumers
Union pamphlet already passed upon by the Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia, the Hines book "Practical Birth
Control Methods" already passed on by the Federal Court of
Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, the Latz book on the "rythm"
method, and the Fishbein and Burgess "Successful Marriage"
which contains a detailed chapter by Dr. Abraham Stone.

2. We believe the distinction between advocacy and action
which you and I discussed should be made clearly. The theory
of freedom to advocate is distinct from the theory of freedom
to act and rests on stronger foundations. We think it would
be desirable to seperate these theories.

The United States Supreme Court last Monday, June 29th, as
you know, made clear the greater latitude allowed to advocacy
than to action, stating in the "Lady Chatterley's Lover"
case: "What New York has done, therefore, is it to prevent
the exhibition of a motion picture advocates an idea - that
adultery under certain circumstances may be proper behavior.
Yet the First Admendment's basic guarantee is of freedom to
advocate ideas. The State, quite simply, has thus struck at
the very heart of constitutionally protected liberty".
Actually, I believe this case may have an important bearing
on both the Buxton, and the patient cases also, and should be
studied with this in mind as well.

3. It would be well to allege that plaintiff has in mind the
counselling of particular parishoners, who stand in specific
need of such advice.

4. For stated reasons, it might be - we think would be -
possible to make more specific the principles of the various
churches vis-a-vis contraception and family planning and it
would be well to emphasize the religious basis of these
principles. Reference should also be made to the Catholic
position in favor of planned parenthood -  its dissent being,
of course, only on the ground of method.

5. We wonder why there is no reference to the Connecticut
conctitution. With kindest regards to you as always.

P.S. I have been in touch on this matter with a lawyer member
of the Executive Comittee of the Planned Parenthood
Federation of America, Inc. namely, Francis A. Goodhue, Jr.,
Esq., a member of a firm of Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer
and Wood and with a former Vice-President of the National
organization, Fifield Workum, Esq., a member of the firm of
Simpson, Thatcher and Bartlett. They are both in accord with
this letter and with the other recommendations we have made.

Dear Bill:

        Mrs. Pilpel sent me a copy of her letter
of June 22 addressed to you and Mrs. Campbell,
with which was enclosed a copy of the letter dated
June 18 from Professor Fowler Harper to Mrs.
Pilpel.
        I can sympathize with Miss Roraback's
desire to be in complete charge of the Connecticut
Legal proceedings. I am also glad to note that Mr.
Harper reports her as welcoming suggestions from
Mrs. Pilpel's office. I would expect this kind of
cooperation to work out well, in the usual manner
that counsel work together when they have clients
with the same interests, to present the very best
possible case.
        A couple of weeks ago, I went over the
Buxton brief and felt that the presentation could
and should  be greatly strengthened in at least
two respects. First, I would place much emphasis
on the acceptance by the medical profession of
birth control for health purposes. The reasons for
this are that I believe that Courts are hesitant
to strike down accepted medical views in
construing a statute, and these views relate to
the due process point. Second, I believe the brief
would be much more persuasive if it explained why
the principles in the Nelson, Tileston and Gardner
cases whould not apply in the Buxton case or
should be overruled.

Dr. William Vogt                        July 8, 1959
        The end of last week, Mr. F.A. Goodhue,
Jr. and I called on Mrs. Pilpel to exchange ideas.
We discussed letters of April 16 to Mr. Harper and
May 14 to Miss Roraback, and the draft of a
further letter to Mr. Harper still be sent. I am
much impressed with the validity of the points she
raised in those letters, which in my opinion would
greatly  strengthened the legal presentation.
I think that the Federation needs prompt advice
from Miss Roraback as to whether these further
points can and will be added in her case; also,
what the status and time schedule are for the
State's brief and the reply brief. It seems to me
that it is unwise to run any risk by failing to
prevent all the possible arguments to the State
Court. If they are not added, I consider that the
Federation may have no choice but to ask the
Court's permission to file and amicus brief,
because the successful outcome of the Connecticut
actions, onced they were commenced, is so
important  to our cause in the rest of this
country and abroad.

Enclosed is a copy of this letter for Mrs.
Campbell. I am sending a copy to Mrs. Pilpel. Mr.
Goodhue has seen a draft.

                        Sincerely yours,

Dear Jack:

        This is in response to yours of April 15th, which I
do not think quite corrctly states my position.

        As I attempted to express to you over the telephone,
I do not think a brief from the CCCL would be a good idea in
the Connecticut proceedings, if it is not filed by
Connecticut counsel on behalf of Connecticut persons. If
filed by non-Connecticutites, it would , in my opinion, have
"at worst...a neutral effect", only if it were filed in
connection and in conjuction with other briefs filed by local
Connecticut grounds.

        On the other hand, I think that such a brief would
have an adverse effect if filed alone, and/or, in conjunction
with those of other national organizations. Thus the problem
raised by the CCCL proposal would not be cured, in my
opinion, by the filing of a brief by the National ACLU.
Rather, it would only compound my reluctance to have a brief
from a national organization such as CCCL, without a local
organization taking such action.

        I know that my feelings in this matter are something
of an enigma to those who have practiced in other
jurisdictions. However, as I tried to express to you over the
telephone, the filing of amicus briefs in the Connecticut
Courts is not a very frequently used procedure, and, may I
say also, the Court does not welcome them generally.

        I would hope that the CCCL would be interested in
participating at the U.S. Supreme Court level, and I do hope
that you can explore that for us. I fully expect that the
case will end there, and not in Connecticut in any event, so
that exploration of this possibility even at this seemingly
premature moment would not be wasted effort.

John de J. Pemberton Jr.     -2-              April 22, 1963

        Since I assume you have discussed this with Harriet
Pilpel, I am sending a copy of this letter to her for her
information.

        Thank you again for all you have done in this regard.

                        Catherine G. Roraback

<h2>Capital Punishment: A Rising Tide</h2>

<b>Introduction</b><BR>
In Utah, convicted child killer John Taylor becomes the nation's first convict in 19 years to be executed by firing squad.<P>

In Delaware, Billy Bailey goes to the gallows in the nation's third hanging since 1965.  Bailey is executed for the shotgun slayings of an elderly couple at their farmhouse in 1979.<P>

The death penalty is on the rise in the United States.<P>

As many as 75 executions are expected nationwide this year, the highest total since the Supreme Court declared capital punishment constitutional in 1976.<P>

The Taylor and Bailey cases, as well as lethal injections in Virginia and Texas, have catapulted the issue of capital punishment to the forefront of the national consciousness.<P>

<b>A Recent History</b><BR>
Prior to the Supreme Court's 1972 decision in Georgia v. Furman, few had challenged the constitutionality of the death penalty.<P>

In Furman, the Court acknowledged that the death penalty had been in use since the inception of the nation. (The earliest recorded execution in the country was in 1622 when Daniel Frank of the Colony of Virginia was put to death for the crime of theft.)  The Court did not rule on the constitutionality of the death penalty but on the manner in which death sentences were being imposed.<P>

The Court ruled on January 29, 1972, that the death penalty as then administered, with trial juries free to sentence to death or life without any standards or guidelines, was "cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments."<P>

In reaction to the Furman ruling, numerous states rewrote death penalty statutes in the belief that the new versions would survive the Court's scrutiny.<P>

In the 1976 case of Georgia v. Gregg, the judges approved a number of capital punishment statutes that had been drafted to meet the new standards. Several months later, on January 17, 1977, Gary Gilmore was executed by a Utah firing squad, becoming the first person executed since 1967.<P>

Since then, more than 300 prisoners have been put to death. While there are some predictable patterns in how the death penalty is used, the fact remains that a low proportion of convicted murderers are sentenced to death.<P>

And nearly every aspect of the death penalty differs from state to state.<P>

Most states favor lethal injection as the manner of execution. Some prescribe electrocution, hanging and even death by firing squad.<P>

In some states, the death penalty can be imposed for several different crimes, while in others it can be imposed only for first-degree murder.<P>

Some states, including Georgia and Texas, allow the jury to have the final say in determining whether someone is sentenced to die. In other states, like Florida, the decision rest with the judge.<P>

The Court TV Law Center hopes this site educates you and sparks debate over this controversial issue.<P>

<H2>Women on Death Row</H2>

Guivevere Garcia was ready to become the second woman to be executed in recent history. Unlike many death inmates, she had given up all appeals and waited to be executed by lethal injection. "This is not a suicide. I am not taking my own life. I committed these crimes. I am responsible for these crimes," she told the Illinois Prisoner Review Board. Garcia, a former prostitute, has been on death row for the 1991 murder of her husband and one-time client. Hours before her scheduled execution on January 17, 1996, Illinois Governor Jim Edgar granted her clemency.)<P>

<H2> Connecticut Supreme Court Leaves No Doubt About the Constitutionality of the Death Penalty</h2><p>

By Paul Frisman<br>
The Connecticut Law Tribune<br>
July 29, 1996 <p>

In a matter-of-fact decision belying the case's significance, the state Supreme Court has voted 4-3 to allow once again the execution of death row inmates in Connecticut.<p>

The decision in State v. Webb, officially released July 30,  represents the first time the seven sitting justices have upheld the constitutionality of the state death penalty. It affirms the death sentence of a state inmate for the first time since such sentences were invalidated as the result of the 1972 U.S. Supreme Court case Furman v. Georgia.<p>

Connecticut has not put a man to death since 1960. At present, six men face the possibility of execution.<p>

The majority opinion, written by Justice David M. Borden, is straightforward and by the book. Borden, joined by Chief Justice Ellen A. Peters and Justices Robert J. Callahan and Richard N. Palmer, finds no natural law barrier to capital punishment; disposes of a catalog of objections to Daniel J. Webb's two-part trial; approves the state's scheme of proportionality review; and finds that Webb's death sentence is in keeping with others meted out in the state.<p>

"There is nothing freakish, arbitrary, wanton or aberrational about the sentence in this case," Borden writes. "The sentence of death . . . therefore, must be affirmed."<p>

The dissents are as passionate as the majority opinion is unemotional. Justices Robert I. Berdon, Joette Katz and Flemming L. Norcott Jr. say the death penalty as it now stands is, in Norcott's words, "infected" with arbitrariness and racism.<p>

"I am confident," writes Berdon, "that eventually both the judicial system and the citizens of this state will reflect back on this day with the same disbelief and sense of outrage that we currently hold in regard to those punishments that were inflicted during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in this state."<p>

<b>Natural Law</b><br>
The court remands Webb to the trial court for the sole purpose of allowing him to challenge the constitutionality of death by lethal injection. The General Assembly changed the method of execution from electrocution to lethal injection in 1995, four years after Webb was convicted of the attempted rape and brutal murder of Connecticut National Bank Vice President Diane Gellenbeck, 37.<p>

Webb, now 33, was charged with abducting Gellenbeck from the bank's parking garage on Aug. 24, 1989, driving her to Hartford's Keney Park and attempting to rape her. When Gellenback broke free, he shot her twice in the back. She then began crawling away, calling for help. Prosecutors said Webb followed her and fired three more shots at her from close range, killing her.<p>

Borden recounts the facts of the case methodically as he rejects almost all of the 30 claims raised by Webb's lawyers, John R. Williams and Norman A. Pattis, of the Law Offices of John R. Williams in New Haven.<p>

Borden says that Webb's constitutional challenge raises several of the same issues the court rejected in State v. Ross (1994) and State v. Breton (1995). In those cases, panels of the justices upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty, but found reversible error in the penalty phase. The full court did not hear those cases because several of the justices disqualified themselves. In this case, the parties waived any potential disqualification of any of the justices.<p>

Borden wastes little time rejecting Webb's theory that natural law and the social compact, as incorporated in Article First, 1 of the state constitution, combines with the due-process provisions of Article First, 8 and 9, to make the death penalty unconstitutional.<p>

Pattis argued at a Dec. 1 en banc hearing that individuals cede some of their natural rights in return for society's protections. But no one, he argued, would voluntarily give up his right to life. "There is a fundamental and inherent right to live that the state cannot abridge," Pattis told the court.<p>

But Borden, referring to earlier decisions in the 1995 decision in Moore v. Ganim, which found no state constitutional right to minimal subsistence, and the 1993 ruling in State v. Joyner, which found that natural law does not require the state to bear the burden of establishing the sanity of a criminal defendant, rejects the theory that "natural law serves as an unwritten source of constitutional rights. . . . Unenumerated rights exist, if at all," he writes, "only if they are grounded in or derived from the constitutional text or Connecticut's unique historical record."<p>

Borden agrees with Pattis that the state constitution must be read "within the context of the times." But he notes that the Legislature's restoration of the death penalty, after the U.S. Supreme Court provided the framework for such laws in Gregg v. Georgia (1976), is evidence that the times may not be going in the direction Webb's lawyers might wish.<p>

<b>Aggravating Factors</b><br>
Most of the lengthy majority opinion concerns dozens of trial-related issues raised by Webb. Borden rejects nearly all of them.<p>

He does agree with Webb's contention that Hartford Superior Court Judge Thomas H. Corrigan erred when he instructed the jury, but finds the error to be harmless.<p>

To impose the death penalty, the jury in Webb had to find the presence of at least one aggravating factor claimed by the state: Either the crime was committed in an "especially heinous, cruel or depraved" manner, or it was committed during the commission or attempted commission of a felony of a kind for which Webb had previously been convicted. Webb had previously been convicted of first-degree sexual assault.<p>

Corrigan, Borden finds, defined "especially cruel" in such a way as to allow the jury to consider mental suffering -- a broader definition than that allowed by the state Supreme Court. "Not only did the instructions improperly fail to incorporate the judicial gloss," Borden writes, ". . . but, arguably, the instructions rendered the statutory language constitutionally vague as well. . . . " evertheless, Borden writes, the error was harmless because the jurors found both aggravating factors to be present in the case, and only one aggravant is needed to impose a death sentence. "We are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the trial court's improper instructions . . . did not affect the jury's deliberations concerning the other alleged aggravant," Borden finds.<p>

Borden also rejects a defense claim that Corrigan failed to give as much weight to mitigating factors as aggravating factors, thereby violating Webb's Eighth Amendment and 14th Amendment federal constitutional rights. Williams and Pattis noted that the Supreme Court itself had so held in similar circumstances in Breton.<p>

Borden acknowledges the Breton rule, which instructs trial courts to provide jury instructions on each mitigant, but rebuffs the defense claim.<p>

"We require this not as a matter of federal constitutional law, but, rather, as a matter of sound judicial policy," he writes. Webb could prevail, he writes, only if the trial court's instructions violated federal constitutional requirements. That was not the case, Borden finds.<p>

Under the law in effect at the time of trial, a jury could not impose the death penalty if it either found no aggravating factors, or any mitigating factor. That law has since been changed to allow juries to weigh aggravating against mitigating factors. Under the new law, if mitigating factors outweigh aggravating factors, the sentence is life without the possibility of release. If aggravants outweigh mitigants, the sentence must be death.<p>

Borden rejects a number of other objections, among them claims of conflict of interest, failure to provide new counsel and improper voir dire.<p>

<b>Proportionality Review</b><br>
Much of the majority opinion concerns the court's conducting of the proportionality review requirement -- the first time the court has actually done so. Proportionality review requires the Supreme Court to affirm a sentence of death unless it finds the sentence is disproportionate to penalties imposed in similar cases "considering both the circumstances of the crime and the character and record of the defendant."<p>

(The General Assembly in 1995 eliminated the Supreme Court's duty to reverse a case if a sentence is disproportionate or excessive. Cases that predate the change in the law are still subject to the law.)<p>

The focus, Borden writes, is not on whether the sentence is proportional to those in similar cases, but on whether it's disproportionate. "The search was not necessarily for a similarity of the case on review to other cases . . . but for a gross disparity. . . . "  The review, he writes, cannot be based on statistics -- there are too few cases for that in any event -- but on comparisons to other cases.<p>

The cases to which Webb must be compared, Borden writes, must be limited to capital felony cases -- the only cases in Connecticut in which the death penalty can be imposed. Borden eliminates from the universe of cases those in which the state did not seek the death penalty and those in which there were no death penalty hearings following conviction.<p>

The universe of similar cases, Borden writes, need not be limited to those in which the crimes charged are identical to Webb's. The court must look at the essential facts, rather than the precise statutory elements.<p>

"In our view similar cases means . . . cases in which the underlying capital felonies were based on conduct . . . that is substantially similar . . . to that of the defendant," he writes. The particular universe for cases similar to Webb, he writes, "consist of those capital felony convictions based upon kidnap-murders, sexual assault, attempted sexual assault or both."<p>

Borden rejects the defense objections to the proportionality review statute, C.G.S. 53a-46b. Among other things, Webb contended that the proportionality review law gave no guidance to the court, leaving it with "little but its intuition" to determine which aspects of a crime or a defendant's character are relevant.<p>

"Although certainly difficult, the process of proportionality review is neither arbitrary nor unprincipled," Borden writes. "We do not rely on our intuition in engaging in the process."<p>

Finally, Borden selects seven cases to compare with Webb's -- four murders of which Michael B. Ross was convicted, and the cases of Sedrick Cobb, Richard Lapointe and Kevin Usry. Ross and Cobb were sentenced to death, Lapointe and Usry to life in prison without the possibility of release.
<p>
Webb's death sentence is not disproportionate to the sentences in those cases, given the aggravating and mitigating factors in each, Borden writes.<p>

<b>Cruel and Unusual</b><br>

In dissent, Berdon, joined by Katz, reiterates the objections to capital punishment he raised in Ross and Breton.<p>

Berdon and Katz say capital punishment violates the state constitution's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment and call for the expansion of the universe of cases used in proportionality review.<p>

Berdon and Katz, joined by Norcott, also say that capital punishment necessarily raises questions of arbitrariness and racism.<p>

Berdon and Katz note that statistics show that black capital felony defendants are convicted twice as often as nonblack defendants, and that the death penalty is less likely to be imposed if the victim is African-American.<p>

"I am greatly concerned that the majority of this court continues to evade the issue of whether racism exists with respect to the death penalty," Berdon writes. Although Webb, who is black, did not raise the issue, Berdon says, "the concern of possible systemic racism is a factor that must be considered when deciding whether the death penalty constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. . . . "<p>

Borden takes umbrage at those remarks, wielding the sharp pen that was so evident in his dissent in Sheff v. O'Neill earlier this month.<p>

". . . The dissent of Justices Berdon and Katz accuses the majority of `continuing to evade the issue of whether racism exists with respect to the death penalty,' " he writes in a footnote. "The accusation is false . . . the issue is not racism; the issue is the proper forum for making a record and presenting such a claim."<p>

Borden says such claims can be raised either through habeas corpus petitions, or under a different section of the proportionality review law, which requires the court to reverse any death sentence that is "the product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor." Norcott, dissenting separately, says he doesn't believe the death penalty per se is unconstitutional, but that it cannot pass constitutional muster as currently applied.<p>

"Our statutory scheme . . . admits of an unacceptable opportunity for arbitrariness and the influence of racial discrimination to operate in the determination of who shall die at the hands of the state," he writes.<p>

Racial prejudice, writes Norcott, the court's only African-American justice, is "the prevalent unresolved and divisive issue in this country."<p>

"The specter of racial discrimination touches every facet of our lives and the statutory scheme for the imposition of the death penalty does not escape its pervasive evil," he writes. "As long as racial prejudice is a factor in our lives . . . there can be no place for a capital penalty in our society."<p>

Defense counsel Pattis, who calls himself an "absolutist" on the death penalty, says he is troubled and disappointed by the court's decision.<p>

"The court's willingness to match an eye for an eye and tooth for tooth is breathtaking," he says. "I cannot comprehend how a court could conclude that people entering into an agreement to be governed would sacrifice their right to live."<p>

Pattis vows to continue the fight in the federal courts. "This struggle is a long way from over," he says. "This office will do everything in its power to prevent the state from killing Daniel Webb."<p>

"It's perhaps appropriate to view [this] litigation as a marathon," he says. We're a long way from tired, and we don't think we've reached the halfway point."<p>

Pattis' opposing counsel, Assistant State's Attorney Timothy J. Sugrue, agrees the battle is not over. Sugrue, who argued Webb before the high court, foresees "years of litigation to follow in federal court."<p>

Other inmates on the state's death row, meanwhile, will have to rework their own appeals to the high court in the wake of Webb, he says. The other state inmates who have been sentenced to death are Ross, Cobb, Robert Breton, Terry Johnson and Richard Reynolds. Ross was convicted and sentenced to death for sexually assaulting and murdering four women in eastern Connecticut; Cobb of sexually assaulting and killing a woman he abducted from a shopping mall parking lot; Breton of killing his ex-wife and son; Johnson of killing state trooper Terry Bagshaw; and Reynolds of killing a Waterbury policeman.<p>

Sugrue says Webb is an "extremely significant decision. . . . This is a significant step toward bringing Webb closer to execution."<p>

The prosecutor says reasonable people can differ about the death penalty -- "you have to respect the dissents," he says, although he disagrees with them -- but he has no doubt about Webb's guilt.<p>

"There's absolutely no doubt that Daniel Webb did these crimes," he says. "No reasonable person could have any doubt that Webb did this."<p>

<h2>Michael Ross Tries for Damage Control</h2>

By Martha J.H. Elliott<br>
Connecticut Law Tribune<br>
July 8, 1996<p>

Convicted serial killer Michael Ross is still determined to stipulate his own execution, and the state is willing to try at least one more time to go along with him. In New London Superior Court on July 2, Ross and Special Assistant State's Attorney  C. Robert Satti Sr. told Judge Joseph J. Purtill that after conferring for over an hour, they had jointly decided to file two motions asking the judge for further guidance in Ross' case. Satti plans to file the motions within the week.<p>

After a four-month trial in 1987, Ross was convicted of six counts of capital felony murder in the deaths of four teen-age girls and given six death sentences. After the statutorily required appeal, the state Supreme Court in July 1994 upheld the convictions, but set aside Ross' death sentences because the trial judge had improperly excluded evidence about Ross' mental condition and improperly instructed the jury.<p>

In September 1994, Ross wrote to prosecutors offering to "go into the courtroom and admit to my actions, to accept responsibility for my actions and to accept the death penalty as punishment for those actions. I am not asking you to do this for me, but for the families involved . . . who, in some small way, might gain a peace of mind by these actions and my execution." He has since explained that he does not wish to put the families through another full-blown trial.<p>

Last November, Ross and Satti signed a stipulation, but reserved seven procedural questions to the state Supreme Court. On June 11, after asking the parties to brief and argue the justiciability of those questions, the court declined to answer the questions and sent the case back to New London. July 2 was the first time that Satti and Ross, who is representing himself, were able to confer on what would be the next step in the matter.<p>

<b>A Single Judge?</b><br>
At the July 2 hearing, Satti told Purtill that the first motion would ask him to determine whether the court, meaning Purtill himself or some other individual judge, has the right to preside over and conduct the sentencing phase of the hearing in the Ross case. Until recently, Satti said, he believed that statute required a three-judge panel to preside over the penalty phase. However, upon further research, Satti now feels that a single judge could hear the case.<p>

According to Satti, it is still both parties' intention to try to conclude the penalty phase by use of a stipulation that acknowledges aggravating factors in Ross' case while stating that there are no mitigating factors. The stipulation would also state that death was the appropriate sentence. Satti also said that Ross plans to object to the presentation of any mitigating evidence by any other party. According to the law under which Ross was sentenced, a death sentence can be imposed only when aggravating factors are present and there are no mitigating factors.<p>

The second motion would ask the judge to rule on whether the defendant has the right to control his case completely. In this case that would mean that Ross would be able to exclude any mitigating evidence presented by other parties.<p>

Contacted on death row after the hearing, Ross says, "I didn't know if Satti would go forward . . . but I've made my bed and I'm responsible. . . . I know I feel a lot better now than I felt a year ago because I feel I'm doing the right thing and it's been hard as hell."<p>

<b>Innocent People</b><br>
During the brief proceeding last week, Purtill seemed hesitant to say whether he himself would be able to preside over the next proceeding because of his heavy schedule as the presiding criminal judge in New London. He also expressed a hesitancy to make any ruling that would tie the hands of a trial judge. "Aren't you asking me to make a decision that the trial judges would normally make?" he asked Satti.<p>

"You may be right," responded Satti. But he also added that pretrial rulings are routinely made in matters of suppressed evidence. "We would like to have the answers because without these answers, Mr. Ross and the state may want to go to a full-blown hearing." Satti said that the problem with this case, which involves new areas of the law -- since Ross is the first to stipulate to his own death -- is that both the state and the defense do not know how to proceed.<p>

Purtill, after determining that Ross agreed on all matters, told Satti to file the motions as quickly as possible and to file briefs by Aug. 7. The parties will return to court on Aug. 14.<p>

Asked whether he is worried that his case will negatively affect other death row appeals, Ross says, "I don't like to think about that, and I hope it never does happen, but the way I look at it, it's my decision, and I have to think about the families. If that happens, it's the fault of capital punishment, not me. There are innocent people on death row." He cites the state of Illinois, where he says seven men have been executed and seven innocent men released from death row. "I would love to challenge the constitutionality of the statute and win, but what I wanted to do was control the damage to my [the victims'] families. That's what I'm doing now. Damage control."<p>

<h2>Post-Conviction Relief Review Now Mandatory In New Jersey Capital Cases</h2><p>

By Michael Booth<br>
New Jersey Law Journal <br>
July 1, 1996 <p>

In a decision that may lead to further delays in carrying out capital sentences, a divided state Supreme Court ruled Friday that post-conviction relief applications in death penalty cases cannot automatically be waived by competent defendants.<p>

Since a defendant facing the death penalty cannot waive a sentencing hearing, a presentation of mitigating evidence or an appeal from sentence, he cannot waive a motion for post-conviction relief either, Justice Daniel O'Hern wrote for a 5-2 majority in State of New Jersey v. John Martini Sr., A-164.<p>

Martini, sentenced to death for kidnapping and murdering Fair Lawn executive Irving Flax in 1989, had sought to withdraw motions filed by his appointed public defender and accept the death penalty. Had the Court granted his request, Martini could have been the first person executed since New Jersey restored the death penalty in 1982.<p>

The Court ruled instead that in future cases involving defendants who wish to die, public defenders are required to pursue post-conviction relief according to a truncated review process. In so holding, the Court sought to ensure the "reliability and integrity" of death sentences, O'Hern wrote.<p>

Justice James Coleman Jr. dissented, saying that he would have upheld Martini's decision to waive the right to file a post- conviction relief petition because Martini was found competent to do so. "It is my belief that ... a competent defendant has the right to decide not to prosecute a post-conviction relief appeal even if it means hastening his or her own death," wrote Coleman, who was joined by Justice Marie Garibaldi.<p>

The majority relied on prior cases that make other procedures mandatory in the imposition of the death sentence: State v. Koedatich, 98 N.J. 553 (1984),  Koedatich II, 112 N.J. 225 (1988) and State v. Hightower, 120 N.J. 378 (1990). The Court rejected requests by defendants that no mitigating evidence be presented, that the defendant be permitted to ask the jury to sentence him to death immediately and that no appeal of a death sentence be pursued.<p>

"[P]ersuasive policy reasons exist for not allowing a defendant in a capital case to execute even a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to present mitigating evidence during the penalty phase," O'Hern wrote, quoting Koedatich II. "These reasons are based substantially on the state's 'interest in a reliable penalty determination.'"<p>

The same logic, he wrote, applies to Martini."Thus, under our law a defendant may not waive a sentencing hearing, may not waive the presentation of mitigating evidence, and may not waive an appeal."<p>

<b>Prosecutors Frustrated</b><br>

As are most death penalty decisions, the Court's opinion was greeted with impassioned though mixed reactions. The public defender's office praised the ruling, while prosecutors rued it. "We are disappointed in the fact that the Court has seen fit to frustrate the efforts of the defendant and prosecutors to mete out a punishment that even the Court says he so richly deserves," says Acting Bergen County Prosecutor Charles Buckley, referring to the Court's two previous rulings in Martini -- 131 N.J. 176 (1993) and 139 N.J. 3 (1994).<p>

Deputy Attorney General Catherine Foddai, who argued the case as amicus before the Court, said she was baffled that the Court raised the issue of reliability and integrity of sentences. "The defendant was found guilty by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, the Supreme Court affirmed the sentence and ruled that proportionality was not an issue," she says. "How much more reliable can it be? It's hard to reconcile that."<p>

<b>Dangerous Precedent?</b><br>

Alan Zegas, a West Orange solo practitioner who was appointed to represent Martini in his effort to abandon the appeals process, says the ruling sets a dangerous precedent. He had argued that the client, not the lawyer, controls the litigation and that if Martini did not wish to proceed with a post-conviction relief application, he should not be forced to do so.<p>

"This is the first court to hold that a competent defendant does not have the right to waive an appeal. And, the Court's opinion is at variance with the death penalty statute in that a proportionality review is available only at the election of the defendant," says Zegas, a vice chairman of the Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey.<p>

But David Ruhnke, who argued the case amicus on behalf of the criminal defense lawyers' group, sees it differently. "The state completely ignores the reality that issues raised in a post- conviction relief petition have never been passed on," he says.<p>

<b>Issues Not Raisable Earlier</b><br>

Indeed, O'Hern noted that there are three issues that Martini could not have raised on the direct appeal of his conviction and sentence: A defense based on certain, previously undisclosed information that Martini only recently passed on to the public defender. The nature of the evidence has not been made public -- even the justices didn't know what it is.<p>

O'Hern cited the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Simmons v. South Carolina, 114 S. Ct. 2187 (1994), that prosecutors cannot "create a false dilemma by advancing generalized arguments regarding the defendant's future dangerousness while, at the same time, preventing the jury from learning that the defendant will never be released on parole." The New Jersey Court had previously ruled that the prosecutor in Martini's case need not have told the jury that Martini would be sentenced to consecutive prison terms for murder and kidnapping and would have died in jail.<p>

<b>The Harris Factor</b><br>

Finally, the Court referred to evidence discovered in another pending New Jersey death penalty case, State v. Joseph Harris, No. 36,962, in which the  Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Sept. 10. A study commissioned by the Administrative Office of the Courts suggests that the state's death penalty may be constitutionally flawed because of evidence suggesting that there is a systemic discrimination against blacks and minorities.<p>

"That demonstrates the bankruptcy of the state's argument," argues Ruhnke, a partner at West Orange's Ruhnke & Barrett. "Those three issues could not have been raised on his appeal."<p>

Garibaldi dismissed the Harris case in her dissent, saying that Martini was well aware that there is evidence that could show the death penalty is unconstitutional, and that he still wants to waive his right to a post-conviction relief hearing.<p>

O'Hern, in his majority opinion, said it is understandable that some may find it difficult to understand why the Court should not simply grant Martini's wish to die.<p>

"For some, no explanation may be necessary. For others, no explanation will suffice. For those who wish to understand, we explain that under our form of government it is not the inmate on death row or the accused who determines when and whether the state shall execute a prisoner; rather, the law itself makes that determination."<p>

<b>Truncated Process</b><br>

The Court acknowledged the public's legitimate interest in seeing criminals like Martini executed. Thus, the majority issued a set of guidelines to be followed in future instances where the defendant does not want to proceed with a post-conviction relief petition. This does not apply to Martini since the majority ruled that no sentence should be carried out until Harris is decided.<p>

First, there shall be only one proceeding. In addition to being allowed to raise the most common appeal issues, defense lawyers also will be allowed to raise issues which normally would be barred, such as newly discovered evidence of innocence, unconstitutionality or illegality of a death sentence. There will also be a requirement of accelerated disposition "in the interest of the public that seeks to know that justice is done."<p>

When counsel learns that the defendant does not want to pursue post-conviction relief claims, the application must be filed within 30 days, and standby counsel will be appointed to represent the defendant. Cases should be assigned to judges who can handle matters on an expedited basis. Additionally, the AOC will be required to provide services so each party can be provided with real-time transcripts.<p>

A trial judge can issue either an oral or written opinion, but must immediately certify to the Supreme Court the transcribed record and copies of all exhibits and briefs. The party that loses at the trial level must file a notice of appeal with the Court within 15 days of the trial judge's ruling. The Court will then issue its ruling within 45 days of the receipt of the notice of appeal and any supplemental briefs, or within 30 days of any oral argument.<p>

Ruhnke says he understands why the Court decided to create a truncated schedule for post-conviction relief petitions in cases like Martini.<p>

"There is sort of a drumbeat out there," he says. "People are saying that these cases are going on too long. The Court certainly is going to recognize that feeling. It's an obvious compromise."<p>

Deputy Public Defender Claudia Van Wyk, who argued on behalf of the public defender's office, says she is realistic about the Court's decision to hasten such hearings, but warns that "anytime you try to speed something up, there is a risk that there will be mistakes made."<p>

She adds that she does understand, however, that the Court also had to weigh the view of the majority of the public that the process goes on too long against the constitutional rights of those facing the death sentence.<p>

Foddai says she is glad to see that the Court, at least, offered that compromise. "It's hard to say whether it will provide any finality on an expedited basis, but it should help these cases to move forward more quickly."<p>

<b>Attorney-Client Privilege</b><br>

When Bergen County Superior Court Judge Bruce Gaeta found last February that the 65-year-old Martini was competent to abandon his post-conviction relief applications, he ruled on the narrow grounds that since Martini had discharged the public defender as his lawyer, that office had no authority to proceed on his behalf.<p>

Zegas argued that the public defender would have to violate attorney-client confidentiality to proceed with the post- conviction relief appeal using the confidential information Martini supplied to his public defenders.<p>

The majority briefly addressed this question, saying that the information will first be heard in camera. Van Wyk said an attorney will be present during that in camera hearing to represent Martini's interests.<p>

Nonetheless, Zegas decried the Court's decision to allow a judge to listen to the information Martini divulged in confidence to the public defender. "The decision sets a horrible precedent for attorney-client privilege," he says. "The decision has the potential to chill attorney-client communication in the future, if the public learns that ... an attorney does not have the obligation to honor promised confidentiality."<p>

<h2>Fine-Tuning The Death Penalty in New Jersey<br>
Victim-Impact Testimony Allowed, But Court Adds Strictures to Law</h2><p>

By Maureen Castellano <br>
New Jersey Law Journal<br>
July 1, 1996<p>

Making families of murder victims parties in capital cases for the first time, the New Jersey Supreme Court on Friday upheld a controversial statute that allows relatives  to testify during the sentencing phase of trials, but subject to a host of newly devised procedural safeguards.<p>

In allowing victim-impact evidence, as mandated under a constitutional amendment enacted last year, the Court avoided a head-to-head battle with the Legislature that might have resulted, in the words of one defense attorney, in a "sure constitutional crisis."<p>

But just as it did in the Megan's Law case last summer, the Court upheld the statute subject to conditions, among them that the victim-impact testimony be limited to one family member, be pre-approved by the trial court, be in writing and not include opinions about the defendant, the crime or the sentence that should be imposed.<p>

The Court split 4-1-2 on Friday's ruling, with the majority deferring to the Legislature and the electorate in upholding the statute. The two dissenters thought the procedural safeguards inadequate to overcome constitutional deficiencies, while another justice -- who concurred in the result -- found procedural problems.<p>

The ruling was lauded as a significant victory by the attorney general's office, the state Prosecutors' Association and victims' rights advocates, who say it will restore the victims' place in a system they contend is obsessed with protecting defendants' rights.<p>

Even defense attorneys voiced guarded praise for the ruling, saying the due process protections mandated by the Court will prevent the introduction of victim-impact statements that are grossly inflammatory or unduly prejudicial.<p>

"I suppose that if we had to get a losing opinion, this is the one to get," says Assistant Deputy Public Defender Stephen Kirsch, who had argued the case before the Court in February on behalf of a Newark man indicted on capital murder charges for the April 1995 death of 8-year-old Jakiyah McClain. State v. Rasheed Muhammad.<p>

"We would have preferred the statute to be stricken as unconstitutional," Kirsch says, "but they did put an awful lot of procedural safeguards in here."<p>

The 42-page decision reversed a trial court's holding last November that the statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3c(6), violated federal and state due process guarantees. Essex County Superior Court Judge Donald Coburn had ruled that the law failed the evidentiary probative-prejudice balancing test and would require "mental gymnastics" by some jurors, who would hear the statements but be asked to disregard them.<p>

The Court's ruling will allow a victim's family to testify during the sentencing phase of a capital trial about the victim's life and the impact of the victim's death on his or her family.<p>

<b>Restrictions Abound</b><br>
Such testimony, however, will be severely limited by the restrictions set forth by the Court. Among them:<p>

* Such testimony may be given only in cases in which the jury finds that the state has proven at least one aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt and in which the jury finds the existence of a mitigating factor pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3c(5)(h), the "catch-all" proviso that allows mitigating factors "relevant to the defendant's character or record or to the circumstances of the offense."<p>

* Only one victim-impact witness can be called, and that witness must be an adult. No minors shall be allowed to testify unless there is no adult survivor.<p>

* The family member's testimony must be in writing and must be pre-approved by the trial judge. The family member must stick to the statement and not introduce additional testimony.<p>

* The impact statement may not include any testimony regarding the family member's opinions about the defendant, the crime or the appropriate sentence.<p>

* A Rule 104 (formerly Rule 8) hearing must be conducted outside the presence of the jury before any statement may be made. The trial judge must use the hearing to make a preliminary determination as to the admissibility of the statement.<p>

* The state must notify the defendant before the penalty phase that the state plans to introduce a victim-impact statement if the defendant asserts the catch-all provision. The state also must provide the name of any witness who may be called so the defendant can interview that witness prior to the testimony being given.<p>

<b>Reluctant Change in Stance</b><br>
In upholding the constitutionality of the statute, the Court backtracked on its longstanding position rejecting the use of victim-impact statements in capital cases.<p>

But that stance clearly was changed with reluctance, and only then, as is obvious from Justice Marie Garibaldi's majority opinion, because of the constitutional amendment enacted last year.<p>

"To hold the victim-impact statute unconstitutional would require us to ignore the Victim's Rights Amendment and the will of the electorate that overwhelmingly approved the constitutional amendment," Garibaldi wrote.<p>

She added: "In the absence of the Victim's Rights Amendment, we might have continued to hold that victim-impact evidence should not be admitted during the sentencing phase of a capital case. However, the electorate ... and the Legislature ... have mandated that victim-impact evidence be admitted."<p>

Garibaldi also noted that the U.S. Supreme Court had cleared the way for the use of victim-impact statements in capital trials. In its 1991 decision in Payne v. Tennessee (1991), the Court overruled its prior rulings and held that the Eighth Amendment of the federal Constitution does not bar a capital sentencing jury from receiving victim-impact evidence.<p>

Still, the Court obviously was leery of any decision to allow such testimony. Garibaldi flatly wrote that the Court "may have drafted the victim-impact statute differently" if it had its druthers. But she notes that the Court has no license to rewrite the statute.<p>

Justices Stewart Pollock and James Coleman Jr., and Chief Justice Robert Wilentz, joined in Garibaldi's opinion upholding the statute's constitutionality.<p>

But in a concurring opinion, Wilentz nevertheless expressed his "misgivings" about allowing victim-impact testimony in capital trials. In his opinion, just three pages long, Wilentz put forth his view that such evidence "has no place in a rationally conducted sentencing proceeding."<p>

"It is a throwback, at least potentially, to the days when the death penalty could be imposed arbitrarily, without reason, much like being struck by lightning," Wilentz wrote. The chief justice, however, said he could not find the statute unconstitutional.<p>

In a separate opinion, Justice Daniel O'Hern concurred that the statute was not unconstitutional. But he said he believes that the use of victim-impact evidence should not be limited to cases in which a defendant has pleaded the catch-all mitigating factor.<p>

He further wrote that victim-impact statements may encumber a defendant's right to present mitigating evidence to the jury, forcing defense attorneys to "shoehorn" mitigating evidence previously introduced under the catch-all factor into one of the other mitigating factors allowed under the statute, where it doesn't belong.<p>

<b>Dissents Find Safeguards Inadequate</b><br>
Justices Alan Handler and Gary Stein filed separate dissenting opinions in the case, stating that the statute as written, even with the procedural safeguards mandated by the Court, is unconstitutional.<p>

Handler's key concerns were that the statute will create a procedural nightmare, as envisioned by the trial court, and will create an unacceptable risk that the death penalty will be imposed in an "invidious and discriminatory" manner.<p>

Stein's dissent focused on issues that were raised in the arguments before the Court, but sidestepped in the majority's ruling. Stein wrote that allowing victim-impact evidence would be to invite the jury to compare the value of victim's life and the defendant's life, in an analysis that could predicate the verdict on the relative worth of the victim.<p>

Public Defender Kirsch, who calls the Court's vote count "interesting," says he believes the statute almost didn't make it past the Court's review. Says Kirsch, "The fourth vote in the case was the chief justice's and he obviously didn't go along with it very willingly."<p>

Amicus attorney Jean Barrett, who argued the case on behalf of the Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey, contends that Wilentz likely voted to uphold the statute's constitutionality to avoid an ugly battle with the state Legislature -- and to ensure that the Court had a say in how the statute was implemented.<p>

"If they [the justices] had overturned this, it would have created a constitutional crisis," says Barrett, of West Orange's Ruhnke & Barrett. "There would have been an enormous battle," she says. And, she says it's a battle the Court likely would have lost, given "the tenor of the times" and the overwhelming public support for establishing more rights for victims.<p>

"Practically," Barrett says, "the only way for the Court to control the use of this evidence was to create procedural safeguards to govern its use. They couldn't have done that if there was a constitutional battle and they lost."<p>

All that isn't to say that Barrett was happy about the Court's ruling, which she calls "ludicrous and contradictory." Says Barrett of the victim-impact statement statute: "The whole thing completely undermines the fairness of death penalty litigation."<p>

She says that while the procedural safeguards put in place will "take the sting out of the emotional content of these statements," defendants will still be unfairly prejudiced by victim-impact evidence.<p>

<b>Victim Valuation</b><br>
Both Barrett and Kirsch also argue that the Court ignored, perhaps intentionally, their arguments that allowing any victim-impact evidence at all invites juries to value one victim over another.<p>

"It still makes the killing of certain victims more important than the killing of others," says Kirsch.<p>

That argument is expected to become an issue in one of the first trials in which victim-impact evidence will likely play a key role.<p>

Mercer County prosecutors had been waiting for this ruling before pressing on to a trial for Jesse Timmendequas, the convicted sex offender facing a capital murder charges in the death of 7-year-old Megan Kanka of Hamilton Township, for whom "Megan's Law" was named.<p>

The proceedings involving Timmendequas, before Judge Andrew Smithson, had been stayed pending the outcome of the Muhammad case, according to First Assistant Mercer County Prosecutor Kathryn Flicker. "That was the main thing holding us up," she says.<p>

Flicker says of the Court's decision: "It will allow a member of [Megan's] family -- probably Maureen Kanka, [Megan's mother] -- to talk about the impact of Megan's death."<p>

Both Kirsch and Barrett say that this ruling will not end the litigation over victim-impact evidence -- far from it. "Even with the safeguards," says Kirsch, "we're going to be challenging it [the statute] to some degree. I'm sure there will still be a lot of issues raised as we proceed with these cases."<p>

Prosecutors says such predictions probably won't prove true. Deputy Attorney General Catherine Foddai, whose arguments the Court appeared wholeheartedly to adopt, contends that both the statute and the Court's ruling will allow victim-impact statements to be used only "in a very limited way."<p>

"I think the Legislature and the Court have been very, very careful to preserve the defendants' rights," Foddai says. "Those safeguards will remove any possibility that the statements [made by family members] will be unduly prejudicial."<p>

Foddai says the Rule 104 hearings will prove crucial in ensuring that victims be heard without prejudicing the jury. "You're going to have a dry run," Foddai says. "At the Rule 104 hearings, the person [giving the statement] will go over their testimony and the judge will have an opportunity to approve it. That should eliminate any problems."<p>

Assistant Essex County Prosecutor John Redden, who is handling the prosecution of 29-year-old Rasheed Muhammad in the McClain murder case, calls the ruling "a significant victory for victims and prosecutors -- and for the system, given that juries will for the first time hear evidence about the uniqueness of each victim."<p>

He, like Foddai, says any concerns raised in the introduction of victim-impact testimony can be addressed by the trial judge in issuing the jury charge.<p>

In the majority ruling, Garibaldi says the Court -- recognizing that jury instructions in these cases will be "more complex" -- has requested that its Trial Judges Committee on Capital Causes draft "appropriate instructions" consistent with the Court's opinion here.<p>

Both Barrett and Kirsch say they don't believe there is any way to draft a jury charge that will prove sufficient in addressing these issues. Says Barrett: "I feel sorry for the trial judges who have to implement this."<p>

<h2>California Plans to Boost Death Row Payroll</h2><p>

By Bill Ainsworth<br>
The Recorder<br>
June 28, 1996<p>


SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Pete Wilson, the most vocal champion of California's tough-on-crime crusade, has proposed dramatically increasing the numbers and pay of attorneys who defend death row inmates. <p>

Wilson, at a news conference on Thursday, announced a plan that would add more than 100 public defenders to the state's payroll in the next two years; create a separate office of Post-Conviction Counsel to handle federal and state appeals; and raise the pay of private counsel handling death row cases from $95 to $125 an hour, the amount paid in California's federal courts.<p>

At the news conference, Wilson found no irony in supporting a $23 million proposal that could be viewed as the Full Employment Act for criminal defense attorneys. "It's essential to make the system work," he said.<p>

The governor's aim is to speed up executions of convicted murderers by eliminating the backlog of 128 death row inmates who have no attorneys. <p>

California has sentenced 514 people to death since restoring capital punishment in 1978, but only four of those people have been executed.<p>

"We're taking another step toward the day when old age will no longer be the leading cause of death among inmates on death row," Wilson said.<p>

The plan is also aimed at qualifying California for the new federal habeas corpus deadlines. Those deadlines were set aside earlier this month by a Northern District judge, partly because the state has such a large number of unrepresented death row prisoners.<p>

Wilson counsel Daniel Kolkey designed the proposal after meeting for the past six months with lawmakers, Attorney General Dan Lungren, State Public Defender Fern Laethem, Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Arthur Alarcon and McGeorge School of Law professor J. Clark Kelso. "We tried to develop a workable solution to an intractable problem," said Kolkey.
<p>
Assemblyman Kevin Murray, a Los Angeles Democrat, said the proposal should appeal to conservatives and liberals. "Whether you are pro death penalty or against the death penalty, you want the system to work," he said.
<p>
Murray will sponsor legislation that expands the 39 -attorney state public defender's office by adding five new lawyers in fiscal 1996-1997 and 32 more the next year. The office would be responsible for eliminating one-third of the backlog by taking on 43 more cases during the next two years.
<p>
Under the plan, lawyers in the office would eventually specialize in direct state appeals. Currently, state public defenders handle both habeas  petitions and direct appeals.
<p>
Under the Wilson plan, both state and federal habeas cases would be handled by attorneys in the Office of Post -Conviction Counsel. The Department of Finance estimates that within three fiscal years the office would employ 100 attorneys.<p>

But legislation creating the office, sponsored by Democratic Sen. Charles Calderon of Montebello, is designed to allow "maximum flexibility and creativity in managing the office," said Kolkey.<p>

As a result, the director of the new office could hire private attorneys or contract with nonprofit groups to handle the work. <p>

Federal habeas appointments are handled by federal courts, and there is no guarantee that judges will appoint attorneys in the new office. But Kolkey said he expects attorneys in the new office to secure many federal appointments because they would already have handled the state habeas petition.<p>

The third part of the Wilson program would speed up the certification of the record in capital cases. Under legislation carried by Republican Assemblyman William Morrow of San Juan Capistrano, trial counsel would be required to certify the record as complete within 90 days of the imposition of the death penalty. The judge would then have to certify the record as accurate within 90 days of the appointment of appellate counsel.
<p>

Currently, certification of the record can take up to five years after a trial is completed.<p>

<b>Private or Public</b><br>

Wesley Van Winkle, vice president of California Appellate Defense Counsel Inc., welcomed the proposed increase in pay for private attorneys. "By finally increasing compensation of appointed counsel to something approaching the market rate, they are going to wipe out the backlog in the next few years," he said.<p>

At the news conference, Wilson said the plan's overall aim is to reduce the role of private counsel in death penalty cases. But Van Winkle said that's unlikely to happen because "ultimately, the state is going to see that private counsel is more efficient" than public attorneys.<p>

Van Winkle said private attorneys handle cases more cheaply because they work more efficiently and do not have as many bureaucratic restrictions. A legislative analyst's study confirmed this view by finding that private death penalty cases cost $75,000 a year, while cases handled by state attorneys cost $205,000.<p>

Michael Millman, executive director of the California Appellate Project, said he supports the concept of two institutional defenders -- one for direct appeal and one for habeas corpus.<p>

Millman, however, has not discussed the proposal with the Wilson administration. "Any system that is adopted should include the continued participation of the private bar," he wrote in a statement.<p>

Kolkey said the Wilson administration opted to expand the public role in death penalty litigation because the private sector was not doing a good job. "We just can't attract enough private counsel to handle these cases," he said.

<h2>California Death Sentence Reversed Due to Incompetence </h2><p>

By Dan Goodin <br>
The Recorder<br>
June 28, 1996<p>

For the first time in 2 1/2 years, the California Supreme Court has reversed both the conviction and death sentence in a capital murder case. <p>

The state high court on Thursday overturned a Fresno man's 1982 death judgment in In re Jones on Habeas Corpus, S016628, ruling that Troy Lee Jones' trial attorney failed to provide effective assistance of counsel. <p>

Jones is the first death penalty case decided by the court under Chief Justice Ronald George, who succeeded Malcolm Lucas on May 1. <p>

"We conclude that defense counsel's performance before and during the guilt phase of the trial was marked by numerous deficiencies," George wrote for a unanimous court, "and that the cumulative impact of counsel's shortcomings at that phase of the proceedings was prejudicial with regard to the judgment of guilt." <p>

The opinion is significant because the state Supreme Court grants so few reversals in capital cases. Under former Chief Justice Lucas, the court affirmed about 90 percent of the death sentences it reviewed, according to J. Clark Kelso, a professor at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento. <p>

But Kelso warned against drawing too many inferences from such a rare reversal shortly after George has come on board, calling it "coincidental timing." <p>

"I don't think you can read very much into this case," Kelso said. "The court did what it had to do under federal constitutional principles. [Defense] counsel in the case simply was poorly prepared and didn't know the facts."  <p>

The ruling entitles Jones, 45, to a new trial for the December 1981 killing of his girlfriend, Carolyn Grayson. Her body, with six bullet wounds, was found in a field near the Merced County community of Los Banos. There were no eyewitnesses, and the murder weapon was never found. <p>

Prosecutors claimed Jones killed Grayson to keep her from revealing his role in a murder 11 months earlier; he was never charged for that murder. A neighbor testified she saw Jones beat Grayson with a tire iron a few weeks before her death and heard Grayson scream that she wouldn't say anything. <p>

"Although . . . there was evidence suggesting [Jones'] guilt, this evidence was not overwhelming and there also was evidence that other members of [Jones'] family had attempted to kill Grayson," George wrote. He cited evidence that Jones' mother and sister had tried to poison Grayson and that Jones' wife had also discussed murder over Jones' objections. <p>

Pointing to such circumstances, George said, the failings of Jones' trial lawyer, Hugh Wesley Goodwin, were "sufficiently significant to undermine our confidence" in the verdict. <p>

Attempts to locate Goodwin for comment were unsuccessful. <p>

Goodwin, a veteran criminal defense lawyer, was appointed to a Fresno Municipal Court seat by Gov. Jerry Brown in 1976 and was defeated in the 1978 election. In his brief judicial career, he attacked the constitutional separation of church and state, ordered defendants to attend church as a condition of probation, and called the Commission on Judicial Performance an "instrument of Satan" after it criticized him. <p>

Two Fresno County defendants represented by Goodwin, Wilbur Jennings and Douglas Stankewitz, were also sentenced to death in separate cases and are appealing in federal court. Stankewitz's lawyer, Robert Bryan, said Goodwin's performance is a central issue in the appeal.<p>

In Jones' case, the court said Goodwin did not hire an investigator and did little preparation apart from talking with Jones for three or four hours. Goodwin then elicited testimony from Grayson's 8-year-old daughter that her mother had said Jones committed the earlier murder. He also put Jones' mother -in-law on the stand, and she promptly testified that Jones had once shot her. <p>

Merced Superior Court Judge William Ivey, who conducted an evidentiary hearing into the matter on the Supreme Court's behalf, described Jones as a "horribly tried case." <p>

The Supreme Court agreed. "Taking into account the nature and extent of defense counsel's inadequate performance, and the evidentiary weaknesses in the prosecution's case . . . there exists a reasonable probability that the outcome of the guilt phase would have been different but for the cumulative impact of defense counsel's numerous failings," George wrote. <p>

Law professor Kelso said of the court's few reversals, most involved habeas claims. In habeas cases, Kelso said, "the court doesn't really have any leeway" because it is bound by federal constitutional principals.<p>

Still, he said the ruling was "unusual because this is not just a reversal at the penalty phase, but at the guilt phase as well." <p>

It will take several years to determine if the Supreme Court under George is taking a more liberal stance on capital cases, Kelso said. <p>

<h2>Warrants For Death</h2><P>


By Thomas Scheffey<br>
The Connecticut Law Tribune<br>
June 17, 1996<p>

The death penalty is so unusual in Connecticut, and in the entire New England region, that it must be re-examined for its constitutionality as we head into the 21st century.<p>

That argument is being asserted by Haiman Long Clein, the former Old Saybrook lawyer who now faces trial, and possibly death, on charges of hiring a hitman to kill Anson "Buzz'' Clinton III of East Lyme two years ago.<p>

Probable cause to prosecute Clein was found April 2, when he waived his right to proceed after three days of testimony, just before testimony of alleged co-conspirators was about to be rendered admissible.<p>

In pretrial defense motions filed May 6, Clein contends that the Connecticut Supreme Court has not examined the death penalty as cruel and unusual punishment since 1969, in State v. Davis. (The brief does not cite State v. Ross, in which the court upheld the death penalty's constitutionality, in this context.) Listing the five Connecticut prisoners who have been consigned to death row -- not counting Michael Ross, whose death sentence was overturned in 1994 -- a pretrial defense brief for Clein declares, "These are the only five persons under sentence of death in the seven state region of New England and New York state." In light of the fact that no one has been executed by this state in more than 30 years, "It is now appropriate and, arguably, constitutionally required that the court's ruling be re-examined in the light of contemporary circumstances and the advent of the 21st century."<p>

<b>For the Defense</b><br>
Clein's lawyer, Robert M. Axelrod, is a Florida transplant who maintains law offices in Meriden. Axelrod also gave state prosecutors notice that Clein may claim a mental disease or defect defense. There have already been hints of a drug habit. In late March, during the probable-cause hearing, staff in Clein's former New London and Old Saybrook law offices testified that on several occasions, Clein appeared to be buying cocaine in $1,000 quantities from a longtime client, inside his Old Saybrook law office.<p>

This alleged drug-dealing client and friend, Mark Despres of Deep River, is also the alleged hitman charged with shooting Clinton on March 10, 1994. Despres' Bridgeport-based defense lawyer, Michael A. Fitzpatrick, argued against the unsealing of the state's arrest and search warrants in the case, in an action brought by The Day of New London. The motion to open the file was prepared for The Day by Thomas W. Boyce Jr., of New London's Faulkner & Boyce, and New London Superior Court Judge Joseph J. Purtill ordered the unsealing on May 17.<p>

Both Clein and Despres are incarcerated awaiting trial, and a third man charged with the identical murder-for-hire, murder and conspiracy counts, Joseph Fremut, has been free on bond since last Dec. 27.<p>

Axelrod, in an interview last week, added the additional contention that murder-for-hire should not bear a harsher penalty than if the contractor had simply done the deed himself.<p>

"If you go out and murder your wife," posits Axelrod, "you are not subject to the death penalty, but if you lack the courage, or for some other reason pay someone to commit murder, you do face the death penalty, even though in effect you are doing less than the murderer who pulls the trigger."<p>

<b>Fighting Death</b><br>
Both Axelrod and Fitzpatrick filed motions in May to prevent prosecutors from asking prospective jurors questions that would create a pro-capital punishment "death qualified" jury. They also requested disclosure of the "aggravating factors" -- the formula of criteria that add up to a death penalty -- the prosecution is planning to prove. o trial dates have been scheduled, but Fitzpatrick, a Bridgeport solo, says he cannot be ready until fall at the earliest. New London State's Attorney Kevin T. Kane says neither Clein's nor Despres' trials are yet scheduled. Fremut, according to defense lawyers working on the case, may well avoid prosecution on any serious charges.<p>

Although much of the state's case was presented in the three days of the probable-cause hearing, in which nearly two dozen witnesses testified, the highly detailed arrest and search warrant affidavits -- whose contents are vigorously contested by defense counsel -- shed new light on the complex case. Clein, who fled arrest last Dec. 15, was a fugitive in a 52-day escape attempt that ended Feb. 5 in Sunset Beach, Calif., when he was nabbed by FBI agents.<p>

<b>Cathy's Call</b><br>

The crime at first had no leads at all. When police found Clinton's body near his 1981 Firebird at the Rocky Neck connector in East Lyme, they had no suspects or motives, and few clues. But two-and-a-half months later, according to the affidavit by a state police detective supporting Clein's arrest warrant, the police got a tip from a woman who identified herself as Cathy White. White said she knew who did the killing. She explained that she is the girlfriend of Joseph Fremut, who is a part owner of a Texaco gas station in Deep River.<p>

On May 25, 1994, White broke the news to State Police Detective John Turner, according to Turner's detailed 14-page affidavit supporting Clein's arrest warrant of Dec. 13, 1995:<p>

"Ms. White stated that while at Joe Fremut's Texaco Station, on or about the last week of February 1994, she overheard Fremut and Despres talking about how Despres was following a guy around but Despres never had the opportune moment `to do him' because someone was always around."<p>

According to the affidavit, White told the detective that the day after Clinton was killed, Despres came to the station and talked with Fremut about a planned trip to Florida, but Despres said he couldn't leave yet because he hadn't received his money.<p>

Later, when they were alone, Fremut explained to White that Despres had "gone through with it," luring Clinton to a deserted highway on the pretext of buying an old tow truck Clinton was selling for $3,000, Turner writes. (Despres' son, Christopher, testified in the probable-cause hearing that his father brought him along during the murder, and that he was present when his father allegedly fired six shots from a .38 revolver at Clinton's torso. As car lights approached on the deserted road, Despres got back in the car, drove over the body and they sped away, Christopher testified. He's 17 now, but was 15 at the time of Clinton's killing.)<p>

Shortly after Clinton's death, Fremut told White that Despres complained he was having trouble sleeping, but his son was sleeping fine, according to the Turner affidavit.<p>

The day after White contacted Turner, state police seized eight rifles, three shotguns, a derringer and two 9 mm Taurus handguns from the Deep River home Despres shared with Esther Lockwood, his mother, according to a search warrant executed that day.<p>

On June 2, 1994, Fremut's Texaco was searched, and police recovered live ammunition at the bottom of a dumpster that exactly matched the bullets "removed from the body of the victim," according to Turner's affidavit in that search.<p>

But from June 1994 to the summer of 1995, Despres disappeared to Florida. For a year and a half the investigation was nearly invisible, as detectives gathered phone records and interviewed witnesses on the periphery of the case.<p>

<b>High Tension</b><br>


On Oct. 29, 1995, the police finally obtained arrest warrants for Fremut and Despres, on capital felony murder, conspiracy to commit capital felony murder and murder. Fremut was arrested at home without incident. Despres made a bigger splash. He was located by police, and filmed by a TV crew at the home of his girlfriend, Jocelyn Johnson, where he was pulled from the trunk of her car. She was arrested for hindering prosecution.<p>

Turner's affidavit in Clein's arrest warrant recounts statements from Cathy White, Joseph Fremut, Mark Despres, Chris Despres and Jocelyn Johnson:<p>

After his arrest, Fremut was interviewed in custody in the presence of his attorney, F. Mac Buckley, a prominent Hartford defense specialist. Fremut said Despres approached him "back in January or February of 1994 and told him that he had a contract to kill Buzz Clinton who was a man that was molesting his kids," Turner states. "Despres told Fremut that the father-in-law of the victim set the murder up through Mark's attorney who Fremut knew to be Haiman Clein of Old Saybrook."<p>

Clinton was married to Kimberly Carpenter Clinton, whose sister, Beth Carpenter, was an associate in Clein's New London satellite office. The firm's bookkeeper and others testified at the probable-cause hearing in March that Clein, who is married and has five children, made no secret of his romantic, obsessive involvement with Beth Carpenter. Carpenter, in turn, seemed protective, to the point of obsession, of her young niece, Kim's daughter by another man. Witnesses at the March probable-cause hearing testified that Beth Carpenter repeatedly expressed her hatred and fear of Clinton, and attempted to wrest legal custody of her niece from her sister and Clinton. either Beth Carpenter nor her father, Richard Carpenter, has been charged or implicated in any way in the criminal proceedings. Carpenter, according to her lawyer, criminal-defense specialist Hugh F. Keefe, of New Haven's Lynch, Traub, Keefe and Errante, is currently in London.<p>

In the presence of his public defender lawyers, Bruce A. Sturman and James McKay, Despres testified in custody on Dec. 8, 1995, according to Turner. Turner's affidavit recounts Despres stating that in early 1994, "he was approached by Haiman Clein, who is a friend and also his personal attorney. Mr. Clein stated to Despres that he wanted Anson Clinton killed because Anson was molesting a little girl and the courts were not doing their job. Despres stated he did not know Clinton and all the initial information about Clinton was learned from Clein."<p>

Despres turned to Fremut for help in the murder, Turner states, because Despres "did not know how to do it." During the probable-cause hearing, Despres' son Chris testified that his father had gone out searching for Clinton about 10 times. Johnson, Despres' girlfriend, recounted in the probable-cause hearing that one night Despres, dressed in camouflage, came to her house for help in getting directions to Clinton's residence. And in the Clein arrest affidavit, Turner states that Fremut told of going with Despres to the convalescent home in Essex where Clinton worked as a nurse to locate his wrecker and "learn his routine in order to find the opportune time to kill him."<p>

By this time, according to Turner's affidavit, the pressure was increasing: Fremut said Despres told him his "lawyer had called and told that he had to do the murder right away and the lawyer did not care if the family found the body or not."<p>

Recounting more of Fremut's testimony, Turner says that on the night of the killing, March 10, 1994, Despres and his son came to Fremut's apartment in Ivoryton and described in detail what had happened. Fremut and White left for Florida two days after the murder. About a week after Fremut returned, Turner writes, Fremut met with Despres, who reported "he got paid down at his lawyer's office and his lawyer told him that `this kind of makes us brothers.' "<p>

Despres told detectives, according to Turner, that he supplied cocaine and marijuana to Clein at one time, but stopped after the murder to avoid suspicion. Despres said his lawyer told him that if he got arrested not to say a word, and that Clein would bail him out, and get him cash and a passport to get out of the country, Turner recounts.   <p>

<b>Jocelyn's Account</b><br>

It didn't work that easily, according to the written statement Turner says he got from Jocelyn Johnson, Despres' girlfriend. She said Despres told her Clein approached him in January or February 1994, to kill Clinton for $3,000. Clein described Clinton as "someone who was sexually abusing a child," according to Turner's affidavit.<p>

"Ms. Johnson stated that Clein told Mark Despres that the court system was not going to resolve the issue so Haiman was going to take care of the matter himself."<p>

Two or three days after Clinton was murdered, Despres and Johnson went to Foxwoods Casino, where Johnson said Despres told her he'd been paid $1,800 by Haiman Clein that afternoon for the murder, says the Turner affidavit. Despres was worried the bills were marked, and cashed them in for chips. Later, when Despres was in Florida, Johnson recounted that "Haiman was sending money to him in order for Mark to survive," according to Turner.<p>

In Despres' statement, Turner recounts, Despres said he accompanied Clein to the Bank of Southeastern Connecticut in Waterford, and that Clein emerged and gave Despres $3,500 in $100 bills. Later, the arrest affidavit states, after Despres left Connecticut, "Clein would Federal Express between $200 to $800 every two weeks," to Despres in Florida, and Despres stated that, beginning in early 1994, Clein overall paid him between $15,000 and $18,000.<p>

On Dec. 12, 1995, state police executed a search warrant on the Bank of Southeastern Connecticut, and discovered records that showed that on March 15, 1994, five days after the murder, Clein presented a check made out to himself for $3,500, on his lawyer's trust account, according to the affidavit of state police Detective John Szamocki. Two days after the bank search, Szamocki requested a search warrant for Clein's Old Saybrook office, to locate, among other things, records of disbursements from Clein's lawyer's trust account. According to the probable-cause hearing testimony of two secretaries who were present when the police came to the law office Dec. 15, Clein phoned in while the search was in progress. Shortly thereafter, Clein became a fugitive.<p>

<b>Phantom Witness</b><br>

Axelrod, Clein's defense lawyer, says that the statements in the arrest warrant affidavit "are completely uncorroborated." He emphasizes how much of the state's information comes from Catherine White, who has never appeared as a court witness. She has also not appeared on any witness lists supplied to the defense, and is not expected to be called at trial. "If she's the backbone of the state's case, that says a lot about the case," comments Axelrod.<p>

Axelrod is not the only lawyer who questions the truth of the contents of the affidavit. "A great deal of what is said in there by White about Fremut is now known to be incorrect," says Fremut's lawyer, Buckley. "And [White] has since claimed to me that a lot of what she said was not true."<p>

White could not be located for comment.<p>

Keefe, representing both Beth Carpenter and her father, Richard, disputes the allegation in the affidavit that Richard originally called for the Clinton murder. "Obviously, this is double or triple hearsay," says Keefe. "It's not true and it's not believed by the state," since no charges have been brought against Richard Carpenter.<p>

"We're not going to comment on any part of the investigation, including what we believe or don't believe," says lead prosecutor Paul E. Murray, supervisory assistant state's attorney. "You can draw your own conclusions."<p>

Despres' lawyer, Fitzpatrick, also questions the strength of the state's case. "Proving a murder is one thing, proving a murder-for-hire is another," he says. "There are many elements to prove in a murder-for-hire. In this case, it's by no means a dead-bang winner for the state."<p>

Dee Clinton, the mother of the murder victim, said last week she expected more talk, in court and out, that would cast her son in a bad light. But she was crystal clear in her insistence that her son never hurt his wife or her daughter. "He wasn't perfect. But he was, in his heart, a gentle soul," she says. She calls the allegations "vicious lies," adding that, "A hearse doesn't have a luggage rack. All that you take with you when you go is your integrity and good name."<p>

Clinton says that she has been able to come to terms with her son's murder on many levels, but that one fact still haunts her: "The most horrific thing about this is how many people knew this was going to happen, how many people had heard -- and did nothing."<p>

<h2>Commentary:  Jamal's Last Stand: Infamous Murder Case May Be Significant Test of New Habeas Statute</h2><p>

By Stuart Taylor Jr.<br>
June 11, 1996<p>

When death row defense lawyers present "new evidence" to support claims of innocence as long as 14 years after the defendant's conviction -- as those representing Pennsylvania death row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal did May 22 -- people are understandably skeptical.<p>

Such claims are often little more than desperate, last -ditch ploys by lawyers running out of delaying tactics. Impatience with such stalling helped prompt Congress and President Clinton to enact strict new limits on federal habeas corpus appeals in April.<p>

But the fact is that due to the peculiar dynamics of our criminal process -- and especially the woefully inadequate representation most capital defendants receive at trial -- evidence casting real doubt on the fairness of murder convictions and death sentences regularly emerges many years later.<p>

As the Supreme Court begins to grapple with the ambiguities in the new habeas statute, the Jamal case stands as an example of the need for federal courts to remain open to new evidence, even after seemingly intolerable delays in carrying out the sentence of a defendant who was convicted in 1982 of murdering a police officer in cold blood.<p>

Jamal's case has been much publicized for reasons that have no direct bearing on his guilt or innocence: He is a self -proclaimed black "revolutionary," and an extraordinarily articulate and talented journalist. Those traits have won him a big following in leftist, Hollywood, and European intellectual circles.<p>

Inconveniently for Jamal's admirers, the evidence that he probably killed police officer Daniel Faulkner remains strong: It is undisputed that he was found 4 feet from the dead officer a minute after the killing, with his empty revolver nearby and a bullet from Faulkner's gun in his torso. In addition, while claiming to be "innocent," Jamal has never said that he did not shoot Faulkner or specified who did.<p>

But new evidence, mostly dug up since 1993 by Jamal's first good lawyers, raises at least a tiny doubt as to whether it was he who killed Faulkner, strongly suggests that if he did, it was closer to manslaughter than to cold-blooded murder, and shows clearly that he received an unfair trial, tainted by grossly inadequate defense lawyering, flagrantly biased judging and, in all probability, police fabrication of evidence and intimidation of witnesses.<p>

<b>Timely, Tantalizing Testimony</b><br>

The latest piece of new evidence is a May 21 affidavit by Veronica Jones, belatedly bolstering both Jamal's trial defense that the killer got away and his current claims that the police intimidated witnesses.<p>

Jones was plying her wares as a prostitute in a seedy part of Philadelphia at 4 a.m. on Dec. 9, 1981, the morning of Faulkner's death. She told police a few days later that she had seen two men hurrying from the scene of the shooting (which she had heard but not seen) before the police arrived and arrested Jamal. But when called as a defense witness at trial, Jones unexpectedly repudiated her police report and supported the prosecution claim that nobody had left the scene.<p>

This, Jones now swears, was perjury, suborned by police. Her May 21 affidavit claims that two (unidentified) Philadelphia detectives had visited her in jail days before Jamal's 1982 trial and had "threatened me by reminding me that I faced a long prison sentence" on multiple pending felony charges; they said she would get off easy if she would help the prosecution at Jamal's trial.<p>

"When they finally left," the affidavit says, "I knew that if I did anything to help the Jamal defense I would face years in prison." And when she was taken from jail to testify at Jamal's trial, "[b]oth detectives who had threatened me earlier were in plain view, standing in the rear of the courtroom. When asked by Jamal's attorney to confirm what I had first told the police -- that I saw two males run from the scene after the firing stopped -- I steadfastly denied it."<p>

Trial testimony by Jones that two men had escaped would have helped Jamal by corroborating the account of another defense witness, Dessie Hightower, that he had seen someone running from the scene. As it was, Hightower's testimony was not much of a counterweight to the prosecution's theory -- backed by two of the three witnesses who identified Jamal as the killer -- that nobody had escaped.<p>

Jamal's current lawyers not only have shredded the credibility of those prosecution witnesses, but also have identified no fewer than five eyewitnesses (including Jones and Hightower) who have said at one time or another that someone escaped the scene. At least four of them said so in their initial police reports, but the jury heard only about Hightower.<p>

Why did it take so long for defense lawyers to come up with the new Veronica Jones account? Well, she says she was afraid to help Jamal. Besides, Jamal's original lawyer never interviewed her, either before or after her surprising trial testimony. And by the time Jamal's current chief lawyer, Leonard Weinglass, began investigating a very cold trail in 1993, Jones had long since left the Philadelphia area, moving several times, using aliases, and keeping an unlisted phone number. It took some doing to find her.<p>

Of course, it's possible that Jones is lying now, but her current account helps convince me that somebody escaped the scene of the crime.<p>

Moreover, the Jones affidavit adds weight to the considerable body of evidence that police influenced a number of vulnerable witnesses -- some through intimidation, some though more subtle suggestions -- to make dramatic changes in their initial stories so as to paint Jamal as a cold-blooded murderer deserving of death, while suppressing evidence that might complicate the picture.<p>

Most flagrantly, it appears probable that a flamboyant Jamal "confession" that was presented to the jury -- "I shot the motherfucker and I hope the motherfucker dies" -- was a complete fabrication, concocted by police long after the fact to clinch the case. Although a prosecution witness claimed that Jamal had shouted this out at the hospital twice, within earshot of 15 or 20 police officers -- who were soon interviewed by homicide detectives seeking to build the strongest possible case against Jamal -- not a word about this "confession" found its way into a single police report for more than two months.<p>

And one of the officers who was later to claim he had heard Jamal's shouted "confession" wrote in his initial report, hours after the shooting, that Jamal had "made no comments" at the hospital. The jury never heard about that.<p>

<b>Bad Means To An End?</b><br>

Some might be tempted to dismiss even such gross violations of due process, and the many others detailed by Jamal's current lawyers, as harmless error if it were utterly clear that Jamal is a cold-blooded cop-killer. But it's not clear.<p>

Evidence that was not provided to the jury shows that Jamal -- then a 27-year-old man with no criminal record -- ran toward Faulkner only after coming upon the sight of the officer beating Jamal's younger brother bloody with a 17-inch flashlight.<p>

(The brother had slugged the officer first while being patted down after a traffic stop; it's unclear whether Jamal saw that. Prosecution and defense agree that the brother did no shooting. He was arrested at the scene, but has never testified.)<p>

The evidence also supports the inference that -- contrary to the prosecution's claim that Jamal fired the first shot "from ambush" into Faulkner's back -- the officer probably fired first, hitting the charging Jamal in the chest and nearly killing him. Then (probably) Faulkner was shot in the back, fell to the ground, and was killed by a bullet between the eyes.<p>

So even if we could be confident beyond a reasonable doubt that it was Jamal who shot Faulkner -- which may be debatable, given the evidence that someone escaped -- it's not at all clear that this was a cold-blooded, first-degree murder, which Pennsylvania law defines as a malicious, unprovoked killing with "deliberation and premeditation."<p>

Jamal is seeking a new trial, and he is entitled to one. But his first collateral attack on his conviction and sentence was predictably rejected last September by Albert Sabo, the same notoriously pro-prosecution Philadelphia judge who presided over the 1982 trial. Jamal is now appealing to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which has already rejected (by 4-0 in 1989) his direct appeal in the politically charged case.<p>

If Jamal loses in the state courts, as seems probable, he will seek federal habeas relief. It will be an important test of the new habeas statute, which requires federal judges to give state courts a strong presumption of correctness on issues of federal constitutional law as well as of fact.<p>

Has Congress paved the way for executions of people whose convictions and sentences are tainted by egregious violations of the Constitution and who may not be murderers at all? We'll see.<p>

<h2>Michael Ross Won't Retreat</h2><P>

By Martha J.H. Elliott<br>
The Connecticut Law Tribune<br>
June 10, 1996<p>

Convicted serial killer Michael Ross is disappointed that the state Supreme Court decided last week not to answer seven questions in his case that he and Special Assistant State's Attorney C. Robert Satti Sr. asked the justices to consider. But he is still determined to avoid a full-blown penalty hearing and to accept a sentence of death.<p>

"I am disappointed, but I am hopeful that I can work something out," he says in an interview from Connecticut's death row at Northern Correctional Institute in Somers. "I am not going to give up now. I am still going to try. As far as I am concerned, nothing has changed. I have to do what I have to do."<p>

Ross was convicted in 1987 of the murders of four women between 1982 and 1984, and received six death sentences. Prior to the trial, Ross pled guilty to two Windham County murders and received the maximum sentence of 120 years. In July 1994, the high court overturned Ross' death sentences, but upheld his conviction.<p>

However, Ross has since explained that he does not wish to put the victims' families through another trial. <p>

In November 1995, Ross and Satti signed a stipulation that states that there were aggravating factors in his case, but no mitigating factors, which would prevent execution. The stipulation also says that the appropriate penalty for the crimes is death. Without any legal precedent to guide them, Ross and Satti asked the high court to answer seven procedural questions, including: If the penalty rehearing is held before a three-judge panel, must that panel's decisions be unanimous; can a defendant waive his right to present mitigating evidence; and must the court consider mitigating evidence presented at the first trial?<p>

In February, the court asked the parties to address the issue of whether it was proper for the court to consider the issues raised by the questions and also invited 17 other parties to submit amicus briefs. One of issues that most troubled the court was that it could be deciding issues that might never enter into the case.<p>

During oral arguments on May 1, the court focused on this point. Within minutes, Chief Justice Ellen A. Peters interrupted, saying that the court was being asked to "make a ruling on hypotheticals or events yet to come and choice that the state has yet to make. . . ."<p>

Given the tenor of the oral argument, it was of little surprise to most observers when, on June 3, the court, in a per curiam decision, declined to answer the reserved questions.<p>

"Although we are mindful of the public interest in expediting the finality of judicial proceedings, we are persuaded that it would be imprudent for us to answer the reserved questions in this case at this juncture," the court states. Many of the questions depend on "contingencies which might never arise."<p>

Specifically, the court is concerned that Ross had not formally requested that "a court, rather than a jury, be the decision maker at his penalty phase rehearing, and the state has not yet formally indicated, on the record, whether it would acquiesce in such a case." In addition, as to the presentation of mitigating evidence, "the defendant has not yet waived, after a formal canvass on the record, his right to contest the state's evidence concerning the existence of aggravating factors and his right to present evidence concerning the existence of mitigating factors."<p>

<b>Where Do We Go From Here?</b><br>
According to Chief Clerk Francis J. Drumm Jr., a 10-day appeal period follows the official publication of the decision in the Connecticut Law Journal on June 11. As long as no one appeals, the case is  remanded back to the trial court where the parties have to decide how they wish to proceed.<p>

Whether the stipulation can now go forward is unclear. Although New London State's Attorney Kevin Kane declines comment, Chief State's Attorney John M. Bailey Jr. issued a press release stating, "The Supreme Court's decision not to consider these questions does not mean that the prosecution cannot continue; it simply means that a full penalty phase hearing may now be necessary." Satti could not be reached for comment.<p>

Ross, however, is adamant that he does not want to go to the penalty phase. He is determined to try either to convince the state's attorney to go forward with the stipulation or to work out some new agreement. Ross says he would agree not to present mitigating factors if the prosecutors would limit the scope of their case.<p>

"Until Satti says no, I have to remain hopeful that we can work something out," says Ross. "Maybe there is still some hope. I won't give up until that is clear. If we go through a full-blown penalty phase, it is because Satti forced it, not me. I'll do whatever it takes. . . . It's in his hands. And it stinks because all these years I have been fighting [Satti] and now it's all in his hands.<p>

"I absolutely dread facing those families," Ross says. "I don't know most of them by face, but all I have to do is close my eyes to see Mrs. Shelley crying on the stand. I can still see Mrs. Stavinski. I don't want to go through that again. I don't want them to go through it."<p>

Since March 1995, Ross has been acting pro se, when he released his public defenders because they did not agree with his decision to stipulate to his own death. However, New London Superior Court Judge Joseph J. Purtill appointed solo attorney T.R. Paulding as standby counsel to Ross. Paulding also represents Ross for the limited purpose of preparing briefs and oral arguments to the Supreme Court. Paulding says he expects Ross to continue pro se.<p>

If he can work out an agreement with the state's attorney's office, he will probably continue pro se, Ross says. However, he says if the state's attorney insists on proceeding into a full-blown penalty phase, he may rehire counsel.<p>

<b>Whose Trial Is It Anyway?</b><br>
While Ross and Satti were ironing out their stipulation, Patrick J. Culligan, chief of trial services for the Office of the Chief Public Defender, filed a motion to intervene as amicus trial counsel so that the trial court could develop as complete a record as possible. Purtill dismissed the motion in September, but Culligan says that his office is discussing whether it should again petition the trial court.<p>

Over the last few months, Ross has bristled at the "help" of the public defenders. He feels that he has the right to conduct his defense as he wishes.<p>

However, G. Douglas Nash, chief of legal services for the Office of the Chief Public Defender, says that while pro se defendants control the guilt phase of their trial, the sentencing hearing has always operated at the judge's discretion. If Ross were charged with robbery, he says, the judge would consider a probation officer's report, letters from interested parties and any other reliable information.<p>

"Why is that different?" Nash asks. "I have never heard someone say, `Give me the maximum,' and the court be forced to give it without considering all the reliable information out there before it does that." Nash says that the court should want even more information in a death penalty case than it does in other sentencing.<p>

The court also has the responsibility of upholding the integrity of the criminal-justice system, and "the court has a responsibility not to let the defense subvert the integrity and reliability of the system in sentencing," comments Culligan. <p>

"On a third level, the Supreme Court has said over and over that they require an adequate record, and they are required to review every death sentence. If there is no record, the trial court is not doing its job," Culligan says. Thus, he says, if the defense does not put on the information, it's up to the trial court to appoint someone to do so. Culligan is not ready to say that his office is the proper party to do that.<p>

"The problem is that the system is not set up to deal with [someone volunteering to die]," says Ann Cole, of Ann Cole Opinion Research and Analysis in New York City, who is a member of Ross' defense team and who opposes the stipulation. "There is always the presumption that the individual is going to do all they can to achieve life. We don't know how to cope with someone who wants to agree to give up their life. Our Judeo-Christian society does not accept self-killing. That's true with Kevorkian and assisted suicide. That's true with abortion. And that's true with the death penalty."<p>

<h2>Federal Court Weighs in on California Rules for Death Row Cases</h2><P>

By: Deborah Yaffe<br>
The Recorder<br>
June 4, 1996<p>

The state Supreme Court's old procedural rules for handling death row inmates' habeas corpus claims were hopelessly muddled, defense lawyers have long griped. The court itself may have agreed, for it established a new set of rules in the 1993 decision In re Clark. <p>

Now the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals has joined the chorus of criticism, ruling Tuesday that federal courts should not reject prisoners' habeas claims just because the California court found that the claims were filed too late. <p>

While the Ninth Circuit ruling potentially affects scores of pending capital cases, it sidesteps a more pressing issue: whether the court's more recent rules, set down in the July 1993 Clark opinion, 855 P.2d 729, are clear and consistent enough to solve the earlier problems. <p>

Nevertheless, the ruling in Morales v. Calderon, 96 C.D.O.S. 3955, marks the first time the Ninth Circuit has weighed in on the question of whether California's pre-Clark timeliness rule constituted an adequate bar to federal review. <p>

Federal courts can refuse to review habeas claims that a state court has rejected for violating state filing procedures. But state procedural rules do not cut off federal review if the state rules are unclear or inconsistently applied. In the case of Michael Morales -- who was sentenced to death in 1983 for raping and murdering a teen-age girl in Stockton -- the Ninth
Circuit found California's pre-1993 rules were both. <p>

The ruling reverses the district court, which rejected Morales' habeas claims because the state Supreme Court had time-barred them. Morales now has the chance for a federal court hearing on the merits of his claims. <p>

Judge William Canby Jr. wrote the opinion, which was joined by Judges Jerome Farris and David Thompson. <p>

The California rule, established in June 1989, said a habeas petition was presumed timely if filed within 60 days of briefing deadlines for the state direct appeal (that timetable was changed a year later to 90 days). But, Canby wrote, "there was no discernible clear rule for petitions filed more than 90 days after the due date for the reply brief on direct appeal." <p>

In the past three years, a number of district courts have reached the same conclusion, and so the Ninth Circuit ruling is not surprising or especially significant, said Gardner & Derham's Cliff Gardner, who has worked on eight death penalty cases. <p>

"The real issue is going to be whether they've done it in the post-Clark era," Gardner said. <p>

Deputy Attorney General Dane Gillette, the office's capital casecoordinator, also downplayed the significance of the Morales  decision, which he had not seen Tuesday afternoon. <p>

"This is an issue that we've been litigating for a number of years," Gillette said. "We're still relying on it, but we've also lost it in a lot of cases." <p>

Gillette said he does not know how many cases pending in federal court are, like Morales', pre-Clark cases in which district courts have refused to review habeas claims because those claims were rejected by the state court for reasons of timeliness. <p>

And David Senior, the partner at Los Angeles' Condon & Forsyth who represented Morales, noted that part of his argument turned on the rarity of his case. <p>

"We were treated significantly differently than lots of other people who had been in the same position that we were," Senior said. <p>

Of 35 habeas petitions filed, like Morales', three years after the end of state direct appeal, the state Supreme Court denied only six for untimeliness alone, Senior argued. More than half were denied on the merits alone. <p>

The state argued that this pattern merely showed that discretion was involved in the application of the timeliness rule. But the Ninth Circuit panel rejected that argument. <p>

"Discretion is the exercise of judgment according to standards that, at least over time, can become known and understood within reasonable operating limits," Canby wrote.<p>

<h2>High Court Justices Seem Uncertain Where Habeas Jurisdiction Stands</h2><p>

By Don J. DeBenedicits<br>
Associate Editor<br>
Fulton County Daily Report<br>
June 4, 1996<p>

WASHINGTON - U.S. Supreme Court justices battered a contention by an attorney for the state of Georgia Monday that the high court's authority to hear habeas corpus petitions has been vastly curtailed by a new federal law.<p>

But neither the justices nor the attorneys arguing a Georgia death-penalty case seemed to know just what jurisdiction the court has left over habeas matters.<p>

The answer, which the court could deliver within a month, may affect not only the hundreds of inmates on death rows around the country but the authority of the Supreme Court itself.<p>

Senior Assistant Attorney General Susan V. Boleyn argued that the Supreme Court should decide it does not have the jurisdiction to rule on the last-minute appeal of a Georgia death-row inmate who was scheduled to be executed only a month ago. Felker v. Turpin, No. 95-8836 (U.S., argued June 3, 1996).<p>

The state contends the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, signed into law by President Clinton on April 24, not only cuts back on the habeas cases federal trial courts can hear but also on those filed directly with the Supreme Court.<p>

Boleyn told the justices that the new act restricts habeas cases filed as "original" matters at the court under 28 U.S.C. 2241, as well as to habeas cases brought to the court on appeal or certiorari petitions.<p>

Attorneys for the defendant and for the federal government both said the act, which does not mention that code section, does not apply to original habeas petitions at the high court.<p>

But the justices questioned her repeatedly about why the new law should apply to 2241 cases and even about whether her arguments made sense.<p>

Georgia's argument ran into immediate trouble from Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. When Boleyn said the state opposed any reading of the new law "that would engender further delay,"  Rehnquist told her that was "not a very specific position."<p>

The act particularly takes aim at what it calls "second or successive" habeas corpus petitions. Prosecutors and other critics complain that criminal defendants who lose on appeal and lose their first habeas petitions then go on to seek habeas relief repeatedly, without raising new issues, managing to delay their executions by 10 years or more.<p>

The Anti-Terrorism Act declares that all successive habeas applications in federal court must be thrown out. The only exception occurs if a three- judge panel of a U.S. circuit court of appeals certifies to a federal district court that the defendant has demonstrated very specific new factual or legal developments in his case.<p>

That screening or "gatekeeper" decision by the Court of Appeals cannot be reheard, appealed or even taken by writ of certiorari to the  Supreme Court, the act states.<p>

The case before the justices Monday was brought by Ellis Wayne Felker, who was convicted in 1983 of the 1981 rape and murder of a 19-year-old woman to whom he had promised a job.<p>

The Georgia Supreme Court upheld his conviction in 1984 and the U.S. Supreme Court refused a hearing that same year. Felker then filed a habeas corpus petition in state court that December, which was finally denied in August 1990. The state Supreme Court blocked an appeal of that decision in 1991 and the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari early in 1992.<p>

He next brought a federal habeas corpus petition. The U.S. District Court turned that down in January 1994; the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied his appeal in 1995, and the Supreme Court again denied cert early this year.<p>

Scheduled to be executed between May 2 and May 9, he brought a new state habeas petition, which the trial court and state Supreme Court rejected.<p>

On May 1, he also filed an application under the Anti-Terrorism Act to file a second federal habeas case. The 11th Circuit denied the application in a 24-page opinion May 24, holding Felker should lose under both the old and the new law. Felker v. Turpin, No. 96-1077 (11th Cir., decided May 2, 1996).<p>

The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to decide the case the next day but put the case on a remarkably fast track and set argument for a month later.<p>

The court said it wanted to decide whether the ban on certiorari petitions is an unconstitutional restriction of its jurisdiction and whether the act's limitations on habeas petitions generally apply to petitions filed as original matters directly with the court itself. It also asked if the new law violates a clause of the Constitution that says the writ of habeas corpus cannot be suspended except in a national emergency.<p>

Showing the difficulty of preparing a case for the Supreme Court on such short notice, the attorney arguing for Felker, Henry P. Monaghan of the Columbia University School of Law, said he and the other defense lawyers may have "flubbed" the answer in their brief to one of the questions the court asked.<p>

But during other parts of his argument, Monaghan seemed engaged with Rehnquist and some other justices in a pleasant, scholarly examination of the history and development of the writ of habeas corpus.<p>

Unlike the adversaries in many cases, the attorneys on all sides  seemed to agree about some issues. For instance, Monaghan conceded that a clause in the Constitution authorizing Congress to exclude some types of cases from high court jurisdiction means Congress can indeed prevent the court from hearing certiorari petitions from Court of Appeals "gatekeeper" decisions in successive habeas cases.<p>

Monaghan told the court that "the petition for certiorari [filed for Felker] must be dismissed."<p>

The attorneys also agreed that the new law does not violate the Constitution's suspension clause. In fact, only U.S. Solicitor General Drew S. Days III even mentioned the issue during the arguments Monday.<p>

But Days and Monaghan disagreed with Boleyn about whether the Anti-Terrorism Act bars successive "original" habeas petitions brought under Sec. 2241.<p>

Boleyn, in fact, even seemed to disagree with herself. Early in her argument, she told Rehnquist that the original writ at least still "exists on paper." Later, following close questioning from Rehnquist and Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, David Hackett Souter and Anthony M. Kennedy, she agreed with Souter's statement that "the practical effect" of the new act's restrictions "is that our original jurisdiction is in fact gone."<p>

What about an exceptional case which meets all the stringent tests of the new law but in which a Court of Appeals panel has mistakenly refused to allow a second habeas petition? Breyer asked. Could the Supreme Court hear that case as an original matter?<p>

"My answer is no," Boleyn said.<p>

"Your brief suggests otherwise," Breyer responded.<p>

In answer to a question from Justice John Paul Stevens, Boleyn said the high court might be able to consider an unusual, exceptional case in a different way, if asked to issue a writ of mandamus to a lower court.<p>

But what is the difference? Souter demanded. "Why don't you take the position that those should be equally barred" by the Anti-Terrorism Act? he asked.<p>

Both kinds of writs should be granted very rarely, Boleyn said.<p>

Monaghan took the position that the Supreme Court could use its original writ jurisdiction to correct miscarriages of justice, such as in the unusual type of case Breyer asked about.<p>

During his portion of the argument session, Days contended the high court can continue to hear original writs but should continue to do so in very rare cases.<p>

He noted that the last time the Supreme Court granted an original habeas writ for a prisoner was in 1925. <P>

<h2> Court Ponders Limits of its Own Power </h2><P>

By Eva M. Rodriquez <br>
The Recorder<p>


WASHINGTON -- It has been billed as high noon for death row appeals at the high court, a showdown pitting a Georgia capital crime convict against a newly enacted law that would drastically curtail his ability to appeal his case to the federal courts. <p>

But on June 3, when the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear Ellis Wayne Felker v. Tony Turpin, Warden, little if any of the court's time is likely to be taken up with questions about whether Felker's 1983 murder conviction should stand, or about the controversial new habeas corpus reforms enacted by Congress earlier this spring. <p>

Instead, the justices will likely seize on Felker's case to grapple with a less flashy, but arguably more profound, constitutional face-off over the power of Congress to meddle with the court's turf. <p>

"This may be a big case, but not for the reasons that most people think it will be," says Larry Yackle, a professor at Boston University School of Law, who has been retained as a consultant for Felker. "[The case] may say something fundamental about what Congress can do about the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court." <p>

On May 3, the court agreed to hear argument on whether the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 unconstitutionally infringes on the Supreme Court's own power, by drastically cutting back on inmates' ability to reach out to the high court in successive habeas petitions. <p>

The act still allows prisoners to petition the high court directly during their first round of appeals. But during subsequent bids for relief, prisoners must get the approval of a three-judge federal appeals panel before they can again make their case to a trial court. The panel's decisions, under the new system, are not appealable to the Supreme Court. <p>

<b>Courts Power Gutted?</b><br>
According to a May 17 brief filed by Felker's lawyers, the new reforms in some respects gut the Supreme Court's power as the ultimate arbiter of justice. <p>

"Whatever the ultimate scope of congressional power to regulate this court's appellate jurisdiction," the brief argues, "we submit that when an individual suffers a severe deprivation of liberty and asserts a claim that he is being confined pursuant to rulings and practices that violate the Constitution of the United States, such a claim cannot be wholly withdrawn from the cognizance of this court." <p>

But the solicitor general, who has weighed in on the side of the state, argues that there is absolutely nothing wrong with the reforms that Congress passed and the president signed into law. <p>

"[T]he consistent recognition by this court and Congress that principles of finality are applicable to habeas litigation demonstrates that the act's further refinement of those principles, in the context of this case, does not violate the [Constitution]," the May 17 brief noted. <p>

Most court watchers and legal scholars assumed that the conservative justices who rushed to hear the case, and who put it on an unusually fast track, also would find the habeas reforms inoffensive. After all, Chief Justice William Rehnquist and his conservative colleagues have often ruled in favor of streamlining the habeas process. <p>

But that calculation may be too simple. Although only the four most liberal members of the court dissented from the grant of certiorari, two conservative justices -- Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy -- might have had their own reasons for hearing the case. Some observers speculate that O'Connor and Kennedy may not be all that receptive to Congress' recent move to scale back further what can sometimes be a prisoner's last, best chance for justice. <p>

"After all of the Supreme Court's cutbacks on habeas in the past few years, O'Connor and Kennedy have shown some tendency to say, 'Far enough,'" says Thomas Rowe Jr., a professor at Duke University School of Law. <p>

And even such staunch conservatives as Justice Antonin Scalia who have been impatient with the seemingly endless and arguably frivolous appeals of death row inmates, might have trouble with Congress' expansive move and its effect on the independence of the federal courts. <p>

"You can be deeply conservative and a serious believer in separation of powers and be quite hostile to Congress' attempts to invade the province of Article III," says Laurence Tribe, a professor at Harvard Law School. "It would not shock me if justices like Kennedy and O'Connor, and maybe even Scalia, were in fact [concerned that this case] presents an impermissible intrusion on Article III." <p>

Adds Tribe: "It might be surprising, but not shocking." <p>

If the conservative coalition on the court concludes that the act does pass constitutional muster, it could reinvigorate critics of judicial activism who want to see the federal courts stripped of any power over issues like school busing and federal court intervention in state prisons. <p>

"If the Supreme Court even opens the door a little, there's going to be a lot of people who think this is a great way to cut back on the constitutional authority of the federal courts over other issues," says Richard Samp, chief counsel for the conservative Washington Legal Foundation. <p>

Samp says he is unaware of any group currently preparing to launch such a challenge. <p>

<b>Amici Weigh In</b><br>
But they are watching. Despite the expedited schedule, a number of conservative, victims' rights, and law enforcement groups have filed amicus curiae briefs in support of the act. The groups include: the Washington Legal Foundation, joined by the Clarendon Foundation and the Florida-based Justice for Surviving Victims, in a brief written by University of Utah law professor Paul Cassell; the National District Attorneys Association; and the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation. <p>

Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a key player in the push for habeas reform, was joined by 50 other federal lawmakers in filing a brief in support of the reforms. <p>

The National Office of the American Civil Liberties Union was considering filing a brief on Felker's behalf, according to a lawyer familiar with the defense. <p>

Considering the potential importance of the case, the number of parties filing amicus briefs is relatively small. <p>

That could be attributable to the expedited schedule for the case, which, according to Tribe, has kept a few Supreme Court regulars, including himself, on the sidelines. <p>

Tribe, a liberal scholar, says that he was approached by one of the parties in the case -- he won't say which -- about joining as counsel, but declined to participate because he wouldn't have had time to prepare adequately for the argument. <p>

"One byproduct [of the way the justices have chosen to proceed with this case] is depriving itself on all sides of the issue of the opportunity to get the best possible briefing on the arguments," says Tribe. <p>

Stephen Bayliss, a lawyer with the Georgia Resource Center, a nonprofit group that aids state death row inmates, is the attorney of record for Felker. Bayliss declines to comment on the case or on who will handle oral argument for Felker. <p>

Susan Boleyn, a senior assistant attorney general for Georgia, will argue the case for the state. Boleyn also declines comment. <p>

Solicitor General Drew Days III will likely argue on behalf of the state if the court -- as it is expected to do -- grants the office time during oral argument. <p>

From the beginning, the court dealt with the case at breakneck speed. Also from the beginning, it seemed clear that the justices were more intent on determining how the new habeas reforms would affect the court than on how they would impact Felker or others like him. <p>

Felker filed his petition with the court May 2, the date on which he was to be executed by the state of Georgia. He filed the petition with Justice Kennedy, the justice for the Eleventh Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, which had jurisdiction over Felker's case. <p>

In his petition, Felker raised several issues that went to the heart of whether he was fairly convicted in 1983 for the murder of a Georgia woman. <p>

Among other things, Felker argued that a state-performed autopsy was bungled, and that the original time of death assigned by the state's coroner made it impossible for Felker to have committed the crime. Felker also challenged as unconstitutional the instructions given to the jury that convicted him. <p>

In one vaguely worded question, Felker also raised the possibility that the new habeas reforms may "unconstitutionally tie the hands of the federal courts with respect to the exercise of jurisdiction in habeas corpus actions, violating the requirement of separation of powers and encroaching on Article III power of federal judges." <p>

On May 3, just 24 hours after receiving Felker's petition, the court voted to hear the case. <p>

The four more liberal members of the court -- Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer -- issued an unusual dissent to the grant of certiorari, calling the rush to hear the case an "unnecessary" and "profoundly unwise" move. <p>

The justices who wanted to hear the case disregarded Felker's claims of innocence, and instead focused on the one question regarding the constitutionality of the act's effect on jurisdiction. <p>

Yackle, one of Felker's lawyers, says he is unconcerned about the way the justices have approached the case. From Yackle's perspective, it is understandable that the justices wanted to deal with jurisdictional issues before tackling broader matters that might arise under the act. <p>

"The court is taking first things first," Yackle says. "It would surprise me very much should the justices get involved in [Felker's other claims] at all." <p>

The justices also had no intention of dealing with anything other than their own turf. The court plucked that one fuzzy notion about the act's constitutionality raised by Felker and fashioned three precise questions of its own -- questions that dealt exclusively with the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, to the exclusion of any of the lower federal courts. <p>

While the act's restrictions on subsequent writs of habeas may seem severe, they may ultimately be constitutional, according to legal scholars who have studied the question. <p>

The case law supporting Congress' power to determine jurisdiction of federal courts goes back more than 150 years. More recently, legal scholars point to the 1973 case of Palmore v. United States, in which the Supreme Court affirmed the notion that Congress has the power to invest the lower federal courts "with jurisdiction, either limited, concurrent, or exclusive, and of withholding jurisdiction from them in the exact degrees and character which to Congress may seem proper for the public good." <p>

Says Michael Perlin, a professor at New York Law School: "Congress has the right to limit jurisdiction, even if we citizens are very galled." <p>

But how much power Congress has to limit the jurisdiction of the highest court is still up for debate. <p>

Yackle cites a line of cases dating back to 1869 in which the Supreme Court has held that even when the court's jurisdiction is trimmed back, litigants may pursue other routes to reach the high court. <p>

And during the 1970s and 1980s, various bills eliminating federal court jurisdiction over such hot-button issues as abortion and school desegregation were batted around, but none were ever passed into law. <p>

According to legal scholars, this may very well be the first time in recent years that the Supreme Court will squarely address the issue of whether Congress can all but eliminate the Supreme Court's ability to review a particular issue. <p>

"This question the court hasn't dealt with in over 100 years," says Yackle. <p>

Adds Tribe: "This is probably the most obvious and direct attempt to identify a particular area of the law and to say, 'The buck stops here.'" <p>

<h2>Judges Rules California Doesn't Qualify to Use New Habeas Law</h2><P>

By Deborah Yaffe <br>
The Recorder<br>
May 28, 1996<p>

California cannot use a new federal law to speed up death row prisoners' habeas corpus proceedings, because the state's system for appointing and paying appellate counsel falls short of the law's requirements, a federal judge has ruled. <p>

The Friday order by Northern District Chief Judge Thelton Henderson in Ashmus v. Calderon, 96-1533, came exactly one month after President Clinton signed the new habeas provisions into law as part of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.<p>

Henderson is the first judge to rule on a challenge to the law's applicability, although a similar suit is pending in Pennsylvania. The law gives death row prisoners only six months to file federal habeas petitions and forces judges to rule on those petitions just as fast -- but only if states appoint competent counsel to handle earlier stages of the appeal process. <p>

Deputy Attorney General Ronald Matthias, who argued the case for the state, could not be reached Friday for comment on whether he plans to appeal. But in oral arguments Thursday, Matthias repeatedly said the AG's office is eager to let the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals resolve the issue once and for all. <p>

Henderson's ruling gave lawyers challenging the new law everything they wanted: a declaratory judgment that California does not qualify for the strict new habeas timetables, a preliminary injunction barring the state from invoking the new law, and provisional certification of the suit as a class action on behalf of all 440 of the state's death row inmates. <p>


But Henderson, who left Friday for a 10-day overseas trip, stayed his 17-page order until his return, promising a "more complete" explanation of his reasoning then. <p>

In his preliminary findings the judge concluded that California's procedures for appointing counsel on capital appeals fail to meet the law's standards for several reasons. Among them: The state has no mandatory competency standards, fails to pay lawyers for raising certain habeas issues in the course of the direct appeal, and takes too long to appoint lawyers for convicted prisoners.<p>

"California has always touted itself as the leader in providing resources," said Michael Laurence of San Francisco's Sternberg, Sowards & Laurence, who represented inmate Troy Ashmus. "It's clear that regardless of what the attorney general's office believes, the federal judiciary has other thoughts about this." <p>

<h2>California Judge Seems Ready to Block Habeas Law</h2><P>

By Deborah Yaffe <br>
The Recorder<br>
May 23, 1996<p>

A San Francisco federal judge suggested Thursday that he plans to hand a total victory to defense lawyers challenging strict new timetables for filing federal habeas corpus petitions in death penalty cases.<p>

But by day's end, Northern District Chief Judge Thelton Henderson had issued no written decision in the case of Ashmus v. Calderon, 96-1533. Henderson said Thursday that he planned to issue a brief ruling by today, when he leaves for a 10-day trip abroad.<p>

The Ashmus suit and a similar case filed in Pennsylvania are the first challenges to the federal habeas law enacted last month in an effort to speed up the slow pace of executions. Under the new law, part of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, only states with adequate procedures for appointing competent capital appellate lawyers can use the new timetables, which give prisoners six months to file their federal habeas petitions and require judges to rule on those petitions equally quickly.<p>

Lawyers for Troy Ashmus, who was sentenced to death for the 1984 rape and murder of a 7-year-old girl, argue that California's procedures for appointing counsel and managing state appeals don't meet the law's standards. Henderson apparently agrees.<p>

"It's reasonably clear to me that California does not qualify for the expedited review provisions," the judge said Thursday morning, prior to oral arguments on a motion to certify the suit as a class action on behalf of all the state's death row inmates.<p>

Then Henderson announced his "tentative rulings," which appeared likely to give Ashmus' lawyers everything they want: class certification; a declaratory judgment that California does not qualify for the new timetables; and a preliminary injunction -- similar to the temporary restraining order Henderson issued earlier this month -- that would bar the attorney general from invoking the new habeas law in capital proceedings.<p>

After listening to two hours of argument, the judge did not say whether he had changed his mind about his rulings.<p>

Deputy Attorneys General Ronald Matthias and Morris Beatus argued that the suit is best treated not as a class action but as a test case, limited to Ashmus, for the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals to resolve. If Henderson certifies the class, they argued, he will poach on the territory of fellow district judges who are presiding over their own capital cases and have a right to issue their own interpretations of the new law.<p>

But Ashmus' lead counsel, Michael Laurence of Sternberg, Sowards & Laurence, said class certification is the most efficient way of resolving the interpretative questions. And an injunction and declaratory judgment are necessary, he said, to prevent the AG's office from pressuring inmates into adhering to the new deadlines out of uncertainty over whether or not they apply.<p>

<h2>A Punishing New Regime: With Habeas Reform, Capital Defense Is Even More Daunting </h2><P>

By Naftali Bendavid<br>
Legal Times<br>
May 6, 1996<p>

When James Coleman Jr. first met Stephen Booker in 1983, Booker was 17 days from death.<p>

Booker had killed a 93-year-old woman in Gainesville, Fla., apparently while under the influence of drugs and alcohol.<p>

Six years and countless court hearings later, Coleman convinced the courts to spare his client's life because Booker had not been allowed to offer all the evidence for softening his punishment.<p>

But with Congress' recent enactment of strict timetables and daunting hurdles in the death row appeals process, Coleman is not sure he would agree to represent Booker today.<p>

"Those of us who take these cases are motivated by our belief that even despicable capital defendants ought to have lawyers," says Coleman, a partner at D.C.'s Wilmer, Cutler &Pickering. "There is a tension between that and the time that you have. So some people will decide they can't afford to do it. It's as simple as that."<p>

Coleman's dilemma illustrates perhaps the most immediate effect of the reform of the death penalty appeals process, or habeas corpus, signed into law by President Bill Clinton April 24: It is likely to exacerbate what many consider a critical shortage of qualified death row lawyers.<p>

With the death row population at 3,061 and growing, Congress has delivered a one-two punch in recent weeks. On April 1, lawmakers killed funds for the 20 special offices nationwide that assist attorneys defending death row inmates. Then members passed the habeas law, which presents death row lawyers with complex new rules, shorter deadlines, and a much smaller chance of victory.<p>

<b>Tough Cases Now Even Tougher</b><br>
The new law was pushed by conservatives frustrated that murderers can cheat the death chamber for decades by pursuing endless habeas appeals, in which the convicts argue that their trial was unconstitutionally bungled. Under the reform, prisoners will be allowed only one federal appeal, except in extraordinary circumstances, and it must be filed within a year.<p>

That scares defense lawyers, who say the habeas process is crucial because a life is at stake and because criminal trials are so often flawed.<p>

It is generally volunteer lawyers who handle habeas appeals, and the system is haphazard at best. Of the roughly 2,000 death row denizens who are ready to file habeas petitions or have already done so, at least 400 have no lawyer. That's because representing "dead men walking" is complicated, time -consuming, and emotionally draining.<p>

For a lawyer with a full caseload and no familiarity with death penalty law, a one-year deadline for filing an appeal is a frightening prospect.<p>

"A lot of the good lawyers are going to look at the time limits and say, 'No way am I going to get involved in that,' " predicts Sean O'Brien, executive director of the nonprofit Public Interest Litigation Clinic in Kansas City, Mo. "A lawyer is obligated not to take a case he can't handle competently. That has to do as much with a lawyer's caseload as with a lawyer's personal competence."<p>

The problem is aggravated because the reform creates 26 pages of new, vaguely worded rules. "This new legislation has made an already complex, for some people, mystifying area of the law three times more complex and mystifying," says George Kendall, an attorney with the NAACPLegal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. "That factor alone is really running people off. And even people who did a case three or four years ago are going to say, 'I've got to go back to Habeas School 101 again.' "<p>

Also rearing its head is a simple psychological factor: Lawyers don't like to take cases that are losers, and the habeas law makes it harder to save a client's life. Federal judges are now allowed to nix a death sentence only if it involves "an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law" -- a standard defense lawyers fear will be almost impossible to meet. <p>

Those who fought hard for the habeas bill consider this so much hand wringing.<p>

"I'm always concerned about having competent counsel representing people in this condition. On the other hand, we have half a million lawyers in this country," says Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). "We are the most lawyer-ridden society in the world. Idon't think it will be a problem."<p>

Hatch, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, also argues that making appeals harder forces defense lawyers to put their energy where it should be -- into the original trial. "Until now, our best capital litigators were content to work only on habeas cases," Hatch says. "I hope now that will change and they will realize that the trial is the main event."<p>

Paul Kamenar, executive legal director of the conservative Washington Legal Foundation, points out that the Constitution does not guarantee a right to a habeas review. So Congress is certainly not obligated to make sure these inmates get lawyers, he says.<p>

"Where there is a slack, that could be made up through efforts of the various state bar associations and at the national level through the American Bar Association," Kamenar says. "It's not like the resources are going to disappear tomorrow."<p>

The current reform rose from the ashes of a habeas agreement painstakingly crafted three years ago by Sen. Joseph Biden Jr. (D-Del.). The Biden proposal, like this one, would have imposed strict filing deadlines. But in return, it would have required that death row inmates be represented by experienced, competent lawyers.<p>

When the Republicans took over Congress, they simply dropped the latter part of the deal. William Barr, who served as attorney general in the Bush administration, says if the Democrats had made some small concessions a few years ago, they could have avoided the more stringent measure passed last month.<p>

"The irony is, this bill is much tougher than what we would have settled for," says Barr, now senior vice president and general counsel of GTE. "I said to Biden when this all started coming down, 'You should have cut a deal with us while you could.' He just laughed. He kind of agreed."<p>

Biden, ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, could not be reached for comment. But he spoke out against the current habeas law on the Senate floor last June: "I am certain all of my colleagues would agree that although the death penalty should be applied swiftly and with certainty, the worst thing in the world would be for it to be applied wrongly."<p>

While the new habeas law does not require states to provide lawyers, it does give special benefits to those jurisdictions that do. If a state creates "a mechanism for the appointment, compensation, and payment of reasonable litigation expenses of competent counsel," then its inmates get just six months, not a year, to file a federal appeal. And the judge that hears the appeal must rule on it within six months. <p>

But it's not at all clear which states, if any, now qualify for the six-month deadline -- so many inmates across the country don't know if they have six months or a year to file a habeas appeal. Lawyers in California and Pennsylvania have filed suits asking federal judges to declare that their states are not eligible for the six-month deadline.<p>

In some places, a scramble has begun to comply with the new standards. Texas legislators, for example, never bothered providing post-conviction lawyers for death row inmates. But now they're eager to force their prisoners to file their appeals within six months, so they recently passed a law providing for attorneys to be paid $100 an hour from state coffers.
<p>
But Texas is running into problems. For one thing, the state's Court of Criminal Appeals, which is responsible for paying the lawyers, requested $4 million over two years, but legislators provided only $2 million. "That has made it a little difficult to fund it," concedes Rick Wetzel, the court's executive administrator.<p>

Further, the lawyers' payments are tentatively capped at $7,500 per case, and many lawyers apparently aren't willing to take on capital cases for that price. So the court has located post-conviction attorneys for only 25 inmates, and roughly 125 of the state's death row prisoners remain lawyerless. <p>

Another state that may foreshadow the future is Missouri. <p>

Missouri was one of 20 states with a Death Penalty Resource Center, but Congress defunded these offices April 1. At least seven of them have shut down, while the others are hanging on with state funds.<p>

The centers, created in 1988, drew fire from opponents who saw them as taxpayer-funded think tanks that devised endless ways to evade legitimate death sentences. Supporters said they brought a measure of rationality and order to capital defense. <p>

When Missouri's resource center shut down, three of its eight lawyers, including Sean O'Brien, formed the Public Interest Litigation Clinic to continue taking death cases. <p>

But they can't keep up. "I can think of four death penalty cases where the courts have called us and I have had to say no because we are completely inundated," O'Brien says. "Ethically, I'm not in a position to take these cases."<p>

Of the roughly 60 Missouri death row inmates who have filed habeas petitions, two are without a lawyer. To some that might not sound like a crisis, but O'Brien disagrees. <p>

"The crisis is not just having a lawyer who's a warm body, but a lawyer who knows the habeas corpus process," O'Brien says. "Of the 60 lawyers representing inmates in the federal system, exactly five have handled a death case before. Fifty -five had never seen a death case in their lives. That's the crisis."<p>

It is unclear exactly what will happen to death row inmates forced to wait a long time for a lawyer. Ronald Tabak, who chairs the American Bar Association's Death Penalty Committee, predicts that more people will wrongly die.<p>

"What we are heading for, quite clearly, is a substantial increase in people who, if their cases were handled properly, could show they were convicted in constitutional error," says Tabak, a special counsel at New York's Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &Flom. "But because they do not get adequate representation they will get executed."<p>

Supporters of the law say that such concerns reflect opposition to the death penalty, not actual doubts about guilt.<p>

"The key thing that's lost in this debate on habeas reform is that in most of the cases, there is not a claim of innocence," says Kamenar of the Washington Legal Foundation. <p>

Ultimately, though, advocates on both sides say it will take a lot of litigation to clarify exactly what the new law means.<p>

Indeed, the rush to court was already under way last week, when the  U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider a Georgia case raising jurisdictional questions about the new law. The justices, on a 5-4 vote, with the conservatives in the majority, agreed to hear oral arguments in Felker v. Turpin  June 3, an extraordinarily expedited schedule.<p>

The justices seem to be focusing primarily on a provision in the new law that allows federal appeals courts to have the final say on whether an inmate can file a second habeas petition. Some suggest that stripping the Supreme Court of the final say unconstitutionally restricts its jurisdiction.<p>

But that is a fairly narrow question, and litigation centered more squarely on the law's new roadblocks to successful habeas petitions is certain to follow. <p>

Those whose job it is to recruit death penalty lawyers are taking no chances. Esther Lardent, chief consultant to the ABA's Post-Conviction Death Penalty Representation Project, has  signed up about 300 lawyers in recent years.<p>

Now Lardent is intensifying her efforts. In coming weeks, the ABA program will send letters to 70,000 attorneys across the country. Then former judges and other prominent figures in each state will call these lawyers and ask them to take on cases.<p>

Meanwhile, the Washington Council of Lawyers has begun a campaign to recruit small and medium-size firms to work on capital cases, supplementing the larger firms that traditionally take on such work. More than 60 lawyers and 20 law students have signed up for the drive, which organizers hope will spread to other states.<p>

Despite the obstacles, some predict the new habeas law will galvanize death penalty opponents, provoking some to take on capital cases who otherwise wouldn't be inclined to do so. <p>

Douglas Robinson, a partner at the D.C. office of Skadden, Arps, has handled death penalty work in the past and says he would do so again, new law or no new law. <p>

"I'm troubled by the fact that you take a case, and it would have been a meritorious case before, and now it's somewhat of a hopeless case," Robinson says. "But I wouldn't let that deter me. I would fight the good fight, and hopefully other lawyers would as well."<p>

<h2>Michael Ross:  Why A Killer Offers To Die</h2><P>

By Martha J.H. Elliott<br>
The Connecticut Law Tribune<br>
April 29, 1996<p>

From any perspective, the story of Michael Ross is an American tragedy. It is the story of the waste of at least nine lives -- -the lives of the eight women whom Ross brutally raped and murdered, and his own, now destined to be spent in a cell or to end on a gurney if he is executed by the state of Connecticut. It is the story of a troubled farm family and the destructive mental illness that it may have spawned. And it is the story of an imperfect justice system given the responsibility of deciding the ultimate punishment.<p>

The final chapter of this story is yet to be written. It began in November 1995, when, after several months of one-on-one negotiations with the state's attorney, Ross -- a convicted serial killer whose death sentence but not conviction was overturned by the state Supreme Court in July 1994 -- signed a stipulation offering to forego a full-blown penalty hearing in his case and accept death for his crimes. This Wednesday, May 1, the justices of the state's highest court will listen to arguments as to whether they should answer seven procedural questions concerning the unusual stipulation. Their decision will be the next step in the legal maze through which Ross must walk to determine whether he lives or dies.<p>

Why does a physically healthy man with an IQ of 122 opt for death over life? Why is Ross, who is morally opposed to the death penalty and who churns out articles expressing that opinion, willing to accept execution for himself? Is the prospect of life imprisonment so grim that death becomes a more palatable option? Is Ross' offer indeed genuine? To those who have followed Ross' case, his subsequent crusade to expose alleged misconduct on the part of the state, his one-man article-writing campaign against the death penalty, and his burning desire for the world to understand his mental illness, his actions can be baffling, even downright contradictory.<p>

Because of the significance of Ross' case -- he is the first man sentenced to death in Connecticut in over a quarter of a century -- and its potential legal precedent, the Law Tribune editors decided that it was important to understand Ross' decision. This article is the result of six months of interviews with Ross, his lawyers, prosecutors, police and others intimately familiar with his case.<p>

<b>Contrasts</b><br>
Michael Ross is a puzzle. If you met him in a supermarket line, you would never suspect that you were standing next to a serial killer. He is soft-spoken, self-effacing, and even funny. Although his appearance has changed since he was arrested in 1984 -- he has gained 75 pounds due to medication he takes and now wears a prison-style crew cut -- Ross still appears almost geeky in his over-sized glasses, and not the least bit menacing.<p>

Ross, a Cornell University graduate, is articulate, but often slips back into an aw-shucks farm boy dialect in which he uses double negatives, faulty grammar and a healthy number of ain'ts. He has a mild-mannered charm that is either disarming or, some say, manipulative and cunning. He and his psychologists acknowledge that his highly developed sense of denial sometimes hides the truth from him. Yet to those who have known him longest -- his lawyers, his advisers, even reporters who have followed his case -- -he seems incapable of lying. He speaks of murders and masturbation with a clinical lack of affect, yet appears on the verge of tears when talking about issues he deems important.<p>

When you ask him a question that he finds difficult to answer, he often deflects it with an inappropriate nervous laugh or a joke. How has he managed to keep his sense of humor while on death row all these years? "I don't know. I must be crazy," he quips.<p>

Karen Clark, who covered his case for The Day of New London, says, "If I were walking down a dark alley and I heard footsteps behind me and turned around and saw Michael Ross, I'd be relieved."<p>

But if that had happened between 1981 and 1984, she probably would have also been dead. During that period, Michael Ross raped and murdered eight women and attacked at least five more -- -all teen-agers or young women just barely out of their teens.<p>

According to Ross' psychiatrists, the murders were the result of the fact that he is a sexual sadist who could not control himself. "You are talking about someone who, should he be strolling down the street one day and see a nubile and naked 17-year-old female, his first inclination would be to kill her. Now that's a strange person," observes Peter Scillieri, one of the public defenders who represented Ross.<p>

"People differ from one another in terms of the sexual cravings that they do or don't experience," says Dr. Fred Berlin of Johns Hopkins Sexual Disorders Clinic, who testified for Ross as an expert witness. "And when that powerful sex drive gets attached to the wrong types of persons, such as children, or attached to the wrong types of behaviors, like sadistic behaviors, it still craves satisfaction, and yet it craves it in a way that when satisfied is going to cause great danger."<p>

According to the state, he is a cold-blooded killer, a rapist who covered up his crimes by murder. As former New London State's Attorney C. Robert Satti Sr. put it in closing arguments during the penalty phase of his 1987 trial, "No way does the fact that a man is a sexual sadist say it's all right for him to go out and pick up any woman he wants, especially little girls, targets of opportunity, [pick] them up, rape them; and when you're done with it, kill them. No way, ladies and gentlemen, even if you find sexual sadism."<p>

The jury agreed with Satti. It took them only 86 minutes to decide his guilt in June of 1987 on charges of killing four women, and only four hours to decide that there were no mitigating factors in his case, a decision that essentially recommended the death penalty.<p>

<b>Sick, Not Evil</b><br>
But you needn't have the state's attorney present to remind you of Ross' crimes. Ross will do it himself. "I have a mental illness, and I couldn't control myself," says Ross, sitting on a cold, round cement cylinder in the visiting area off death row, which is now housed at Northern Correctional Institute in Somers. "But whenever you look at me you have to remember that there are eight bodies behind me. I killed those women, and I did nothing to stop myself for three years. And because of that I'm guilty."<p>

Ross, who will turn 37 in July, explains that his decision to accept death is part of a slow metamorphosis that he has undergone, aided by the catalysts of medication -- DeproLupron, which nearly eliminates any testosterone level -- soul searching, and the nine years he has spent on Connecticut's death row. He sees it as a logical progression from his 1992 decision to end his appeals, and his only moral choice.<p>

He first articulated his position in a September 1994 letter to prosecutor Satti: "Please allow me to go into the courtroom and admit to my actions; to accept responsibility for my actions; and to accept the death penalty as punishment for those actions. I'm not asking you to do this for me, but for the families involved who don't deserve to suffer further and for the families who, in some small way, might gain a sense of peace of mind by these actions and my execution."<p>

In a letter written this month to the Law Tribune, he explains his feelings more exactly: "The real issue boils down to two simple facts. One, I raped and murdered eight women. Two, I am responsible for those actions and the consequences of those actions on the families of my victims. How and why I did these things is irrelevant. These questions may bear on my legal culpability, but they don't negate my moral responsibility. . . . I am not an evil person, but merely a sick person. I don't want to be hated and despised -- I don't want people cheering at my execution. I get concerned with how others perceive me. It is self-centeredness. . . . But I have to fight the urge to protect how others perceive me because in my case it carries a dreadful cost. And in the end which is more important: how others perceive you or how you perceive yourself? I have a responsibility to the families of my victims. . . . To allow them to be harmed, or equally important to not prevent them from being harmed when it is in my power to do so, is simply wrong. If I allowed that to happen it would affect how I perceive myself, for in my mind it would take me one step closer to being exactly the person Satti portrays me as being."<p>

<b>Moral? Or Manipulative?</b><br>
When he killed the women, Ross explains, he was out of control. Now he has controlled his violent fantasies, and that has also given him control over causing any additional pain to the families of his victims. Going forward with a full-blown penalty hearing would hurt the families. Because of that, he says, he can't morally let the penalty hearing take place.<p>

"That's because he is a morally responsible person," says Scillieri. "A classic demonstration of an intact moral outlook: `I've done a bad thing. Having already done that, I wish I could have stopped myself from doing it, but nevertheless, I've done it. The least I could do now is to admit it and to take myself out of circulation so that no one else be harmed, and about that I feel even worse than about the act itself, since I can't control myself from committing the act, but I certainly damn well can march down to the police station so that it won't happen again. And for that, I'm guilty as charged.' A moral response."<p>

Detective Michael Malchik, the chief investigator in the case, has little sympathy for Ross. He expresses concern that Ross is disingenuous in his offer to die and will use it as a mitigating factor in a new penalty phase. He adds that if Ross really wants to spare the families pain, he would stop granting press interviews, which make the families "go berserk" and "hurt these people over and over and make them so sad." Malchik tells of being called to the house of one of the families in the middle of the night and of trying to stop the father from trying to strangle himself to see how long it would take to die as his daughter did.<p>

"Not a day goes by [that they do not have pain]. . . . He's hurting these people terribly by doing this. I doubt the sincerity of what he's doing. How does a mother and father get over it? . . . Their life is over. He's destroyed their life. He's destroyed these people." Malchik also speculates that Ross has made his offer only for the limelight of being the first person on death row to be put to death.<p>

Although Satti is hesitant to make comments about the ongoing case for fear of violating the rules of professional responsibility, he does echo Malchik's remarks about hurting the families. And he says that Ross "must realize that every time he makes a statement for publication about these cases, he does exactly that. Prime examples of this are the article he wrote for Northeast magazine in March 1995, his agreeing to numerous TV interviews and his making comment for this very article that you are writing."<p>

Ross responds by saying that the families need not read anything that he writes or says. He says that he has turned down many invitations to comment and that he comments only when the press is undertaking a long investigation rather than seeking a two-minute clip on the nightly news. He adds that if Satti believes that he is making the offer so that he can use it for mitigation, Ross will publicly state that it will not be used for mitigation should there ever be another full-blown penalty phase.<p>

"I think it's insane," says M. Fred DeCaprio, one of Ross' defense attorneys, speaking of the stipulation. "I understand what he wants to do. It's sincere. . . . There's not a doubt in my mind about that, but I think it's ill-advised. I don't think he's going to be able to accomplish what he wants to do even if it happens the way he wants or hopes. . . . I think it's a bad precedent. It's a dangerous precedent in terms of capital sentencing in the state."<p>

Dr. Walter Borden, a New Britain psychiatrist who testified for Ross in his trial and says he spent more time on Ross' case than any other, explains, "He was obsessed with death, a kind of ultimate perversion, as a normal person is obsessed with life. . . . I think what he is involved in is nothing short of state-assisted suicide."<p>

Borden sees great value in keeping Ross alive, "He should be studied. . . . I think the state has an opportunity to understand how people come to be this way," which, he says, would help prevent other needless deaths.<p>

Some lawyers worry that the stipulation itself is dangerous. "Prosecutors could lean on defendants by saying, `If you stipulate [to] the death penalty, we won't prosecute your brother or we'll give your wife a lesser sentence,' " says David Golub, of Stamford's Silver, Golub and Teitel. Golub represents Sedrick H. Cobb, a fellow death row inmate of Ross'.<p>

Ann Cole, of Ann Cole Opinion Research and Analysis in New York City, who is a member of Ross' defense team but opposes the stipulation, asks, "What happens when [a defendant's] family says, `Don't put us through a trial. Just stipulate [to] the death penalty?' " A psychologist, she explains that many persons accused of capital crimes are "depressed, suicidal and remorseful" and susceptible to psychological pressure.<p>

<b>The Underlying Problem</b><br>
Although sparing the families pain is his primary concern, Ross has another reason for doing what he is doing. He also believes that the criminal-justice system failed him and that he can never get a fair hearing. He claims the police twisted facts, the prosecutor kept important exculpatory information from the jury and the judge was blatantly biased against him in an effort merely to secure his death warrant.<p>

"I thought a trial was a search for the truth. I was naive. I thought I was going to go in there, and they were going to give me answers. I didn't know myself what the truth was. I didn't know what the psychiatrists were going to say until I heard them in court. . . . But a trial isn't a search for truth. It's the state versus the defense, and there isn't anyone interested in finding the truth," says Ross.<p>

After his conviction and the imposition of six death sentences, Ross became obsessed with proving that the system was corrupt. He petitioned many state agencies to look at this case -- to investigate the state police, to censure the judge and the prosecutor. Then-Chief State's Attorney John Kelly responded in a June 1988 letter that the complaints involved matters that occurred during trial and "should be addressed to your attorneys so that they can determine whether or not to include them in your appeal. . . . This office will not investigate any of your complaints." The Judicial Review Council and the Statewide Grievance Committee also dismissed Ross' complaints.<p>

"Nobody cared. Nobody cared," says Ross.<p>

Monsignor John D. Gilmartin, Ross' spiritual adviser, explains, "Michael thinks he won't get a proper hearing of all the issues and that is tragic. It's a disgrace . . . but he doesn't want to go through the ugliness of the trial and not try to understand his illness." Saying that Ross' biggest nightmare is facing the families again, Gilmartin adds, "It isn't that he wants to die, he has no death wish. . . . But it is a frustration that nobody understands his illness."<p>

<b>Farm Life</b><br>
To understand Ross' decision, one must look at the details of his life, pieced together from interviews with Ross, people who know him well, his psychiatrists and trial transcripts.<p>

If ever anyone was born under crossed stars, it was Michael Bruce Ross. According to hospital and court records, his mother and father, Daniel and Patricia Ross, were forced to marry when his mother was in high school because Pat became pregnant with Michael. Pat wanted no part of the marriage or of being the wife of a chicken farmer in Brooklyn, Conn. Into this unhappy union, Michael was born on July 26, 1959.<p>

Five years, four children, two abortions later, Pat Ross tried to run away to North Carolina to be with the man whom she had considered her true love since she was 15, according to hospital records in the first of two psychiatric admissions. After being retrieved from North Carolina, she was admitted to Norwich Hospital because she "has talked of suicide, has beaten and struck children" and because her husband had taken the children away from her, say the reports of the admitting doctor.<p>

Much evidence was produced during the trial about his mother's alleged abuse of Ross, which ranged from beatings to front-yard burnings of his mattress when she caught her son masturbating. Ross' siblings spoke at trial of how Michael often received the brunt of their mother's anger.<p>

Borden, one of the psychiatrists who evaluated Ross, added, "All you have to do is look at the Norwich hospital records . . . and right there in black and white they talked about the child abuse going on. . . . And I'll tell you something, that was back at a time when it wasn't required to report abuse. So if it's reported, it's pretty serious. You better believe it."<p>

Borden also points out that Ross had an uncle who committed suicide when he was 14 and Michael about 8 years old. Borden says that there was convincing evidence that the uncle, who was Ross' babysitter, sexually abused him in a way similar to the way Ross abused his victims. Although Ross was very close to the uncle, he says he remembers almost nothing about him.<p>

After the uncle's death, one of his jobs, the killing of sick and malformed chicks, fell to 8-year-old Michael. Ross killed them the same way he later killed his victims. "His mother said that she wouldn't allow the other children to kill the chickens because it was too disturbing to them. `Let Michael do it,' " comments Dr. Borden. (Pat Ross has changed her name and moved out of state. Ross himself does not know where she is.)<p>

Ross himself has almost no memory of any problems in the family. To him it was a cherished farm life. "I liked the lifestyle. It's a hard life, but I think it taught me a lot of good things. . . . Like you have to get up and feed the chickens every day. Just because you don't want to get up in the morning, you got to get up and do what has to be done. And if a piece of equipment is broke and it's 4 o'clock in the afternoon and it's quitting time and the chickens ain't been fed, that means you gonna miss your supper because you got to be sure the chickens get fed before you get fed. . . . I think a lot of kids today, I don't think they have the responsibility that I grew up with on the farm."<p>

By the time Ross was in high school, his father relied on him heavily. "My dad knew that if he took a weekend off and was going somewhere, I would make sure that the eggs would be packed and the chickens would be fed, and everything would get done."<p>

<b>College Days</b><br>
Ross dreamed of becoming a farmer, and he decided to go to Cornell to study agricultural economics. He went off to college with strong middle class values and conservative opinions: He believed in the death penalty and he thought that the insanity defense was some lame legal technicality designed to get the guilty off. His dream was to graduate from college, get married, "go back to Brooklyn, and have a family."<p>

Cornell, which Ross entered in 1977, began as the happiest time of his life. It wasn't long before he established a steady relationship with a woman in the ROTC program. But, Ross says, things went bad after she became pregnant and had an abortion. He acknowledges that he was not supportive of her either emotionally or financially. However, the final blow to their relationship was when she signed her four-year commitment papers for the service. "I didn't want to wait four years for a wife," says Ross. "I was stupid."<p>

Soon Ross' dream of the perfect farm family began to be crowded by other fantasies -- disturbing, violent, sexual fantasies. During his sophomore year, he began stalking women. Despite the fact that he had fallen in love with and gotten engaged to another woman, named Connie, Ross' urges intensified. He says he tried to deny that it was happening to him and told himself it would stop. Sometime during his senior year he committed his first rape. Later that year he raped and strangled another woman and threw her body into Cornell's well-known gorge.<p>

Ross says he later tried to kill himself by jumping from a cliff above Lake Cayuga's  waters, where Cornell is perched, but "was too chicken to do it." He convinced himself "that it would never happen again. I wouldn't hurt anyone else." But it did happen again. And before he was caught, eight women would be dead. <p>

Ross says that he has no distinct memories of any of the crimes. "I don't have any real specific memories. It's more of a jumble. It's hard to explain. Remember those old black and white movies you used to see in high school, and they are all spliced and then they jump, and that's sort of what I remember. I remember bits and pieces. Dr. Borden says that I reconstruct things and try to fill in the spots that I don't know because some of the things I told police ended up not being true," he says.<p>

<b>The Catch</b><br>
Enter Detective Michael Malchik, a strapping, handsome Norman Rockwell version of a state trooper. Malchik had been called in 1983 to analyze the Tammy Williams case to see if he could come up with any new angles. At the time, Williams was listed as a missing person. The detective who sat next to him had the Deborah Taylor case and the two began to compare notes. "I started to see similarities between the two. We don't have murders that occur on a daily basis in an area like Danielson, and I saw that the women were the same size, were roughly seen about six miles apart . . . and I forget, there were a number of things that looked like they were similar to me, so I said I thought they were done by the same person."<p>

While he was working on that theory, Wendy Baribeault disappeared. Four days later her body was found, and Malchik was assigned as chief investigator.<p>

By this time Ross had become almost brazen in his crimes. Several witnesses had seen him turn his car around abruptly and in broad daylight approach Baribeault from behind as she walked down the road. Malchik had the make and color of car -- a blue Toyota. He had a description of the perpetrator, and the first door he knocked on from the printout of the owners of 3,600 blue Toyotas was that of Michael Ross, who, after his parents' divorce and the sale of the egg farm, had become an insurance salesman living in Jewett City.<p>

Although the spectacled Ross did not match the composite sketches, and his car was not exactly what Malchik was looking for, Malchik had a strong suspicion that this was his man. He describes the June 28, 1984, visit to Ross' apartment as a "roller coaster ride." Every time he was ready to go, Ross would drop him a crumb that would make him think that he should ask more questions, Malchik says. When Ross told him he had been arrested twice for sex offenses, Malchik decided to bring him down to the station for more questioning. Ross said he asked if he could come down after work at 4 p.m., but that Malchik said no, he had to make a statement that morning. Malchik denies this. Ross also contends that he asked to call his father, but that he was not allowed to do so until after all the confessions had been signed. Malchik also denies this.<p>

For the next four hours, Malchik gained Ross' confidence. They talked about his family. They talked about college and Connie. According to Ross, they talked hypothetically about serial killers and Baribeault's murder. (Malchik puts this discussion much later in the day.) It was by all accounts exquisite police work, because Malchik was able to get Ross to confess to not only the Baribeault murder, but to five others, including two that the police had classified as runaways.<p>

Ross says he felt like Malchik was his friend, and that he and the detective were going to "solve" his case. He now feels that Malchik betrayed him by allegedly twisting certain facts to make them sound much worse in order to prove extreme cruelty -- an aggravating factor in the death penalty equation.<p>

One of the important issues that would later come up in the Ross appeal was when Ross was in custody, and whether he was read his Miranda rights as soon as a reasonable person would assume he was in custody. Both Ross and Malchik agree that Ross confessed to both Malchik and his partner before he was read his rights. Both also agree that Ross asked Malchik if he thought he killed Wendy Baribeault and that Malchik said yes, and that Malchik felt that Ross would do it again. Ross then confessed to Malchik and again to Malchik's partner. The defense contends that at that point Ross was in custody and had been seized illegally without probable cause. Malchik contends that Ross knew he could leave at any time.<p>

<b>Rhode Island or Connecticut?</b><br>
Two years later, in 1986, the issue of Malchik's credibility arose. Although the state originally claimed that the Leslie Shelley and April Brunais murders were committed in Connecticut, there was testimony in a 1986 hearing that they were committed in Rhode Island, though the girls were picked up in Connecticut and their bodies were later hidden in this state as well. The defense moved to dismiss those murder, sexual assault and kidnap-murder charges on the ground that the Connecticut court did not have jurisdiction.<p>

The state claimed that the crimes occurred in Connecticut, but that even if they hadn't, Connecticut had continuing jurisdiction because the crimes began and ended in the state. Satti produced a report written by Malchik only weeks before the proceeding containing what Malchik said were Ross' additional directions to the crime scene -- directions that, Malchik says, were inadvertently left out of the written and taped statements taken two years earlier, and which  Ross says he never gave. Those directions, Satti contended, would place the crime scene in Connecticut.<p>

However, during the hearing the defense produced strips of cloth found in a secluded area in the Exeter, R.I., woods that purportedly matched a slip cover from Ross' apartment and a missing ligature found around one of the girl's necks. The defense lawyers were also able to show on the taped statement that Ross had offered to take the officers to the crime scene three times, despite Malchik's memory to the contrary.<p>

In what Scillieri describes as "my favorite day in court," Superior Court Judge Seymour Hendel blew up during the closed hearing and on the record lambasted the prosecutor and the police. According to the transcript, Scillieri and Malchik, Hendel yelled at the prosecutor and threw a map at the investigator. At the conclusion, he said, "Gentleman, there is no question in my mind this happened in Rhode Island. There is absolutely not one scintilla of doubt it happened in Rhode Island. I disbelieve the testimony of both officers, Malchik and Officer Griffin [Malchik's partner]. . . . Two officers that I feel lied before me on something absolutely unnecessary to lie about. . . . Officer Malchik did a fantastic investigation. All the Court can say is I am glad it is a . . . sealed record. They did not want Rhode Island to get involved in this case. Why I will never know. . . . It bothers me, it bothers me greatly. At some point this record will become open when this case is over. Let the chips fall where they may."<p>

But Hendel threw out only some of the counts and would not grant the defense's motion to reopen the suppression hearing on Ross' confessions. (The suppression hearing had been held a year earlier. During that hearing, Ross' defense had attempted to impeach Malchik but was stopped by Hendel.)<p>

When the record was finally unsealed in 1989, two years after Ross' conviction, Hendel retracted his criticism of the police officers. "[W]ith the benefit of hindsight, I realized that the officers made a judgment call at the time based on the information which was available to them, that it wasn't important to go to the site of the killings, since they were looking to secure corroboration of the defendant's confession' and they felt that by going to the place where the bodies were, they would get that corroboration. . . . I understand their testimony now; and I do believe that they testified truthfully during the hearing."<p>

Ross is less bothered by this episode now, but it plagued him for years. It was the first of many experiences that convinced him that no one was interested in truth or justice "in a case like mine, where there is so much emotion and so many careers are at stake."<p>

Malchik, now an investigator for the state's attorney's office who recently passed the state bar exam, is affronted by the mere questioning of his credibility. "I've testified many times, and they always question your veracity and credibility," Malchik says, "and that comes with the job, but . . . I went out of my way to be fair. . . . [T]hat's very important to me, my truthfulness, my credibility."<p>

Saying that he does not want to criticize Hendel, Malchik says he believes that the original outburst was caused by tension between Hendel and Satti. "Judge Hendel believed that you could not get the death penalty under the present law. Judge Hendel wants to move his docket, which any judge does. . . . He used to argue with Satti all the time about this case causing him problems on his docket. He was not going to win and it was a waste of time to go through all these things," Malchik continues.<p>

Hendel declines to be interviewed on the matter and refers to the transcripts of the two proceedings.<p>

<b>Hands and Knees</b><br>
But it was the 1987 trial itself that was Ross' biggest disappointment, and a revival of it is now his biggest fear. Ross was tried for four murders. He pleaded guilty to two Windham County murders and, at his request, was given the maximum sentence of 120 years.<p>

It lasted for more than four months in 1987. Desperate not to make eye contact with anyone, he says, every morning he would go over in his mind what he would say to the guards as he walked "through the gauntlet" of victims' families and reporters in the hall from the elevator to the courtroom in Bridgeport's Golden Hill courthouse, where the trial had been moved because of publicity.<p>

Ross was soon disillusioned by what he describes as the blatant bias of Superior Court Judge G. Sarsfield Ford and the aggressive tactics of Satti. Near the end of the trial, for instance, Satti got down on his hands and knees to re-enact the murders for the jury. Ross also feels that Satti kept important exculpatory information from the jury --  the fact that his own psychiatrist felt there were mitigating factors. He feels that no one wanted to understand his mental illness, and that as the result of all these things, he didn't -- and couldn't -- get a fair trial.<p>

<b>The Judge: Rolling His Eyes, Clipping His Nails?</b><br>
"Judge Ford is unique," says Scillieri, Ross' trial counsel, adding that he has never had another trial experience like that one. DeCaprio goes further.<p>

"All of us have had judges take more active roles, but I've never had it to that extent," says DeCaprio. He says that he always believed that Ford "was tremendously offended by the natures of the crimes. . . . And it was very subtle. . . . So there are a lot of times there is nothing for the record. It's done with inflection, gesture, it's devastating. . . . And I thought we had a pretty compelling case, but [because of Ford], I thought a lot of it never got heard."<p>

Clark, the reporter for The Day, agrees. She says that Ford would open mail, clip his nails and act bored or roll his eyes during defense testimony. She also says that his tone was demeaning towards DeCaprio and Scillieri. "My feeling is that if somebody is on trial for their life, the judge should at least appear to be interested while the court is in session," says Clark. "The judge had a lack of respect for the defense, and I think the jury picked up on that. . . . I really feel there was bias shown against the defense and that it was inappropriate and just on that alone, [Ross] couldn't have gotten a fair trial."<p>

Perhaps the most blatant demonstration is Ford's alleged treatment of defense witnesses. No sooner had Tina Ross testified on June 17 that her brother had grown up as an emotionally deprived, unloved child than Ford launched a string of questions that five observers say was clearly intended to impeach her and show disbelief. "When you were growing up, did you have birthdays, did you celebrate Christmas, did you have exchange of gifts, were you in the Girl Scouts, did you get awards, were you in school, were you in school plays and did [your father] . . . provide an education for you and all the children?"<p>

"It was brutal," says DeCaprio, who objected to the rhetorical questioning during the trial.<p>

Two of Ross' psychiatric witnesses also feel that Ford stepped over the line. Psychiatrist Borden says that Ford would whisper disparaging remarks to him while he was testifying and that other neutral observers said that the judge would make facial expressions and roll his eyes while Borden was testifying. He says he felt personally and professionally attacked by the judge at times.<p>

Dr. Berlin says, "I just don't feel that we were treated -- the doctors who were testifying to things that might have mitigated on Mr. Ross' behalf -- I didn't think we were allowed to be heard very much, and I didn't think we were dealt with in a very polite and respectful fashion."<p>

Berlin filed a complaint with the Judicial Review Council in June of 1987. In that complaint he writes, "During my three days of testimony, I was repeatedly treated by Judge Ford in a disrespectful, condescending, and in my opinion, often prejudicial manner. It is my understanding that he treated several other professionals who testified at that hearing in a similar fashion." Berlin goes on to say that he had testified many times and never experienced this type of situation before.<p>

Two years later, the Judicial Review Council informed Berlin that it had "completed and terminated its investigation" and "determined that there is not sufficient evidence to substantiate probable cause of misconduct" and that the complaint was dismissed.<p>

Asked recently to comment on these charges, Ford writes that it would be improper for him to comment since the Ross case is still pending.<p>

But Satti is very willing to defend Ford. "I believe that the criticism of Judge Ford that you have related to me is `sour grapes' and not deserving of direct response," he writes in a statement to the Law Tribune. "Much of it can even be characterized as `childish.' " Judge Ford was an experienced trial judge who believed in controlling his courtroom and the conduct of the trial in strict accord with the rules of practice and case and statutory law. To fault him for this admirable characteristic does a disservice not only to the judiciary of this state, but to the citizens themselves, who rely on our judges to enforce those rules. . . . In my opinion, Judge Ford was fair and impartial and in controlling the conduct of the trial, and the specific items of criticisms you have related to me are completely unjustified.<p>

<b>The Grandpa</b><br>
Then there is the matter of Satti's style. Unused to aggressive courtroom theatrics, Ross was and is cowed by Satti. But DeCaprio shrugs and says, "that's how Mr. Satti tries a case. . . . He's dogged. He's a bulldog. He'll go ask something and he'll worry it to death and if he can't do it one way, he'll try it another and he'll ultimately wear you down."<p>

Scillieri laughs, "Mr. Satti? Oh, he's just a nice old grandpa."<p>

However, one of Satti's trial tactics, and Judge Ford's decisions, ultimately lead to Ross' death sentence being overturned. That concerns a confidential letter written by Dr. Robert Miller, the state's psychiatric witness, to Satti. In the third paragraph of the Feb. 15, 1987, "Dear Bob" letter sent to Satti just as jury selection was about to begin, Miller says, "After deliberation I can't see how I could testify against psychopathology playing a sufficient role in defendant's behavior to mitigate the type of penalty. If it had been only one or two incidents I could have held up, but the repetitive nature of the acts as well as past history of assaultive behavior make my (our) position untenable. Accordingly I must back out of the case, even if it is such a late date."<p>

Aware of his legal responsibility, Satti immediately turned over that paragraph to the defense. However, he did not turn over the first, second and fourth paragraphs until Ford ordered him to do so near the end of the guilt phase of the trial. In the first paragraph, Miller states that he has had a great deal of time "to go over in my mind how feasible the stand we had anticipated I would take might be." And the second paragraph states that the result of this rumination is a "demurral and a reverse of my earlier intemperate stand, which was based more on emotion than reason."<p>

Miller concludes with, "If it is of any assistance to you, I have had to see an ENT specialist several times recently, and will have to see him in a month again at which time I may have to enter a hospital for further tests, so you could tell the Court I have to be excused for reasons of health."<p>

"It is outrageous," says defense attorney Golub. "If this weren't a death penalty case and the prosecutor didn't turn this letter over and the state's witness wrote this kind of letter, there would be ethical hearings. This isn't a close question. Dr. Miller testified for the state in hundreds of cases. He was one of the leading state psychiatric experts in Connecticut for a long time and for him to write this type of letter and for him to write it as a `Dear Bob' letter and say here is my excuse for not testifying if you want to hide me, it's terrible."<p>

Satti says, "I can make no comment on your questions relating to Dr. Miller and his report and letter. In fairness, however, I'm sure you are aware that I called Dr. Miller as a witness fully expecting him to testify as to his opinion as to Mr. Ross' psychiatric condition; thus making him subject to full cross-examination by the defense. When defense counsel objected to his testimony about Mr. Ross, and was not willing to affirmatively waive any possible confidential communications, I did not further press the issue."<p>

The transcript reveals that Satti did indeed stop examining Miller because of the defense objection. However, Judge Ford said that there was no need for a waiver because the defense had raised insanity as a defense. Also, the defense had already withdrawn its objection.<p>

Later, at both the guilt and the penalty phase of Ross' trial, Ross' defense tried to introduce Miller's letter into evidence and both times Satti objected. Ford refused both times to let the letter in -- at the guilt phase because, Ford said, it went to mitigation, not guilt; and at the penalty hearing, because Miller was not present to testify. The defense did not want to call Miller because Satti would have been able to cross-examine his own witness. At the guilt phase of the trial, Satti had cleverly avoided asking Miller any questions about Ross himself.<p>

The result? The jury never heard the fact that Miller, the state's own witness, thought that Ross suffered from a mental disease, sexual sadism. Nor did they hear the most important testimony: that he felt there was mitigation and that the death penalty was not warranted.<p>

Ross was found guilty and sentenced to die in 1987. When the case was appealed, the high court threw out Ross' six death sentences in 1994 -- based on the fact that the judge hadn't let in Miller's letter or report.<p>

Initially Ross was outraged that the jury never heard about Miller's letter. However, he now says sarcastically that the irony is that had the jury heard the letter, it wouldn't have made any ultimate difference. They still would have found no mitigation despite the unanimity of the doctors, the high court would not have overturned his sentence, and he'd be dead by now.<p>

Ross doesn't understand why the court didn't just state that as a matter of law he had a mental illness, on which all the experts agreed. Had the high court done that or overturned his guilt as well as his sentence, Ross might have been willing to go through a new trial.<p>

"The Supreme Court made it easy for me," says Ross. "If I thought I had a shot of proving I was insane and a shot at spending the rest of my life in Whiting [the state hospital for the criminally insane] instead of a criminal setting like this, then I would have a difficult decision, because then I would have to weigh my rights and needs versus my responsibilities to the victims families." Ross also says that if offered a life sentence he would accept it, and then spend his life in prison being as productive as he could.<p>

Few are willing to comment on the broad question of whether Ross got a fair trial. Golub sees it in terms of all death penalty cases: "This is what happens because the stakes are so high. If you link that [the Miller letter] with the Hendel hearing, I've never heard such outrageous testimony from cops in my life. . . . The point is this:<p>

This is every death penalty case."<p>

Scillieri is more philosophical. "I'm not going to sit here and defend the system. . . . The system is just about as imperfect as the people that make it up, and that's just another reason why the death penalty is so atrocious."<p>

To Scillieri, the problem is that you don't have perfect knowledge or perfect jurors acting on behalf of a perfect just being. "So I guess what I'm telling you in the great run of cases, as much as it pained me being a lawyer in this particular case, I am not as aghast about what went on, but somebody can lose their life as a result of these imperfections. We ought to be really thinking about, given the fact that the system will always be imperfect, maybe even willfully derailed, we have to be very very careful about whether we are going to put someone's life at risk on the basis of the decisions of that system."<p>

<b>Today's Fantasies</b><br>
In the nine years since his trial, Ross has gone through many changes. The most significant was that he was put on anti-depressants and on other drugs that in effect chemically castrate him. He had been tortured by his violent fantasies for two years after the trial. The thought of being taken off one of the drugs, Depro-Lupron, is unthinkable. "I couldn't do life without it," says Ross.        With the medication, Ross has been able to do a lot of thinking, thinking about what he did, thinking about the parents of the victims, and has come to the conclusion that accepting death without another court trial is his moral obligation.<p>

To keep busy, he spends a lot of his time writing articles against the death penalty, learning to be a Braille transcriber, and promoting the death row support project through which he has found over 300 pen pals for death row inmates. He also helped establish the death row law library at Northern and continues to try to get donations of used books. Currently they are looking for an old set of U.S. Supreme Court Reporters.<p>

When he is in his cell, no longer plagued by the violent fantasies, Ross imagines himself back at Cornell with his first girlfriend, the one who had the abortion. In his dream world, "We had the baby, and we moved in together and got married. And we finished my junior and senior year with the baby. I'm quite the father, you know," he chuckles. "You see, she was an engineering student, so I used to take the baby with me to classes. I always had an easy time in my classes. . . . It was a good kid. It was a girl, Ashley. I was a student teacher for [agriculture] class, and I used to have a help class on Saturdays that the students would attend. I always brought Ashley there, and she was a big hit with the girls."<p>

And then there is reality, and he thinks of the parents of his victims, crying on the stand. "How can I even look at them?" he asks. "How can they ever forgive me?. . . . I can't even say I'm sorry. What if I killed your daughter? `I'm sorry.' You know how pitiful that sounds?"<p>

And then Michael Ross knows what he has to do. In his recent letter to the Law Tribune, he writes: "Right now I have nothing left except who I am, and I can't let anyone take that away from me, even if it costs me in how I am perceived by others. I have to do what I believe is the right thing to do, even if it is misinterpreted, misunderstood and/ or unappreciated by others -- to do anything less would be to betray who `Michael Ross' really is. . . . And ultimately, how I perceive myself is far more important than how others perceive me."<p>

Even if it means death.   <p>

<h2>Mulling the Death Penalty in Unabomber Case </h2><P>

By Charles Finnie<br>
Legal Times<br>
April 23, 1996<p>

WASHINGTON -- Since the April 3 arrest of Theodore Kaczynski, the university mathematician turned reclusive mountain man, Justice Department officials have managed to disclose a vast array of information explaining why they believe he is the elusive Unabomber. <p>

But there's one point department officials -- from the attorney general on down -- are keeping well under wraps: the prospect of invoking the federal death penalty for the Unabomber's 17-year terror campaign. <p>

"I can't comment on how this matter will proceed, except to say that we will take every step based on the evidence and the law," Attorney General Janet Reno said April 18 at her weekly news briefing. <p>

Although department officials are loath to acknowledge it, the silence reflects a lesson learned from its case against the two men charged with carrying out the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. <p>

Within hours of the Oklahoma City explosion, Reno vowed that she would move to execute those responsible. "The death penalty is available, and we will seek it," she said, looking to assure a shocked nation -- and seemingly running roughshod over a policy she issued less than three months earlier on how the department would deliberate in cases eligible for capital punishment. <p>

If that isn't reason enough to keep mum, another uncomfortable factor looms when considering the death penalty for the Unabomber. <p>

The Kaczynski family early in their dealings with the Federal Bureau of Investigation voiced objections to capital punishment, says Tony Bisceglie, the Washington lawyer who serves as an intermediary between the Kaczynskis and the FBI. And although they were in no position to "negotiate a guaranteed outcome," Bisceglie says, the family no doubt will remind Reno that she has her suspect in jail only by the grace of Kaczynski's brother, whose suspicions eventually enabled the FBI to make its arrest. <p>

"Let's be frank here," says Bisceglie. "There is only one person who could have brought him to the attention of the government, and it was David [Kaczynski]." <p>

A final reason for the tight lips on the death penalty is that, while lawyers in the case are reviewing potential statutory schemes for invoking capital punishment, it remains to be seen on what charges the evidence is strongest -- and whether the federal interest in the prosecution could be better served by a swifter, non-capital case, which could still put the accused perpetrator behind bars for decades, if not for life. <p>

Across the country, capital defense lawyers, who are keenly interested in how the attorney general has wielded the federal death penalty since its modifications and expansion in the 1994 crime bill, are watching the case closely. <p>

Recalling Reno's "hang 'em high" rhetoric in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, the attorney general has won praise from the defense bar for keeping quiet as the Unabomber case unfolds. <p>

"I can only compliment them on learning their lesson," says Gerald Goldstein, of San Antonio, Texas, the immediate past president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. <p>

Goldstein, however, was quick to add that Reno's silence is in marked contrast to the "flood of leaks" on evidentiary matters emanating from her department, a point Goldstein says is an embarrassment to Reno. <p>

"There will come a day when a court is going to toss out a serious case because of that kind of behavior," he predicts. <p>

On Friday, a judge in Helena, Mont., rejected a defense motion filed on Kaczynski's behalf asking that the planned grand jury proceedings in the case be halted because news leaks have compromised chances for an impartial hearing. Kaczynski's Montana counsel declined comment for this article, citing a local court rule forbidding discussion of criminal cases in the media. <p>

The bottom line of any behind-the-scenes death penalty deliberations is made abundantly clear, however, in the procedures themselves, which Reno issued on Jan. 27, 1995. If an indictment allowing for capital punishment is returned against Kaczynski, it will fall to the attorney general herself to make the final call in yet another hot case -- and perhaps during the heat of a presidential campaign. <p>

According to defense lawyers, legal scholars and former Justice Department officials, Reno's ultimate decision on the death penalty is an open question, given what is known about Kaczynski and what still remains to be seen of his legal defense. <p>

And a department summary of its death penalty-eligible cases in 1994 and 1995 offers few clues about the ultimate outcome. <p>

It shows Reno has authorized an increasing number of capital cases, but suggests she will accept life sentences in some of these cases in exchange for guilty pleas. What's more, she has withdrawn official notices of intent to seek capital punishment in pending cases and, at least once, did so over the objections of a U.S. attorney. <p>

As applied to the Unabomber case, the procedures, known as U.S. Attorney's Manual 9-10, call for the lead prosecutor, Robert Cleary, the top New Jersey assistant U.S. attorney, to invite Kaczynski's defense counsel to meet and present arguments against capital punishment. Kaczynski is currently being represented by Michael Donahoe and Tony Gallagher of the nonprofit Federal Defenders of Montana. <p>

Regardless of whether Cleary chooses to proceed further, the rules call for him to prepare a prosecution memorandum to be submitted to the chief of the department's Criminal Division. The document is supposed to include a comprehensive discussion of the government's theory of liability in the case; facts and evidence covering any aggravating and mitigating factors set forth in the death penalty provisions of the 1994 crime bill; biographical and criminal data on the defendant; and any justification for a federal, as opposed to a state, prosecution. <p>

One thing the rules don't allow Justice prosecutors to do is use the threat of a death sentence as leverage in seeking a plea from the defendant. <p>

Cleary did not return a telephone message seeking comment. <p>

If he were to choose to press for a death penalty authorization from Main Justice, a capital punishment review panel -- made up of Reno and Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick, or their designees -- would be convened. That body must invite defense counsel to make a second presentation. <p>

Following a recommendation from the review panel, which is supposed to be completed within 15 days, it is left to the attorney general to authorize or reject the filing of a death penalty notice. <p>

Capital defense specialists are suspicious of the review process, particularly in high-profile cases, and in the politically charged context of the death penalty. <p>

That sentiment is held strongest perhaps by lawyers for the Oklahoma City bombing defendants, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. <p>

"We declined to participate on the basis that the procedure is a sham and the decision was already made," says Robert Nigh Jr., one of three court-appointed lawyers for McVeigh. <p>

To support the charge, Nigh, a solo practitioner and former assistant federal public defender in Nebraska, cites post-bombing comments by Reno and President Bill Clinton. Indeed, the Justice Department hasn't as yet put the legal implications of the post-explosion comments in the Oklahoma City
blast behind it. A hearing is scheduled May 1 in Denver on a bid by the bombing defendants, McVeigh and Nichols, to block capital punishment in their case. <p>

In the motion, their lawyers claim Reno prejudged the matter, thereby violating her own procedures for authorizing the death penalty -- and, by extension, the due process rights of McVeigh and Nichols. <p>

Nigh says that an acceptable alternative to the procedures for the Oklahoma City case would be for the courts to appoint a special prosecutor or commission to decide the question. <p>

The Justice Department has countered Nigh's claims in court papers. The department argues the attorney general's guidelines confer no due process rights on criminal defendants. <p>

The department also contends that the procedures were properly followed in the case, regardless of the post-bomb statements. <p>

Another defense lawyers says that he has had a better experience with the process. <p>

David Ruhnke, a leading New Jersey capital defense specialist, has appeared twice before the Justice Department death penalty review panel.

"I can't in good conscience call it a rubber stamp," says Ruhnke, of West Orange's Ruhnke & Barrett. <p>

In 1995, Ruhnke succeeded in convincing the attorney general to reject the death penalty for a client charged in a drug-related killing, although the U.S. attorney in Pennsylvania prosecuting the case argued for authorization. <p>

Yet, Ruhnke adds, he is under no delusions that the attorney general would find it easy to reach a similar conclusion in the case against Kaczynski, given the three deaths and 23 injuries that FBI agents have ascribed to the Unabomber. <p>

"In a sense, it is like Oklahoma City," he says. "You've got national attention and the politics of the death penalty. I would be surprised if they're not predisposed, and would have to be talked out of it." <p>

George Kendall, the top death penalty lawyer at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., which has a long tradition of monitoring and intervening in state capital punishment cases, expressed little faith Reno would reject the death penalty in the Unabomber case, if confronted with political pressure to seek it. <p>

"I don't care what policies you have in place," Kendall says. "Objective criteria go out the window." <p>

Stephen Bright, of the Southern Center for Human Rights in Atlanta, applauds Reno for setting up the procedures, but he says he remains skeptical of their value to defendants. <p>

"It is hard to imagine they will be able to resist, with the publicity," Bright says of a decision in the Unabomber case. "Nothing drives the death penalty like publicity." <p>

<b>Poetic Justice</b><br>
For the man accused of being the Unabomber, there may be poetic justice in the statute under which federal prosecutors are most likely to seek an indictment. <p>

18 U.S.C. 1716, a Postal Service measure, was signed into law in 1948, but was based on statutes dating back to 1909, before the modern-day technology the Unabomber rails against took hold. <p>

Although the statute's criminal ban on mailing "injurious articles" covers explosives, it is first and foremost concerned with organic matter -- specifically poisons and poisonous animals, reptiles, and insects, and live scorpions in particular.<p>

Each intentional violation of the statute that results in injury is punishable by a $10,000 fine or a 20-year prison sentence. The death penalty, carried out by lethal injection, or life in prison without parole is available if a victim is killed. <p>

A five-year statute of limitation, however, means prosecution under the measure for much of the Unabomber's mail -bombing campaign is foreclosed. The statute would be available for two 1993 bombings, which injured a University of California geneticist and a Yale computer scientist, and for two fatal blasts in 1994 and 1995. The latter killed New Jersey public relations executive Thomas Mosser and California forestry industry representative Gilbert Murray. <p>

To invoke the death penalty, the government also would be required to prove one of several aggravating factors established by the 1994 crime bill. Killings involving "substantial planning" is one factor the department would consider. <p>

One former Republican Justice Department official is not yet sold that the government will, or even should, seek the death penalty for Kaczynski. <p>

And no matter what the decision, says George Terwilliger, the second in command at the Justice Department during President George Bush's administration, federal prosecutors have no reason to rush. <p>

Terwilliger says gauging the death penalty, as well as potential prison sentences set out in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, will be just two of many considerations in the government's prosecution strategy. <p>

The primary question, he says, will be venue: "Where is the strongest case?" He adds that the department also would want to "preserve the options presented by multiple prosecutions," whether in various federal districts or by cooperating with state prosecutors. <p>

Given the criminal penalties in the postal statute and related measures, "there seems enough evidence to convict him of serious crimes in the District of Montana, put him away for a long time, and vindicate the federal interest," Terwilliger says. <p>

Terwilliger also parts company with many defense lawyers on the inevitability of politics coming to bear on the death penalty question. <p>

"People died. Public opinion is relevant. He created terror. He killed purposely," Terwilliger says of the Unabomber. "But it is not a slam dunk. There is a political focus to any decision an attorney general makes. Yet, I would guess it would not be a major focus." <p>

Although Justice Department officials declined comment for this article, a summary of recent death penalty cases released by its public affairs office suggests that Reno, who personally opposes capital punishment, has nonetheless not been reluctant to employ it as attorney general. <p>

According to the figures, Reno authorized the federal death penalty for 38 defendants during her first three years on the job, which is more than half the total number approved since 1990. <p>

In 1995, after passage of the 1994 crime bill, which expanded and established new evidentiary standards for the federal death penalty, Reno authorized it for nine new defendants. But she also moved to withdraw from seeking it against five defendants, according to the summary. None has actually been executed. <p>

Paul Rothstein, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, says the figures suggest the department is deliberating carefully, and he applauds Reno for imposing a centralized mechanism that serves to insulate decisions from local passions and prejudice. <p>

"I think it is inevitable there will be some political influence, and political influence is abominable in a death penalty decision," says Rothstein. <p>

Rothstein agrees with Terwilliger that the death penalty question in the Unabomber case will not be a political test for Reno. <p>

"Oklahoma City was a test, but Kaczynski is far more complicated," he says. "He is obviously nuts, which is a mitigating factor. I just don't think there is going to be the coalescence of public opinion. It's a vastly different case. I think the procedures will work." <p>

Rothstein still sees a virtue in the procedural alternative offered by the lawyers for the accused Oklahoma City bombers, however. <p>

"The best solution to political influence would be an independent commission or committee totally insulated, say with lifetime tenure, older folks with no reputation to make or break -- and made up of every conceivable shade," he says. <p>

Yet with no such proposals on the horizon in Congress and with the Supreme Court having yet to hear an appeal of the new federal death penalty, the decision is certain to fall to Reno. <p>

And that sets up the possibility of a peculiar first for the attorney general, if, in fact, Cleary, the New Jersey prosecutor leading the case, moves for the death penalty for Kaczynski. <p>

Bisceglie, the white collar and civil litigator who is the Kaczynski family's go-between with the FBI, says he expects to participate in any formal Justice Department death penalty review on the case. It remains to be seen whether that would include an actual appearance at the review committee meetings.<p>

<h2>Habeas Bill May Boomerang at First </h2><P>

By Deborah Yaffe<br>
The Recorder<br>
April 22, 1996<p>

Ready or not, federal habeas corpus reform is finally here. <p>

To prosecutors, the anti-terrorism bill that President Bill Clinton may sign as early as today will usher in a bright new morning of efficient and fair criminal justice. To defense lawyers, the future looks more like a dark night of draconian restrictions on fundamental rights. <p>

Ironically, though, both supporters and opponents agree the initial effect of the bill, which many describe as poorly drafted, is likely to be litigation-spurred delays in executions -- even though the bill was pushed by conservatives fed up with the slow grinding of the capital punishment machinery. <p>

"All the little 'ands' and 'ors' are going to be challenged," predicted Richard Dieter, executive director of the anti-capital punishment Death Penalty Information Center. "Every word will be challenged." <p>

The anti-terrorism bill aims to cut down delays at both ends of the capital habeas process, requiring federal judges to rule on capital cases within months and for the first time giving inmates a time limit for filing federal habeas petitions. <p>

For most inmates, the time limit is a year;  for death row prisoners, the window narrows to six months if states adopt procedures for appointing and paying competent counsel to handle state -- though not federal -- post-conviction work. And the bill raises the standard for submitting a second habeas petition, requiring inmates to convince a panel of judges that any subsequent petition contains compelling new evidence of innocence. <p>

But most important, say both supporters and foes of the new law, the anti-terrorism bill would require federal judges to defer in most cases to state courts' interpretations of the federal Constitution -- potentially turning federal habeas review into little more than a once-over-lightly look at past decisions. <p>

The new bill is a true reform of an out-of-control process, say prosecutors. Fourteen years after President Ronald Reagan first proposed such changes, "the credibility of our criminal justice system is even more strained by the rampant abuse of habeas corpus by convicted criminals -- particularly death row inmates," California Attorney General Dan Lungren wrote Clinton last week. <p>

Lungren and his capital case coordinator, Deputy Attorney General Dane Gillette, have been vocal backers of habeas reform. <p>

But defense lawyers say the bill is a dangerous retreat from fundamental rights. <p>

"You're not allowing the final arbitrators of the federal Constitution to enforce its provisions," said San Francisco solo practitioner Timothy Foley, who is currently handling three capital cases. "I hope we're not going back to a Civil War-era situation where the states simply do what they want and there's no safety net." <p>

Whatever its pros and cons, the new law likely won't start to bite -- or to speed up the executions of the nation's 3,061 death row inmates -- until after years of litigation over its meaning, say those on both sides of the issue. <p>

"It's not an extremely well-written law," acknowledged Kent Scheidegger of Sacramento's Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, which supports the measure. <p>

The bill leaves open a host of important questions, including whether its time limits apply retroactively, barring the federal courthouse door to prisoners whose state convictions became final more than a year ago. <p>

Nor is it clear, say some opponents, that California's procedure for appointing and paying appellate counsel for death row inmates will meet the bill's requirements, and therefore activate the most stringent time limits on filing. <p>

And some, including Northern District Chief Judge Thelton Henderson, say Congress' effort to tell the federal courts how to organize their calendars and evaluate state court findings could violate separation of powers. <p>

The bill could also face another constitutional problem, some argue: Article I, 9 of the Constitution provides that "the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended" except in time of rebellion or invasion. <p>

"There will be an argument that these restrictions so much choke off the ability to seek habeas corpus that they violate the suspension clause," said Charles Weisselberg, clinical professor at the University of Southern California Law Center. <p>

But that argument could run into historical problems: The right to habeas review was extended to state prisoners only after the Civil War. And Scheidegger argues that the absolute constitutional right applies only before trial, not after conviction. <p>

<b>The Squeeze Is On</b><br>

If the law's provisions survive intact, the new squeeze on federal habeas will start with the shortened filing times. Glendale solo practitioner Tracy Dressner, a former death penalty law clerk in the Central District of California, just took on a capital case with an 11,000-page record. Even if she does nothing but read all day long, Dressner said, she won't finish the transcripts for six weeks, a big chunk out of a six-month filing time. <p>

"You haven't talked to your client, haven't done any investigation, haven't started writing," Dressner said. "It's just not practical if you have attorneys who have any other kind of practice." <p>

At least defense lawyers can have the comfort of knowing that judges will face similar pressure. <p>

The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals has already begun assessing the bill's likely impact, said Chief Judge Procter Hug Jr., and especially the impact the new time limits will have on pending cases. <p>

Those new limits, which give district judges six months and appeals courts four months to rule on capital habeas petitions, are significantly shorter than current practice. <p>

According to statistics compiled last year for the Federal Judicial Center, between 1988 and 1994 district courts in the Ninth Circuit took an average of 520 days -- more than 17 months -- to dispose of capital habeas cases, and the appellate court took an average of 214 days, or about seven months. <p>

Nationwide, over the past 20 years, executions have taken place an average of eight years after conviction, Dieter said, although it is not clear how much of that time is taken up with federal proceedings. <p>

The new bill specifies that its provisions apply to pending capital cases, and it bars judges from evading the new limits "because of general congestion of the court's calendar." <p>

The upshot is bound to be a big squeeze on already crowded dockets, say judges and lawyers, as Congress shows no signs of allocating more money to add judgeships. <p>

"If we make this our priority and tell the people with important intellectual property cases we'll get around to them when we can, sure, we can do it," said the Northern District's Henderson. <p>

Such a trade-off is inevitable, he said, "unless you assume we're playing golf half the time. We're working our butts off -- and you can quote that."
<p>
But the scheduling crunch need not occur if federal judges take seriously the new deference standard, said the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation's Scheidegger. The bill requires federal judges considering habeas petitions to defer to state findings unless those findings are based on "an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law." <p>

"To look over somebody else's decision and say that it's within reason is a much simpler and faster task than redeciding the questions yourself," Scheidegger said. <p>

That's just what worries opponents of the new bill, who note that federal courts currently overturn convictions or sentences in 40 percent of the capital cases they review. <p>

"It's like judicial good faith: If they tried hard enough and they got close, it's good enough," said Lawrence Gibbs of Berkeley's Grossman & Gibbs, who does federal and state habeas work but not capital cases. "What's the point of a constitutional right if the state court can get it wrong and you
nonetheless have no remedy?" <p>

Hug, the Ninth Circuit chief judge, also voices concern about the deference standard. <p>

"When we're deciding a question of law by giving deference to someone else's decision of law, you're really not deciding the law," Hug said. "You're deciding how bad the misinterpretation might have been." <p>

But such concerns imply that state courts do a poor job of protecting constitutional rights -- and that's an inaccurate view, say supporters of the new law. <p>

"Very often, the criticism tends to be inflated and perhaps exaggerated based upon examples that are years old," said Gillette, the deputy AG who coordinates capital cases for the state. <p>

In California, Gillette insists, capital cases are tried exhaustively and scrutinized carefully on appeal. Under Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas, the state Supreme Court has rarely overturned capital convictions or sentences -- although the federal courts have overruled them in some cases. <p>

Scheidegger, too, says that the wrongly convicted innocents who populate the arguments of habeas reform opponents are largely fictional. But he acknowledges that an occasional mistake may slip through the cracks. <p>

"Any time you cut back on review, you're going to have a few more wrong decisions," he said. "You're going to have a few more errors in the state's favor and a few less errors in defendants' favor." <p>

That's an argument defense lawyers find hard to take. <p>

"The reason why it is so offensive is that there is not one person in the world who is willing to accept that argument if they're the one person, or their kid is, who pays the price," said Dennis Riordan of San Francisco's Riordan & Rosenthal. "It will be somebody who is black or poor, and it won't be me." <p>

<h2>New York Governor and District Attorney Battle Over Death Penalty</h2><P>

Staff Reports<br>
April 19, 1996<p>

The legal battle between New York Governor George Pataki and a local prosecutor over the state's death penalty is heading to court.<p>

District Attorney Robert Johnson of the Bronx has sued the governor for removing him from a case involving the fatal shooting of a police officer. Johnson was taken off the case when he refused to make a commitment to seek the death penalty against the killers of Officer Kevin Gillespie. The governor assigned state Attorney General Dennis Vacco to the case.<p>

In his lawsuit, Johnson argued that "the governor seeks to use the power of his office to impose on prosecutors throughout the state his beliefs as to the appropriateness of the death penalty, both in general and in any given case."<p>

Johnson claims New York's capital punishment law does not require district attorneys to consider execution in first-degree murder cases if they choose not to. New York reinstated the death penalty in March 1995.<p>

The public feud between Johnson and Pataki has raised questions about the breadth of the governor's authority, the limits of prosecutorial discretion and the rights of voters to be represented by the prosecutor of their choice.<p>

<b>Shoot-Out in The Bronx</b><br>
The controversy erupted following Gillespie's murder on March 14. Police say Angel Diaz and two friends, Jesus Mendez and Ricardo Morales, hijacked a car, pistol-whipped and robbed a pedestrian and led police on a chase that ended in a shoot-out in the Bronx. Gillespie was shot to death and five other people, including another police officer and Diaz, were wounded. <p>

Soon after the shooting, Gov. Pataki demanded to know whether Johnson would seek the death penalty against Gillespie's killers.<p>

Johnson, who had publicly expressed his opposition to the death penalty,  promised to weigh all the facts before making a decision. He argued that the law gives district attorneys 120 days from the time of an indictment to decide whether to seek the death penalty.<p>

But the governor was convinced that Johnson never would bring a death penalty case in the Bronx, and removed him on March 21. <p>

"We cannot have different standards and different laws in different parts of this state," Pataki said at the time. "We cannot have the death penalty in New York state except the Bronx."<p>

Diaz was indicted April 16 on charges of first-degree murder, attempted murder, criminal possession of a weapon among other charges. Mendez and Morales were charged with second-degree murder, attempted murder and other charges. Diaz is the only suspect who may face the death penalty.<p>

Following Diaz's indictment, Vacco stopped short of promising to seek the death penalty. But he said that his prosecutors had not yet found any reason not to pursue the death penalty and that they would rely on Diaz's lawyers to provide them with any such information. <p>

"As I stand here today, I have not arrived at any judgment," Vacco said at a news conference. "But it is clear that on first blush, there are potential aggravating factors that would qualify this case for death penalty prosecution."<p>

Vacco said the New York State Constitution clearly grants the governor the authority to replace prosecutors who refused to uphold the law. Johnson fell into that category, he said, when he closed his mind to consideration of the death penalty. <p>

<h2>Shargel Diary - Part 1</h2>

[Editor's Note: Gerald Shargel is considered one of the nation's top criminal defense lawyers. He's agreed to share some of his thoughts and views as he defends accused murderer Chen Jia Wu in a case that could result in the death penalty.]<p>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT ALIGN=ABSBOTTOM SRC=shargel.gif BORDER=0>

<b>February 6, 1996</b><p>

Late last year, I agreed to accept an assignment from Federal Judge Edward Korman in what was described as a "death eligible" case. A young Chinese man, Chen Jia Wu, who would become my client, was charged, along with three co-defendants, in the kidnapping-murder of a young Chinese woman. According to the indictment, the charge under 18 U.S.C. Section 1203 was that the murder victim and two others were held for ransom. All of the defendants entered pleas of not guilty.<P>

The case is described as "death eligible" because under Justice Department protocol, an elaborate review must occur before a committee in Washington decides whether or not to seek the death penalty. The determination starts with the local United States Attorney's Office which makes its non-binding recommendation to Justice. At both the local and Justice stage of review, defense counsel has the opportunity to make a presentation in an effort to persuade the government attorneys against asking for the death penalty. At present, my case is under consideration by the local U.S. Attorney's Office.<p>

Although I have been in a criminal defense practice for more than 26 years, and although I have handled a number of murder cases, I never before had a death penalty, or "death eligible" case. I practice in New York, where, until last September, there has been no death penalty since I began trying major cases. In the federal court, death penalty cases are still in the embryo stage.<p>

Where I have defended many cases where the penalty was life without parole, I now find it to be quite true that, as the Supreme Court has said, "death is different."  The responsibility I have undertaken in awesome, and I feel the difference. I have discovered that there is a whole universe of common knowledge about death penalty strategy that it not found in any case or book. Fortunately, each of the lawyers assigned to the case has the benefit of a "death penalty expert."<p>

I will never forget, in one of the earliest conversations with the expert, I suggested a particular strategy which would have made sense in any conventional case. Based on his vast experience, the expert told me that my strategy would be a mistake and I'll never forget these words: "You'll get your guy killed. After trying about a hundred cases in federal court, I don't scare easily. But that one statement made me scared as hell and brought me to the point where I do nothing without thinking and rethinking the consequences, not only in defending the case, as I usually do, but in thinking ahead to what might--barring an acquittal--be the death penalty phase of the trial.<p>

<h2>Mumia Abu-Jamal Sues NPR, Claiming Censorship</h2><P>

By Staff Reports<br>
March 26, 1996<p>

Mumia Abu -Jamal, a nationally-known journalist serving a death sentence for the murder of a Philadelphia police officer, says National Public Radio violated his First Amendment rights.<p>

In a civil lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, the former radio journalist contends that NPR decided not to run a recorded broadcast of his death-row commentary for the show ''All Things Considered'' in 1994 because of political pressure from the Fraternal Order of Police and  U.S. Sen. Robert Dole.<p>
The lawsuit seeks $1.5 million in punitive damages from NPR and the airing of Abu-Jamal's recordings.<p>

Abu -Jamal contends that NPR canceled the program after Sen. Dole threatened its funding.<p>

In May 1994, Senator Dole denounced NPR and threatened closer Congressional oversight and reduction of NPR's funding because of NPR's initial decision to broadcast Mr. Jamal's commentaries, according to the lawsuit. <p>

In a 1995 speech delivered on the Senate floor, Senator Dole asserted that NPR's abrupt reversal of its decision to air Mr. Jamal's commentaries was due to pressure brought to bear by members of Congress, including himself, the lawsuit alleges.<p>

The suit contends that NPR has also failed to honor repeated requests from Abu-Jamal that his recordings be released to him and the project.<p>

In a public statement, NPR officials said the decision not to air the commentaries was editorial discretion, not censorship. <p>

Abu-Jamal, convicted in 1982 of killing Philadelphia Police Officer Daniel Faulkner, has become a prison author and celebrity whose case has drawn international attention. <p>

Earlier this year, his lawyers asked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to overturn his conviction. Abu-Jamal's defense team contends that his original lawyer botched his defense in 1982; that the trial judge was biased against the defendant; and that new evidence suggested someone else killed Faulkner in 1981. The court is expected to issue a ruling sometime this summer.<p>

<h2>Ruling on Death-Penalty Jurors Prompts Sharp Dissents</h2><P>

By Don J. DeBenedictis<br>
Associate Editor<br>
Fulton County Daily Report<br>
March 19, 1996<p>

Over a pair of sharp dissents, the Georgia Supreme Court has upheld a death penalty imposed by a jury from which the trial judge excluded five people who had doubts about capital punishment.<p>

The majority held that even if there were "ambiguities" during jury selection, the trial judge's decisions could not be overturned easily.<p>

In this case, Superior Court Judge E. Mullins Whisnant of the Chattahoochee Judicial Circuit "undertook an exhaustive and conscientious effort to determine whether [the prospective jurors'] views on the death-penalty would prevent or substantially impair the performance of their duties," Justice George H. Carley wrote for the five-justice majority.<p>

It does not matter, Carley continued, that "at some point during voir dire, each of the prospective jurors may have given answers, which, if considered in isolation, would indicate that his or her opposition to the death penalty was not 'automatic.' " Greene v. State, No. S95P1366 (Sup. Ct. Ga. decided March 15, 1996).<p>

In a lengthy dissent, Chief Justice Robert Benham blasted Whisnant's "practice of removing for cause any prospective juror with serious concerns about imposing the death penalty" as "plainly unconstitutional."<p>

He said the majority's deference to the trial judge's decisions "is a dramatic departure from precedent" that "seriously undermines" the Supreme Court's ability to review the removal of potential jurors.<p>

Justice Leah J. Sears concurred in Benham's dissent and went on to write a second, short dissenting opinion of her own. In it, Sears criticized the majority for basing its decision solely on a U.S. Supreme Court decision, Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412 (1985), but not on Georgia cases interpreting that opinion. Under those later cases, "each of the five prospective jurors was qualified to serve, and ... the trial court committed reversible error in ruling otherwise," Sears wrote.<p>

The dissents concerned only the imposition of the death penalty. All seven justices of the Supreme Court voted to uphold the defendant's convictions for murder, aggravated assault and armed robbery.<p>

The defendant, Daniel Greene, was accused of robbing a convenience store in Taylor County and of fatally stabbing a customer and wounding the store clerk. Although he had apparently confessed at one point, at trial he contended that he remembered only having a severe headache inside the store after smoking a cigarette given him by an acquaintance, according to the majority opinion.<p>

In the appeal of Greene's conviction and sentence, the defense listed 30 potential errors made by the trial court, including that the five prospective jurors "were disqualified merely for expressing 'qualms' about the death penalty or for 'leaning' toward a life sentence," according to the majority opinion.<p>

But Carley indicated that Whisnant had apparently found more than qualms or leanings. He stressed that trial judges may remove potential jurors even if the jurors' opposition to capital punishment "may not appear with 'unmistakable clarity.' "<p>

"The relevant inquiry is whether the trial court's finding that the proper standard for death- penalty disqualification was met as to each of the prospective jurors is 'fairly supported' by the record 'considered as a whole,' " Carley wrote, joined by Justices Carol W. Hunstein, Hugh P. Thompson and P. Harris Hines.<p>

Justice Norman S. Fletcher concurred specially, but without writing an opinion. Hunstein dissented from another portion of Carley's opinion, also without writing separately.<p>

In his dissent, Benham quoted extensively from the record to show that it supported retaining at least four of the five prospective jurors. Those four "unambiguously indicated on voir dire that they could vote to impose a death sentence in an appropriate case," he wrote.<p>

For instance, one said "unequivocally and repeatedly" she could vote for death in the right circumstances. Another said she "could" vote for death although she had "misgivings" about sending someone to the electric chair, according to Benham.<p>

But misgivings and doubts aren't enough, Benham argued. A juror cannot be excused because he or she "would have difficulty imposing a death sentence, has qualms about the death penalty or is leaning toward a life sentence," he wrote, citing a 1992 Georgia Supreme Court decision, Jarrell v. State, 261 Ga. 880.<p>

"To eliminate from the venire all persons voicing such scruples is to distort the 'conscience of the community' which the jury is assembled to express. ... Execution of a death sentence imposed by a jury of such skewed composition would unconstitutionally deprive the defendant of life without due process of law," the chief justice wrote.<p>

In separate portions of their dissents, Benham and Sears both disagreed with another aspect of Carley's opinion. Carley had rejected a challenge by the defense to biblical references the prosecutor, then-District Attorney Douglas C. Pullen, made in arguing for a death sentence.<p>

Carley held that the prosecutor's argument consisted "entirely of references to principles of divine law related to the penological justifications for the death penalty, including ... retribution and ... mercy. It is just this type of argument that was found to be authorized" by earlier opinions.<p>

Benham noted that the prosecutor had described himself as "a plain old country Baptist" and cited the Sermon on the Mount and the Old Testament's call for an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. Pullen is now a Superior Court judge.<p>

"[T]he improprieties in this case were of such magnitude that there is a reasonable probability that they may have altered the outcome of the sentencing phase," Benham wrote.<p>

Sears said those references in the closing argument amounted to "inflammatory appeals to the private religious beliefs of the jurors, and were therefore improper."<p>

<h2>Should Death Sentence Be a Judgment By Default?</h2><P>

By Lisa Brennan<br>
New Jersey Law Journal<br>
February 19, 1996<p>

Since New Jersey restored the death penalty in 1982, the state Supreme Court has dealt with almost every issue that could arise in a death penalty case, but always in the context of appeals of death row prisoners who wanted to stop their executions.<p>

The question the Court has never dealt with, but will deal with very soon, is whether the state -- as executioner -- has a duty to ensure that a murderer who wants to be executed was properly convicted. Whether the justices decide that question as a matter of law or as one of public policy, John Martini Sr.'s fate hangs in the balance.<p>

Last week, Superior Court Judge Bruce Gaeta found the 65-year-old convicted murderer competent to abandon his post- conviction relief applications. Gaeta, who sits in Hackensack, decided the case on narrow grounds: Since Martini had discharged the state Public Defender as his lawyer, that office had no authority to proceed with post-conviction relief. Martini has a court-appointed lawyer who's arguing for death. Thus, in Gaeta's eyes, the public defender is a lawyer without a client.<p>

The standing issue seems clear enough, but the larger question -- which Gaeta was content to leave to the high court - - is whether technical issues like standing should determine whether a man lives or dies when there may be grounds for reversal of the underlying conviction.<p>

Stated differently, should the question of life or death be decided finally on the merits or as a judgment by default?<p>

During two days of hearings last week, Assistant Deputy Public Defender William Smith argued that post-conviction relief applications should continue regardless of Martini's wishes or a determination of competence. Smith maintained that three Supreme Court decisions -- taken together -- permit a defense lawyer to present defenses and mitigating evidence regardless of whether the client consents: State v. Hightower, 214 N.J. Super. 43 (App. Div. 1986); State v. Koedatich, 98 N.J. 553 (1984) and 112 N.J. 225 (1988); and State v. Preciose, 129 N.J. 451 (1992).<p>

Saying he expects his ruling to be appealed, Gaeta refrained from setting an execution date. Indeed, Deputy Public Defender Claudia Van Wyk in Hackensack said her office would appeal to the state Supreme Court, which in December 1994 upheld Martini's conviction and death sentence in the murder of Irving Flax. That ruling ended the two-stage, direct review process required under New Jersey law.<p>

Martini is one of 10 inmates on New Jersey's death row. Four have undergone direct and proportionality reviews, a fifth is in the proportionality review stage, and five inmates are in the direct review stage. Nine of the 10 post-conviction defendants' cases have been handled by the Public Defender's Office, a 20-year-old organization of 210 attorneys,  38 of whom handle capital defense cases.<p>

<b>Similar Cases Nationwide</b><br>

Although Martini is the first capital defendant in New Jersey to be permitted to forgo further appeals, similar cases are common across the country, and generally state courts favor curtailing appeals. Of the 318 people executed since 1977, 36 abandoned their appeals and asked to die; five of the first eight people executed had abandoned their appeals, according to George Kendall, assistant counsel to the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund's Capital Punishment Project.<p>

At this point in Martini's case, Van Wyk will assert that the law requires her office to carry on and raise new claims over Martini's objections. "It's an indispensable part of the process," Van Wyk said. "If you read other cases, you'll see people often change their minds. And once the machinery of death is set in motion, you can't turn it on and off like a faucet."<p>

Kendall agrees with that assessment. He said it's common for capital defendants to change their minds after they have decided to abandon their appeals,  forcing lawyers to navigate through a narrow ethical corridor. "There's the issue of how the law handles this, and then there's the issue of how lawyers handle these issues," Kendall said Thursday. "The much more difficult question is what you do as a lawyer when you're placed in this position. It's like trying to figure out a Rubik's Cube.<p>

"Every client I've dealt with loses hope. They're living in a room the size of a bathroom. I've had eight or nine clients who've said they can't continue their appeals anymore. It's the only control they have left over their lives.<p>

"As it turned out, they all changed their minds."<p>

Gaeta left plenty of room Wednesday for Martini to change his mind. In a reference to Valentine's Day, he said: "I make this decision with a heavy heart on a day when the heart is prominent in our minds. If you change your mind, Mr. Martini, Mr. Smith [the public defender] is only a telephone call away."<p>

Martini was as resolute in his death wish Wednesday as Irving Flax's widow was thrilled at Gaeta's decision to let Martini die. Marilyn Flax was in the courtroom while Gaeta read his opinion. Flax was the man Martini admitted to having kidnapped and shot three times in Paramus in 1989 after collecting a $25,000 ransom.<p>

Shackled at the ankles, Martini took the stand to answer questions by his lawyer, Alan Zegas, that probed his mental state. Using mostly monosyllabic words, Martini said he grew up in the Bronx with two sisters and two brothers, had an eighth grade education, was married and had four children, had worked as a truck driver, went into real estate rehabilitating old houses and eventually ran a bar in Arizona until he got into legal trouble. He said he was divorced eight or nine years ago and hasn't heard much from his children since, but received a Christmas card from one daughter two months ago and talks to his former wife occasionally from prison.<p>

<b>Seeking Absolution</b><br>

Then Martini talked about two murders he committed in Arizona in 1988 and the killing of Flax. "Why did you kill him [Irving Flax]?" asked Zegas.<p>

"Because I knew him," Martini said.<p>

Asked why he wanted to be executed, Martini said: "Jail's a bad place. Food's bad. Extortion. Stabbings. Lots of noise. Rats and mice. Dirty. Absolution." Did he understand he would die? "Yeah." Martini said he had thought about his decision for two years and that anti-psychotic drugs he was taking for schizophrenia had not clouded his judgment. Asked by Gaeta why he wanted to die, Martini said he wanted to repent for his wrongdoing. "Penance. I think I should be punished," he said.
<p>
Martini, who said he is a Roman Catholic, argued he was seeking death on religious grounds to obtain absolution.
<p>
Gaeta also heard testimony from court-appointed psychiatrist Azariah Eshkenaze of Forest Hills, N.Y., and psychiatrist Kenneth Weiss of King of Prussia, Pa., who was hired by the Public Defender's Office. Eshkenaze testified that he found Martini's drug treatment for chronic schizophrenia did not impair his ability to make a rational decision. Weiss said he found that the drugs and depression clouded Martini's judgment, but he would not pronounce Martini incompetent.
<p>
The expert questioning grew testy shortly after it began Tuesday afternoon. After Eshkenaze, who is being paid by the Public Defender's Office, gave direct testimony, assistant public defender Smith asked him on cross-examination why he billed for 9.5 hours when he only spent 1.5 hours with Martini. "The rest was travel time," said Eshkenaze, who met with Martini in a Philadelphia prison, where Martini is awaiting trial on another murder charge.
<p>
Asked about the two tranquilizers and anti-depressant that Martini has been taking for several years for the treatment of chronic schizophrenia, Eshkenaze said the drugs acted as a "calming influence" and enabled Martini to "have clarity."
<p>
Asked why he didn't call Philadelphia prisons' doctor Edward Guy to find out more about why he diagnosed Martini with chronic schizophrenia and prescribed the anti-psychotic drugs, Eshkenaze said that his observations indicated Martini was functioning in a competent way.
<p>
Zegas covered the same ground with Weiss, the public defender's expert. He pried Weiss about how much time he spent with Martini. Weiss acknowledged that he had spent no more than one-and-a-half hours with Martini and had not consulted with the prison doctor about his diagnosis. Weiss said that he found Martini to be suffering from "serious depression" and that the drugs he was taking contributed to the depression. "I would say that Mr. Martini's depression is talking in his decision not to continue living, not his best self," Weiss said.
<p>
Zegas urged Gaeta to adopt Eshkenaze's findings on the grounds that Weiss could not pronounce Martini  incompetent. Zegas and Bergen County Assistant Prosecutors Fred Schwanwede and Susan Sciacca argued that Martini was competent and that the public defenders lacked standing to argue further.
<p>
<b>Attorney-Client Privilege</b><br>

Moreover, Zegas argued that the public defenders would breach the attorney-client privilege if they continued with new claims on Martini's behalf. "They have an ethical obligation to refrain from filing the proposed petition for post-conviction relief because the pleading has not been authorized by Mr. Martini and contains information obtained directly or indirectly through attorney-client conferences, which Mr. Martini does not want disclosed," Zegas argued.
<p>
Van Wyk said that public defenders had several new claims, some of which were based on nonprivileged information. "Under the circumstances, it is no more appropriate for Mr. Martini's counsel to declare his case hopeless than it would be for a doctor to declare a patient's case hopeless after discovering that one kidney was not functioning -- without examining the other kidney," she argued. "Neither this court nor the Supreme Court can be confident that Mr. Martini's death sentence was reliably and appropriately imposed without entertaining a petition for post-conviction relief. Therefore, no matter how painful it may be, the court must permit the public defender to file the petition."
<p>
Gaeta disagreed. On the competency issue, Gaeta cited, among other cases, Demosthenes v. Baal, 495 U.S. 731(1990), in which a three-judge panel imposed a death sentence after a competency hearing. The defendant filed for post-conviction relief under court rules and was later allowed to withdraw his petition.
<p>
Gaeta said he "had a full understanding" of the requirements of competency -- that he be capable of making knowing, intelligent and voluntary decisions. "In this case, I don't find Mr. Martini is suffering from any mental illness or impairment," Gaeta said. "Dr. [Edward] Guy may have put down schizophrenia but there was no support for it .... The jury heard three psychiatrists and a social worker but chronic schizophrenia never came up. Did Mr. Martini develop it since the jury rejected his defense?"
<p>
Gaeta rejected Weiss' suggestion that the drugs were clouding Martini's ability to make a rational decision. Gaeta referred to the case of Keith Zettlemoyer, who last summer became the first person executed in Pennsylvania since that state reinstituted the death penalty in 1977. "Zettlemoyer was taking anti-psychotic drugs voluntarily at the time he testified on the stand .... The court said Zettlemoyer voluntarily took the drugs for a number of health problems because he said, 'It benefits me tremendously.'"
<p>
Gaeta said it would be a "bizarre vindication of due process" if he capitulated to a presumption of incompetency, simply because Martini is in a drug-induced depression. "He's depressed and there is a life situation he finds himself in and there's no way out," Gaeta said. "I don't find it's affecting his ability to make a rational choice to proceed.<p>

"So I find the public defenders can't proceed. In most cases, if there's someone -- a fellow inmate, a priest, family member who sought standing -- in all these cases the courts held that if the defendant is competent they cannot intercede -- it's his choice."<p>

On the issue of standing, Gaeta adopted Sciacca's argument, citing Matter of Association of Trial Lawyers of America, 228 N.J. super. 180, 188 (App. Div.), cert. denied, 113 N.J. 660 (1988), in which state courts recognized "the traditional rule that one 'may not claim standing ... to vindicate the constitutional right of some third party.'"<p>

Moreover, Gaeta found that the public defenders did not demonstrate that they "suffered an injury in fact," a requirement for standing. "It's not for this court to apply an untethered notion of public policy," he said.<p>

But Gaeta rejected an assertion by Schwanwede and Zegas that the public defender's abolitionist view of the death penalty was fueling the appeals process and not Martini's best interests. "I don't think the public defenders are attempting to substitute their own beliefs for Martini's," Gaeta said. "They're acting in good faith. They believe they have a duty to proceed."<p>

Gaeta appointed Zegas last year at the request of the Public Defender's Office to ensure that Martini's interests would be fully represented. Assistant Public Defender Dale Jones had given Gaeta a list of possible attorneys for the job.The public defender agreed to pay for Zegas' services.<p>

<H2><I>Dead Man Walking</I><BR>
and Death Penalty Litigation</H2>

By David George<P>

[David George is a law clerk to the Honorable Harold R. DeMoss, Jr. of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. A practicing lawyer, David received his B.A. from Baylor University and his J.D. from the Baylor University School of Law. The opinions expressed in this article are his personal view alone and do not in any way represent the opinon of the court or any judge on the court. If you wish you may <A HREF=mailto:ageorgex@counsel.com>contact the author via e-mail</a>.]<P>

In his new film  <i>Dead Man Walking</i>, Tim Robbins examines the death penalty through the eyes of Sister Helen Prejean, a New Orleans nun. The film does not focus on the legal issues; instead, it dwells on the human side of the death penalty -- from both the killer's and the victim's family's perspectives. However, the legal aspects of the death penalty are woven throughout the film. I'll try to walk you through the mechanics of death penalty litigation.<P>

On the whole, <I>Dead Man Walking</I> accurately portrays death penalty law. However, it left a few things out. One common misconception about the death penalty, and one <I>Dead Man Walking</I> did not dispel, was that there are multiple rounds of "appeals." This is not exactly correct. A person is convicted in state court and sentenced to death. The conviction is then appealed in the state system. After the state appeals are exhausted, the ball is in the prisoner's court. The prisoner will file a state court habeas corpus petition -- a civil suit filed by the prisoner against the person confining him (the warden or the head of the prison system). Essentially, the prisoner is asking the court to make the warden prove that he is imprisoning him legally. Habeas corpus is known as the "Great Writ," because of the protection it affords us -- it allows a person to challenge a wrongful imprisonment.<P>

Even if the prisoner loses the state court habeas corpus petition, he still has options. He can go to federal district court and file another habeas corpus petition, saying that his imprisonment violates the U.S. Constitution. This petition is then appealed to the Court of Appeals (in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, where the movie is set, such cases go before the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans). Finally, the prisoner can appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.<P>

The prisoner must be careful in writing his petition for habeas corpus -- he will only get one real chance. If a prisoner loses on federal habeas corpus and his appeals are exhausted, he can't just file another petition. Successive petitions will be dismissed unless the prisoner can prove that he had a very good reason for not raising earlier whatever new issues he includes in his second petition. A prisoner can't delay the process indefinitely by raising one issue after another.<P>

If the execution date is near and the court wants more time to look at the case, it will issue a stay. This stops the execution. Once a stay is issued and the execution date passes, it takes a while to set a new date. Thus, prisoners often time their petitions carefully. For example, they might file it one day before the execution. If this is the prisoner's first petition, the court will almost always issue a stay. If the prisoner filed his petition a while before his execution date, it might be decided by the time the date comes up -- and then he would have no more options.<P>

In <I>Dead Man Walking</I>, Sean Penn's character presents two legal arguments for why his case should be reversed: (1) that although he was present when the killings happened, he was not the "triggerman"; and (2) that the lawyer who represented him at his trial was incompetent. These are typical arguments raised by death row inmates.<P>

Here's another problem with the film: <I>Dead Man Walking</I> implies that a person who did not actually pull the trigger cannot be executed. That is not so. A non-triggerman can be executed if his role in the killing was substantial. However, the jury can consider the non-triggerman status in deciding whether to sentence someone to death. If the judge at trial made a mistake and kept out evidence showing whether someone was a triggerman, that might be enough to reverse a case.<P>

A criminal defendant is entitled to have a lawyer at his trial. The Supreme Court has interpreted this to mean that defendants have the right to a minimally competent attorney. A conviction must be reversed if the lawyer did such a bad job that it was essentially the same as having no lawyer at all. This is called "ineffective assistance of counsel."  Ineffective assistance is a very common argument, but it's incredibly hard to prove -- it almost never works. Great deference is given to the lawyer who tried the case, and the fact that the lawyer made bad tactical decisions is not enough to reverse a case. Instead, the prisoner has to show that the attorney's conduct fell below an acceptable level and that this made a difference in the verdict.<P>

In <I>Dead Man Walking</I>, Sean Penn's lawyer was a tax attorney who had never tried a criminal case before. He took only four hours to pick a jury (it usually takes much longer) and only made one objection. This is not a good performance by the lawyer, but it would probably not be considered ineffective assistance.<P>

Remember, the purpose of habeas corpus is not to retry the case. The question is not whether the defendant had the best trial possible; instead, the court only has to determine whether the trial was so bad that the defendant's constitutional rights were violated. Unless his constitutional rights were violated, he is not entitled to a new trial.<P>

<H2>Just Say Revenge</H2>

By Nancy Savitt<P>

[Nancy Savitt is a partner with Aftab & Savitt, a commercial and litigation boutique in New York and Paramus, New Jersey. She was a U.S. Attorney in New York.]<P>

Should the government be in the revenge business? That is one of the questions raised by <I>Dead Man Walking</I>. In it, Sean Penn plays a man convicted of murdering a teenage boy and girl after brutally raping the girl. The film is set in his last few days on death row, just before his execution. His spiritual advisor, a nun (played by Susan Sarandon), speaks with both the convict's and the victims' families in her attempt to perform her duties. The movie makes its best case for the death penalty in those discussions between the nun and those families. But those same scenes point up most starkly our discomfort as a society with being in the death business.<P>

As a society, we have taken justice out of the hands of the families of the victims and placed it in what is supposed to be an impartial system. Vigilantism is outlawed. Yet it is probably easier to exact the ultimate revenge for a criminal act in the heat of fury than after a dispassionate, drawn-out series of judicial proceedings.<P>

Our criminal justice system is supposed to serve several purposes: deterrence, rehabilitation, punishment. Most people agree that the death penalty does not deter crime. No one has the temerity to argue that it is rehabilitative. Thus we are left with two options: One, it is necessary to kill these people for our own safety; or two, these are revenge killings. In the first group are those who pose a risk to society, who kill without thought or conscience and who admit that if released they would kill again. We can justify imposing the death penalty on such people as a kind of societal self-defense.<P>

But revenge?<P>

As a nation, we find it hard to kill -- that's why there are so few murders among us. With the legitimized institution of killing enshrined in our nation's death penalty statutes, it seems the only way we can get past our inborn abhorrence of taking human life is to demonize the killers. They are not human. They are not like us. They are depraved, totally evil creatures, beyond redemption, and they deserve to have their lives cut short.<P>

Thus in <I>Dead Man Walking</I> the parents of the slain teenagers refuse to acknowledge that they are even the same species as the man who killed their children. He is not human. He is not even an animal -- he is a "monster."  They are disgusted that the nun has been spending time with this -- this thing -- and they're fearful, too, recognizing perhaps that if he has a human face, it will be harder to wish for his death.<P>

The audience sees that human face through the eyes of the nun. It is rarely sympathetic. But when his mother shows the nun his childhood pictures, they are eerily similar to the ones of the murder victims, with the same open, innocent look. The point is made: This man is not evil incarnate. He is a human being, just like his victims.<P>

When the criminal is personalized, our society finds it harder to take a life. The case of Susan Smith, the woman who drowned her children last year, illustrates this point. Most of the country clamored for a death sentence. Yet a jury of people who knew her refused to condemn her to death, even for her heinous crime.<P>

The ending of <I>Dead Man Walking</I> also suggests that very little changes after an execution. The murder victims are still dead, but now another family has lost a child. What is the point?<P>

<h2>When Death Comes Knocking at Your Door</h2><P>

By Russ Bleemer<br>
New Jersey Law Journal<br>
February 12, 1996<p>

John Peoples Jr. says he'd be dead by now if it weren't for William Cagney.<p>

Peoples has spent the past 12 years on death row in a state prison in Atmore, Ala. He was convicted and sentenced to die in 1984 for the brutal murder of three members of a family near Birmingham. He admitted to being at the scene, but he says the state's star witness actually committed the murders. Peoples credits Cagney, a partner in the Edison office of New York's Lane & Mittendorf, with keeping him out of the death chamber so far.<p>

"Down here," said Peoples last week in a telephone interview from prison, " you get 100 percent more respect using an attorney from up north."<p>

The ability of Northern lawyers to command the respect of Southern judges is bringing Bryan Stevenson, the head of the Alabama Equal Justice Initiative, on a recruiting trip to New York and New Jersey next week. "This truly is the third world," says Stevenson. "There are dozens of people who have not been represented effectively for years and are facing execution."<p>

The need is greater now because Congress has cut the funding for death penalty resource centers in 20 states by $21 million last year. So while the day New Jersey executes its first prisoner is still to come, New Jersey lawyers are being asked to step up their efforts on behalf of convicts in other states.<p>

Stevenson expects to speak at bar associations here next week. In the background is the question of whether the well of northern volunteers could soon dry up. The need for help with habeas corpus petitions hasn't reached a crisis stage in New Jersey. At some point, death penalty experts say, northern attorneys who have been inclined to take the cases will have enough business to keep them busy at home. That's what has happened in Pennsylvania already, they say.<p>

Few states have an agency like New Jersey's Office of the Public Defender, which handles nine out of 10 of New Jersey's post-conviction cases. The 29-year-old, 210-attorney state agency provides representation in the cases, including such at the appellate level.<p>

Most southern states don't have any public defender agency, leaving those convicted of homicide to depend on the death penalty resource centers. The centers' funding is expiring under an interim measure Congress passed during the current federal budget fight. An appropriation for the federal judiciary specifically excludes paying for the centers as of next month.<p>

Stevenson's nonprofit Equal Justice Initiative, in Montgomery, Ala., succeeds his defunct Alabama Capital Representation Resource Center. Stevenson, a MacArthur Foundation fellow, used grant money to establish his new center in October.<p>

Stevenson says his staff has shrunk from 13 to nine as his caseload has increased. Last year, Alabama executed two convicts. The state now has 140 on death row, up from 33 in December 1988, according to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Stevenson says 240 people are awaiting Alabama capital murder trials.<p>

And there are proposals in Congress linked to anti-terrorism legislation that would restrict habeas corpus actions, which would make capital cases now before federal judges even more critical.<p>

Nationally, 56 convicts were executed last year, the most since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstituted the death penalty in 1976. There now are more than 3,000 death-row convicts in the nation, up from about 2,150 at the end of 1988.<p>

<b>Not Only Megafirms</b><br>
It's at least a minor miracle that there are law firms still signing on to these battles. But some New Jersey firms have. Currently working on cases with Stevenson's center are Morristown's Riker, Danzig, Scherer, Hyland & Perretti, and Shanley & Fisher, and Roseland's Lowenstein, Sandler, Kohl, Fisher & Boylan.<p>

And William Cagney, a partner in the Edison office of New York's Lane & Mittendorf, has represented Peoples for nearly three years. "When you take something like this on, you think you're taking it on for a deep-seated philosophical reason," he says, "but after you take it on it's clear that you're doing it to serve a client that is in the most critical need of any client you'll ever have."<p>

When he speaks to bar groups next week, Stevenson will have to address firms' biggest fear in the cases -- the cost. Traditionally, the profession perceives pro bono matters as good will only national megafirms can afford.<p>

Stevenson says that impression is not founded. "The expense on all this stuff is sometimes exaggerated," he says, adding that if the rates used to calculate the time are like those for big corporate matters, "then the bills get enormous. But I see this as pro bono work in a classic sense. Sure, they require time. Time is money. But it is not like firms have to make a huge outlay of assets."<p>

Adds Stevenson, "We have had lawyers at very small firms, and even some solos, who, with some [local] support, are very efficient in managing and litigating these cases."<p>

Nevertheless, death penalty defense eats up notorious amounts of billable time, often making the cases extremely expensive. Hiring investigators and traveling to the South adds to the costs. The cases last for years.<p>

There's also little chance of a nice Hollywood ending. For example, last month, a Virginia man convicted of murder and armed robbery in a 1985 holdup exhausted his appeals and was executed by lethal injection. His attorney, David Wadyka, special counsel to Roseland's Hannoch Weisman, strongly urges firms to heed Stevenson's call and get involved in death penalty litigation.<p>

But Wadyka, obviously pained after four years of representation in which he headed a five-lawyer Hannoch Weisman team, said resignedly last week, "Most of these things wind up where we wound up: You're seeing your clients executed."<p>

Stevenson doesn't argue philosophical points against the death penalty in his pitch to get lawyers to take capital cases, and appears to accept that most people favor it. Although he does not back down from criticizing Congress and disagreeing publicly with prosecutors who say extensive appeals make imposing the death penalty too hard, Stevenson instead emphasizes convicts' solitary desperation and appeals for lawyers to help preserve the sanctity of the Constitution.<p>

<b>The Death-Row Railroad</b><br>
Under Alabama's counsel assignment system, inexperienced attorneys get assigned tough cases in small towns where they know everyone and may even fear reprisal for tough advocacy. Fees cap out at $1,000 for the trial phase of a case. As a result, few issues are preserved for appeal, Stevenson says, and pursuing appeals is difficult.<p>

Stevenson believes that in many cases the Spartan defense system, fueled by partisan judicial elections and racial prejudice, has railroaded the accused to death row without due process. Even out-of-state lawyers who support capital punishment, Stevenson says, work on the cases, because of the grave constitutional issues caused by the elimination of resources. The point of doing so, he says "is to uphold the bill of rights."<p>

Though he didn't work with Stevenson's office in his Virginia case, Hannoch Weisman's Wadyka vindicates the Alabama attorney's view. "I'm not an abolitionist," says Wadyka. "These really are people who are truly in need of quality representation."<p>

Over the years, Stevenson and his staff have beefed up their assistance materials as they have farmed cases out. He says 35 out of the 140 Alabama death row appeals are now being handled by law firms outside the state; most of the assisting firms are in New York, Philadelphia and Boston. The outside firms usually take the cases well along in the state appeals process and do the bulk of their work on the federal appeals. The Equal Justice Initiative summarizes recent U.S. Supreme Court holdings, provides pleadings and reviews documents for the outside firms. "We can cut the time in half," Stevenson says.<p>

New Jersey firms taking the Alabama cases uniformly try to downplay the ideological and expense aspect of the cases. Most attorneys working on the cases are against the death penalty; all say it is crucial, even rewarding, pro bono work.<p>

@ Riker, Danzig partner Benjamin Michel says his firm took the case of one of two men accused of murder and sentenced to death because there "seemed to be a very compelling case for the fact that these two men are innocent of the crime."<p>

Michel said out-of-pocket expenses in the Alabama appeal -- mostly for new witness investigations -- so far have cost the firm about $50,000, and the firm only signed on to the case last year.<p>

@ Shanley & Fisher partner Brian McDonough says his partners approved the firm's death penalty work "without any hesitation." McDonough, based in the firm's New York office, says that since 1991, Shanley & Fisher has spent about 2,000 hours on the case of a Mt. Vernon, Ala., man sentenced to die for his part in a fatal armed robbery. Using a blended rate, he says, the firm's hours tally to about $300,000. The firm has spent "tens of thousands" in disbursements, he says.<p>

@ Lowenstein, Sandler associate Bruce Rosen, who is overseeing the firm's work on an Alabama capital case nearing a federal hearing notes, "People say, 'How can you do that?' ... It's taking a lot on yourself. But what are you going to do, take only insurance coverage cases? This is what you go to law school to do, to be a value to society." He says the firm has strongly backed his work on the case.<p>

@ Lane & Mittendorf's Cagney -- who, like Rosen and McDonough hooked up with Bryan Stevenson after returning a postcard expressing interest in a recruiting program by the American Bar Association's Washington-based Post-Conviction Death Penalty Representation Project -- says his experience proves that a small firm can do the work. Although his firm has nearly 60 attorneys, he says only he, two associates, a paralegal and a secretary in the firm's six-attorney Middlesex County office are working on the case.<p>

Cagney, a former assistant U.S. attorney, speaks about John Peoples' case with almost religious conviction. Peoples, now 39, was arrested several days after a husband and wife and their 10- year old son disappeared from their lake house in St. Clair County, Ala. Peoples eventually led investigators to their bodies. Though he confessed to his presence at the crime scene, he has maintained his innocence and says that the state's chief witness killed the family.<p>

Peoples and Cagney have been waiting for a year for a federal magistrate to decide whether there will be a new evidentiary hearing based on their habeas corpus petition. The delay is in part attributable, Peoples says, to Cagney's presence in the case. "When you got a new attorney from outside the state," says Peoples, "it makes a world of difference."<p>

So far, Cagney says his firm hasn't reached the most difficult part of the case in terms of costs because there haven't been many investigation expenses. "It hasn't hit us yet," he says, adding, "God willing, we will get a hearing." Are his partners prepared? He says simply that "They agreed to it, and they see pro bono work as an important part of our professional responsibilities."<p>

@ Hannoch Weisman's David Wadyka, having witnessed the execution of his client, Richard Townes, on Jan. 23 in Virginia, says that the economic realities can't be avoided. "The first thing I would say to the firms Stevenson is pitching is to make sure that you understand that it is a long process and an expensive process. Don't go into this halfway with the idea that you can bail out and be greeted with success."<p>

Wadyka says Hannoch spent about $1 million in attorney time since 1991, using a team of five attorneys and a paralegal. Looking back, he says, the benefit of the case was the satisfaction that Townes "got the best representation he could possibly have gotten. We could not have done anything more than we did."<p>

<h2>Capital Punishment and Voices From Death Row</h2><P>

By Rob Rossi<br>
The Recorder<BR>
January 19, 1996<P>

Death row inmates make strange bedfellows, no matter who they're sleeping with.<p>

But in the whirlwind surrounding the death penalty, the growing number of condemned prisoners asking the state to follow through on its promise to execute them may find themselves in bed with kindred spirits in different ideological camps.<p>

The reason is that these inmates' avowed aversion to an interminable prison stint bolsters the arguments of people who want executions carried out post haste, and of those who think there are better alternatives to executing killers.<p>

The latest prisoner to make a stab at convincing the state to carry out his death sentence is Robert Massie, who has languished in San Quentin for 17 years. Massie admitted his guilt and tried -- without success -- to waive the automatic appeal that California files on behalf of its condemned prisoners. His current attempt to pressure the state to kill him involves a claim that his appeal amounted to unlawful double jeopardy -- in effect, that if they won't kill him they must free him.<p>

The lengths to which Massie -- along with fellow Californians David Mason and Jeffrey Sheldon and others around the country -- must fight to have their lawful sentences carried out is almost too perfect a parody of the abuses decried by habeas corpus reformers. The prisoners' contention that the delays wrought by endless appeals are unfair echoes the reformers' complaint that justice delayed is no justice at all.<p>

Granted, the prisoners' motive differs from that of the prosecutors and victims advocates who share their longing for expedient executions. But it's also true that these parties' desires all flow from the premise that we should be able to expect a degree of certainty from the justice system, whether to afford victims a feeling of closure or revenge, or to relieve the tortuous anticipation endured by a condemned prisoner.<p>

On the other hand, the spectacle of inmates clamoring to be put out of their misery may offer death penalty opponents their best chance yet to win over people who have serious misgivings about the fairness of our criminal justice system or the morality of state-sanctioned killing. These prisoners' kill -me-now posture lends credence to death penalty opponents' argument that life in prison without parole is a tougher punishment than a death sentence.
<p>

Indeed, Massie's lawyer, in an interview last week with <i>The Recorder</i>, pretty much made their case when he said his client "would prefer to be executed or set free. He doesn't want to spend year after year after year on death row."
<p>
I'd say fairness dictates that Massie get his wish. He admitted guilt and accepted his sentence. Even if you disagree with capital punishment, why further punish a man who wants to play by the rules?

<H2>My Journey Toward the Light:<BR>
A View from Death Row</H2>


By Michael B. Ross <BR>
The Connecticut Law Tribune <BR>
January 15, 1996<P>

My name is Michael Ross. I am a condemned man on Connecticut's death row. When most people think of death row inmates, I'm the one that they think of.<P>

I'm the worst of the worst, a man who has raped and murdered eight women, assaulted several others and stalked and frightened many more. And when I am finally executed, the vast majority of the people of this state will celebrate my death. Sometimes, when I close my eyes, I can see the hundreds of people who will gather outside the prison gates on the night of my execution. I can see them waving placards, drinking and rejoicing, and I can hear their cheers as my death is officially announced.<P>

I have lived here on Connecticut's death row for over eight-and-a-half years. I live in an 8-by-10 foot unpainted concrete cell for 23 hours a day -- 24 hours a day on weekends. I come out for an hour of recreation five days a week. Other than that, the only times that I come out are for a 15 minute shower five days a week, and for the occasional visit (one half hour, through glass, on a telephone). I eat all of my meals in my cell, brought to me in a styrofoam box three times a day. I live in a single cell so I live alone -- and since I can only talk to the two people on either side of me, I feel quite alone.<P>

<B>Soul-Searching</B><BR>
One of the results of this almost total isolation is that, after a while, a person is forced to look at himself. I'm not talking about the cursory, superficial manner in which most people look at themselves, but rather a quite painful, unrelenting search of one's very soul.<P>

Many inmates in prison, and many of those on death row, are able to lie convincingly to themselves, to see themselves as basically good people who are the innocent victims of a corrupt judicial system or an unfair and uncaring society in general. Sometimes it is very difficult to see ourselves as we truly are, and much easier to blame others as justification for our actions. I know this to be true because for years this was exactly what I did. During this period I was angry -- so very angry -- at everyone and everything except for the one person I should have been angry with -- myself. It took a very long time, years in fact, for that anger to subside and for me to begin to accept who I was and what I had become, and even longer before I was ready and willing to accept responsibility for my actions.<P>

Two things primarily led to this transformation. Much of the credit for the first goes to a psychiatrist from the Sexual Disorders Clinic at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore -- Dr. Fred Berlin. He diagnosed me as suffering from a paraphiliac mental disorder and was indispensable in my fight to get the Connecticut Department of Correction to acknowledge my disorder and to treat it with the medication that I now receive. The drug -- Depo-Lupron -- clears my mind of the vile and noxious thoughts of rape and murder that plagued my mind for so long, and the drug eliminates the previously uncontrollable urges that drove me to commit the crimes that put me here on death row. That monster still lives in my head, but the medication has chained him and banished him to the back of my mind. And while he is still able to mock me, he can no longer control me -- I control him. I am human again.<P>

You cannot begin to imagine what a milestone this was in my life. Try to imagine a time that a melody or some catchy tune got stuck in your mind, playing over and over and over again, driving you crazy. The harder you try to push that tune out of your mind, the louder and more persistent it becomes. Try to imagine that, instead of a harmless yet annoying tune, you experience filthy and despicable urges, desires and fantasies of the degradation, rape and murder of innocent women. Day in and day out. They fill your thoughts and fantasies when you are awake. They are in your dreams when you sleep. Imagine trying to control the urges, day by day, hour by hour. And try to imagine the self-hatred, loathing and abhorrence that you develop toward yourself when you fail. If you can imagine this, then you will have only begun to understand what I have experienced, what I had to live with, what I had become. And only then will you begin to understand the true blessing that this medication was to me.<P>

But the medication was only part of the story of my personal transformation. It gave me back my mind -- a clear mind free of the malevolent thoughts and urges. And it allowed my humanity to awaken -- giving me back something that I thought I had lost forever. But this was just the first step, and perhaps the easiest, for I didn't have to do anything -- the medication did it for me.<P>

<B>The Reality</B><BR>
Then began the more difficult part of my transformation, an examination of myself -- a very profound, very painful and ongoing examination. Now that my mind was clear, for the first time, I really began to see. It was like a spotlight shining down on me, burning away the mist, exposing every shadow of my being. I began to see things as they really were; I began to see things I didn't like. And many of the things that I saw brought me great anguish.<P>

I saw how weak and afraid I really was -- I had always thought that I was strong and confident. I saw how I had allowed the monster in my mind to take control of me. I saw what I had become. And worst of all, for the first time, I saw the pain that I had brought to so many -- such great and unceasing pain.<P>

After my eyes were finally opened and I saw the truth of what I had become and what I had done, I began to feel things -- unpleasant, disturbing feelings. I began to feel the terrible agony and distress that I had brought to so many: my victims, the family and friends of my victims, my own family. And I also began to feel the awesome weight of my responsibility for my actions and of my responsibility to the people that I had harmed. And finally, I felt a profound sense of guilt. An intense, overwhelming and pervasive guilt that surrounds my very soul with dark, tormented clouds filled with a mixture of self-hatred, remorse, regrets and sorrow. All of which leaves me with a deep desire to make amends and achieve reconciliation -- something which, under the circumstances, seems all but impossible.<P>

<B>Reconciliation</B><BR>
Yet it is this sense of reconciliation that I yearn for the most. Reconciliation with the spirit of my victims. Reconciliation with the families and friends of my victims. And finally, reconciliation with myself and my God. This will be the final part of my transformation -- and undoubtedly the most difficult part.<P>

I am fortunate to have a good friend and guide for this part of my journey. A true man of God, Rev. John Gilmartin, who makes a six-hour round trip drive to see me once a month. I have travelled a great distance and have gone through quite a transformation since that day when I first set foot on death row -- most of it alone. And I am grateful and thankful to the divine providence that sent me Rev. Gilmartin. With his help, and if it is God's will, I will achieve that reconciliation that I so desire, and hopefully complete my transformation into one who is worthy of redemption and forgiveness. My journey is still far from over, but at least now I can see that there is a light at the end of the tunnel -- and what a glorious light it is. May God give me the strength, perseverance and moral fortitude to complete my journey and become one with that light.<P>

Author's note: There is a group of people who firmly believe in this concept of reconciliation: victim-offender reconciliation and the offender's reconciliation with society. They stand up for their beliefs and actively promote reformation and reconciliation over the more politically popular concept of retribution through execution. For more information about this group, contact: Pat Bane, Director; Murder Victims' Families For Reconciliation; P.O. Box #208, Atlantic, Va. 23303-0208. Or call her at (804) 824-0948. And, please, tell her that Michael Ross sent you.<P>

<H2>For Death Row Prisoner, a Change of Heart</H2>


By Deborah Yaffe<BR>
The Recorder<BR>
January 30, 1996<P>

Six years ago, state public defender George Mertens was paying a routine visit to a death row inmate in San Quentin prison. But the visit -- to William Kirkpatrick Jr., the man now at the center of a controversy over California's death penalty -- turned out to be anything but routine.<P>

The two men were sitting at an elevated table in a visiting room when Kirkpatrick got up to light a cigarette with matches kept at the guard station behind Mertens.<P>

&quot;The next thing that I knew, he was pounding on the right side of my head,&quot; says Mertens, who cites attorney-client privilege in refusing to describe what precipitated the attack.<P>

Kirkpatrick stabbed Mertens 22 times with a sharpened toothbrush, puncturing the then 33-year-old lawyer's eardrum in four places. &quot;I was soaked in blood,&quot; Mertens recalls.<P>

After the attack, Mertens spent four or five months off work and finally took disability retirement from his job, plagued by permanent hearing loss and post-traumatic stress.<P>

After collecting a $15,000 workers' compensation award, he did not practice for more than a year. &quot;I just suddenly had this distaste for law,&quot; Mertens explains.<P>

Now a solo practitioner in the Placer County town of Lincoln, Mertens still defends accused murderers and visits clients in prison. But he no longer takes capital cases.<P>

The attack on Mertens was only the most dramatic of the violent incidents that have marked Kirkpatrick's life behind bars in the nearly 12 years since he was sentenced to death for shooting two young men during the 1983 robbery of a Burbank Taco Bell restaurant.<P>

Earlier this month, it looked as if Kirkpatrick could become the first man executed in California in more than two years. He had declared that he wanted to drop his appeals and accept execution, which had been scheduled for last Friday.<P>

But nearly two weeks ago, the 35-year-old prisoner changed his mind and Los Angeles federal Judge William Keller stayed the execution. Then Attorney General Dan Lungren made headlines by accusing lawyers from the publicly funded California Appellate Project of bringing Kirkpatrick around with gifts, including tennis shoes and cookies.<P>

CAP said no public money was spent on the items -- and noted that Kirkpatrick has every right to seek further review of his case.<P>

Once his federal  habeas corpus petition is filed, it could be years before Kirkpatrick's case is resolved.<P>

<b> A Cruel Crime</b><BR>
The crime that sent Kirkpatrick to death row was a cruel one, and the prosecution case -- presented by Terry Green, now an L.A. Superior Court judge -- was &quot;fairly compelling,&quot; recalls one of Kirkpatrick's two court-appointed defenders, defense lawyer Rayford Fountain of Pasadena's Fountain &amp; Hattersley.<P>

The shooting victims, L. Wayne Hunter, 27, and James Falconio, 16, were found in a closet at the Taco Bell at midnight on Sept. 17, 1983. Each had been shot once in the head with a .22-caliber bullet, and $625 was missing from the safe and cash register. Hunter, an assistant manager, was dead; Falconio, an employee, died almost two weeks later.<P>

Kirkpatrick had once worked at the same Taco Bell -- and had told an acquaintance he wanted to kill Hunter and another manager for transferring him to a different store, according to court records.<P>

When Kirkpatrick was arrested five days after the shooting, police found three .22-caliber cartridges in his car and a stereo equalizer stolen eight days earlier from a North Hollywood gas station where Kirkpatrick had once worked.<P>

A .22-caliber pistol had been taken in the same gas station robbery, and two of Kirkpatrick's acquaintances said that soon after the Taco Bell shootings he told them he had killed two people.<P>

But Kirkpatrick denied committing the murders, saying the shells had been left in his car by gang members who had borrowed it to shoot heroin. The night of the shooting, he said, he was buying a new battery at a gas station -- but testimony by another gas station customer suggested Kirkpatrick had actually been there hours later than he claimed.<P>

None of Kirkpatrick's relatives testified for him during the penalty phase of his trial, because Kirkpatrick told his lawyers he did not want them involved. But he spoke for himself, telling the jury that he hoped to become a published writer.<P>

The penalty phase also produced evidence of a scary streak, however. A 17-year-old boy testified that months earlier Kirkpatrick had forced him into oral sex, threatening to kill him if he did not comply. A 16-year-old boy testified that Kirkpatrick tried to choke him when he refused to help out with a robbery.<P>

And a woman testified that Kirkpatrick threatened her and her daughter, and later poisoned her dogs, because she did not return a calculator she had borrowed from him.<P>

A jury deliberated for nearly two days before recommending death.<P>

A co-defendant, Eddie Salazar, who participated in the robbery but did not pull the trigger, is serving 25 years to life for first-degree murder.<P>

<b> Automatic Appeal Denied </b><BR>
In June 1994, the state Supreme Court unanimously denied Kirkpatrick's automatic appeal. By then, Kirkpatrick was represented by Edward Horowitz, a Los Angeles private attorney who was assigned to the case after the state public defender asked to be relieved in the wake of the Mertens assault.<P>

Horowitz argued that his client's rights were infringed when L.A. Superior Court Judge Coleman Swart refused to let Kirkpatrick serve as co-counsel during the guilt phase of his trial or represent himself during the penalty phase.<P>

Swart did, however, let Kirkpatrick serve as co-counsel during the penalty phase. Kirkpatrick cross-examined penalty-phase witnesses and argued to the jury.<P>

The Supreme Court said Judge Swart did not abuse his discretion in finding that Kirkpatrick's self-representation motion came too late in the trial. But the court did chastise Kirkpatrick's lawyers for opposing their client's motion, noting, &quot;Defense counsel's primary role is to represent the accused.&quot;<P>

Despite his record of later prison violence, Kirkpatrick was relatively well-behaved during his trial, says former defense counsel Fountain.<P>

&quot;He was actually much more cooperative and pleasant than a lot of other clients I've had,&quot; says Fountain, whose memories of the trial are dim more than a decade later.<P>

But after the conviction, Kirkpatrick's relationship with his lawyers began to break down, Fountain recalls.<P>

That moment &quot;would have been the beginning of the shift, once he realized that the system had now condemned him,&quot; Fountain says. &quot;Perhaps that was the beginning of his real anger at the system.&quot;<P>

<B>No Prior Felonies</B><BR>
Kirkpatrick had not been in much serious legal trouble before the Taco Bell shooting. The child of a Mexican mother and an African-American father he never met, he grew up in Brooklyn, N.Y. His stepfather was a New York City police sergeant.<P>

Kirkpatrick dropped out of high school after 11th grade and worked a variety of odd jobs, including as a driver and a cook. According to the corrections department and the Supreme Court, his criminal record consisted solely of misdemeanors -- two drunken driving convictions and two convictions for receiving stolen property.<P>

But in San Quentin, Kirkpatrick has broken prison rules more than 20 times, sometimes by fighting with other inmates or threatening staff, according to Department of Corrections records. He was not prosecuted for the Mertens assault because of his condemned status, but he lost prison privileges, the corrections department says.<P>

Even before the attack, Kirkpatrick was living in the prison's &quot;adjustment center,&quot; where troublesome inmates are punished with sharp restrictions on privileges such as outdoor exercise. Although it is possible for inmates to move back to the regular death row if they behave, Kirkpatrick has been in the adjustment center ever since, said San Quentin spokeswoman Lt. Joy Macfarlane.<P>

Kirkpatrick still maintains he is innocent, CAP said earlier this month. But that claim, like Kirkpatrick's decision to continue his appeals, has not always been so firm.<P>

In July 1995, Kirkpatrick wrote to the U.S. Supreme Court, addressing the justices as &quot;Dear sorry white trash.&quot; In the obscenity-filled letter, Kirkpatrick said he was guilty and wanted to proceed to execution.<P>

&quot;I feel no remorse!&quot; he wrote. &quot;Give me my execution date and kill me!!!&quot;<P>

<h2>Disparate Justice Imperils a Community</h2><P>

By Marc Mauer<BR>
Legal Times<BR>
October 16, 1995<P>

A new report just released by The Sentencing Project reveals shocking racial disparities in the criminal justice system. Young Black Americans and the Criminal Justice System: Five Years Later is a follow-up to our 1990 study that found that one in four African-American males in the age group 20-29 was under some form of criminal justice supervision-either in prison or jail, or on probation or parole.<P>

Our new study finds that nearly one in three (32.2 percent) young black men is under criminal justice supervision on any given day. In addition, we have also documented that black women have experienced the greatest increase in criminal justice control of all demographic groups, with their rate of criminal justice supervision rising by 78 percent in the five years from 1989 to 1994.<P>

These dramatic rates of involvement in the criminal justice system are already having a substantial impact on the life prospects of black males in the criminal justice system. Beyond that, we can only speculate on the long-term impact this may have on the African-American community generally. For the next generation of children, though, the vision of massive numbers of black males passing through the prison system clearly cannot be one that inspires a sense of hope for the future.<P>

While current political rhetoric might suggest that rising violent crime rates among blacks are responsible for this situation, in fact the data provide little support for this. Although African-American arrest rates for violent crimes_45 percent of all arrests_are disproportionate to their share of the population, this proportion has not changed substantially for 20 years.<P>

If we look instead at drug policies, we find a more significant explanation for the rise in criminal justice populations. We see this taking place through two overlapping trends: first, a dramatic rise in drug arrests, convictions, and incarcerations, and second, a disproportionate impact of drug policies on African-Americans.<P>

Looking at the 10-year period 1983-1993, the number of incarcerated drug offenders nationally increased by 510 percent, rising from 57,000 to 353,000. Today, about one in every four inmates is either awaiting trial or serving time for a drug offense. At the same time, the black proportion of drug arrests has increased substantially, rising from 24 percent in 1980 to 39 percent by 1993.<P>

These disparities become more pronounced if we focus only on drug possession, not trafficking. All things being equal, drug possession arrests should be somewhat correlated with drug usage among the population. Although national survey data have some limitations, the best indicators are that African-Americans constitute about 13 percent of monthly drug users, just above their 12 percent share of the population. Yet African-Americans make up 35 percent of arrests for drug possession, 55 percent of convictions, and 74 percent of prison sentences. Blacks and Hispanics combined now constitute nearly 90 percent of all offenders sentenced to state prison for drug offenses.<P>

How do these disparities arise? Much evidence in recent years points to decision making by both policymakers and practitioners. This begins with federal priorities that put nearly two-thirds of anti-drug funds into law enforcement and only one-third into prevention and treatment. It then moves to police practices that target inner-city communities for intensive drug enforcement and finally to prosecutorial and sentencing policies that have been found to affect African-Americans disproportionately.<P>

Does this mean that the criminal justice system is fraught with racism? While the Mark Fuhrmans of the system demonstrate racism at its worst, much of these disparities result from more subtle decision making, often representing a combination of race and class effects. Again, this is readily apparent in regard to drug policy. How many middle-class parents, for example, would opt to turn over their drug-abusing teenager to the local prison system rather than avail themselves of a high-quality treatment program? Yet when it comes to low income communities, where blacks and Hispanics are disproportionately represented, national policies emphasize a law enforcement response as the primary means of problem-solving.<P>

These problems have been exacerbated at the national level in recent years. Proposals adopted by or being considered by Congress, such as &quot;three strikes and you're out&quot; and &quot;truth in sentencing,&quot; will not only increase prison populations but will quite likely result in increasingly disproportionate racial impacts.<P>

Much of the necessary response for confronting these enormous disparities lies, of course, in addressing long-term social and economic issues. The combination of inner-city economic dislocation, the allure of the drug trade, and the ready availability of guns have taken a great toll on many communities. But there are also a variety of policy and programmatic options to address these problems that could be enacted much more readily. These include:<P>
<UL>
<LI> Revise national drug spending priorities. Since the mid-1980s, two-thirds of federal anti-drug funding has been devoted to law enforcement and just one-third to prevention and treatment. Funding requests by the Clinton administration to increase treatment in the criminal justice system have been largely denied by Congress. This has taken place despite research by RAND and others documenting that treatment is seven times more cost-effective than supply control programs in reducing cocaine consumption. Failure to increase treatment access for low-income persons ensures that we will maintain a two-tiered system of justice_treatment for the wealthy, incarceration for the poor.<P>

<LI> Eliminate mandatory sentencing and other sentencing policies that have had a disproportionate impact on women and minorities. The injustices caused by mandatory sentencing and its failure to have an impact on crime have been well- documented. In its recent report, the U.S. Sentencing Commission clearly articulated the racial disparities created by the crack/cocaine powder sentencing distinctions. (Unfortunately, that report is meeting stiff opposition from the Clinton administration and Congress.) Many of the problems identified with mandatory sentencing, though, apply equally well to the federal sentencing guidelines and other overly restrictive sentencing policies being adopted in various jurisdictions.<P>

<LI>Sentencing guidelines that are rigidly &quot;neutral,&quot; for example, have often worked to the disadvantage of women and minorities. Factors that most people would acknowledge should be considered relevant at sentencing_child care responsibilities, histories of abuse and dependency_are often not considered to be appropriate for consideration, all in the name of reducing sentencing disparity. While the reduction of disparity is a laudable goal, so too is an individualized approach to sentencing that incorporates an analysis of offender responsibility and appropriate sentencing options.<P>

<LI> Adopt legislative racial/ ethnic impact statements. As has been  done with fiscal impact statements in recent years, legislative bodies  should be required to prepare racial/ethnic impact statements for pending sentencing policy legislation in order to consider any adverse or unanticipated consequences on minorities. If a proposed policy were shown to have such an impact, policymakers would be free to decide if the impact was warranted or if an alternative policy might accomplish the same objective without creating such a disparity. Had this been done prior to the adoption of mandatory penalties for crack cocaine, perhaps Congress would not have enacted such sweeping policies.<P>

<LI> Promote a renewed dialogue on drug policy. Since the heated drug policy debates of the 1980s, there has been little serious discussion regarding the optimal mix of approaches for addressing substance abuse. This is evidenced by the low priority given by the Justice Department to its 1994 report on mandatory sentencing and the disciplining of former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders for advocating a discussion of drug policy. Given the tragic consequences of current policies, a renewed bipartisan debate is critical if we are to develop a national consensus on a more effective strategy.<P>
</UL>
These issues take on particular significance in the context of the presidential election, which is only a year away. As the candidates debate national issues, the public should demand that the issue of minority overrepresentation in the criminal justice system be a major focus of attention. Failure to do so will only exacerbate racial divisions without having any constructive impact on crime.<P>

<h2>Prosecutor's Discretion: Opting Against Death</h2><br>
Opinion and Commentary<p>
By Monroe Freedman<br>
Legal Times<BR>
October 16, 1995<P>


With the resurgence of the death penalty, an increasing number of prosecutors are facing a uniquely agonizing decision -- a decision of life or death. For it is the prosecutor who has discretion to opt for death in the first instance, and it is the prosecutor who must ultimately stand before the jury and use her professional skills to win the judgment that another person must be killed. <p>

Some prosecutors have gone on record against the death penalty. In New York, where capital punishment has recently been brought back, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau has spoken out strongly against it. In addition, Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson has announced a general policy against seeking the death penalty, which has led to an unexpected response from Steven Krane, who is a member of Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn. Acting in his individual capacity, but identifying himself as the chair of the Committee on Professional and Judicial Ethics of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, Krane wrote a letter to the New York Law Journal expressing the opinion that it is unethical for prosecutors to adopt a general policy against the death penalty. <p>

<b>Fallacies in Argument</b><br>
Krane is wrong. His conclusion rests on two fallacies. His first fallacy is that prosecutors have "clients." His second fallacy is that the prosecutor owes a duty to those clients to enforce the laws "zealously." <p>

Oddly, Krane begins by disclaiming the very notion that he then relies upon. He first acknowledges that "prosecutors do not have 'clients' in the traditional sense." That is certainly true. Although it is said that prosecutors "represent the sovereign," that is simply a metaphorical way of saying that the prosecutor has no client in the ordinary sense. What it means, most importantly, is that prosecutors exercise vast discretion -- in the words of Ethical Consideration 7-13 of the American Bar Association's Model Code of Professional Responsibility, "mak[ing] decisions normally made by an individual client." And just as an individual client has absolute discretion to forgo a right given by the law (EC 7-8), a prosecutor has the same discretion. <p>

Nor can that discretion be coerced. As noted by the National District Attorneys Association: "Of the greatest importance to the functioning of the prosecutor is the ability to exercise the 'independent professional judgment' " required by ethical rules. Thus, prosecutors have the awesome responsibility to exercise their discretion independently, or, as Krane says pejoratively, "unilaterally." <p>

But having acknowledged that prosecutors don't have clients, Krane then gives them some. The prosecutors' clients, according to Krane, are "all of the citizens of New York, if not also. . . the victims of crimes." What is the point of this exercise in doublespeak? Why is it important to say, contrary to fact, that prosecutors have clients? <p>

The answer is that the fallacy of prosecutorial clients is necessary to advance to Krane's next fallacy_that prosecutors owe a duty of zealous representation to these asserted clients. He says that the prosecutors have a "duty to their 'clients' . .. to enforce zealously the laws." But it has long been recognized that "[t]he responsibility of a public prosecutor differs from that of the usual advocate." <p>

As stated in a joint statement of the ABA and the Association of American Law Schools, the "partisan advocacy" required of private lawyers must be "severely curtailed" in prosecutors if their duties are to be carried out properly. Thus, prosecutors do not share the private lawyer's obligation of zeal. Moreover, even if they did, it would be a contradiction in terms to say that prosecutors are to exercise their discretion zealously. Discretion connotes cool judgment, not warm zeal. <p>

Krane also argues that the death penalty is a "reflection of the most current and deep-seated attitudes of the people of New York State, as seen over the last decade in the overwhelming affirmative votes of legislature after legislature." Thus, he suggests that prosecutors have no choice but to carry out the will of the people, as expressed by the legislature, to seek the death penalty. In fact, however, the legislature has not sought to coerce prosecutorial discretion with regard to the death penalty. The law expressly gives the prosecutor the choice of seeking life imprisonment without parole. <p>

Krane contends, though, that those prosecutors who have said that they will not request the death penalty have failed to exercise discretion at all. But it is hard to see how he can know that. A general prosecutorial policy about what crimes to pursue and what penalties to seek is not uncommon. A general policy against seeking the death penalty might well be based on a judgment that it is more difficult to persuade juries to convict in death cases, thereby raising the risk of acquittals of defendants who are dangerous to the community. Also,
prosecutors might be unwilling to divert scarce resources from other priorities to upholding death verdicts, which is a notoriously heavy drain in personnel, time, and money.
<p>
<b> Risky Business</b><br>
In addition, it is entirely proper - indeed, it is inevitable -that a significant factor in every prosecutor's discretion should be the prosecutor's own sense of morality. There have been sufficient executions of innocent people to make a conscientious prosecutor unwilling to accept that risk and carry the terrible personal burden of error. The legislature has expressly allowed each prosecutor to make his or her own choice. It would be wrong, then, for a disciplinary body, on the basis of a contrary moral judgment, to seek to compel a prosecutor's discretion.
<p>
Finally, if the people disapprove of how particular prosecutors are exercising their discretion, the people can vote them, or those who appointed them, out of office. In New York, for example, prosecutors are elected. Those prosecutors who have been courageously candid with the public about their position on the death penalty have therefore put their careers on the line. This may not be good politics, but it is certainly good ethics.<p>

<h2>Crimes Against the Revolution</h2><P>

By Naftali Bendavid<BR>
Legal Times<BR>
December 18 and 25, 1995<P>

At first glance, the big news of the Republican Revolution, Crime Division, seems to be this: Not a single major anti-crime law has been enacted this year.<P>

The death penalty has not been streamlined. More money has yet to be set aside for prisons. Sentences have not been toughened. Prevention programs (yes, like midnight basketball) have not been eliminated. The assault gun ban has not been repealed. The exclusionary rule barring illegally obtained evidence from court has not been softened.<P>

Those were all elements of the fiery campaign rhetoric that helped sweep dozens of Republicans to power in 1994. But on taking office, GOP lawmakers found that President Bill Clinton had adroitly claimed the political center on crime, and that it was not so easy to attack, say, gun control initiatives or the president's program to put 100,000 cops on the street.<P>

&quot;The Democrats have very skillfully, and appropriately, moved toward the center on criminal justice,&quot; says James Wootton, president of the Safe Streets Alliance, a conservative nonprofit group that works on criminal justice issues. &quot;That makes it more difficult for Republicans to see that they will get any gain from moving aggressively on crime issues.&quot;<P>

<B>Internal Schism</B><BR>
In taking power, moreover, Republicans exposed an internal schism, on one side, law-and-order conservatives; on the other, those wary of handing police, especially federal police, too much power. That split has been thrown into high relief by such dramas as the Oklahoma City bombing and revelations about the standoffs at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and Waco, Texas.<P>

Yet the GOP crime agenda is likely to revive in the coming weeks or months. Republicans are now turning to the age-old tactic of hitching pieces of their agenda to unrelated bills that are either indispensable, such as 1996 spending measures, or popular, such as the counter-terrorism bill crafted in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing.<P>

&quot;I think we'll come out with something,&quot; predicts Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), who chairs the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime. &quot;I'm not sure if it will be in the next two weeks or next year. But I think there may be some compromise with the president.&quot;<P>

There was little talk of compromise when the year began. Propelled to victory partly by promising to be extra tough on criminals, House Republicans wasted no time passing six anti -crime bills based on their Contract With America. This was a particular slap at President Clinton, who just months earlier had desperately maneuvered to win passage of his own $30 billion crime bill.<P>

The GOP package would have killed President Clinton's $8.9 billion cops program, replacing it with flexible block grants. It would have increased spending on prisons from $8 billion to $10.5 billion, and pressured states to increase prison terms. It would have limited death-row appeals. And it would have narrowed the exclusionary rule, allowing evidence from improper police searches if the police believed they were acting properly.<P>

But this bold onslaught was greeted in the Senate with a long, loud silence. &quot;The House has passed one of most aggressive legislative initiatives of the past 50 years, and the stuff goes over to the Senate and it gets bogged down,&quot; complains Robert Moffit, deputy director of domestic policy studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation. &quot;If the question is whether it's frustrating, the answer is yes, it is frustrating.&quot;<P>

Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), along with Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.), did introduce a crime bill in January, mirroring many of the House's proposals. But they never brought it before their colleagues for a vote.<P>

Senate Republicans say they just didn't have the time, what with balancing the federal budget and all. But Sen. Joseph Biden Jr. (D-Del.), ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, says that the Republicans know the bill is a political loser - especially killing a program to add 100,000 cops.<P>

&quot;I have been hearing since the day that Mr. Gingrich became speaker and the Democrats lost control of the Senate that one of the first items on the agenda was a Republican crime bill,&quot; Biden taunted recently on the Senate floor. &quot;Well, bring it on. Where is it? Where is the Republican crime bill?&quot;<P>

The answer is that it is in pieces. And those pieces are embedded in the 1996 spending bill recently approved by Congress for the departments of Commerce, Justice, and State.<P>

That bill now includes provisions to eliminate the police program and numerous prevention initiatives, while increasing prison spending. Republicans also have tossed in measures curtailing prisoner lawsuits, eliminating special drug courts, and shutting down legal centers that defend condemned inmates.<P>

The White House has vowed to veto the bill because it guts the president's cherished cops program, and this will likely lead to drawn-out negotiations. While Democrats are determined to defend the police program, which they see as a political winner, President Clinton shows little sign of putting up a fight against the other GOP initiatives embedded in the bill.<P>

That encourages conservatives. &quot;We put a lot of things through, despite a very full agenda,&quot; Hatch says. &quot;The President is going to veto the bill, then we'll just start from scratch. We'll pursue the items individually if we have to. I would have preferred crime legislation on a separate track, but I'll get it done whichever way I can.&quot;<P>

Republicans are also pushing ahead with plans to speed up the federal death row appeals process, or habeas corpus. They have hitched their proposal to the counter-terrorism bill drafted shortly after the April 19 Oklahoma City bombing. That bill seemed a sure thing, given the public's emotional reaction to the tragedy.<P>

The Republican habeas plan limits death row inmates to just one federal appeal, to be filed within six months after the state appellate process has run its course. More important, it prohibits a federal judge from granting these appeals at all unless he finds that the state court acted &quot;unreasonably.&quot; Because that will rarely happen, civil libertarians say this provision would eviscerate federal judges' ability to free innocent people.<P>

<B>Speed Bump</B><BR>
While the anti-terrorism bill flashed through the Senate, it hit an unexpected speed bump in the House. An odd alliance of liberals and conservatives converged to protest the new powers the bill would hand police. Suddenly, the bill was in danger of going down in flames.<P>

House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) negotiated intensively with Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), a leader of the House Republican freshmen, in an effort to salvage the provision. On Nov. 30, Hyde and Barr announced a compromise that would delete some of the new wiretapping authority the police were to receive and would also nix a definition of &quot;terrorism&quot; that many considered too broad.<P>

But even those concessions, it now seems, may not be enough. Several conservative lawmakers have written Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) urging him to postpone a vote on the measure. And a coalition of groups, ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union to the National Rifle Association, held a press conference Dec. 6 to denounce the legislation.<P>

&quot;There definitely is a philosophical split in the Republican Party,&quot; says Timothy Lynch, assistant director of the Center for Constitutional Studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. &quot;A lot of the freshmen and sophomores believe the mandate from the '94 elections was to reduce the size and scope of the federal government, including law enforcement. Whereas some of the old-bull Republicans want to replace liberal crime -fighting strategies with conservative crime-fighting strategies.&quot;<P>

So the Republicans' habeas reform plan remains in limbo. But if the House leadership does decide it has enough support to push the proposal through, a vote could come within days.<P>

Perhaps the most dramatic Republican initiative that never materialized is a repeal of the 1994 ban on assault weapons. The NRA poured $3.2 million into the 1994 congressional elections and was quick to take credit for the Republican takeover. It seemed at first that the GOP would be eager to push the NRA's favorite policies.<P>

That has not happened, because the Oklahoma City bombing put gun groups on the defensive, and because gun control is relatively popular. While the House may vote on repealing the assault weapons ban shortly after it votes on the anti-terrorism bill, whenever that may be, the repeal seems unlikely to come up in the Senate.<P>

&quot;I don't think there is any major political support for it,&quot; says Moffit of the Heritage Foundation. &quot;It's not something that grabs the anti-crime public.&quot;<P>

Even if these unfinished Republican goals are not achieved by year's end, they could be taken up next year. Dole's rival for the Republican presidential nomination, Phil Gramm (R -Texas), may prod the majority leader to push through hard-line initiatives.<P>

Still, given the Republicans' blazing entrance a year ago, and given the conventional wisdom that no politician suffers by being too tough on crime, it is noteworthy that so many initiatives have bogged down.<P>

&quot;It's been a funny year, with strange coalitions,&quot; says Lawrence Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, which fights to preserve Second Amendment rights. &quot;A lot of things that might have been slam dunks in this [session of] Congress weren't.&quot;<P>

<h2>Guilty and Framed</h2><P>

By Stuart Taylor, Jr.<br>
The American Lawyer<br>
December 1995<p>



You've probably heard about the current darling of the radical-chic crowd and the America-bashing European intellectual set: Mumia Abu-Jamal, a convicted cop killer seeking to parlay his literary and black militant credentials into a ticket off death row.<p>

In a full-page advertisement in the August 9 New York Times, 112 writers, actors, politicians, and others declared: "There is strong reason to believe that as an outspoken critic of the Philadelphia police and the judicial and prison systems, Mumia Abu-Jamal has been sentenced to death because of his political beliefs." The signers included the likes of director Oliver Stone, actors Mike Farrell and Paul Newman, Professor Derrick Bell, and the same Norman Mailer who helped free killer-author Jack Henry Abbott, who killed again.<p>

Cornel West compares Jamal with Martin Luther King, Jr. Jesse Jackson compares him with Nelson Mandela (who has asked that Jamal be spared). And Jamal's book, Live from Death Row, has helped make him an international cause celebre, selling more than 50,000 copies since May.<p>

What you would not know from such stuff is that the evidence shows that Jamal is probably an unrepentant killer, who on December 9, 1981, stood over 26-year-old Daniel Faulkner and put a bullet between his eyes while the already wounded officer lay helpless on his back.<p>

So why the big hoo-hah about this character? Is it just the old radical conceit that any black guy who shoots a white cop can't be all bad, especially if he is a "revolutionary" with the Black Panthers on his resume, long dreadlocks, an engaging smile, and a way with words?<p>

Actually, it's more complicated than that. Complicated enough that I'm joining the "Save Mumia" movement, here and now.<p>

After a detailed review of the trial transcripts, witness statements to police, and other evidence brought out before and during a much-publicized post-conviction hearing this summer in state court in Philadelphia, it appears to me that Jamal's trial was grotesquely unfair and his sentencing hearing clearly unconstitutional.<p>

Jamal was prejudiced by police misconduct and probably rampant police perjury; ineffective and underfunded defense lawyering; inappropriate prosecution arguments to the jury; egregiously bad judging by the notoriously biased, pro-prosecution Albert Sabo of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas; and questionable voir dire stratagems that forced Jamal to face an 83 percent white jury (ten whites, two blacks) in a 40 percent black city.<p>

Due to this toxic combination of factors, the jury that convicted and condemned Jamal in 1982 lacked some important evidence, including a police report strongly supporting Jamal's claim that his "confession" was a complete fabrication, cemented by perjured prosecution testimony.<p>

There is also evidence -- much of which the jury did not have -- suggesting that all three of the prosecution's eyewitnesses changed their stories to conform to the prosecution's theory of the crime between their initial police "interviews" and their testimony at trial, and that the police sought to stifle exculpatory evidence.<p>

Moreover, even if Jamal did kill Faulkner, the evidence shows that there were mitigating circumstances: When Jamal came on the scene, what he saw was a big (6-foot) white police officer beating Jamal's much smaller brother bloody with a 17-inch flashlight; and when Jamal rushed to his brother's aid, the officer probably shot Jamal in the chest before Jamal shot the officer -- perhaps before Jamal drew his own gun.<p>

In the end, even the overblown assertion in that New York Times advertisement -- that Jamal "has been sentenced to death because of his political beliefs" -- has a kernel of truth to it.<p>

<b>A Most Unusual Death Row Inmate</b><br>

Mumia Abu-Jamal is an extraordinary man, with a powerful intellect, a rare talent for radio journalism, a burning empathy for poor people, a lot of admiring friends in journalism and politics, and no prior record of crime or violence, despite personal experience of police brutality and years as a teenage Black Panther under the microscope of FBI and police surveillance.<p>

The day after the 27-year-old Jamal's arrest,  the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Jamal's "searing and skillful interviews" had made him "a well-known figure in local broadcast journalism." Jamal had been on National Public Radio, the National Black Network, and local Philadelphia stations including WUHY-FM (now WHYY). He had been elected chair of the Philadelphia Chapter of the Association of Black Journalists and had won mention in Philadelphia magazine as one of "81 people to watch in 1981."<p>

You won't find many people on death row with credentials like that.<p>

But this was no ordinary journalist, either. Jamal's radical activism went back to his mid-teens, when, he has said, he was beaten, threatened with a gun, kicked in the face, and called "nigger" by police in connection with various peaceful protest activities.<p>

While he was protesting at a George Wallace-for-president rally in 1968, Jamal wrote in Live from Death Row, "we were attacked by several white men. . . . I was grabbed by two of them, one kicking my skull while the other kicked me in the balls. Then I looked up and saw the two-toned, gold-trimmed pant leg of a Philly cop. . . . I yelled, 'Help, police!' The cop saw me on the ground being beaten to a pulp, marched over briskly -- and kicked me in the face. I have been thankful to that faceless cop ever since, for he kicked me straight into the Black Panther Party." Jamal became a founding member of the Black Panther Party's Philadelphia chapter in 1969 at the age of 15.<p>

After joining mainstream news organizations in the 1970s, Jamal, who changed his name from Wesley Cook as a teenager, took an interest in stories about police brutality, and with good reason. The Philadelphia police department was so notorious that the Justice Department, in an unprecedented 1979 civil suit, charged then-mayor (and former police commissioner) Frank Rizzo and the top police brass with encouraging rampant police brutality, racism, and lying. (The complaint was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds.)<p>

By the late 1970s Jamal was also an ardent sympathizer of MOVE -- a black militant, antiestablishment, antipolice group -- and was wearing his hair in long dreadlocks like a MOVE member. By mid- 1981 Jamal's growing obsession with MOVE had compromised his standing as a journalist and cost him his job at WUHY. He was freelancing while moonlighting as a cabdriver. After being robbed, he had started carrying a gun.<p>

Nonetheless, Jamal's arrest for Faulkner's murder stunned friends and fellow journalists, several of whom have said that despite the revolutionary rhetoric, violence was alien to his nature.<p>

<b>Who Shot Faulkner: What The Jury Heard</b><br>

Police officer Daniel Faulkner's radio dispatches, accounts of witnesses, and physical evidence establish beyond serious dispute how the chain of events leading to Faulkner's death began that December night in 1981.<p>

At 3:51 a.m. Faulkner stopped Jamal's brother, William Cook, who was driving a Volkswagen Beetle, apparently for a traffic violation, on the south side of Locust Street, about 80 feet east of 13th Street. It was a seedy area replete with late-night bars, nightclubs, cafes, and streetwalkers. Faulkner radioed his location, and then added: "On second thought, send me a wagon" -- apparently planning to arrest Cook (or someone in Cook's car) for an unknown reason.<p>

Both Faulkner and Cook got out of their cars. Faulkner spread- eagled Cook across one of the cars. Then Cook suddenly turned and slugged the officer, or so say two prosecution witnesses. Faulkner responded by clubbing Cook several times with his 17- inch flashlight. (Cook's face and neck were bloody when police arrived.)<p>

At this point, Jamal came out of a parking lot on the northeast corner of Locust and 13th, accelerating from a walk to a run as he charged across Locust Street, right at Faulkner. That's when the shooting started, at point-blank range. (It has never been clear why Jamal, whose cab was parked nearby, happened to be around.)<p>

When police arrived at the scene less than a minute later, the wounded Jamal -- sitting on the curb 4 feet from Faulkner, with his empty shoulder holster on and his empty gun nearby -- was the obvious suspect.<p>

Cook was standing a few feet away against a wall, with what two witnesses called "a look of shock" on his face. He allegedly told police, "I ain't got nothing to do with it." (Cook was prosecuted only for slugging Faulkner; Jamal's lawyers and prosecutors agree that he did not shoot Faulkner.)<p>

The main disputes are over who fired the two shots that hit Faulkner, and over when Faulkner shot Jamal, during the interval of a few seconds after Jamal began running toward the scene.<p>


According to the prosecution's theory, Jamal ran up behind Faulkner "from ambush" to within about 1 foot, and shot him in the back. The wounded Faulkner returned fire, hitting Jamal in the chest, while falling onto his back. Jamal emptied his gun at his helpless victim's face at close range, finishing him off with a shot between the eyes.<p>


It's a nice, clean theory, pointing to a clear legal conclusion: first-degree murder, which is capital murder in Pennsylvania when the victim is a police officer. If all one had to go on was the physical evidence (as it was presented to the jury) and the trial testimony of the three prosecution eyewitnesses, Jamal's guilt would seem established beyond a shadow of a doubt.<p>


Cynthia White, a prostitute, swore that she had seen Jamal, with gun in hand, firing two shots at Faulkner's back; then Faulkner "turned around and staggered and seemed like he was grabbing for something, then he fell"; and then Jamal was "standing over" the fallen officer firing "three or four more" shots into his face. Robert Chobert, a cabdriver, swore that he had heard a shot, looked up, and had seen Jamal firing down at the supine Faulkner. Michael Mark Scanlan, who had been out bar-hopping, swore that he had heard a shot while watching a dreadlocked black man (evidently Jamal) rushing at Faulkner with arm outstretched, as though pointing a gun; then the man had stood over Faulkner firing more shots.<p>


"There's no question in my mind," says Jamal's trial prosecutor, Joseph McGill, "that Mumia Abu-Jamal viciously killed Officer Faulkner in the manner presented before the jury, and the jury agreed."<p>


But the prosecution's theory begins to unravel when one studies the initial statements that these three witnesses gave to police on the morning of the shootings, and traces the dramatic changes -- all to the benefit of the prosecution -- in their accounts over the next six months, culminating in their testimony at trial. Still more doubt creeps in when one weighs the strong incentives that White and Chobert had to give police what they wanted.<p>


The prosecution's theory is that Jamal shot Faulkner in the back before being shot by Faulkner. But review of all available evidence (much of which was not before the jury) suggests to me that Faulkner probably saw Jamal coming -- perhaps with gun in hand, perhaps not -- and may have fired the first shot. And other evidence suggests that Cook may well have had a passenger in his car, who jumped out and got away, perhaps after firing one or more shots at Faulkner.<p>


The prosecution's theory -- and, probably, the reality -- is that it was Jamal who fired the fatal shot into the fallen Faulkner's face. But the testimony undergirding this theory was far shakier, less credible, and less consistent with the eyewitnesses' initial reports to police than the jury could have known.<p>


Nor is the physical evidence conclusive, although it may have looked that way to the jury. There was no definitive match, for example, between Jamal's gun and the bullet that killed Faulkner. And police could have gone a long way toward establishing whether or not Jamal was the killer by testing his hands, to determine whether he had recently fired a gun, and smelling his gun barrel, to determine whether it had recently been fired. They did neither.<p>

<b>A Concocted Confession?</b><br>

If the jurors had any doubts about Jamal's guilt after hearing from the prosecution's eyewitnesses, those doubts probably evaporated when they heard Jamal's "confession."<p>

As he was lying on the floor of the hospital emergency room, near the police officer he was suspected of murdering, Jamal defiantly shouted: " 'I shot the motherfucker, and I hope the motherfucker dies.' " He shouted it again a minute later. At least that was the testimony of Priscilla Durham, a hospital security guard, at Jamal's 1982 trial. Officer Garry Bell, Faulkner's former partner and best friend, swore that he heard Jamal shouting the same words.<p>


Prosecutor McGill not only made powerful use of this alleged confession in his closing argument for a first-degree murder conviction; the next morning, in urging a death sentence, he stressed "the arrogance of an individual who defiantly will do it and then defiantly brag after it."<p>


But this was a most peculiar "confession," even putting aside the improbability that a man described by another prosecutor at this summer's hearing as "one of the smartest people I have ever seen" would so spontaneously and flamboyantly incriminate himself.<p>


For although Jamal allegedly shouted it out while 15 or so police officers were grappling with him or nearby, and although most or all of these officers were interviewed over the next few days by homicide detectives seeking to build the strongest possible case against Jamal, not a word about this "confession" found its way into a single police report for more than two months.<p>


Jamal's lawyers contend this "confession" was fabricated. And due to the ineffectiveness of Jamal's defense lawyer and the bias of Judge Sabo, the jury never heard the most exculpatory evidence: Officer Gary Wakshul, who was in the paddy wagon that took Jamal from the scene to Jefferson Hospital, reported later that morning that "we stayed with the male at Jefferson until we were relieved. During this time, the Negro male made no comments."<p>


Did Wakshul just not hear Jamal's confession? Or did he step away for a minute and miss it? Or did he leave the hospital before Jamal uttered it? Nope. It turns out he heard the whole confession, loud and clear. At least, that's what Wakshul said in a new statement 64 days after the fact, on February 11, 1982, when questioned in a probe of Jamal's claim that police had beaten him.<p>

Wakshul suddenly recalled there was this one little comment: "As he was placed on the floor [outside the hospital emergency room], and as I was standing back up, I did hear him say, 'I shot him. I hope the motherfucker dies.' " Asked by his interviewer to explain his initial report, Wakshul said that "the statement disgusted me, and I didn't realize it had any importance until today."<p>

Didn't realize it had any importance? Wakshul's initial report had included far less important details, such as the exact times of Faulkner's radio dispatches. The idea that he had heard Jamal confess but hadn't bothered to report it is patently incredible.<p>

Like Wakshul, officer Garry Bell made no mention of Jamal's "confession" in his reports in the days after the shooting. It was not until 78 days later that Bell says he "remembered" the confession. Bell explains he was "devastated seeing Danny . . . with his face almost blown off," but not one of the other 15 to 20 other police officers with Jamal at the hospital ever reported hearing the confession.<p>


Priscilla Durham first mentioned Jamal's "confession" to police investigators in a February 9, 1982, interview, 62 days after the shooting. It was not until yet another four months had gone by that Durham first claimed, in her June 24 trial testimony, that she had reported the alleged Jamal confession "the very next day" after the shooting to a hospital investigator, in a statement that he wrote down by hand. Prosecutor McGill, seemingly surprised, interjected, "I've never seen one."<p>


Nor has one ever been produced, from that day to this. McGill sent word for the hospital to dig up this handwritten "statement," and while Durham was still on the stand there arrived in the courtroom an unsigned, unauthenticated, typewritten piece of paper, dated December 10, 1981.<p>


Durham said that she had never seen this typed "statement" before, but that it was close to what she had reported to hospital investigators. "They took the handwritten statement and typed this," Judge Sabo helpfully conjectured. He then let McGill bolster Durham's credibility by reading key portions of this unauthenticated document to the jury.<p>


Jamal's lawyers stress that Durham was a biased witness because she knew Faulkner and Bell, worked closely with police on a daily basis, and harbored hopes of getting a job as a police officer. Durham and Bell (like Wakshul) also undermined their credibility by denying that Jamal had been brutalized at the hospital, despite evidence (some of which the jury did not hear) suggesting that he was beaten in their presence.<p>


Nor would this have been the first time that Philadelphia police cooked up a phony confession. "That's the kind of bullshit we see all the time," asserts John Packel, chief of the appeals division of the Defender's Association of Philadelphia. "Cops making up whatever they think will help, making up confessions, to get someone they think is guilty."<p>


In fact, police may have manufactured two Jamal confessions. Inspector Alfonzo Giordano reported later on the morning of the shooting that the handcuffed Jamal had confessed to him when they were alone in the back of the paddy wagon.<p>


Giordano says he asked Jamal, " 'Where is the gun that goes into the holster?' and he stated to me, 'I dropped the gun on the street after I shot him.' " The prosecution elected not to use this "confession," partly because of the risk of reversal on Miranda grounds.<p>


But I think Giordano made it up. I think Jamal was telling the truth in an interview 11 weeks later, when he told Philadelphia Daily News columnist Chuck Stone: "I confessed? That's absurd. I do remember he [Giordano] called me a black motherfucker and hit me with a walkie-talkie." Giordano -- who pled guilty in 1986 to tax charges arising from his taking $57,000 in payoffs -- stands by his story.<p>


<b>Eyewitnesses: A Cabbie With Problems</b><br>

"Throughout this trial, whenever there was any testimony that was changed, it was always to the benefit of the commonwealth."<p>

So said Anthony Jackson, the defense lawyer at Jamal's 1982 trial, while on the stand at this summer's hearing. The proof of his point lies in the remarkable evolution over time in the stories told by the three prosecution eyewitnesses who fingered Jamal as a cop-killer.<p>

Consider cabdriver Robert Chobert.<p>

It is undisputed that he was closer to the scene than the two other prosecution eyewitnesses, parked in his cab a car's length behind Daniel Faulkner's squad car, and some 50 feet from the shooting. He was writing up a fare when he heard the first shot and looked up. He had to look over or past Faulkner's car, with its flashing red dome light, to see the action, and saw the shooter only from the side.<p>


Chobert testified at trial that when he looked up, he saw Faulkner fall; then saw Jamal "standing over him and firing some more shots into him."<p>


"I know who shot the cop, and I ain't going to forget it," Chobert snapped at Jackson during cross-examination.<p>


But Chobert's first recorded statement to police -- about which the jury was not told -- was that the shooter "apparently ran away," according to a report that morning by Inspector Giordano.<p>


Giordano encountered Chobert upon reaching the scene about five minutes after the shooting: "[A] white male from the crowd stated that he saw the shooting and that a black MOVE member had done it and appearently [sic] ran away. When asked what he ment [sic] bby [sic] a MOVE member, the white male stated, 'His hair, his hair,' appearantly [sic] referring to dreadlocks. I asked him to step over to the rear of EPW #601 [the paddy wagon], the wagon crew opened the back door, the suspect was laying on his back on floor, the white male immediately stated, 'That is the man that shot the policeman.' "<p>


The white male was Chobert. The dreadlocked suspect in the wagon was Jamal. And the problem with Chobert's first account was that if indeed the shooter "ran away" from the scene, then it would be hard to pin the crime on the critically wounded Jamal, who was found on the curb 4 feet from Faulkner, and who had not run anywhere, according to three other witnesses. (Giordano now says that "I don't doubt that this cabdriver saw somebody run away," but that it was not the shooter. The prosecution's theory, and Chobert's testimony, was that nobody ran away.)<p>


Had Chobert gotten confused and misidentified Jamal as the shooter when he saw him in the paddy wagon, because of his race and hairstyle? (Cook had dreadlocks too, and a third man with dreadlocks escaped the scene, according to other witnesses.) Or what?<p>


This account would have given the defense a good start at attacking the prosecution's case against Jamal, on the ground that Chobert's initial report showed that the shooter had escaped -- or, at the very least, that Chobert had no idea who the shooter was. But Chobert's story changed in each of his two subsequent police interviews, getting better for the prosecution each time.<p>


At the homicide unit, less than an hour after his initial report to Giordano, Chobert signed a statement that "I saw this black male stand over the cop and shoot him a couple more times. Then I saw the black male start running towards 12th Street. He didn't get far, maybe 30 or 35 steps and then he fell. . . . The cops got him and stuck him in the back of a wagon."<p>


Chobert also told police that the dreadlocked shooter was "kind of heavyset. He was about 6 feet tall and he was wearing a light tan shirt and jeans."<p>


This second recorded Chobert statement still posed big problems. For one thing, while Jamal is over 6 feet, he was far from heavyset; he was lean, almost gaunt. And when arrested he was wearing not a light tan shirt, but dark clothes.<p>


More important, if the shooter ran 35 steps (about 100 feet) toward 12th Street, the shooter wasn't Jamal, who sat down or collapsed on the curb 4 feet from Faulkner, and who, according to prosecution eyewitness Cynthia White, "didn't try to run or anything."<p>


Three days later, in a December 12, 1981, reinterview, Chobert said that the shooter's shirt was "dark gray" -- not "light tan." And when asked (yet again) "how far did this man [the shooter] run," he revised 35 steps to "about a car length away," adding that then the shooter "just layed [sic] there by the curb, about 10 feet from the cop." Thus did 100 feet (35 steps) suddenly shrink to 10 feet, perhaps with a little coaching by police.<p>


By the time of his June 19, 1982, trial testimony, Chobert was swearing that the shooter had not run at all: "I saw him walking back about 10 feet and he just fell by the curb."<p>


Jackson stressed some of these discrepancies in cross- examination, but he didn't do it very well, and he didn't get the biggest discrepancy of all ("ran away") before the jury. This enabled prosecutor Joseph McGill plausibly to dismiss the discrepancies as trifling details.<p>


And while McGill told the jurors they could "trust" Chobert, he didn't tell them -- and with Judge Sabo's help prevented the defense from telling -- that Chobert needed friends in law enforcement because he was, among other things, on probation for arson-for-hire.<p>


"I threw a bomb into a school. . . . A Molotov [cocktail]. . . . I got paid for doing it," Chobert explained in chambers. Judge Sabo ruled the arson conviction inadmissible for purposes of impeachment on the ground that it was not "crimen falsi" -- a crime tending to show untruthfulness.<p>


Nor was the jury told about Chobert's drunk driving record, which Sabo deemed inadmissible. Nor was the jury -- or the defense -- told that Chobert had been driving his cab with a suspended license the night of the killing; that it was still suspended at the time of the trial; that police had never given him any trouble about this; that (according to Chobert's testimony this summer) Chobert had asked McGill during the trial "if he could help me find out how I could get my license back"; that McGill had "said he'll look into it"; and that this was "important" to Chobert because "that's how I earned my living."<p>


McGill never mentioned this exchange to the defense. He says now that the conversation probably occurred after Chobert testified.<p>

<b>Tales of Two Prostitutes</b><br>

The only prosecution eyewitness who claimed that she had seen a gun in Jamal's hand at any time, and the only one who reported Faulkner grabbing at his side (for his own gun?) after being shot, and the only one besides Chobert who identified Jamal as the shooter, was the prostitute Cynthia White.<p>


She told the jury she had seen the whole thing unfold while standing on the southeast corner of Locust and 13th Streets. That would put her about 80 feet from the scene and perhaps 30 feet behind Chobert's cab.<p>


But White has more credibility problems than the average prostitute -- so many that it's hard to dismiss Jamal's lawyers' contention that her tale was scripted to please the police. Some evidence suggests she wasn't even there.<p>


White had at least 38 arrests on her record in Philadelphia, with three open cases awaiting trial there when she testified at Jamal's trial. She was serving 18 months for prostitution in Massachusetts at the time of Jamal's trial. The jury heard about all that. But Judge Sabo blocked proffered testimony from another prostitute, Veronica Jones, that might have cast even more doubt on White's credibility.<p>


Jones had heard the shooting, but not seen it, while standing almost a block to the east, at Locust and 12th Streets, according to her December 15, 1981, statement to police. Called to testify (reluctantly) for the defense at Jamal's trial, Jones started to say something intriguing: Sometime after her December 15, 1981, statement, she had been locked up "for nothing," held for five hours, and pressed by police to say, "I had seen Mumia . . . do it . . . intentionally." Prosecutor McGill cut Jones off with objections.<p>


In a bench conference, Jackson said that Jones had told him that police "told her that if she would give a statement that backed up Cynthia White, they would let her work the street just like they were letting [Cynthia] work." At McGill's request, Sabo barred any such testimony as irrelevant, and struck the part that Jones had already blurted out.<p>


White's account of the shootings, like Chobert's, evolved considerably after her initial police interview on December 9, 1981, as Jackson stressed in cross-examination. Police arrested her for streetwalking on December 12 and 17, and took the opportunity to send her up to Homicide to be reinterviewed each time. She was reinterviewed again on December 23.<p>


In her first statement, the morning of the shooting, White said that the shooter was "short" with dreadlocks, and "came running out of the parking lot on Locust Street. He had a handgun in his hand. He fired the gun at the police officer four or five times. The police officer fell to the ground, starting screaming."<p>


Problem: Jamal is tall (6 feet 1 inch). Cook is much shorter. Both had dreadlocks. Bigger problem: Chobert and Scanlan, the third prosecution eyewitness, both told police that same morning that they had heard only one shot before Faulkner fell, and that the rest of the shooting had come as he was flat on his back.<p>

By December 17, 1981, White had a revised version: "He pointed the gun at the police officer and shot him one or two times. Then the officer fell, and he went over and stood above him and shot three more times."<p>

Also in her initial statement, White said that "there was no struggle" between Faulkner and the driver of the Volkswagen (Cook). Problem: Scanlan told police that he saw Cook slugging Faulkner, and then saw Faulkner beating Cook hard with a billy club (apparently it was Faulkner's flashlight).<p>

Three days later, White amended her story, saying that "the driver of the V.W. struck the officer. The officer grabbed him and turned him around." At trial she said Cook had suddenly struck Faulkner "with a closed fist to the cheek." But she still swore that Faulkner had never struck Cook, and had nothing in his hands.<p>

<b>Credible But Confused</b><br>

Scanlan, the bar-hopping motorist, was the most credible of the three prosecution eyewitnesses. He saw the critical events a lot less clearly than Chobert and White claimed to have seen them. But his story also got better for the prosecution between his initial accounts to police and his testimony at trial.<p>

Scanlan was headed east on Locust Street and stopped at the light on the west side of 13th, about 120 feet from the scene [see diagram, page 77]. To see the shootings, he had to look past the corner where Cynthia White claimed she was, past Chobert's cab, and past Faulkner's squad car with its flashing red dome light.<p>

According to Scanlan's initial statement to police, Faulkner had "spread the guy across the car with his arms out, and the guy turned back around and swung at the officer. The officer pulled his billy club out and swung hard at the guy hitting him several times on the arm and back. . . . Then I noticed another black guy come running across the street towards the officer and the guy he was hitting. Then the guy running across the street pulled out a pistol and started shooting at the officer . . . the officer fell down. Then he stood over the officer and fired three or four more shots point blank at the officer on the ground."<p>

While Jamal's lawyers don't dispute that Jamal was the man Scanlan saw running across the street, they do dispute that Scanlan saw Jamal shoot Faulkner in the back, or at all. And with good reason. For one thing, when Scanlan was asked by police at the scene to identify Jamal, he identified him as the driver of the Volkswagen -- not the shooter. For another, Scanlan then drew a diagram that clearly showed Faulkner facing Jamal as Jamal approached the scene. And in a police reinterview two days later, Scanlan muddied the waters even more.<p>

First, Scanlan said he hadn't seen the man who ran across the street holding or firing a gun. Rather, he assumed that this man was the source of the first gunshot that he heard. Scanlan also noted: "I don't know if the officer fired his gun or not, I didn't see him pull his gun or fire it, I didn't know whether either of the males was shot or not, I was stunned. . . ."<p>

Second, Scanlan told police in this reinterview that he had no idea which black male had fired the shots after Faulkner fell: "One of the two males was standing over the officer, I don't know which one it was, then I saw two or three flashes, and heard the shots, I saw the gun in one of the males' hand, but I don't know which male had the gun."<p>

By the time of his June 25, 1982, trial testimony, however, Scanlan's account was less messy: He said that a man (concededly Jamal) had run at Faulkner from behind, and that "I saw a hand come up, like this, and I heard a gunshot. There was another gunshot when the man got to the policeman, and the gentleman he had been talking to. And then the officer fell down on the sidewalk and the man walked over and was standing at his feet and shot him twice. I saw two flashes."<p>

"The man walked over . . . and shot him twice"? Which man? How could Scanlan -- who had admitted on December 11, 1981, that he had no idea which man it was -- be sure in June 1982 that it was Jamal? In cross-examination, Scanlan indicated that he was not very sure: "There was confusion when all three of them were in front of the car."<p>

<b>What Really (Probably) Happened</b><br>

Jamal's lawyers theorize that Scanlan saw Faulkner facing Jamal as Jamal charged the scene; heard Faulkner shoot first at Jamal; mistakenly assumed that it was the other way around; and then saw someone standing over Faulkner and killing him -- the same someone who, according to Chobert's first statement, "ran away."<p>

The prosecution's theory that Jamal fired the first shot, from within 12 inches, into Faulkner's back, depends on the assumption that the wounded Faulkner, while staggering and falling onto his back, with two assailants right on top of him, was able to pull out his gun, turn, and fire into Jamal's upper chest a bullet that lodged in his lower back. Also that Jamal passively waited with gun in hand for Faulkner to draw and shoot before continuing his assault.<p>

It's possible it happened that way. But it's doubtful that it did -- especially since none of the prosecution's three eyewitnesses ever claimed to have seen Faulkner draw, aim, or shoot his gun, and only the less-than-credible Cynthia White claimed to have seen the charging Jamal, with gun in hand, shooting at Faulkner from behind.<p>

The defense theory seems more plausible: "At that moment, Officer Faulkner faced a life-threatening situation. He had one suspect who allegedly struck him bent over the hood of a car with another individual running toward him. He was alone. It was 4 a.m. It was dark. The neighborhood was unsettling." So Faulkner shot Jamal first. And then Faulkner got spun around and shot in the back by Jamal. Or, as the defense claims, he was shot in the back by a man who ran away.<p>

The who-shot-first question is important: A jury might find that even if the gravely wounded Jamal did shoot Faulkner, the circumstances warranted neither the death penalty nor, perhaps, a first-degree murder conviction, which requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of malicious and unprovoked killing with "deliberation and premeditation."<p>

The defense could argue: Here we have a 27-year-old man with no criminal record. He sees his beloved kid brother being brutally clubbed by a big police officer. He understandably rushes to his brother's aid, his gun in its holster. The officer turns and shoots him in the chest, nearly killing him. He is racked with pain and shock. Even if you believe that he then shot the officer, it was surely in self-defense, or defense of his brother, or at worst manslaughter, committed after grave provocation and in the heat of passion.<p>

The prosecution could, of course, counter that the execution- style fatal shot, with Jamal standing over his helpless victim, was first-degree murder punishable by death no matter who fired the first shot. But a verdict of manslaughter would be a real possibility, especially if any juror had even a scintilla of doubt as to who fired that fatal shot.<p>

Jamal's lawyers say that if they win a new trial, they're after an acquittal, not just a manslaughter conviction. And to that end, they have taken aim at another key element of the prosecution's case: the theory that Jamal must have killed Faulkner because nobody else but Cook was at the scene.<p>

No fewer than five eyewitnesses (including Chobert) have made statements at one time or another that support the defense theory that someone ran away from the scene. These accounts also raise at least a suspicion that police were so bent on nailing Jamal that they may have shunted aside, or even suppressed, evidence supporting this defense theory.<p>

The most important of these witnesses, and the only one whom the jury heard saying that someone escaped the scene, was a part-time college student, Dessie Hightower. He has consistently and credibly stuck by the story he told police 80 minutes after the shootings: that he saw a man (or possibly a woman) about 6 feet tall, who looked "Jamaican" from behind (meaning that his hair was in dreadlocks or braids), "run from the scene of the crime" before police arrived.<p>

Hightower's initial account posed a problem for police. He was called in for a reinterview six days later, on December 15, 1981. It lasted almost six hours. He told the same story, adding details about what happened after police arrived: Several officers had kicked and beaten Jamal, and had banged his head against a pole while dragging him to the paddy wagon by his dreadlocks. (Police admitted at trial that they banged his head against a pole and dropped him on his face, but claimed these were accidents.)<p>

In the middle of this reinterview, Hightower was asked to take a polygraph test. (None of the prosecution witnesses was asked to do this, despite White's and Chobert's criminal records.) Hightower did so, and was told he had passed, he claims. But prosecutors at this summer's hearing produced a typed police report, dated 12 days after the polygraph test, purporting to show the opposite. The report says that Hightower was told that there was "deception indicated" when he denied "know[ing] for sure who killed Pol. Faulkner"; when he denied "see[ing] Pol. Faulkner killed"; and when he denied "see[ing] Jamal with a gun in his hand."<p>

This report is puzzling in at least two respects. First, it indicates that the polygrapher asked Hightower questions wildly out of sync with police reports of his prior interviews, in which he said he did not see the shootings because his view was blocked by a wall at that moment. Second, the report indicates that the polygrapher did not ask Hightower anything about the important subject on which his prior interviews had focused: his claim that he had seen someone running away.<p>

What kind of game were the police playing with this exculpatory witness?Aside from Hightower, the prostitute Veronica Jones told police (but not the jury) that after Faulkner fell, "I saw two black guys walk across [the] street and then they started sort of jogging." Two black guys jogging: That matches Chobert's (second) December 9, 1981, report, which says he saw the shooter and another black man running. Cook, perhaps -- and who?<p>

Taking the eyewitness evidence as a whole, it seems more likely than not that somebody had been in Cook's car with him and had run away before police arrived. It's also at least conceivable that this mystery man killed Faulkner.<p>

That, in fact, is the sworn testimony of one William Singletary, a new witness who contacted Jamal's lawyers in 1990 and testified publicly -- if not very credibly -- for the first time at this summer's hearing.<p>

Another less than credible new defense witness this summer was Arnold Howard, a lifelong Jamal acquaintance with forgery and burglary convictions on his record. He provided the identity of the mystery man who allegedly was in Cook's Volkswagen and escaped the scene: Kenneth Freeman, Cook's (now deceased) partner in a vending stand a few blocks away.<p>

In an affidavit, Howard swore that Freeman "told me he was driving [Cook's] Volkwagon [sic]" when Faulkner stopped it.<p>

<b>Ineffective Assistance</b><br>

During the six months between Jamal's arrest and his trial, while police and prosecutors were putting their case together and doing some 150 witness interviews, Jamal's court-appointed defense lawyer, Anthony Jackson, was doing a lot less.<p>

Jackson was far from the worst lawyer a death penalty defendant has ever had. He had some 20 homicide trials under his belt and other useful experience, including several years at a public interest group that specialized in lawsuits alleging police brutality.<p>

But Jackson's preparation of Jamal's case was woefully inadequate, and he was working under conditions that became increasingly difficult. Judge Paul Ribner, who handled the pre- trial proceedings, allocated Jackson the standard Philadelphia ration for an investigator and expert witnesses -- "not to exceed $150" apiece. Several Jackson motions for additional funds to investigate the case were denied, as was a Jackson plea for the appointment of a second lawyer to help out.<p>


As trial approached, Jackson's investigator had stopped work due to insufficient funds, after interviewing only two witnesses. Jackson also lacked funds to pay for trial testimony by a pathologist or a ballistics expert. Meanwhile, Judge Ribner had denied a defense request for a lineup to test the questionable identifications of Jamal as the killer by eyewitnesses Chobert and White. And by May 1982, Jamal was aware of the prosecution's apparent intention to use one or both of his two (probably phony) "confessions" at trial.<p>


So perhaps it's not hard to understand how it was that by the time of the June 1982 trial, Jamal -- who had been slipping into the MOVE group's strange orbit for some time -- got the impression that he was being railroaded by a corrupt and dishonest system bent on killing him, and that Jackson was being used as a fig leaf.<p>


Jamal elected on May 13 to represent himself at trial. Jackson, meanwhile, was ordered by Judge Ribner to act as Jamal's "backup counsel," and the first of his several requests to withdraw was rejected. He ceased to work on the case for the five weeks before trial, because (he says) he assumed that Jamal would handle everything from voir dire to questioning witnesses. But Judge Sabo, who took over the case as trial approached, apparently had other ideas.<p>

<b>An Unfair Trial</b><br>

The unfairness of Jamal's 1982 trial was almost guaranteed once it was assigned to Judge Albert Sabo (who declines to comment on the case). The short, white-haired judge, who is said to be genial and informal off the bench, was undersheriff of Philadelphia County for 16 years, and a proud member of the Fraternal Order of Police, before taking the bench in 1974. Sabo, now 74 and semiretired, has sent 32 defendants (27 blacks, two Asians, two whites, and one Latino) to death row -- far more than any other judge in the nation. He is notoriously pro-prosecution -- a cop on the bench.<p>


Judge Sabo and Jamal began battling soon after the start of voir dire, on June 7, 1982. After two laborious days, Sabo granted a request by prosecutor McGill to bar Jamal from continuing to question prospective jurors, on the ground that he was taking too long and making them uncomfortable.<p>


But this smacked of pretext. The Inquirer wrote at the time that Jamal "was intent and businesslike" and "subdued" in voir dire. While some jurors were apparently upset by Jamal's dreadlocks, beard, and questions about their home life, Sabo's claim (in findings of fact after this summer's hearing) that he was "belligerent" during voir dire rings false.<p>


Prosecutor McGill used peremptory challenges to strike 11 of the 14 blacks in the eligible jury pool. By the time testimony began, the black militant defendant, charged with the highly publicized murder of a white policeman, in a then-40 percent black city, faced -- as a result of a probably unconstitutional voir dire -- a jury of two blacks and ten whites, including a friend of another officer shot in the line of duty.<p>


After being unjustly barred by Sabo from representing himself at voir dire, Jamal made things worse for himself by insisting over and over again, throughout the rest of the trial, that MOVE founder John Africa be allowed to sit at the defense table and counsel him. Sabo rejected any such arrangement because Africa was not a lawyer. But Jamal refused to accept the finality of Sabo's rulings. Instead, he repeatedly complained in front of the jury that he was being "gagged" and deprived of his right to represent himself, and did not want or trust Jackson or any "any legal-trained lawyer."<p>


These disruptions led Sabo to bar Jamal from examining witnesses or otherwise representing himself at any stage of the trial, and to expel him from the courtroom -- with such comments as "take a walk" -- each time Jamal misbehaved.<p>


Jackson, meanwhile, was suddenly thrust unprepared into the arena, whipsawed between an unmanageable client -- who, Jackson told Sabo, "has no faith in anything I say" -- and a judge who would neither let Jackson withdraw nor give him a break. With Sabo rushing the trial through three consecutive Saturdays, Jackson recalled in an affidavit this year, "I was kept busy each evening feverishly reviewing over 100 police interviews" and other materials, "with little or no time for witness preparation or the defense case."<p>


Under these difficult circumstances, Jackson blew it. For example, he did not interview either of the defense eyewitnesses, Dessie Hightower and Veronica Jones, before the trial. And Jones gave Jackson a nasty surprise when she took the stand: She flatly disavowed her December 15, 1981, statement to police that she had seen "two black guys . . . sort of jogging" after the shootings.<p>

Sabo compounded Jackson's difficulties by issuing a string of pro-prosecution rulings on key issues throughout the trial. The most prejudicial precluded a belated bid by Jackson to put on the best evidence that Jamal's confession was a fabrication: Officer Gary Wakshul's report the morning of the shootings that Jamal had "made no comments" while at the hospital.<p>

Jackson swore at this summer's hearing that he had simply forgotten to subpoena Wakshul or give the prosecution timely notice that he wanted him to testify. Although this may well have been ineffective assistance of counsel, it does not excuse the responses of prosecutor McGill and Judge Sabo on July 1, 1982, when Jackson sought a brief continuance to summon Wakshul.<p>

McGill strenuously objected, saying, "He is not around." Judge Sabo, scanning the December 9, 1981, Wakshul statement, preposterously suggested that it was consistent with the trial testimony that Jamal had defiantly shouted out a confession at the hospital. Sabo also conjectured -- with remarkable clairvoyance -- that Wakshul "could be on vacation." McGill checked, and reported back that, in fact, "he is on vacation until July 8."<p>

Jackson asked whether this meant Wakshul was "not in the city." McGill did not answer. Instead, Judge Sabo cut in: "I am not going to go looking for anybody now." When Jamal complained that this was a crucial witness, the judge snapped, "Your attorney and you goofed." Jamal responded: "You are trying to hide the truth."<p>

Ironically, at this summer's hearing Wakshul recalled that he had spent most of that 1982 vacation at home, leaving town only after "I believed the testimony was over."<p>

A bit later on the same day (July 1, 1982) that Sabo spurned Jamal's pleas to call Wakshul, Jamal elected not to testify in his own defense, explaining to the court: "The right to represent myself, the right to select a jury of my peers, the right to face witnesses and examine them . . . were taken from me. It seems the only right that this judge [wants] to confer is my right to take the stand, which is no right at all. I want all of my rights, not some of them . . . because my life is on the line."<p>

The Wakshul episode was not the only instance of sharp practice by prosecutor McGill at the trial. He also sponsored possibly perjured testimony by witnesses including Durham, Bell, Chobert, and White. And in his summation, McGill improperly vouched for Chobert's testimony, misleadingly suggested that Chobert had no reason to tailor his account to the prosecution's liking, and contended that Jamal's vociferous insistence on his right to represent himself showed a "vicious . . . frame of mind."<p>

(McGill rejects these criticisms as "absolutely wrong," and notes that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejected all of Jamal's attacks in a 1989 decision.)<p>

Jackson's closing was feeble -- especially his lame statement to the jury that "you have heard all of the evidence," which was very far from being the case. Jackson also urged the jury (perhaps at Jamal's insistence) not to "compromise this verdict," and either to convict Jamal of first-degree murder or acquit him of any role in Faulkner's death.<p>

The jury got the case at noon on July 2. After asking at one point to be reinstructed on the law of first- and third-degree murder and manslaughter, the jury returned its first-degree conviction at about 5 p.m.<p>

<b> An Unconstitutional Sentence</b><br>

If Jamal's trial was unfair, his sentencing proceeding was a travesty. It was pushed through by Judge Sabo in less than three hours on the Saturday of the July 4 weekend, the morning after the conviction. And it was riddled with constitutional flaws including ineffective assistance of counsel, improper cross- examination and argument by prosecutor McGill, and inadequate instructions of law by Sabo.<p>

Jackson says he did no preparation for the sentencing proceeding, gave no thought to the "available tactical approaches," and had only a perfunctory meeting with Jamal, at which he neither consulted with his bitterly estranged client on what to do nor looked at the statement that Jamal was about to read to the jury.<p>

The best hope for persuading the jury that Jamal did not deserve to die was to establish the mitigating circumstance of good character, through testimony by some of his many friends and admirers -- journalists, politicians, and others. Yet Jackson did not call a single witness in the sentencing phase. (Jackson had called 15 character witnesses during the guilt phase. They testified briefly that Jamal was a peaceful and law-abiding man. But the rules would have allowed for far more detailed accolades at sentencing.)<p>

Jackson's closing argument at sentencing was pathetic. He wasted time and credibility, for instance, quibbling with the prosecution's unassailable claim that Faulkner was a "peace officer" within the meaning of the statutory list of aggravating circumstances on the verdict form.<p>

Jamal's own uncounseled and ill-advised statement to the jury made a disastrous situation worse. His assertion that "I am innocent despite what you 12 people think" was lost amid his attacks on the judge ("black-robed conspirator"), the prosecutor, and the defense lawyer ("this worthless sellout and shyster"), and his denigration of the jury. "Had he been actively seeking the death penalty, some have said, he could hardly have done a better job," Marc Kaufman wrote in the Inquirer after the trial.<p>

But if Jamal helped dig his own grave, he was shoved into it by the police, the prosecutor, the judge, and the ineffective defense lawyer, in gross violation of the Constitution. And if Jamal seems a paranoid wacko when one first reads his rantings about a corrupt and dishonest system, a closer look suggests that maybe the system proved him right.<p>

McGill -- in his cross-examination of Jamal at the sentencing -- made inflammatory use of political pronouncements Jamal had made as a Black Panther 12 years before, when he was 15 years old. McGill read from a 1970 newspaper clipping in which Jamal was quoted saying, "All power to the people," and asserting that blacks "are facing the reality that the Black Panther Party has been facing: Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." McGill implied that these statements and Jamal's courtroom behavior showed that Jamal deserved to die.<p>

"I saw it," said Jamal in a recent interview. "When [the name Black Panther] hit the jury, it was like a bolt of electricity -- pow."<p>

This alone should require reversal of Jamal's sentence both under long-established First Amendment and death penalty case law, and under the logic of the Supreme Court's 8-to-1 decision in Dawson v. Delaware, in 1992. It held that a prosecutor violated the First Amendment in a death sentencing proceeding when he stressed the defendant's membership in a white racist prison gang called the Aryan Brotherhood. A defendant's "abstract beliefs," the Court held, could not be used to argue for a death sentence unless relevant to "the issue being tried."<p>

McGill misleadingly suggested in his closing argument that the Jamal quotation showed that "this is not something that happened overnight" -- implying that Jamal had been looking for a chance to kill a cop -- and stressed that "one thing that cannot be tolerated is constant abuse of authority, defiance of authority, and daily law-breaking."<p>

Daily law-breaking? For all his revolutionary rhetoric, the 27- year-old Jamal had a spotless criminal record. And "abuse of authority" is not supposed to be a capital offense in this country. (The Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 1989 unpersuasively upheld McGill's use of Jamal's political statements as showing his "long-standing disdain for the system.")<p>

McGill also sought to minimize the jury's sense of responsibility by arguing, among other things, that the jurors could bring in a verdict of death without worrying too much about Jamal's being executed: He would have "appeal after appeal after appeal," and any verdict for death would not be final.<p>

In my view, this violates several U.S. Supreme Court cases and a 1986 Pennsylvania Supreme Court precedent, which had struck down a man's death sentence because of nearly identical comments to the jury by the same Joseph McGill. (The Pennsylvania court, straining to distinguish these precedents, rejected Jamal's appeal on this point too.)<p>

Judge Sabo's instructions of law to the jury were also constitutionally flawed in at least two respects: Sabo made no explicit mention of the jury's obligation to consider any evidence of overall good character as a mitigating circumstance. He also used a standard Pennsylvania verdict form that appears to violate principles later detailed in the 1988 Supreme Court decision in Mills v. Maryland, by leaving the false implication that unanimity might be required to find any such mitigating circumstance.<p>

<b>Celebrity on Death Row</b><br>

After his 1982 trial, Jamal, like most death row inmates, largely disappeared from view. But by 1989 -- when his less-than-well- crafted direct appeal was spurned by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court -- the seeds were being planted for his remarkable rise to global celebrity. He has since emerged as the nation's premier anti-death penalty poster boy, and as a rallying point for what remains of the radical left.<p>

In the late 1980s, Jamal's MOVE supporters brought his cause to the attention of the far left, New York-based Partisan Defense Committee, which portrayed Jamal as a political prisoner and began organizing protests around the country and in Europe. Jamal's cause was also taken up by other leftist groups, death penalty opponents, and black politicians.<p>

Leonard Weinglass, a seasoned 62-year-old trial lawyer with a long list of leftist causes and criminals on his resume, was recruited by Jamal's family and friends and took over as lead counsel in early 1992. Weinglass has represented three defendants in the 1969-1970 Chicago Seven conspiracy trial as well as Angela Davis, Jane Fonda, Kathy Boudin, and various protesters, accused bombers, and killers. Working with Weinglass are his protege Daniel Williams, of New York's Moore & Williams; PDC staff counsel Rachel Wolkenstein; and Jonathan Piper, a 35-year-old associate at Chicago's Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal. Piper and others at his firm have put in thousands of pro bono hours on the case.<p>

While his legal team was preparing for post-conviction appeals, Jamal was writing dozens of essays about prison life and the criminal justice system. He was published in the Yale Law Journal (in 1991), the Nation magazine, and elsewhere, and he taped radio broadcasts that were aired in New York, San Francisco, Canada, Cuba, England, France, Germany, and Australia. Addison-Wesley Publishing Co. collected many of these commentaries this spring in Jamal's book, Live from Death Row, which has been a commercial success.<p>

<b>The Sabo Circus: Part II</b><br>

National and international media attention on Jamal's case reached a crescendo this summer, after Pennsylvania governor Thomas Ridge signed a death warrant on June 1, scheduling Jamal's execution for the week of August 13. Jamal's legal team filed his first state petition for post-conviction relief, as well as related motions for discovery, a stay of execution, and recusal of Judge Sabo -- some 300 pages in all -- on June 5.<p>

Under Pennsylvania procedure, Judge Sabo had the option of presiding over the post-conviction proceeding, much of which consisted of attacks on his own conduct at the 1982 trial. Although semiretired, he seized the case with relish, summarily spurning contentions that he should recuse himself because of what Jamal's lawyers called his bias at Jamal's trial, his general bias against African-American capital defendants, and "his inability to endow this proceeding with . . . the appearance of fairness and impartiality."<p>

This last accusation proved an understatement. Throughout the internationally scrutinized post-conviction hearing, which ran from July 26 to August 15, and the closing arguments on September 11, Judge Sabo flaunted his bias, oozing partiality toward the prosecution and crudely seeking to bully Weinglass, whose courtroom conduct was as correct as Sabo's was crass.<p>

Sabo denied all of Jamal's discovery requests and quashed over 25 subpoenas, many of which sought evidence that Sabo had barred the lawyers from exploring through discovery or other witnesses. He sharply restricted Jamal's lawyers in their questioning of witnesses, and blocked them from making offers of proof on the record to show the import of the precluded testimony. In a letter to Sabo, Weinglass complained that the judge's conduct "raises the troubling spectre of attempting to defeat judicial review."<p>

Sabo also hurled two unwarranted contempt-of-court citations at Jamal's lawyers. On August 2 he ordered Rachel Wolkenstein handcuffed and arrested for repeatedly seeking to explain for the record the relevance of two witnesses whose subpoenas Sabo had quashed. And on August 11 Sabo fined Leonard Weinglass $1,000 for failing to hand over some photographic slides quickly enough.<p>

"We were in some kind of a game where, when we complied with a request or a ruling, the rules changed," recalls Weinglass, adding that Sabo and the late judge Julius Hoffman of Chicago Seven fame are the only two judges who have held him in contempt. Asked to compare the two, Weinglass responds: "Judge Hoffman had a lot more finesse and a good sense of humor. Judge Sabo is just a blunderbuss of bias."<p>

Jamal's lawyers did not hit any home runs at the hearing, and had some setbacks. Their new witnesses -- including William Singletary and Arnold Howard -- were less than credible. But they did succeed in doggedly piling up a record that, when scrutinized in detail, establishes the unfairness of Jamal's trial and sentencing; casts a dark shadow over the integrity of the system that put him on death row; raises substantial doubt about whether this was a first-degree murder; and leaves a lingering question whether Jamal killed Faulkner at all.<p>

Sabo rejected Jamal's petition on September 15, four days after receiving the parties' post-hearing briefs and hearing their closing arguments. Much of his 154-page opinion was lifted verbatim from the prosecution's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Jamal's lawyers have appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. If they lose there, they will seek federal habeas corpus review.<p>

<b>What Should Be Done</b><br>

A careful appraisal of the facts, and a scrupulous application of the constitutional precedents, would lead a reviewing court to reverse both Jamal's sentence and his conviction, and to grant him a new trial. (That's not a prediction.)<p>

But while I have no doubt that Jamal's death sentence should be reversed, I initially hesitated to call for a new trial, and I suspect that judges might hesitate as well.<p>

The reason (which no judge would admit) is this: Big-city juries can no longer be counted on to convict -- even when the defendant is clearly a vicious murderer -- in racially charged cases poisoned by police misconduct. See, for example, People v. Orenthal James Simpson. So a new trial for Jamal might very well mean an acquittal.<p>

And the evidence that Jamal shot Faulkner -- and probably fired the fatal shot -- remains very strong, even if, as I believe, both of Jamal's "confessions" were fabrications, and the police and prosecutors cannot be trusted, and the eyewitness testimony was unreliable, and someone ran away from the scene, perhaps after shooting Faulkner at least once.<p>

Is it clear beyond a reasonable doubt that Jamal killed Faulkner? I lean toward that conclusion, but with some ambivalence. I still have a nagging little question about whether the real killer may have gotten away. And the evidence that tips me toward finding Jamal guilty beyond a reasonable doubt is supposed to be irrelevant (under Fifth Amendment case law), and would be inadmissible at any retrial.<p>

That evidence is the 14-year-long silence of both Jamal and his brother, William Cook, about what happened. Neither of them has ever said how Faulkner was killed, or even denied explicitly that Jamal killed him. Not on the day of the murder. Not at Jamal's trial. And not during the 14 years since.<p>

The most Jamal has ever said about the murder was his statement to the jury during the sentencing phase that "I am innocent of these charges."<p>

What's that supposed to mean? Jamal's lawyers say it means Jamal didn't shoot Faulkner. I'm not so sure. This is a man who chooses words with care. If he were truly innocent, wouldn't he have found at least one occasion, in the 5,000 days since Faulkner's death, publicly to say something like "I didn't shoot him"? And to explain who did?<p>

Jamal will not answer such questions. Although he has granted some interviews, he declined my request for one, through his lawyers, after I refused to agree to their condition that I promise in advance not to ask Jamal anything about what happened the morning of Faulkner's death.<p>

The silence of Jamal and Cook leaves me convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Jamal shot Faulkner at least once, and comes very close to convincing me that he fired the fatal shot. Still, there is good reason to believe that if Jamal did fire the fatal shot, he acted with a mental state somewhere on the spectrum of culpability between manslaughter and classic first-degree murder, because he resorted to deadly force only after seeing Faulkner beating Cook bloody, and probably only after being shot by Faulkner.<p>

And for doing that -- in the interval of a few seconds that crashed without warning into what had for 27 years been a largely admirable life -- the appropriate penalty is less than death, and less than life without parole. The maximum penalty for manslaughter in Pennsylvania in 1981 was ten years, with parole eligibility after five. I'm not sure that this was a mere manslaughter, and I'm not sure that the 14 years Jamal has already spent behind bars -- mostly in the hell-on-earth called death row -- is punishment enough. But it's close.<p>

And that is reason enough to put aside any qualms about the possibility that granting Jamal the appropriate legal relief might lead to his walking free. He deserves a new trial, and he should get one.<p>

Now and then a case comes along that tells us a lot about how close we are coming to executing innocent people in this country, and in substantial numbers, and about what will happen if Congress completes the evisceration of the writ of habeas corpus that is already under way in the Supreme Court.<P>

One such case is that of Missouri death row inmate Lloyd Schlup. It took a revealing turn on Dec. 8, when a federal district judge found Schlup to be probably innocent, in the sense that &quot;no reasonable juror would have convicted [Schlup] in light of the new evidence&quot; now in the record, of the 1984 prison murder of which he was convicted. (Schlup was already in prison for two other crimes of (nonfatal) violence.) The judge found credible the recent testimony of 11 eyewitnesses and two alibi witnesses that Schlup was not even present during the murder.<P>

This holding, by Judge Jean Hamilton of St. Louis (a George Bush appointee), is remarkable in several ways:<P>
<UL>
<LI>The same Judge Hamilton had previously pushed Schlup down the track toward the death chamber without bothering to hold an evidentiary hearing in an August 1993 decision spurning his habeas appeal and vacating his stay of execution.<P>

<LI>Schlup would probably have been executed years ago if the habeas corpus &quot;reforms&quot; that were passed last year by both the Senate and the House (in somewhat different forms) had been in effect.<P>

<LI>Schlup would surely have been executed by now but for the efforts of his first good lawyer, Sean O'Brien of Kansas City, Mo., who did not get the case until six years after Schlup's December 1985 conviction, and whom Congress is trying to put out of business. (O'Brien was head of the Missouri Capital Punishment Resource Center until last fall, when Congress cut off the federal funds that had sustained it and other offices supporting appeals of indigent death row inmates; he is now struggling to find the resources to stay in death row defense work as head of the newly created Public Interest Litigation Clinic.)<P>

<LI>Schlup can still be executed, even after convincing a federal court of his probable innocence, unless he can also prove that his 1985 trial was so unfair as to violate the Constitution.<P>
</UL>
The U.S. Supreme Court made this last point clear on Jan. 23, 1995, in Schlup v. Delo, which directed the lower federal courts to take a closer look at Schlup's evidence of innocence, but at the same time saddled Schlup (and other habeas petitioners) with a heavy burden of proof:<P>

A death row prisoner whose initial federal habeas corpus appeal has been blown by incompetent counsel, as in Schlup's case and many others, can prevail in a successive appeal, the Court held, only if he can prove either that he had an unconstitutionally unfair trial (no easy task) or that newly discovered facts &quot;unquestionably establish [his] innocence&quot; (a virtually impossible task).<P>

So if a prisoner can prove only that he is probably innocent, and cannot prove constitutional error at his trial, the state is free to execute him. So says the Supreme Court, in a decision that both the Senate and House have voted to overrule as too generous to death row inmates!<P>

O'Brien must now try to convince Judge Hamilton (at a Jan. 26 hearing) that Schlup's 1985 trial was flawed by ineffective assistance of counsel or suppression of exculpatory evidence. And Schlup is still sitting on death row.<P>

When all this was explained to O'Brien's 9-year-old daughter Haley, her reaction was understandable: &quot;How many times does Dad have to win this case before it's over?&quot;<P>

O'Brien has won it twice so far. But these partial victories came after a decade of rulings against Schlup, by both state and federal courts, that brought him to within hours of execution in November 1993. (The history of the case and the evidence are detailed in my article &quot;He Didn't Do It&quot; in The American Lawyer, December 1994.)<P>

Schlup's case shows why the tough-on-crime crowd's goal of speeding the pace of executions can be accomplished only by cutting off habeas appeals before defendants like Schlup can get the kind of lawyering necessary to show their innocence.<P>

The underqualified, undercompensated, court-appointed lawyers who defend most capital cases at trial typically do little or no independent investigation of the facts. And the tiny band of really good death penalty defense lawyers focus on those of the 3,000 death row inmates who are closest to execution. So evidence of innocence often emerges years after conviction.<P>

Schlup was convicted of the February 1984 murder of Arthur Dade after a two-day trial in December 1985. Dade, a black prisoner, was stabbed to death in a crowded cellblock by Robert O'Neal, a hit man for a white prison gang called the Aryan Brotherhood. (O'Neal was executed on Dec. 6, 1995.) Schlup's conviction and death sentence rested on the testimony of two prison guards that they saw him holding Dade while O'Neal did the stabbing.<P>

Glaring weaknesses in the prosecution's case_suggesting that the guards did not see the stabbing at all --and powerful exculpatory evidence were not effectively exploited, either by Schlup's court-appointed trial lawyer (who got $2,000 for fees and expenses) or by his first three court-appointed post -conviction counsel (who were paid little or nothing).<P>

For almost eight years, for example, Schlup urged these four successive lawyers to confirm his story that he was not present during the murder by interviewing some of the more than two dozen prisoners who were there. Nor did any of these lawyers make effective use of a prison surveillance videotape that strongly supports Schlup's alibi; it shows him calmly strolling into the cafeteria for lunch 65 seconds before the prison radio broadcast a distress call from the scene, some 400 feet away.<P>

Schlup's post-conviction counsel were pressured by execution-happy state judges to rush through the appeals without taking the time to investigate the facts. And under Supreme Court precedents, Schlup's burden of proof became heavier as his lawyers frittered away his appeals.<P>

It was not until Schlup's mother found Sean O'Brien in late 1991 that the evidence of his innocence began to emerge. By mid-1993, O'Brien had shredded the credibility of the prosecution's witnesses and hunted down more than 20 prisoner -eyewitnesses who signed affidavits swearing, with striking unanimity, across racial and gang lines, that Schlup was not present during the racially charged murder.<P>

Even then, O'Brien could not get to first base with Judge Hamilton. In her initial, August 1993, decision, the judge took her cue from Supreme Court precedents suggesting that federal courts should give short shrift to successive habeas petitions.<P>

She rejected O'Brien's request for an evidentiary hearing; she termed the prisoner-eyewitnesses &quot;suspect&quot; because their affidavits had been produced years after the crime and because &quot;inmates . . . do not necessarily have a strong incentive to refrain from perjuring themselves&quot;; and she held that Schlup &quot;has failed to make a persuasive showing of actual innocence.&quot;<P>

Compare Judge Hamilton's 18-page opinion on Dec. 8, 1995, after a three-day evidentiary hearing: She found 11 prisoner -eyewitnesses who testified that Schlup had not been present during the murder to be &quot;credible in spite of their criminal histories&quot;; she also credited the testimony of a former guard, Robert Faherty, who supported Schlup's alibi by asserting that he had encountered Schlup far from the scene, en route to lunch; and she held that &quot;[i]t is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted [Schlup] in light of the new evidence.&quot;<P>

What a difference a three-day hearing makes.<P>

But there would have been no hearing if the matter had been left to Judge Hamilton and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. It affirmed her August 1993 ruling against Schlup by a 2-1 vote, in an opinion that reads less like a careful inquiry into the facts than like a complaint about Schlup's persistence in pestering the courts.<P>

That would have been the end of the case, and of Schlup, who was scheduled for execution on Nov. 19, 1993, four days after the 8th Circuit ruling, but for Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan's last-minute decision to delay the execution. Then came the Supreme Court's highly unusual decision not only to hear Schlup's appeal, but also to conduct a detailed review of the evidence.<P>

The Court's 5-4 decision a year ago exuded concern that this death row inmate might very well be innocent. It was this concern that apparently won over the crucial fifth vote, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, whose previous votes curbing habeas corpus review had helped bring Schlup close to execution, and whose ongoing hostility to habeas apparently explains why the Court's ruling for Schlup was so narrow and grudging.<P>

The holding was that the lower courts had put too heavy a burden on Schlup when they required him to prove his innocence by &quot;clear and convincing evidence&quot; in order to qualify for an evidentiary hearing. The justices held that on remand, Schlup should get a hearing if he could &quot;show it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in the light of the new evidence.&quot;<P>

It is this holding that would be overturned by the habeas legislation now before Congress, which would (among other things) reinstate the &quot;clear and convincing&quot; standard that Judge Hamilton and the 8th Circuit had initially used to deny Schlup a hearing.<P>

The bills passed by the House and Senate are numbingly complex. But the progress of Schlup's case discloses their basic message: We want the likes of Lloyd Schlup executed_guilty or innocent.<P>

The suit alleges that tobacco companies sold and marketed their products "knowing full and well that when the State of New Jersey's citizens used those cigarettes,...[they] would be substantially certain to suffer injury, disease, and illness, including cancer, emphysema, heart disease, and other illnesses causing disability and death and that the State of New Jersey itself would be economically injured thereby." </p> <p><a href=marlboroman.html>Widow of Marlboro Man Sues Philip Morris</a><br>The widow of the "Marlboro Man" filed suit August 30, 1996 against the tobacco industry, alleging that its fraud and deceit contributed to David McLean's death from lung cancer. McLean was featured in a long-running campaign for Philip Morris' most popular brand of cigarettes. McLean's widow alleges that he routinely smoked as many as five packs of cigarettes a day in the course of shooting print and television commercials.</P><p><a href=michigan.html>Michigan Sues Tobacco Companies</a><br>Michigan is the thirteenth state to sue the nation's leading tobacco companies to recover health care costs from cigarette-related illnesses. In this suit, filed on August 21, 1996, Michigan also names several major wholesalers and vending machine operators as defendants.</p><p><a href=kansas.html>Kansas Sues Tobacco Companies</a><br>Kansas is one of the latest states to sue the nation's leadingtobacco companies to recover health care costs incurred because of theharmful effects of cigarette smoke. The Kansas suit also citesviolations of the state's Consumer Protection Act stemming from whatit alleges were deceptive trade practices used by the tobacco industryin denying consumers accurate information on the health risks ofsmoking.<p><p><a href=lacounty.html> Los Angeles County Sues Tobacco Companies</a><br>In this complaint against the nation's leading cigarette manufacturers, the County of Los Angeles alleges "that through a fraudulent course of conduct that has spanned decades, Defendants have manufactured, promoted, distributed or sold tobacco products to thousands of residents of the County knowing, but denying and concealing, that their tobacco products contain a highly addictive drug, known as nicotine, and have, unbeknownst to the public, controlled and manipulated the amount and big-availability of nicotine in their tobacco products for the purpose and with the intent of creating and sustaining addiction."<p><p><a href=arch.html>Arch v. American Tobacco</a><br>After a federal appeals court did not grant class-action status to a lawsuit accusing the tobacco manufacturers of manipulating nicotine levels to keep smokers hooked and suppressing data that cigarettes are addictive, The Castano Plaintiffs Legal Committee announced its intention to pursue state-wide class actions across the country. This one was recently filed in Pennsylvania.<p><p><a href=disclose.html> Tobacco Companies Sue to Block Disclosure Law</a><br>Four tobacco companies filed this lawsuit against the state of Massachusetts to block enforcement of a tobacco disclosure law.  The law requires tobacco companies to provide lists of ingredients in their products other than tobacco, water, and reconstituted tobacco. The companies claim the law would force them to give up trade secrets in violation of the Constitutional provisions against seizing property without compensation. They also claim the required disclosures would place an undue burden on interstate and foreign commerce.<p><p><A href=conn.html> Connecticut Sues Tobacco Companies</a><br>On July 18, 1996, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal filed this suit against seven tobacco companies for $1 billion, charging that they had engaged in "conspiracy to mislead, deceive and confuse" the state and its residents about the debilitating and addictive effects of cigarettes. Two weeks ago, four tobacco companies sued Blumenthal in a pre-emptive strike, charging that his expected suit would unconstitutionally impede the interstate commerce of a legal product.<p><p><A href=ctsued.html>Philip Morris v. Blumenthal</a><br>On June 28, 1996, four tobaccco companies filed this suitagainst Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal to preventhim from filing suit against the tobacco companies. Blumenthal isplanning to file a suit against the companies seeking to recoup statefunds spent on smoking-related illnesses.<p><P><A HREF="mnsuit2.html">Minnesota v. Philip Morris</A><BR>The Supreme Court denied a request for certiorari by the tobacco companies, allowing this order to stand in the State of Minnesota's suit to recover health care and other costs resulting from the use of tobacco products. The order covers creation of a central repository for discovery documents and allows plaintiff access to an internal tobacco industry database of research and litigation documents.</P><P><A HREF="noclass.html">Appeals Court Rejects Class Action Lawsuit Against Tobacco Industry</A><BR>The tobacco industry won a major legal victory on May 23, 1996, when a federal appeals court refused to grant class-action status to a lawsuit accusing the companies of manipulating nicotine levels to keep smokers hooked and suppressing data that cigarettes are addictive.</P><P><A HREF="mdsuit.html">Maryland Sues Tobacco Companies</A><BR>The State of Maryland has joined other states, including Massachusetts and Texas, in suing the tobacco industry to recover funds paid out for health care and other costs. The state argues that the costs were incurred because the "Big Six" tobacco concerns carried out a conspiracy of false warranties and disinformation to prevent potential smokers from realizing the likelihood of addiction and the health effects of smoking. The suit, filed May 1, 1996, claims that the addictive and carcinogenic effects of cigarette smoking have been known to the management in the tobacco industry for decades.</P><P><A HREF="txsuit.html">Texas Sues Tobacco Companies</A><BR>Texas has become the seventh state to file suit against the tobacco industry, claiming the companies placed profits above the well-being of the American people, and that they deliberately suppressed evidence linking nicotine and various illnesses. The suit also alleges that the tobacco industry used advertising targeted at children to build their customer base, obscuring the addictive, unhealty elements of smoking. The lawsuit was filed in federal court on March 28, 1996.</P><P><A HREF="statements.html">Statements of Former Philip Morris Employees</A><BR>Three former employees of the Philip Morris company gave these sworn statements to the Food and Drug Administration. The statements seemingly contradict the company's publicly-held position on the purposes and nature of its own research into the effects of its products and the process of "restoring" nicotine to cigarette tobacco.  The FDA is soliciting comment on these declarations.</P><P><A HREF="liggett.html">Tobacco Settlement: Liggett Group</A><BR>The Liggett Group, the smallest of the nation's five major tobacco companies, has broken ranks with the rest of the industry and agreed to settle several huge liability suits. The largest suit that Liggett settled was the Castano action case in which about 60 law firms are suing on behalf of every U.S. smoker who claims to be addicted. This is the settlement.</P><P><A HREF="moore.html">Media Attempts to Unseal Informer's Deposition</A><BR>A group of newspapers filed this Dec. 4, 1995 motion to unseal the testimony of Jeffrey Wigand, a former researcher at Brown & Williamson, a tobacco company. Wigand provided information to 60 Minutes for a segment the TV news magazine chose not to air because of the risk of being sued. Wigand was deposed as an expert witness in the case of Moore v. American Tobacco Co., but his deposition has been placed under seal by the court.</P><P><A HREF="morales.html">Tobacco Companies Sue Texas</A><BR>A group of tobacco companies has filed suit against the Attorney General of Texas and various state departments to preempt a "threatened lawsuit" by the state. The tobacco companies claim that the state is preparing a suit against them for the costs incurred by Medicaid and other health programs due to the detrimental effects of cigarette smoking on Texans. They also claim that the state authorities are overreaching their authority and that any suit should be dismissed for various procedural reasons. Here is the Nov. 28, 1995 petition.</P><P><A HREF="wigand.html">Tobacco Company Sues Informer</A><BR>Brown & Williamson has filed this suit against Jeffrey Wigand, a former employee, for allegedly breaching employee confidentiality agreements by providing information regarding the tobacco company's research and business operations to the media and to plaintiffs in a products liability suit.</P><P>In a much reported sequence of events, Mr. Wigand provided information to CBS's "60 Minutes" for a segment which the network chose not to air because of the risk of being named a defendant in a suit much like this one. CBS has reportedly agreed to indemnify Mr. Wigand regarding this suit.</P><P><A HREF="broin.html">Broin v. Philip Morris Companies</A><BR>A Florida court order permitting airline flight attendants to sue tobacco companies for second-hand smoke-related health problems.</P><P><A HREF="flsuit.html">Florida v. U.S. Tobacco Companies</A><BR>This is the full text of the complaint filed by the state of Florida against major tobacco companies "to force cigarette manufacturers to pay for the health care crises their products have caused." The complaint asks the court to order "the defendants to disgorge all profits from sales of cigarettes in Florida." </P><P><A HREF="nycigar.html">N.Y. Smoking Complaint</A><BR>A cigar-smoking New York City lawyer has filed a complaint challenging the City's new anti-smoking law, as it applies to cigars. The lawyer argues that there is no basis for assuming that studies showing harmful effects of second-hand cigarette smoke hold true for cigar smoke. He also challenges the constitutionality of the new law, and states, "Prior to January 1, 1995, a number of desirable women enjoyed the company of their cigar smoking male companions and understood the enhancing qualities of maleness."</P><P><A HREF="abc.html">RJR Nabisco Complaint</A><BR>RJR Nabisco's complaint against ABC for allegedly making false and defamatory statements.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
 
 
ANNIE LEIBOVITZ, 
 
Plaintiff, 
 
- against - 
 
 
PARAMOUNT PICTURES CORPORATION, 
 
Defendant. 
 
 
Civil Action No. 

COMPLAINT 

PLAINTIFF DEMANDS A JURY TRIAL 


Plaintiff Annie Leibovitz, by her attorneys, Norwick & Schad, for her 
complaint, alleges as follows:  


INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT 
 
1. Plaintiff Annie Leibovitz ("plaintiff") is a professional photographer of 
international reputation. Her distinctive and widely acclaimed photographs 
have been published editorially and in advertising in all media throughout 
the world. Her photographs appear in the editorial pages of Vanity Fair 
magazine on a regular basis.  
 
 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
 
2. This is an action for copyright infringement arising under the Copyright 
Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C. Sec. 101 et seq. Jurisdiction over this action is 
conferred by 28 U.S.C. Secs. 1331 and 1338.  
 
3. Venue is proper within the Southern District of New York, under 28 
U.S.C. Sec. 1400.  
 
 
THE PARTIES 
 
4. Plaintiff is an American citizen by birth, residing in the County and City 
of New York.  
 
5. Upon information and belief, defendant Paramount Pictures Corporation 
("defendant") is a California corporation having its principal place of 
business in Los Angeles, California, with offices in the City, County and 
State of New York.  
 
 
STATEMENT OF FACTS 
 
6. In early 1991, plaintiff photographed the actress Demi Moore on 
assignment for Vanity Fair magazine, a publication of Advance Magazine 
Publishers Inc. d/b/a The Conde Nast Publications Inc. ("Conde Nast"). 
One of plaintiff's photographs of Demi Moore (the "Photograph"), 
attached as Exhibit A hereto, was published with permission on the cover 
of the August 1991 issue of Vanity Fair.  
 
7. The August 1991 issue of Vanity Fair was duly registered for copyright 
by Conde Nast on July 31, 1991 under Registration No. 3 109 469. 
Plaintiff, as the photographer, is the beneficial and sole owner of all right, 
title and interest in the copyright in the Photograph.  
 
8. In late 1993 or early 1994, defendant commenced an international 
advertising campaign for its motion picture, "Naked Gun 33 1/3, the Final 
Insult" (the "Film"), about to be released in March 1994. The 
advertisements featured the Photograph, or a copy of it, attached as 
Exhibit B, superimposing over the face of Demi Moore the face of Leslie 
Neilsen, the star of the Film.  
 
9. Starting in early 1994, defendant caused advertisements featuring the 
Copy to be published in print media in this district, in the United States 
and, upon information and belief, throughout the world. Moreover, on 
information and belief, the Copy also appeared on posters advertising the 
Film in motion picture theaters throughout the world. The advertisements 
and posters featuring the Copy bore the legend, "Copyright 1993 by 
Paramount Pictures, All Rights Reserved."  
 
10. Plaintiff and her agent, Contact Press Images, Inc., through their 
attorneys, wrote to defendant on March 14, 1994 that the pervasive and 
unauthorized use of the Photograph was a calculated and willful violation 
of the copyright in the Photograph and that its continued use by defendant 
would only compound the injury.  
 
11. By letter of March 17, 1994, defendant informed plaintiff's counsel 
that defendant did not reproduce the Photograph in the advertisements. 
Rather, defendant wrote that the photograph (the Copy) which appeared in 
the advertisements "was a specially commissioned photograph of a model 
hired for the ad campaign." By letter of March 25, 1994, counsel for 
plaintiff notified defendant that the intentional copying of the Photograph 
only aggravated the infringement.  
 
12. Defendant did not respond to the letter. Instead it continued its willful 
and intentional infringement of plaintiff's registered copyright, in total 
disregard of plaintiff's rights.  
 
 
CLAIM FOR RELIEF 
 
13. Plaintiff repeats and realleges each and every allegation set forth in 
Paragraphs 1 through 13 herein.  
 
14. By its actions alleged above, defendant has infringed and continues to 
infringe plaintiff's copyright in the Photograph. -  
 
WHEREFORE, plaintiff respectfully requests judgment against defendant 
as follows:  
 
(1) that defendant, its officers, directors, principals, agents, servants, 
employees, successors and assigns, and all those in active concert or 
participation with it, be preliminarily and permanently enjoined and 
restrained from infringing the copyright in the Photograph in any manner;  
 
(2) that defendant's infringements be found to have been intentional and 
willful;  
 
(3) that defendant be required to pay to plaintiff statutory damages 
pursuant to the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Secs. 101 et seq.;  
 
(4) that defendant be required to account for all gains and profits 
attributable to defendant's acts of infringement;  
 
(5) that defendant be required to pay to plaintiff actual damages according 
to proof and all profits attributable to the infringements of plaintiff's 
copyright;  
 
(6) that plaintiff be awarded plaintiff's costs and attorneys' fees, pursuant 
to 17 U.S.C. Secs. 101 et seq. and  
 
(7) that the Court grant such other relief as the Court deems proper.

<P>Paramount Pictures superimposed comic actor Leslie Neilsen's face 
over a portrait of a pregnant Demi Moore to promote the film, "Naked 
Gun 33 1/3." Photographer Annie Leibovitz sued Paramount over its use 
of the copyrighted photo, which she originally shot for the cover of Vanity 
Fair magazine. In this Dec. 19, 1996 order, a federal judge threw out the 
lawsuit, ruling that Parmount's ad was a parody and a fair use of the 
copyrighted work.</P>

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
 
 
ANNIE LEIBOVITZ, 
 
-against- 
 
PARAMOUNT PICTURES CORPORATION, 
 
Defendant. 
 
 
94 Civ. 9144 (LAP) 
 
MEMORANDUM AND ORDER 
 
 
LORETTA A. PRESKA, United States District Judge:  
 
This action examines the extent to which a parody that appears in the form 
of an advertisement can constitute a fair use of a copyrighted work. 
Plaintiff is a well-known photographer who shot a photograph of the 
actress Demi Moore that appeared on the August, 1991 cover of Vanity 
Fair. Ms. Moore was eight months pregnant and nude in the photo, the 
publication of which aroused a great deal of controversy. It is undisputed 
that plaintiff is the sole owner of the copyright in this photograph. In 1993, 
the defendant was developing advertising in connection with the release of 
its film, Naked Gun: The Final Insult 331/3. The defendant eventually 
selected a "teaser" ad which it contends was a parody of the Vanity Fair 
cover. In the advertisement, a model who was also eight months pregnant 
was photographed against a backdrop similar to that used in the Demi 
Moore photograph; the lighting and pose were also similar to the Moore 
photograph. Further, the photograph was subjected to some computer 
manipulation in order to duplicate the skin tone and body configuration 
that appeared in the Moore photo. On top of the second model's body, 
however, appeared a photograph of the face of Leslie Nielsen, the star of 
the Naked Gun series of films. In contrast to Ms. Moore's expression of 
fulfillment, serenity, and pride, Mr. Nielsen's face wore a guilty smirk. 
Underneath the photo ran the legend "Due This March."  
 
Plaintiff brought suit, charging that the advertisement infringed her 
copyright in the Moore photograph. Defendant conceded that plaintiff 
owns the copyright in the photograph and that its advertisement targeted 
the Moore photograph, but contended that the ad was a parody and a fair 
use of plaintiff's copyrighted work. The parties made cross-motions for 
summary judgment. For the reasons that follow, plaintiff's motion for 
summary judgment is denied, and defendant's motion for summary 
judgment is granted.  
 
 
BACKGROUND 
 
Plaintiff Annie Leibovitz is a professional photographer whose work has 
earned international acclaim. (Affidavit of Annie Leibovitz, sworn to on 
June 28, 1996, Para. 2). She serves as an independent contractor with 
Conde Nast, the publisher of Vanity Fair magazine. (Leibovitz Aff., Para. 
2). In 1991, pursuant to her exclusive contract with Conde Nast, Ms. 
Leibovitz shot a series of photographs of actress Demi Moore. Ms. Moore 
was eight months pregnant at the time and posed in the nude for some of 
the photographs. (Leibovitz Aff., Paras. 6-8). One of the nude photographs 
was ultimately selected for publication as the August, 1991 cover of 
Vanity Fair. (Leibovitz Aff., Para. 7). The cover aroused a great deal of 
controversy and public commentary at the time of its publication. 
(Leibovitz Aff., Para. 8, Deposition of Annie Leibovitz, p. 25; Declaration 
of Nathan Grant, sworn to June 25, 1996, Para. 6). For a substantial period 
of time (until, in fact, its displacement by another Leibovitz cover), the 
August, 1991 issue was the best-selling single issue of Vanity Fair. 
(Deposition of Jeffrey D. Smith, p. 46). The August, 1991 issue of Vanity 
Fair was duly registered for copyright by Conde Nast in July, 1991 under 
Registration No. 3 109 469. (Leibovitz Aff., Para. 2). Plaintiff, as the 
photographer, is the undisputed owner of the copyright in the Moore 
photograph. (Leibovitz Aff., Para. 2).  
 
In 1991, Spy magazine featured a parody of the Moore photograph on the 
cover of its September issue. (Grant Decl., Para. 9). The cover consisted of 
a photograph of the face of Bruce Willis, Ms. Moore's husband, 
superimposed on the computer-manipulated body of a pregnant man. 
(Grant Decl., Exhibit A). Although Ms. Leibovitz was aware of this cover, 
neither she nor anyone else registered any objection to it. (Deposition of 
Annie Leibovitz, pp. 32-34).  
 
In August, 1993, defendant Paramount hired Dazu, Inc., an outside 
advertising agency, to develop a "teaser" campaign for the upcoming 
release of the film, Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult. (Grant Decl., Para. 
3). A teaser campaign is a brief campaign designed to pique the public's 
interest in a forthcoming movie and give a hint of the plot. (Grant Decl., 
Para. 3). According to Paramount's Executive Vice President for Creative 
Advertising, the main theme of Naked Gun 33 1/3 centers around the 
protagonist's struggle with his new life as a retired police detective and 
pressure from his wife to start a family. In the midst of this crisis, the 
detective is called upon to prevent a mad bomber (and his mother) from 
blowing up the Academy Awards ceremony. (Declaration of Lucia 
Ludovico, sworn to on July 1, 1996, Para. 4). Paramount provided Dazu 
with a copy of the script and requested that Dazu develop teaser ads that 
would be in line with the no-holds-barred humor that characterized the 
Naked Gun series of films. (Ludovico Decl., Para. 5).  
 
In response to this request, the agency provided several options. Among its 
suggestions was a hybrid photograph featuring the smirking face of Leslie 
Nielsen, the actor featured in the Naked Gun films, engrafted onto Ms. 
Moore's pregnant, nude body from the Vanity Fair cover. (Ludovico Decl., 
Para. 6; Grant Decl. Para. 6). Paramount's executive Vice President for 
Creative Advertising stated that she believed that the Nielsen ad, which 
"lampooned the controversial and 'serious' Moore Photo, was perfectly in 
keeping with the Naked Gun brand of irreverent parodic humor." 
(Ludovico Decl., Para. 7). In addition, the proposed ad was linked to the 
themes of marriage and childbearing that were central to the movie's plot.  
 
Once Paramount had selected the Nielsen ad, Dazu sought out and hired 
another model, who was also eight months pregnant, to serve as a body 
double for Ms. Moore. (Grant Decl., Para. 10). Dazu posed the model in a 
manner similar to Ms. Moore's photograph, against a similar backdrop, 
with similar lighting. (Grant Decl., Para. 10). The photograph was also 
digitally modified to more faithfully replicate the body configuration and 
skin tone that appeared in the Vanity Fair cover. (Grant Decl., Para. 10; 
Deposition of Kevin Stapleton, pp. 16-17). Dazu and its contractors then 
superimposed the smirking, guilty face of Leslie Nielsen on the second 
model's body and added the words beneath the photograph, "Due This 
March." (Leibovitz Aff., Exh. C). Neither Dazu nor Paramount ever 
requested permission to use the Vanity Fair cover from Ms. Leibovitz or 
Conde Nast.  
 
The Nielsen ad ran in several magazines, including Vanity Fair, nationally 
in January and February, 1994. Nathan Grant received two industry 
awards for his work on the Nielsen ad. (Grant Decl., Para. 12). Publication 
of the ads ceased sometime around February, 1994. In March, 1994, 
counsel for Ms. Leibovitz informed Paramount that it viewed the Nielsen 
ad as an infringement of the Moore photograph. Paramount responded that 
the ad was a parody and therefore non-infringing, and that the ad was no 
longer in use. In December, 1994, plaintiff instituted the present suit. The 
parties have cross-moved for summary judgment. Both parties agree that 
in the absence of a fair use defense, the Nielsen ad infringes the Moore 
photograph. The dispositive issue before me, then, is whether the Nielsen 
ad constituted a fair use of the Moore photograph.  
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
I. Summary Judgment Standard 
 
Under Rule 56(c), summary judgment 
 
 
shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to 
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, 
show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the 
moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.  
 
 
Fed. R. Civ. P. Sec. 56(c); see Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 
250 (1986).  
 
The moving party has the initial burden of "informing the district court of 
the basis for its motion" and identifying the matter that "it believes 
demonstrate[s] the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Celotex 
Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). The substantive law 
determines which facts are material to the outcome of a particular 
litigation. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250; Heyman v. Commerce & Indus. 
Ins. Co., 524 F.2d 1317, 1320 (2d Cir. 1975). In determining whether 
summary judgment is appropriate, a court must resolve all ambiguities, 
and draw all reasonable inferences against the moving party. See 
Matsushita Electrical Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.s. 574, 
586 (1986) (citing U.S. v. Diebold Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655 (1962)).  
 
If the moving party meets its burden, the burden then shifts to the non-
moving party to come forward with "specific facts showing that there is a 
genuine issue for trial." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). The non-moving party must 
"do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the 
material facts." Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586. Only when it is apparent, 
however, that no rational finder of fact "could find in favor of the non-
moving party because the evidence to support its case is so slight" should 
summary judgment be granted. Gallo v. Prudential Residential Services 
Ltd. Partnership, 22 F.3d 1219, 1223 (2d Cir. 1994).  
 
Because of the factual nature of many aspects of a copyright case, a 
district court should be especially wary of granting summary judgment in 
cases alleging copyright infringement. See Hoehling v. Universal City 
Studios Inc., 618 F.2d 972, 977 (2d Cir.) (summary judgment traditionally 
frowned upon in copyright litigation), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 841 (1980). 
In cases involving the fair use doctrine in particular, such as the instant 
case, "[b]ecause the fair use question is so highly dependent on the 
particular facts of each case, courts . . . have usually found it appropriate to 
allow the issue to proceed to trial." Maxtone-Graham v. Burtchaell, 803 
F.2d 1253, 1258 (2d Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1059 (1987).  
 
A number of cases in this circuit have demonstrated, however, that 
summary judgment on the fair use issue is appropriate under some 
circumstances. Several cases, for example, have upheld the granting of 
summary judgment in favor of defendant when there has been a finding 
that no copyrightable material was taken or when a finding of fair use was 
made as a matter of law. See, e.g., Wright v. Warner Books, 953 F.2d 731 
(2d Cir. 1991) (use of copyrighted material not unfair as a matter of law); 
Maxtone-Graham, 803 F.2d 1253 (same); Hoehling, 618 F.2d 972 
(summary judgment appropriate when no copyrighted material taken). 
Alternatively, other cases in this circuit have made it clear that a rejection 
of the fair use defense and a subsequent finding in favor of a copyright 
plaintiff also may be appropriate at the summary judgment stage. In 
Rogers v. Koons, 960 F.2d 301, 307 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 365 
(1992), for example, the Court of Appeals held that summary judgment in 
favor of plaintiff on the fair use issue was proper when the direct evidence 
is undisputed, or when the evidence was such that no reasonable jury 
could differ. See id.; see also United Feature Syndicate, Inc. v. Koons, 817 
F. Supp. 370 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (granting summary judgment in favor of 
plaintiff after rejecting fair use defense).  
 
In the present case, the very comprehensive submissions of the parties 
leave no factual issues concerning which additional, non-cumulative 
evidence is likely to be presented at trial. See Steinberg v. Columbia 
Pictures Industries, Inc., 663 F. Supp. 706, 709 (S.D.N.Y. 1987). Further, 
one critical fact distinguishes this case from most copyright infringement 
actions, in which it is preferable to leave the determination of the issue to a 
jury: each party has contended that its case is complete by moving for 
summary judgment. Id. The parties' statements pursuant to Rule 3(g) make 
it clear that no dispute exists as to any material facts (although the parties 
vigorously dispute the conclusions to be drawn from those facts). In the 
interests of judicial economy, therefore, summary judgment is appropriate.  
 
 
II. Copyright Infringement 
 
To establish a claim for copyright infringement of a protected work, a 
plaintiff must show both ownership of a valid copyright and that defendant 
copied the protected work without authorization. See Computer Assocs. 
Int'l. Inc. v. Altai Inc., 982 F.2d 693, 701 (2d Cir. 1992); Weissmann v. 
Freeman, 868 F.2d 1313, 1320 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 883 
(1989); Hasbro Bradley, Inc. v. Sparkle Toys Inc., 780 F.2d 189, 192 (2d 
Cir. 1985). In the present case, the plaintiff is the undisputed owner of the 
registered copyright in the Moore photograph. As to the second element of 
copyright infringement, "[t]he plaintiff may prove defendant's copying 
either by direct evidence or, as is most often the case, by showing that (1) 
the defendant had access to the plaintiff's copyrighted work and (2) that 
defendant's work is substantially similar to the plaintiff's copyrightable 
material." Computer Assocs. Int'l. Inc., 982 F.2d at 701; see also Walker v. 
Time Life Films, Inc., 784 F.2d 44, 48 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 
1159 (1986). The within case is that rare case where there is direct 
evidence -- in fact, a frank admission by the defendant -- that the allegedly 
infringing work is modelled on the copyrighted work. In the absence of a 
fair use defense, therefore, the defendant would be liable for infringement. 
See Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 114 S. Ct. 1164, 1169 (1994) 
("[Defendant's] song would be an infringement of Acuff-Rose's rights in 
'Oh, Pretty Woman,' under the Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C. Sec. 106 
(1988 ed. and Supp. IV), but for a finding of fair use through parody.")  
 
 
III. The Nielsen Ad Is a Parody and a Fair Use of the Moore Photograph  
 
The purpose of copyright law is set forth in the United States Constitution, 
Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 8: "[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts . 
. . " Lawmakers and judges generally adhered to the view that the optimal 
means to encourage the production of creative works was to secure to their 
creators the exclusive entitlement to resulting financial rewards. 
Nonetheless, the courts recognized that in some instances the monopoly 
conferred by copyright protection could limit, rather than expand, the 
public's access to creative works; copyright would thereby defeat its own 
purposes. To counteract this potential problem, American courts adopted 
the doctrine of "fair use." In Folsom v. Marsh, Justice Story explained that 
the doctrine classified certain uses as non-infringing by "look[ing] to the 
nature and objects of the selections made, the quantity and value of the 
materials used, and the degree in which the use may prejudice the sale, or 
diminish the profits, or supersede the objects, of the original work." 9 
F.Cas. 342, 348 (No. 4,901) (CCD Mass. 1841). This judge-made fair use 
analysis thus balanced the public interest in access to works building on 
the foundation laid by earlier copyrighted works against the protection of 
the author's monetary incentive to create.  
 
The Copyright Act of 1976 clearly derived its codification of a statutory 
fair use defense from Justice Story's formulation. Section 107 provides:  
 
 
Sec. 107. Limitations on exclusive rights: fair use. Notwithstanding the 
provisions of Sec. 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, 
including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any 
other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, 
comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for 
classroom use), scholarship, or research is not an infringement of 
copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in a particular 
case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include:  
 
(a) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a 
commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;  
 
(b) the nature of the copyrighted work; 
 
(c) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the 
copyrighted work as a whole; and  
 
(d) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the 
copyrighted work.  
 
 
17 U.S.C. Sec. 107 (1988 ed. and Supp. IV). Congress intended Sec. 107 
to preserve the existing doctrine, "not to change, narrow, or enlarge it in 
any way." H.R. Rep. No. 94-1476, p. 66 (1976); S.Rep. No. 94-473, p. 62 
(1975), U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 1976, pp. 5659, 5679. The fair 
use analysis "permits [and requires] courts to avoid rigid application of the 
copyright statute when, on occasion, it would stifle the very creativity 
which that law is designed to foster." Stewart v. Abend, 495 U.S. 207, 236 
(1990) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).  
 
The Supreme Court has acknowledged that Sec. 107 calls for a "case-by-
case analysis." Campbell, 114 S.Ct. at 1170. Moreover, within each case, 
courts are not to apply the four-part test as a rigid formula; the factors 
listed are nonexclusive and must be considered as integrated parts of a 
flexible examination. Harper & Row v. The Nation, 471 U.S. 539, 560 
(1985). Ultimately, the fair use defense requires a sensitive balancing of 
inherently antagonistic interests in order to secure public access to the 
greatest number of creative works. The flexibility that must be the 
hallmark of the fair use defense, however, has the unfortunate side effect 
of making the application of the defense to this particular case a complex 
and daunting task.  
 
 
A. The Purpose and Character of the Use 
 
The first of the fair use factors directs my attention to the allegedly 
infringing work and requires an examination of two aspects, the character 
and the purpose, of that work. Prior to 1994, analysis of this element 
focused almost exclusively on the purpose of the use; courts emphasized 
that "every commercial use [was] presumptively. . . unfair." Campbell v. 
Acuff-Rose, 972 F.2d 1429, 1439 (6th Cir. 1992) (citing Sony Corp. of 
America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.s. 417, 451 (1984)), rev'd, 
114 S.Ct. 1164 (1994). This presumption often tipped the scales of the fair 
use inquiry at the expense of the underlying principles of flexibility and 
individualized analysis. Although it has been roundly rejected by the 
Supreme Court, this approach did have one undeniable benefit: it 
substantially simplified the fair use analysis, since a finding of commercial 
purpose rendered the other factors negligible and virtually compelled the 
conclusion that the use was unfair.  
 
The Supreme Court dispelled this inflexibility -- and any accompanying 
simplicity -- in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (1994). In 
Campbell, the Court held that the Sixth Circuit had placed undue weight 
on the commercial nature of the allegedly infringing use in its 
determination that the use was unfair. The Court noted that any hard 
evidentiary presumption would run counter to the long common-law 
tradition of fair use adjudication and would contradict the statute's clear 
indication that a work's commercial nature is only one element of the first 
factor inquiry into its character and purpose.  
 
In Campbell, the Supreme Court faced a commercial parody that was 
asserted to be a fair use; the parallels to the present case are obvious. The 
plaintiff owned the rights to the Roy Orbison song, "Oh, Pretty Woman." 
The defendants Campbell et al., who were better known by their collective 
appellation, 2 Live Crew, had written a rap song of the same title which 
drew heavily on the Orbison song but substituted shocking lyrics for the 
sweet, not to say syrupy, words of the Orbison composition. The 
defendants had applied for permission to use the Orbison song; after being 
refused permission, they nonetheless recorded and released the rap 
version.  
 
Defendants argued that their use was a parody of the "banal" original and a 
fair use; the district court agreed based on its analysis of the four fair use 
factors. The Sixth Circuit reversed on the grounds that the district court 
had "refused to indulge the presumption" that all commercial uses are 
unfair. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed the Court of 
Appeals, holding that no such presumption was warranted.  
 
As to the first fair use factor, the Court held that the critical inquiry 
entailed whether the second work "adds something new, with a further 
purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, 
meaning, or message; it asks, in other words, whether and to what extent 
the new work is 'transformative.'" Campbell, 114 S.Ct. at 1171. The Court 
went on to state, "the more transformative the new work, the less will be 
the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh 
against a finding of fair use." Id.  
 
 
With respect to parody, the Court concluded:  
 
Parody has an obvious claim to transformative value, as Acuff-Rose itself 
does not deny. Like less ostensibly humorous forms of criticism, it can 
provide social benefit, by shedding light on an earlier work and, in the 
process, creating a new one. . . [T]hus, . . . parody, like other comment or 
criticism, may claim fair use under Sec. 107.  
 
 
Id.; see also Fisher v. Dees, 794 F.2d 432 (9th Cir. 1986) (finding a parody 
entitled "When Sonny Sniffs Glue" to be a fair use of the song, "When 
Sunny gets Blue); Elsmere Music, Inc. v. National Broadcasting Co., 482 
F. Supp. 741 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd, 623 F.2d 252 (2d Cir. 1980) (finding "I 
Love Sodom," a Saturday Night Live parody, to be a fair use of "I Love 
New York").  
 
To qualify as a parody under the Court's definition, however, the second 
work must comment upon or criticize the original copyrighted work. The 
Court distinguished parody from satire in this regard: "Parody needs to 
mimic an original to make its point, and so has some claim to use the 
creation of its victim's (or its collective victims') imagination, whereas 
satire can stand on its own two feet and so requires justification for the 
very act of borrowing." Campbell, 114 S.Ct. at 1172. A work that lacks 
this direct reference to the copyrighted work is not a parody, and is likely 
to fail as a fair use:  
 
 
If, on the contrary, the commentary has no critical bearing on the 
substance or style of the original composition, which the alleged infringer 
merely uses to get attention or to avoid the drudgery in working up 
something fresh, the claim to fairness in borrowing from another's work 
diminishes accordingly (if it does not vanish), and other factors, like the 
extent of its commerciality, loom larger.  
 
 
Id.; see also Dr. Seuss Enters., L.P. v. Penguin Books USA, Inc., 924 F. 
Supp. 1559, 1567-68 (S.D. Cal. 1996) (comparing satire and parody and 
indicating that a satirist has less justification for copying an original than a 
parodist). The plaintiff in this case claims that the Nielsen advertisement 
does not constitute a parody of the Moore photograph because it does not 
comment upon or criticize the Moore photograph and that, as a result, the 
first factor weighs against a finding of fair use. Several courts have found 
that a work that is not referential to the copyrighted work does not qualify 
as a parody or a fair use. In Steinberg v. Columbia Pictures Industries, 
Inc., 663 F. Supp. 706 (S.D.N.Y. 1987), for example, the court held that a 
poster advertising the film "Moscow on the Hudson" that copied a famous 
Saul Steinberg representation of the New Yorker's myopic view of the 
world which had appeared on the cover of The New Yorker magazine was 
not a parody. The court relied on the fact that:  
 
 
neither the "Moscow" movie nor the poster was designed to be a parody of 
the Steinberg illustration. The poster merely borrowed numerous elements 
from Steinberg to create an appealing advertisement to promote an 
unrelated commercial product, the movie. No parody of the illustration is 
involved, and defendants are not entitled to the protection of the parody 
branch of the fair use doctrine.  
 
 
Id. at 715. Similarly, in MCA, Inc. v. Wilson, 677 F.2d 180 (2d Cir. 1981), 
the Second Circuit rejected the fair use defense raised by the composers of 
"Cunnilingus Champion of Company C," which infringed the plaintiff's 
copyright in "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy of Company B." In that case, 
defendants conceded that their song satirized the mores of society rather 
than lampooned the well-known Andrews Sisters song. In light of that 
admission, the court concluded:  
 
 
We are not prepared to hold that a commercial composer can plagiarize a 
competitor's copyrighted song, substitute dirty lyrics of his own, perform it 
for commercial gain, and then escape liability by calling the end result a 
parody or satire on the mores of society.  
 
 
Id. at 185; see also United Features Syndicate, Inc. v. Koons, 817 F. Supp. 
370, 384 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (rejecting fair use defense of an artist who 
admitted that his sculpture parodied "the banality of life" rather than the 
characteristics of Odie, the cartoon character it copied); Rogers v. Koons, 
960 F.2d 301, 305, 311 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, U.S. , 113 S. Ct. 365 (1992) 
(upholding summary judgment against the same artist who copied a 
postcard photograph in order to satirize conventionality in general, noting 
that "it is not really the parody flag that appellants are sailing under, but 
rather the flag of piracy"); cf. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. v. American 
Honda Motor Co., 900 F. Supp. 1287, 1300 (1995) (denying a fair use 
defense where defendant argued that its commercial parodied the action 
film genre rather than the specific character, James Bond).  
 
By contrast, courts have repeatedly found works that are adequately 
referential to the copyrighted work to be parodies. In Fisher v. Dees, for 
example, the composers of "When Sunny Gets Blue" argued that although 
the allegedly infringing work, "When Sonny Sniffs Glue," borrowed from 
the original, it was not "directed at" the original and therefore failed to 
qualify as a parody. Fisher, 794 F.2d at 432. The Ninth Circuit disagreed, 
stating that "we reject the notion that the song was used merely as a 
vehicle to achieve a comedic objective unrelated to the song, its place and 
time." Id. at 436. The court found that the defendant's version was 
intended to "poke fun at the composers' song, and at Mr. Mathis's rather 
singular vocal range." Id. The court went on to analyze the alleged 
infringement under the statutory factors and held it to be a fair use. Id. at 
440.  
 
Similarly, in Elsmere Music, Inc. v. National Broadcasting Company, the 
court examined a Saturday Night Live sketch in which the cast of SNL, in 
the characters of the mayor and members of the Chamber of Commerce of 
the biblical city of Sodom, are discussing their city's poor image among 
potential tourists. Elsmere, 482 F. Supp. at 743. Rather than addressing the 
underlying social ills, Sodom's leaders decide instead to unveil a glitzy ad 
campaign that recasts the city's image in a more positive light. The 
highlight of the campaign involves a cheery, a capella rendition of a 
catchy jingle, "I-I-I-I Love Sodo-o-o-m." Id. The creators of the New York 
city advertising campaign, which also relied on a catchy "I Love New 
York" jingle were, in the words of Queen Victoria, not amused. They sued 
for copyright infringement. Id. at 744. The plaintiffs argued, among other 
things, that the SNL segment parodied New York City and the problems it 
was having, rather than the advertising campaign or the song "I Love New 
York" itself, and that therefore the defendant's copying was unjustified. Id. 
The court rejected this argument, holding that the song "I Love Sodom" 
and the sketch of which it was a part, were "clearly an attempt by the 
writers and cast of SNL to satirize the way in which New York City had 
attempted to improve its somewhat tarnished image through the use of a 
slick advertising campaign . . . [t]he song was as much a parody of the 
song, "I Love New York," a catchy, upbeat tune intended to alter a 
potential tourist's perceptions of New York, as it was of the overall "I 
Love New York" advertising campaign." Id. at 744, 746. The court went 
on to hold that SNL's use of the "heart" of the "I Love New York" jingle 
was a fair one. The Court of Appeals upheld this conclusion, stating 
succinctly, "Believing that, in today's world of often unrelieved solemnity, 
copyright law should be hospitable to the humor of parody, and that the 
District Court correctly applied the doctrine of fair use, we affirm on 
Judge Goettel's thorough opinion." Elsmere Music, Inc. v. National 
Broadcasting Co., 623 F.3d 252, 253 (2d Cir. 1980) (per curiam).  
 
In the case at bar, the Nielsen ad clearly takes satiric aim directly at the 
Moore photograph. From the outset, it was intended to make a mockery of 
an image that had become a "cultural icon." (Ludovico Decl., Para. 7, 
Grant Decl., Para. 6). In fact, without reference to the Moore photograph, 
the Nielsen ad simply is not very funny. Like all parodies, it relies for its 
comic effect on the contrast between the original -- a serious portrayal of a 
beautiful woman taking great pride in the majesty of her pregnant body -- 
and the new work -- a ridiculous image of a smirking, foolish-looking 
pregnant man. It thus fits squarely within the definition of parody as a 
"literary or artistic work that imitates the characteristic style of an author 
or a work for comic effect or ridicule," The American Heritage Dictionary 
1317 (3d ed. 1992), or a "composition . . . in which the characteristic turns 
of thought and phrase in an author or class of authors are imitated in such 
a way as to make them appear ridiculous," The Oxford English Dictionary 
247 (2d ed. 1989). Because the humorous nature of the Nielsen ad 
depended on the unique qualities of the Moore photograph and its instant 
recognizability, it demonstrates the necessary "joinder of reference and 
ridicule" to qualify as a parody. See Campbell, 114 S. Ct. at 1173.  
 
Moreover, the advertisement's use of the Moore photograph was 
intentionally linked to issues of childbearing and pregnancy that are 
central to the plot of Naked Gun 33 1-3. In her deposition, Annie 
Leibovitz discussed her view that the Vanity Fair cover was an "important 
image for women who are made to feel that when they are pregnant they 
are supposed to hide and go off in a corner . . . ." (Deposition of Annie 
Leibovitz, p. 25). The Moore photograph thus came to represent a 
particular view of pregnancy as a source of pride and a particular form of 
beauty. By contrast, Leslie Nielsen's character in the film is subject to 
pressure from his wife to start a family and views pregnancy and 
fatherhood with at best ambivalence, at worst stereotypical dread. 
(Ludovico Decl., Para. 4). The contradiction between these views is 
captured in the Nielsen ad by the contrast between Leslie Nielsen's guilty 
smirk and the copying of Demi Moore's forthright pose. This contradiction 
is part of what makes the Nielsen ad a parody.  
 
While under the particular circumstances of this case it is appropriate for 
the judge to make the determination as to "whether a parodic character 
may reasonably be perceived," Campbell, 114 S. Ct. at 1172, I take 
comfort from the fact that no one connected with this complex case has 
expressed a contrary opinion (other than the plaintiff's attorneys in their 
role as advocates). The unchallenged testimony from defendant and its 
advertisement agency is that from its inception, they intended the 
advertisement to be a parody of the Moore photograph and geared their 
copying to that objective. (See Ludovico Decl., Para. 6; Grant Decl., Para. 
6, 9). Further, the plaintiff herself identified the Nielsen ad as a "parody" 
of the Moore photograph. (Deposition of Annie Leibovitz, p. 38 ("[I]t was 
obviously, you know, it was a parody of the picture.")). The opinions of 
these parties, who combine intimate familiarity with the images at issue 
with a degree of aesthetic expertise that I cannot claim to possess, while 
not dispositive, offer further support for the conclusion that the Nielsen ad 
is a parody of the Moore photograph.  
 
Unfortunately, the finding that the Nielsen ad parodies the Moore 
photograph does not, standing alone, mean that the first factor of the fair 
use analysis weighs in favor of defendant. The first factor requires me to 
look at two issues, the character and purpose of the otherwise infringing 
use. In the present case, these two "ingredients" of the first element 
militate in favor of opposing conclusions. The Nielsen ad is, like all 
legitimate parodies, "transformative" in character. It is also, however, 
undoubtedly commercial in purpose: it was intended to pique public 
interest in Naked Gun 33-1/3. In the wake of Campbell, this factor is not 
dispositive but it remains relevant and weighs against a finding of fair use.  
 
The Supreme Court has not given the district courts much guidance in 
resolving a case like this one. On one hand, the Court has indicated, "the 
more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of 
other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair 
use." Campbell, 114 S. Ct. at 1171. On the other hand, while clearly 
holding that the commercial purpose of an otherwise infringing work does 
not automatically bar a finding of fair use, the Court also stated that "[t]he 
use. . . of a copyrighted work to advertise a product, even in a parody, will 
be entitled to less indulgence under the first factor of the fair use enquiry, 
than the sale of a parody for its own sake. . . . " Id. at 1174. Further 
complicating matters, the Court does not even begin to address the wheels 
within wheels presented by a case like this one, where a parodic, otherwise 
infringing ad is used to market another creative work that is itself a satire.  
 
I can only reconcile these disparate elements by returning to the core 
purpose of copyright: to foster the creation and dissemination of the 
greatest number of creative works. The end result of the Nielsen ad 
parodying the Moore photograph is that the public now has before it two 
works, vastly different in appeal and nature, where before there was only 
one. Of course, in all cases the existence of the infringing work in some 
sense doubles the public access to creative works. Where the second work 
is not highly transformative, however, the second work may not add much 
to the public catalogue. And, of course, where the presence of the second 
work disrupts the incentive of authors to create works that will be subject 
to piracy by infringers, the public loses access to those works that 
discouraged authors determine not to create. Here, however, I find that the 
second work is very different from the first; whether photographers like 
Annie Leibovitz would be discouraged from creating works like the 
Vanity Fair cover is dealt with under the fourth fair use factor. See 
Campbell, 114 S.Ct. at 1170-71 ("Nor may the four statutory factors be 
treated in isolation, one from another. All are to be explored, and the 
results weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright.") Under the 
particular circumstances of this case, I find that the purposes of copyright 
are best served by a finding that the highly transformative character of the 
Nielsen ad trumps its admittedly commercial purpose and that the first fair 
use factor therefore weighs in favor of the defendant, albeit perhaps by 
only a slight margin.  
 
 
B. The Nature of the Copyrighted Work 
 
The second statutory factor represents an acknowledgement that certain 
works are closer to the heart of copyright than others; fair use is therefore 
more difficult to establish when a core work is copied than when an 
infringer takes material that falls only marginally within copyright 
protection. See e.g., Stewart v. Abend, 495 U.S. 207, 237-38 (1990) 
(contrasting a fictional short story with factual works); Harper & Row v. 
The Nation, 471 U.S. at 563-64 (contrasting forthcoming memoir with 
published speech); Feist Publics. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 
340, 348-51 (1991) (contrasting creative works with bare factual 
compilations).  
 
In the present case, there can be no doubt that the photograph created by 
Ms. Leibovitz is a highly creative work by an accomplished artist that falls 
well within the heartland of copyright protection. To quote the Supreme 
Court, "[t]his fact, however, is not much help in this case, or ever likely to 
help much in separating the fair use sheep from the infringing goats in a 
parody case, since parodies almost invariably copy publicly known, 
expressive works." Campbell, 114 S. Ct. at 1175. I conclude, therefore, 
that this factor weighs in favor of the plaintiff, but assumes less 
importance in the fair use analysis with respect to a parody like the one at 
issue, relative to the other three factors.  
 
 
C. The Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used in Relation to the 
Copyrighted Work as a Whole  
 
This element of the fair use analysis examines the extent of the parodist's 
copying in light of its purposes to determine whether it is qualitatively and 
quantitatively excessive. Id. The Supreme Court has recognized that the 
extent of permissible copying varies with the purpose and character of the 
use. See id.; Sony, 464 U.S. at 449-50 (holding that reproduction of entire 
work "does not have its ordinary effect of militating against a finding of 
fair use" as to home videotaping of television programs); Harper & Row, 
471 U.S. at 564 ("[E]ven substantial quotations might qualify as a fair use 
in a review of a published work or a news account of a speech" but not in a 
scoop of an as yet unpublished memoir). This factor therefore intersects 
both with the first factor and with the fourth fair use factor, which 
examines the degree to which the second work usurps the market for the 
copyrighted work.  
 
The Supreme Court has stated the general rule as follows: "a work 
composed primarily of an original, particularly its heart, with little added 
or changed, is more likely to be a merely superseding use, fulfilling 
demand for the original." Campbell, 114 S.Ct 1176. The application of this 
guideline to parody, however, is particularly difficult. As discussed above, 
parody depends on imitation of a recognizable original to achieve its 
humorous commentary. In recognition of the peculiar needs of the 
parodist, the Campbell Court joined a line of previous decisions holding 
that a parodist is justified in taking more of the original copyrighted work 
than would otherwise be permissible, even for another fair user. See. e.g., 
Rogers v. Koons, 960 F.2d at 310 ("We have consistently held that a 
parody entitles its creator under the fair use doctrine to more extensive use 
of the copied work than is ordinarily allowed . . . ."); Elsmere Music, 482 
F. Supp. at 744 ("[A]n author is entitled to more extensive use of another's 
copyrighted work in creating a parody than in creating other fictional or 
dramatic works."); Berlin v. E.C. Publics., Inc., 329 F.2d 541, 545 (2d cir. 
1964) (holding that because defendants had taken no more of the original 
songs than was necessary to "recall or 'conjure up' the object of his satire" 
and because the parody had "neither the intent nor the effect of fulfilling 
the demand for the original," no infringement had taken place). Campbell 
adopted this reasoning and held that "the parody must be able to "conjure 
up" at least enough of that original to make the object of its critical wit 
recognizable." Campbell, 114 S.Ct. at 1164. The question, then, is whether 
the defendant in this case took more than was reasonably required to 
"conjure up" the Moore photograph in creating the Nielsen ad.  
 
The plaintiff, of course, rigorously argues that the defendant took the heart 
of her work without any justification and offers as an alternative that "Mr. 
Nielsen could have, sans attire, struck a Moore-like pose with pillows 
strapped round his waist to simulate pregnancy." (Memorandum in 
Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, p. 23). Defendant 
responds that the heart of the Moore photograph was its portrayal of Demi 
Moore's face and expression, rather than the appearance of her pregnant 
body. I view the Moore photograph as an integrated whole: Ms. Moore's 
face and body, taken together, convey a unique image of a woman who 
radiates unashamed sensuality and pride in her pregnancy. While I agree 
that defendant copied many of the most distinctive features of the Moore 
photograph, this determination is not dispositive in light of the Supreme 
Court's recognition that even a taking of the "heart" of the original does 
not necessarily bar a finding of fair use because "the heart is also what 
most readily conjures up [the work] for parody, and it is the heart at which 
parody takes aim." Campbell, 114 S.Ct. at 1176. The inquiry instead is 
whether the defendant took more than was reasonably required to conjure 
up the original and bring home the point of its parody. See Fisher, 794 
F.2d at 438 ("[T]he concept of 'conjuring up' an original came into the 
copyright law not as a limitation on how much of an original may be used, 
but as a recognition that a parody frequently needs to be more than a 
fleeting evocation of an original in order to make its humorous point. A 
parody is entitled to at least 'conjure up' the original.") (citing Elsmere v. 
National Broadcasting Co., 623 F.2d 252, 253 n.1 (2d Cir. 1980) (per 
curiam)); see also Tin Pan Apple, 737 F. Supp. at 830 ("A parody is 
entitled to at least 'conjure up' the original. Even more extensive use would 
still be fair use, provided that parody builds upon the original, using the 
original as a known element of modern culture and contributing something 
new for humorous effect or commentary.") As the Supreme Court has 
admonished, however, not everyone "who calls himself a parodist can 
skim the cream and get away scot free . . . the question of fairness asks 
what else the parodist did besides go to the heart of the original." 
Campbell, 114 S. Ct. at 1176.  
 
In the present case, the Nielsen ad drew heavily on the original; it closely 
mimicked the pose, lighting, backdrop, body configuration, and skin tone 
that appeared in the original. on the other hand, the Nielsen ad is in fact a 
photograph of a different pregnant woman, and of course neither Ms. 
Leibovitz nor anyone else holds a monopoly over the idea of a nude, 
pregnant woman. See Branch v. Ogilvy & Mather, Inc., No. 89 Civ. 2440 
(LLS), 1990 WL 74540, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. May 30, 1990) ("It is an axiom of 
copyright law that the protection granted to a copyrightable work extends 
only to the particular expression of an idea and never to the idea itself.") 
(internal quotation marks omitted). The addition of Leslie Nielsen's head, 
with its markedly different facial expression, was a significant 
transformative element. Moreover, I do not agree that a photo of Leslie 
Nielsen with a pillow strapped to his middle would be sufficiently 
evocative of the Moore photograph to serve defendant's parodic purpose. 
Perhaps the defendant could have used the pose and backdrop, but not the 
lighting of the original, or the pose and lighting, but not the backdrop and 
still achieved its purposes. I view any additional copying as slight, 
however, when compared with the copying that was absolutely necessary 
to defendant's aim: the reproduction of Ms. Moore's pose, her state of 
pregnancy, and her nudity. Further, I note that the unchallenged testimony 
of Nathan Grant supports a conclusion that the defendant calibrated the 
extent of its copying against its estimation of what was necessary to evoke 
the Moore photograph in the public mind. In his Declaration, Mr. Grant 
stated, "We also wanted to ensure that the audience would be certain to 
identify the work we were parodying." (Grant Decl., Para. 9). Mr. Grant's 
deposition testimony was consistent on this point:  
 
 
Q. You told Mr. Schad that the intent of making the photograph of the 
model was to come as close to the Demi Moore photo as possible: is that 
correct?  
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Why were you trying to come as close as possible?  
 
A. Because we were trying to have the viewer make no mistake that that's 
who we were making a parody of. This is a parody of that shot.  
 
 
(Deposition of Nathan Grant, pp. 23-24). In light of the ad's "parodic 
purpose and character, its transformative elements, and considerations of 
the potential for market substitution sketched more fully below," 
Campbell, 114 S.Ct. at 1177, I find that defendant's calibration succeeded; 
defendant took no more of the Moore photograph than was necessary to 
conjure it up in the eyes of a viewer of the Nielsen ad. Because the ad took 
an image that had become widely known and added something distinctly 
new for humorous commentary, this element weighs in favor of a finding 
of fair use.  
 
 
D. The Effect on the Potential Market for or Value of the Copyrighted 
Work  
 
The final element of the fair use analysis examines the market harm 
caused by the alleged infringement, taking account "not only of harm to 
the original but also of harm to the market for derivative works." Harper & 
Row, 471 U.S. at 568. Although no single element of the fair use test is 
dispositive, in light of the underlying purposes of copyright, the Supreme 
Court has recognized that this is "undoubtedly the single most important 
element of fair use." Id. at 566. The centrality of this factor results not 
from courts according disproportionate weight to it, but from its close link 
to the other fair use factors, including the purpose and character of the use 
(see III.A, supra) and the extent of the portion taken (see III.B, supra).  
 
Once again, parody as a genre occupies a different position than other 
assertedly fair uses, because a parodist is entitled to damage the market for 
an original -- but only in certain ways. As the Supreme Court stated:  
 
 
We do not, of course, suggest that a parody may not harm the market at 
all, but when a lethal parody, like a scathing theater review, kills demand 
for the original, it does not produce a harm cognizable under the Copyright 
Act. Because "parody may quite legitimately aim at garroting the original, 
destroying it commercially as well as artistically," B. Kaplan, An 
Unhurried View of Copyright 69 (1967), the role of the courts is to 
distinguish between "[b]iting criticism [that merely] suppresses demand 
[and] copyright infringement, [which] usurps it." Fisher v. Dees, 794 F.2d 
at 438.  
 
 
Campbell, 114 S.Ct. at 1178. This principle recognizes that although 
derivative markets are an appropriate consideration in a fair use analysis, 
there is no protectable derivative market for criticism. Id. Courts have 
been realistic in acknowledging the "unlikelihood that the creators of 
imaginative works will license critical reviews or lampoons of their own 
productions." Id.  
 
Because parody must be a transformative use, a parody is unlikely to serve 
as a market substitute for the original. See id. at 1177 ("[I]t is more likely 
that the new work will not affect the market for the original in any way 
cognizable under this factor, that is, by acting as a substitute for it 
(superseding its objects). This is so because the parody and the original 
usually serve different market functions.") (internal quotation marks and 
citations omitted).  
 
Numerous courts have relied on this recognition that separate markets 
exist in concluding that a parody inflicted no harm on the market for a 
particular original. For example, in Fisher v. Dees, 794 F.2d at 438, the 
Ninth Circuit held that demand for the song, "When Sunny Gets Blue," a 
nostalgic reminiscence about lost love, was not supplanted by the parody 
"When Sonny Sniffs Glue," a song describing the physical aftermath of 
glue-sniffing. Similarly, in Eveready Battery Co. v. Adolph Coors Co., 
765 F. Supp. 440, 448 (N.D. Ill. 1991), the court held that a beer 
commercial that parodied a battery commercial did not usurp the market 
for the first commercial. See also Elsmere Music, Inc. v. National 
Broadcasting Co., 482 F. Supp. 741, 747 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd, 623 F.2d 252 
(2d Cir. 1980) (finding that the song, "I Love Sodom," did not have an 
impermissible market effect on the demand for the song, "I Love New 
York.").  
 
In the present case, plaintiff admits that she has noticed no adverse effect 
on the sale or licensing of the Moore photograph after publication of the 
Nielsen ad. (Deposition of Annie Leibovitz, p. 57; Deposition of Jeffrey 
D. Smith, pp. 65-66; Deposition of James M. Moffat, pp. 53-54). This is 
not surprising in light of the unlikelihood that a consumer who was in the 
market for an image such as the Moore photograph -- a serious comment 
on a woman's fulfillment in her pregnancy -- would have his or her 
demand satisfied by a slapstick parody such as the Nielsen advertisement. 
Because market substitution is the only cognizable harm under the 
Copyright Act and there is no derivative market for critical works, this 
final element also weighs in favor of a finding of fair use.  
 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The fair use doctrine has been described as a "guarantee of breathing space 
at the heart of copyright." Campbell, 114 S. Ct. at 1171. This breathing 
space ensures that copyright will not stifle the very proliferation of 
creative works that it was designed to foster. Three of the four fair use 
factors in the present case militate in favor of a finding of fair use, largely 
because the defendant's transformation of the plaintiff's photograph has 
resulted in public access to two distinct works, serving distinct markets, 
with little risk that the creator of the first work will be disinclined to create 
further works that may be open to parody. Because I agree with the 
Second Circuit that in this case "[a]ccording [the] proprietor [of the 
copyrighted work] further protection against parody does little to promote 
creativity, but it places a substantial inhibition upon the creativity of 
authors adept at using parody, . . ." I hold that the fundamental purposes of 
copyright are best served by a finding that defendant's use of the Moore 
photograph is a fair one. Warner Bros., Inc. v. American Broadcasting 
Companies, Inc., 720 F.2d 231, 242 (2d Cir. 1983). Accordingly, 
defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted and plaintiff's motion 
for summary judgment is denied.

<P>California voters passed the anti-affirmative action initiative, 
Proposition 209, in November 1996. U.S. District Judge Thelton 
Henderson issued a preliminary injunction December 23, 1996 blocking the implementation and enforcement of Proposition 209, citing the law would violate equal protection guarantees for California's women and minorities. The judge 
also concluded that the law discriminates by banning  "constitutionally

No. C 96-4024 TEH


In The United States district court for the northern district of California 


FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND ORDER RE 
PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION  


THELTON HENDERSON, CHIEF JUDGE UNITED STATES 
DISTRICT COURT: 


I.INTRODUCTION


This action presents a challenge to the constitutionality of newly-enacted 
Article 1, section 31 of the California Constitution. This measure, which 
appeared on the ballot as Proposition 209, was passed by the California 
electorate on November 5, 1996. It provides in relevant part as follows: 


The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, 
any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or 
national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or 
public contracting. 


Cal. Const. art. 1, section 31(a).[FOOTNOTE 1]


It is important to note at the outset that much of this language simply 
reaffirms existing anti-discrimination protections already provided by the 
United States and California Constitutions, and by the 1964 Civil Rights 
Act. These laws have long-guaranteed all persons "equal protection of the 
law," and prohibited discrimination in employment and in any program or 
activity receiving federal assistance.[FOOTNOTE 2] This aspect of 
Proposition 209-which creates no change in existing law-is not at issue in 
this case. Indeed, it could hardly be more clear that a law that merely 
affirms the non-discrimination principles in our Constitution is, itself, 
constitutional. 


It is also undisputed that the Constitution precludes voluntary, 
government-sponsored race and gender "preferences" except in the most 
limited circumstances. Thus, government entities were already barred, 
prior to Proposition 209, from using race-conscious "preferences," e.g. 
race-conscious affirmative action programs, unless they could pass the 
most exacting "strict scrutiny" required by the Fourteenth Amendment. 
Under this test, only those programs that are "narrowly tailored" and 
"necessary to break down patterns of deliberate exclusion" perpetuated by 
the enacting agency are permitted. City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 
488 U.S. 469, 509 (1989)(emphasis added).[FOOTNOTE 3] Quotas are 
not permitted. See, e.g., Regents of the Univ. of Calif. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 
265 (1978). Gender-based programs, under existing law, are also subject 
to a heightened level of scrutiny. U.S. v. Virginia, 116 S.Ct. 2264, 2275 
(1996). 


In short, Congress and the courts had already prohibited discrimination, 
and sharply constrained government use of race and gender preferences, 
long before Proposition 209 was enacted on November 5, 1996. The 
parties do not dispute, however, that the people of California meant to do 
something more than simply restate existing law when they adopted 
Proposition 209. It is this "something more" that is the focus of this action. 


To be sure, the outer boundaries of this "something more" have yet to be 
determined. It is clear, however, that the primary change Proposition 209 
makes to existing law is to close that narrow but significant window that 
permits the governmental race- and gender-conscious affirmative action 
programs described above that are still permissible under the United States 
Constitution. Notably, defendants agreed at oral argument that Proposition 
209 prohibits at least some of these constitutionally permissible programs. 
They also failed to identify any other programs that would be affected by 
Proposition 209. 


It is thus essential to keep in mind that plaintiffs' constitutional challenge 
to Proposition 209 is not, in fact, a facial challenge to the entire initiative. 
Rather, it is much narrower in scope: it is a challenge only to that slice of 
the initiative that now prohibits governmental entities at every level from 
taking voluntary action to remediate past and present discrimination 
through the use of constitutionally permissible race- and gender-conscious 
affirmative action programs.[FOOTNOTE 4] 


Plaintiffs assert that this specific aspect of Proposition 209 violates the 
United States Constitution on two separate grounds. First, they allege that 
Proposition 209, although couched in neutral terms, violates the 
Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection guarantee of "the right to full 
participation in the political life of the community." Washington v. Seattle 
School Dist. No. 1, 458 U.S. 457, 467 (1982); see also Romer v. Evans, 
116 S. Ct. 1620, 1628 (1996) ("Central to our own Constitution's 
guarantee of equal protection is the principle that government in each of its 
parts remain open on impartial terms to all who seek its assistance."). 
Proposition 209 violates this guarantee, they argue, because it restructures 
the political process in a nonneutral manner. Specifically, it erects unique 
political hurdles only for those seeking legislation intended to benefit 
women and minorities-who must now obtain a constitutional amendment-
while allowing those seeking preferential legislation on any other ground 
unimpeded access to the political process at all levels. 


Second, plaintiffs allege that Proposition 209 violates the Supremacy 
Clause of the United States Constitution because it interferes with 
Congress' intent that employers be afforded the option of utilizing 
constitutionally permissible race- and gender-conscious affirmative action 
to comply with their obligations under Titles VI and VII of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. 


The immediate issue before the Court is whether plaintiffs[FOOTNOTE 5] 
have satisfied their burden of demonstrating that defendants[FOOTNOTE 
6] should be preliminarily enjoined from enforcing or implementing 
Proposition 209 pending a final determination of the merits of this action. 
In weighing this matter, the Court is mindful that any challenge to a duly-
enacted law should be met with caution and restraint. It is not for this or 
any other court to lightly upset the expectations of the voters. At the same 
time, our system of democracy teaches that the will of the people, 
important as it is, does not reign absolute but must be kept in harmony 
with our Constitution. 


Thus, the issue is not whether one judge can thwart the will of the people; 
rather, the issue is whether the challenged enactment complies with our 
Constitution and Bill of Rights. Without a doubt, federal courts have no 
duty more important than to protect the rights and liberties of all 
Americans by considering and ruling on such issues, no matter how 
contentious or controversial they may be. This duty is certainly 
undiminished where the law under consideration comes directly from the 
ballot box and without the benefit of the legislative process. As the 
Supreme Court aptly noted in another socially-charged case: 


Nor does the implementation of change through popular referendum 
immunize it [from constitutional scrutiny]. The sovereignty of the people 
is itself subject to those constitutional limitations which have been duly 
adopted and remain unrepealed. 


Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385, 393 (1969). 


It also cannot be overemphasized that this case does not call upon this 
Court to adjudicate whether affirmative action is right or wrong, or 
whether it is no longer an appropriate policy for addressing the continuing 
effects of past and present discrimination against racial minorities and 
women. Such questions, while they are most certainly of vital public 
policy interest, lie beyond the purview of this Court. Nor does this case 
implicate the ability of governmental entities to voluntarily repeal 
affirmative action policies, as the Regents of the University of California 
did earlier this year. 


Rather, the substantive issues raised by this action are considerably more 
narrow, albeit no less important: whether the particular method chosen by 
Proposition 209 to curtail affirmative action is unlawful because it either 
(1) violates the rights of women and minorities to fully participate in our 
political system or (2) interferes with Congressional goals embodied in 
Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the 
Education Amendments of 1972. 


In the discussion that follows, this Court first addresses the question of 
whether plaintiffs have standing to bring this action. The Court then turns 
to the appropriate standard governing plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary 
injunction, which is followed by this Court's Findings of Fact and 
Conclusions of Law, with respect to that motion, as required by Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 65. 


Based on these Findings and Conclusions, this Court rules that: 


(1) Plaintiffs have standing to bring this action. 


(2) Plaintiffs have demonstrated a probability of success on their claim 
that Proposition 209 violates the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection 
guarantee to full participation in the political life of the community. 


(3) Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on their 
claim that Proposition 209 violates the Supremacy Clause because it 
conflicts with, and is thus preempted by, Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights 
Act and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. 


(4) Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on their claim that 
Proposition 209 violates the Supremacy Clause because it conflicts with, 
and is thus preempted by, Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. 


(5) Plaintiffs have demonstrated that a preliminary injunction is necessary 
to protect the plaintiff class from the possibility of irreparable injury. 


Accordingly, the Court grants plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary 
Injunction, and enjoins defendants, pursuant to the injunction following 
these Findings and Conclusions, from enforcing and implementing 
Proposition 209 pending trial or final judgment in this action. 


II. STANDING


A "threshold question in every federal case [is] whether the plaintiff has 
stated a 'case or controversy' between himself and the defendant within the 
meaning of Article III." Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975). The 
core component of whether a case or controversy under Article III exists is 
the doctrine of standing. Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984). The 
Supreme Court has established three elements necessary to meet the 
Article III standing requirement. First, the plaintiff must have suffered an 
"injury in fact"-"[t]he plaintiff must show that he 'has sustained or is 
immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury' and the injury or 
threat of injury must be both 'real and immediate,' not 'conjectural' or 
'hypothetical.'" City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101-102 
(1983). Second, the injury must be a result of the challenged conduct. See, 
e.g. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992) ("The injury 
has to be 'fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and not 
the result of the independent action of some third party not before the 
court."). Finally, a plaintiff must show a likelihood that a favorable 
decision will redress the injury. Id. 


Here, defendants assert that none of the plaintiffs shows an imminent 
threatened injury. Notwithstanding the limitations imposed by article 3, 
section 3.5 of the California Constitution,[FOOTNOTE 7] however, 
Proposition 209 is a self-executing amendment to the California 
Constitution that imposes an affirmative duty to comply. "In this 
circumstance compliance is coerced by the threat of enforcement, and the 
controversy is both immediate and real." Lake Carriers' Association v. 
MacMullan, 406 U.S. 498, 508 (1972). 


Plaintiffs have shown a real and immediate threat of injury. Proposition 
209 is clearly applicable to statutes and programs that are currently 
benefitting the named plaintiffs and it is virtually certain to be enforced. 
The amendment was recently enacted and is not a statute that has lain 
dormant for years and likely to remain moribund. See Poe v. Ullman, 367 
U.S. 497, 501 (1961). Further, the Governor has already made moves to 
employ article 1, section 31, to invalidate certain state statues in a pending 
civil action. Wilson v. State Personnel Board, 96-CS01082 (App. to File 
Mot. to Amend, Nov., 6 1996). Moreover, a conflict between the plaintiffs' 
interests and the challenged amendment is inevitable. Babbitt v. United 
Farm Workers Nat'l Union, 442 U.S. 289, 297-305 (1979) ("One does not 
have to await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive 
relief. If the injury is certainly impending, that is enough."); cf. Steffel v. 
Thompson, 425 U.S. 452, 459 (1974) (a plaintiff need not first expose 
himself to actual arrest or prosection before challenging the 
constitutionality of a criminal statute). 


The constitutional injury asserted by the plaintiffs is directly connected to 
the actions of the defendants. See S. v. D., 410 U.S. 616, 618 (1973) 
(quoting Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 488 (1923)) ("The party 
who invokes judicial power must be able to show that he has sustained or 
is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as a result of a 
statute's enforcement."). Two of the defendants, and now class 
representatives, the California Governor and Attorney General, are 
explicitly charged with the task of enforcing the laws of the state. The 
other defendants are governmental entities that are under a duty to apply 
the amendment to existing statutes, ordinances, and regulations. Plaintiffs 
have shown that they will suffer the alleged constitutional injury when any 
one of the defendants enforces the constitutional amendment. 


Finally, since the constitutional injury to the plaintiffs is allegedly caused 
by the enforcement of Proposition 209, plaintiffs' requested remedy, a 
declaration that the Proposition is unconstitutional and unenforceable, 
would unquestionably address the plaintiffs' alleged injuries. See Allen v. 
Regan, 468 U.S. 737, 753, n.19 (1984) (the redressability requirement 
"examines the causal connection between the alleged injury and the 
judicial relief requested"). 


By demonstrating imminent injury attributable to the actions of the 
defendants that will be redressed by a favorable decision by this Court, 
plaintiffs have met the requirements for standing under the Article III 
"case or controversy" clause.[FOOTNOTE 8] 


III. PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION STANDARD


According to Ninth Circuit precedent, in order to obtain a preliminary 
injunction, the moving party must demonstrate either (1) a combination of 
probable success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury, or 
(2) that serious questions are raised and the balance of hardships tips 
sharply in favor of the movant. Associated General Contractors, 950 F.2d 
at 1410. These formulations are not different tests but rather two points on 
a sliding scale in which the degree of irreparable harm increases as the 
probability of success on the merits decreases. Id. In considering a request 
for a preliminary injunction, a court must remain mindful that such relief 
is aimed primarily at preserving the status quo pending trial. See Los 
Angeles Mem. Coliseum Comm'n v. National Football League, 634 F.2d 
1197, 1200 (9th Cir. 1980) ("fundamental principle" governing 
preliminary injunctive relief is the need to maintain the status quo prior to 
determination on the merits). Under either formulation of the test, a court, 
in balancing the harms, must also take into account any public interests 
implicated by the injunctive relief sought. Caribbean Marine Services Co. 
v. Baldrige, 844 F.2d 668, 674 (9th Cir. 1988). 


Because the plaintiffs here allege that they suffer constitutional injury at 
the hands of Proposition 209, the Court must evaluate the merits of their 
constitutional claims before it can meaningfully address the irreparability 
and imminence of any harm. See Bery v. City of New York, 906 F. Supp. 
163, 166 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (where constitutional injury is alleged, "the two 
prongs of the threshold showing required for injunctive relief merge into 
one"), rev'd on other grounds, 97 F.3d 689 (2d Cir. 1996). 


IV.FINDINGS OF FACT


The following Findings of Fact are based on the preliminary record 
presently before the Court. 


A. Characterization of Proposition 209


After qualifying as an initiative constitutional amendment, Proposition 
209 was placed on the California general election ballot for November 5, 
1996. 


Prior to the election, each registered voter received an official California 
Ballot Pamphlet prepared by the non-partisan California Legislative 
Analyst's Office ("LAO").[FOOTNOTE 9] This Pamphlet, which provided 
an official description and analysis of each statewide initiative, portrayed 
Proposition 209 as a measure that would eliminate race- and gender-
conscious affirmative action programs in the public sector.[FOOTNOTE 
10] Accordingly, the California Ballot Pamphlet explained to voters that: 


A YES vote on [Proposition 209] means: The elimination of those 
affirmative action programs for women and minorities run by the state or 
local governments in the areas of public employment, contracting, and 
education that give "preferential treatment" on the basis of sex, race, color, 
ethnicity, or national origin. 


A NO vote on this measure means State and local government affirmative 
action programs would remain in effect to the extent they are permitted 
under the United States Constitution. 


Pls. Exh. 2 (emphasis in original).


In addition to this brief summary, the Ballot Pamphlet also provided voters 
with a more extensive analysis of Proposition 209, which underscored that 
the initiative would effectively eliminate race- and gender-conscious 
affirmative action programs. Specifically, the LAO explained Proposition 
209 and its effects as follows: 


[F]ederal, state, and local governments run many programs intended to 
increase opportunities for various groups-including women and racial and 
ethnic minority groups. These programs are commonly called "affirmative 
action" programs . 


If [Proposition 209] is approved by the voters, it could affect [the 
following programs] . 


Public Employment and Contracting


The measure would eliminate affirmative action programs used to increase 
hiring and promotion opportunities for state or local government jobs, 
where sex, race, or ethnicity are preferential factors in hiring, promotions, 
training or recruitment decisions. In addition, the measure would eliminate 
programs that give preference to women-owned or minority-owned 
companies on public contracts . 


Public Schools and Community Colleges


[T]he measure could eliminate, or cause fundamental changes to, 
voluntary desegregation programs run by school districts . Examples of 
desegregation spending that could be affected by the measure include the 
special funding given to (1) "magnet" schools (in those cases where race 
or ethnicity are preferential factors in the admission of students to the 
schools), and (2) designated "racially isolated minority schools" that are 
located in areas with high proportions of racial or ethnic minorities . 


In addition, the measure would affect a variety of public school and 
community college programs such as counseling, tutoring, outreach, 
student financial aid, and financial aid to selected school districts in those 
cases where the programs provide preferences to individuals or schools 
based on race, sex, ethnicity, or national origin . 


University of California and California State University 


The measure would affect admissions and other programs at the state's 
public universities. For example, the California State University ("CSU") 
uses race and ethnicity as factors in some of its admissions decisions. If 
this initiative is passed by the voters, it could no longer do so . 


Id. (emphasis in original). As the above reflects, the only programs 
identified by the LAO as potentially affected by Proposition 209 are race- 
and gender-conscious affirmative action programs. 


The California Ballot Pamphlet also included partisan arguments 
submitted by proponents and opponents of the initiative. These arguments 
further established that the issue at stake in Proposition 209 was the 
continuation of public sector race- and gender-conscious affirmative action 
programs. The Argument In Favor Statement begins by instantly focusing 
the reader on the issue of affirmative action: 


A generation ago, we did it right. We passed civil rights laws to prohibit 
discrimination. But special interests hijacked the civil rights movement. 
Instead of equality, governments imposed quotas, preferences, and set-
asides. 


Pls. Exh. 3. The next paragraph quotes the facially-neutral language of the 
initiative but then immediately returns to the issue of affirmative action, 
with a particular emphasis on race-conscious affirmative action: 


"REVERSE DISCRIMINATION" BASED ON RACE OR GENDER IS 
PLAIN WRONG! . [S]tudents are being rejected from public universities 
because of their RACE. Job applicants are turned away because their 
RACE does not meet some "goal" or "timetable." Contracts are awarded to 
high bidders because they are of the preferred RACE Proposition 209 will 
stop [these] terrible programs . 


Id. (emphasis in original).[FOOTNOTE 11] 


The Argument Against Statement also focused attention on Proposition 
209's impact on affirmative action programs beneficial to women and 
minorities. The argument warns that: 


Proposition 209 will eliminate affirmative action programs that help 
achieve equal opportunity for women and minorities . 


and concludes by stating that Proposition 209: 


poses as an equal opportunities initiative, but [it] puts at risk every 
outreach program, sets back the gains made by women and puts the brakes 
on expanding opportunities for people in need. 


Id. (quoting General Colin Powell).


B. Election Results and Response by Defendants 


On November 5, 1996, the voters of California enacted Proposition 209 
into law, with 4,736,180 votes (54%) cast in favor of the initiative and 
3,986,196 votes (46%) cast in opposition.[FOOTNOTE 12] Because the 
initiative is by its terms self-executing, public entities around the State 
faced the immediate question of implementation. Three of the defendants 
in this action responded by quickly acting to implement and enforce 
Proposition 209. On November 6, 1996, Governor Wilson issued an 
Executive Order (W-136-96) requiring state agencies to promulgate 
implementing regulations and identify all state statutes and programs 
pertaining to employment, education or contracting that grant or encourage 
preferences based on race, sex, color, ethnicity or national 
original.[FOOTNOTE 13] That same day, Attorney General Lungren 
instructed state agencies to comply immediately with Proposition 209 to 
the extent permitted by California law.[FOOTNOTE 14] The University 
of California also promptly took steps to implement Proposition 209. See 
Dec. 6, 1996 Order at 2.[FOOTNOTE 15] Other defendants expressed 
uncertainty and confusion regarding the appropriate response to the 
initiative. See Response of Defendant City of Pasadena to Plaintiffs' 
Request for Temporary Restraining Order at 2 ("[C]omplex questions now 
exist about how to reconcile the competing and seemingly conflicting 
requirements of federal, state and local affirmative action policies. These 
are issues which this City cannot resolve on its own."). 


C. Effect of Proposition 209 on Affirmative Action Programs 


Any California public entity that implements Proposition 209 is required 
to end voluntary race- and gender-conscious affirmative action programs 
in three areas: contracting, employment, and education. We thus briefly 
review each of these areas in turn.[FOOTNOTE 16] 


1. Contracting


Race- and gender-conscious affirmative action programs in California in 
the area of public contracting have taken various forms, from requiring 
that prime contractors make good-faith efforts to utilize women- or 
minority-owned subcontractors to providing an advantage in evaluating 
bids. These programs are designed to address the continuing effects of past 
or present bias against the use of women- and minority-owned contractors 
on public sector projects. According to the evidence before the Court, their 
effect has been to provide such contractors with substantial opportunities 
not previously available. 


The experience of Antonio Ruiz provides one such example. Mr. Ruiz 
owns Ruiz Construction Company & Associates which engages in general 
engineering and construction work. Amended Ruiz Decl. filed in support 
of amicus para. 2. It is Mr. Ruiz' experience that "contractors accept the 
bids of those contractors with whom they have established ties." Id. para. 
8. In 1985, Ruiz qualified to participate in the city of San Francisco's 
voluntary affirmative action program, which was adopted to remedy past 
discriminatory practices by the city in its letting of contracts. Prior to this 
time, Ruiz was unable to "get many large contractors to even accept [his] 
bids for subcontract work," and he in fact had obtained "only one 
contracting job with the City." para.para. 7-8. By participating in the City's 
affirmative action program, he was able to break through the old patterns 
of doing business and obtain subcontracts. para.para. 10-11. The exposure 
he gained led to additional business with prime contractors, and allowed 
him to build his business substantially and "form joint ventures to bid as a 
prime contractor on City contracts." para.para. 12-14. See also Fung Decl. 
para. 4 (affirmative action in public contracting has reduced discrimination 
against Asian American contractors and made it possible for them to bid 
competitively for public contracts); Wu Decl. at 144-145 (affirmative 
action in public contracting has substantially benefitted Asian Americans); 
Burns Decl. para. 4 (women-owned painting and wallpapering company 
benefitted substantially from San Francisco affirmative action contracting 
program); Chavez Decl. para.para. 3-4 (describing how affirmative action 
in public contracting programs allowed him to break through the "old boy 
network" and obtain public contracts); Larson Decl. para. 16 (disparities 
between the availability of women- and minority-owned contractors and 
their use by public agencies "are noticeably reduced where government 
agencies implement affirmative action policies"), para. 20 (after Los 
Angeles adopted affirmative action programs, percentage of women 
businesses obtaining city contracts increased from 0.3% to 8% and 
percentage of minority businesses obtaining city contracts increased from 
2% to 11.8%). 


The record further demonstrates that implementation of Proposition 209 
would substantially reduce opportunities in public contracting for women 
and minorities. Larson Decl. para. 17 (discussing studies showing that race 
or gender neutral programs designed to address underutilization of 
minority and women contractors were generally ineffective), para. 21; 
Chavez Decl. para. 5 (estimating that absent affirmative action program 
"his firm would lose up to 50 to 75% of" its public contracting work); 
Leonard Decl. para. 15 (discussing a study finding "not only a stagnation 
but a reversal of advances" for African-Americans under "weak" 
affirmative action programs). 


2. Employment


Race- and gender-conscious affirmative action programs in California in 
the area of public employment generally allow an employer to consider the 
ethnicity or gender of an otherwise qualified applicant as one of many 
factors. Some programs may also utilize hiring goals. Such programs are 
typically designed to address the continuing effects of past or present bias 
against the hiring and/or promotion of women and minority employees. 
According to the evidence before the Court, their effect has been to 
provide such employees with substantial opportunities not previously 
available. 


The use of voluntary affirmative action in California's civil service 
provides one such example. In 1971, then-Governor Ronald Reagan issued 
an Executive Order establishing voluntary affirmative action in the 
California civil service. Bielby Decl. para. 4. Subsequently, state agencies 
and departments began using hiring goals and timetables in an effort to 
correct the existing underutilization of women and 
minorities.[FOOTNOTE 17] As a consequence, the "index of gender and 
race segregation in state agencies" declined by 11 and 16 percent 
respectively between 1979 and 1986. para. 5. See also Newmann Decl. 
para. 7 (period from 1979-85 showed substantial statistical increases in the 
rate of female representation in the California "civil service and an even 
greater increase in nonwhite representation"); Badget Decl. para. 6 ("After 
state and federal governments began to require that state and local 
employers execute affirmative action plans in the early 1970s, the 
representation of Latino and black women increased dramatically as did 
access to managerial and professional jobs for all women of color."); 
Grillo Decl. para.para. 1-4 (affirmative action guidelines have been "very 
important" in enabling women and minorities to gain civil service 
positions in California). 


The record also indicates that implementation of Proposition 209 would 
substantially reduce opportunities for women and minorities in public 
employment. 


3. Education


Race- and gender-conscious affirmative action programs in California in 
the area of public education range from voluntary desegregation and 
"magnet school" programs at the elementary school level to financial aid 
and admissions programs at the college and graduate school level. The 
evidence before the Court demonstrates that, overall, these programs have 
benefited minorities and women. 


The University of California provides one example. Where the number of 
eligible applicants exceeds the spaces available, the University of 
California campuses select between 40 and 60% of students based upon 
their grades, test scores and course work. The remaining selections are 
made using a combination of criteria including California residence, 
physical and learning disabilities, educational disadvantage, family 
income, ethnicity, leadership ability, public service, special athletic, 
artistic or musical ability, composition of a student's family (whether 
student comes from a single- or two-parent family) and a student's family's 
college history (whether student is first-generation college bound). 


Under this system of admissions, the racial composition of the total 
University of California freshman class for the Fall of 1994 was as 
follows: 


numberpercentage


American Indian214 .96


African American9684.35


Latino 3,31314.87


Filipino 949 4.26


Asian 7,19132.28


White/other 9,64343.28


total:22,278 100.00


Conrad Decl. para. 15.


The record indicates that, without the present race- and gender-conscious 
affirmative action efforts, the number of African American enrollments 
"could be reduced across the system by as much as 40 to 50 percent while 
Chicano/Latino enrollments could be reduced by 5 to 15 percent . 
American Indian enrollments could be reduced by 40 to 50 percent. 
Filipino enrollments could increase by 5 percent or decline by 5 percent." 
Pls. Exh. 7 at i. On the other hand, Asian American enrollments would 
increase by 15 to 25 percent. White enrollments would likely remain 
roughly the same. Id.[FOOTNOTE 18] 


The above estimates may well understate the actual decreases that would 
occur over time. As acceptance rates fall for African American, Latino and 
American Indian students, the applicant pool from these groups may fall 
as well, since high school students consider the probability of admission 
when deciding where to apply for college. 


The record also suggests that, absent race- and gender-conscious 
admission programs, the admissions of African American, Latino, and 
American Indian students at California's public medical schools will 
significantly decrease. This in turn is likely to have a negative effect on the 
delivery of health care services in those communities. "On average, black 
physicians care for nearly six times as many black patients and Hispanics 
physicians care for nearly three times as many Hispanic patients as other 
physicians." Conrad Decl. para. 37; Drake Decl. para. 5. 


D. Impact of Proposition 209 on the Political Process 


Prior to the passage of Proposition 209, anyone seeking to petition his or 
her government representatives to adopt, amend, or retain race- or gender-
conscious affirmative action programs faced the same burdens as those 
faced by any constituent seeking preferential treatment for any group in 
the area of contracting, employment or education.[FOOTNOTE 19] 
Typically, this burden involves directly petitioning and lobbying the 
specific representatives or policymakers with authority to adopt such 
programs. Such programs can generally be approved by simple majority 
vote or by executive decision. See e.g. Hernandez Decl. para. 5 (describing 
constituents' successful effort to convince city of San Francisco to adopt 
affirmative action program to remedy discriminatory practices in city 
contracting). In other cases, a local initiative process may be required. 


After the passage of Proposition 209, women and minorities who wish to 
petition their government for race- or gender-conscious remedial programs 
face a considerably more daunting burden.[FOOTNOTE 20] Before such 
persons can approach their school district, city council, county 
government, or any other subdivision of government with such a proposal, 
they must first obtain an amendment to the California Constitution that 
would either (a) repeal Proposition 209, or (b) permit the specific 
government entity at issue to adopt a particular race- or gender-conscious 
affirmative action program. 


The California Constitution can be amended through either an initiative 
constitutional amendment or a legislative constitutional amendment. 
Either method places a heavy burden on those seeking to advocate the use 
of constitutionally- permissible affirmative action programs in their local 
communities. 


Under the first method-an initiative constitutional amendment-sponsors 
must first obtain signatures supporting the initiative equal to 8% of the 
previous gubernatorial vote. In 1996, this required the collection of 
693,230 valid signatures. Cain Decl. para. 4. Since many signatures are 
disqualified, in order to ensure the requisite number of valid signatures, 
approximately 50% more "raw" signatures must be collected. Zimmerman 
Decl. para. 8. Because these signatures must be collected within a 150-day 
time limit, a campaign must typically collect up to 7,000 signatures during 
each of the 150 days. Id. para. 9. Given these requirements, and the size of 
California, hiring paid signature gatherers is a virtual necessity. The cost 
of obtaining signatures runs from $0.70 to $1.50 per signature. Id. para. 
10. Thus, even where volunteers gather some portion of the required 
signatures, the cost of securing sufficient signatures, and minimally 
staffing a few offices, can run from $500,000 to $1.5 million. Id. para. 11; 
Cain Decl. para. 6. Once the initiative has qualified, it must gain majority 
approval by the voters. 


Under the second method-legislative constitutional amendment-sponsors 
must secure a two-thirds vote of approval by both the California Senate 
and Assembly. A majority of the voters must then approve the amendment 
at the next statewide election. 


In either case, substantial funds are required to organize and fund the 
statewide campaign that follows the initiative qualification procedure or 
requisite legislative approval. Again, the size of California makes this 
endeavor particularly expensive. To reach at least 10 million voters 
directly, a campaign would have to talk to 1,000 voters each day for 30 
years. Zimmerman Decl. para. 12. Campaigns must thus generally reach 
voters through television, radio, print advertising, and direct mail. 
According to the California Commission on Campaign Financing, $109 
million was spent on statewide initiatives on the 1990 ballot. Cain Decl.

As a result of the new political-process hurdles erected by Proposition 
209, members of the plaintiff class are effectively precluded from 
petitioning local and state policymakers and representatives to adopt, 
maintain, or expand race- or gender-conscious affirmative action 
programs. For example, the Coalition for Economic Equity (Coalition), a 
named plaintiff in this action, has proposed fifteen amendments to the City 
of San Francisco's affirmative action policy. Members of the Coalition 
have met with City Supervisors in preparation for a vote on the proposed 
legislation by the entire San Francisco Board of Supervisors. The 
Coalition is now precluded from further pursuing this legislation through 
the normal political channels that were available prior to the adoption of 
Proposition 209. 


V.CONCLUSIONS OF LAW


A. Likelihood of Success on Plaintiffs' Equal Protection Claim 


"The Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment guarantees racial 
minorities the right to full participation in the political life of the 
community." Seattle, 458 U.S. at 467. This guarantee applies with equal 
force to women. United States v. Virginia, 116 S. Ct. at 2275. The Equal 
Protection Clause not only prohibits the outright exclusion of women and 
minorities from the political process, but also prohibits more subtle 
distortions of the political process. Seattle, 458 U.S. at 467. In the words 
of the Supreme Court, "the State may no more disadvantage any particular 
group by making it more difficult to enact legislation in its behalf than it 
may dilute any person's vote." Id. at 476 (quoting Hunter, 393 U.S. at 
393). 


Plaintiffs argue that Proposition 209, despite its facial neutrality, violates 
the Equal Protection Clause because it restructures the political process to 
disadvantage only those seeking to enact legislation intended to benefit 
minorities and women. Relying on the Supreme Court opinions in Seattle 
and Hunter, plaintiffs emphasize that prior to the enactment of Proposition 
209, supporters of race- and gender-conscious affirmative action programs 
were able to petition their state and local officials directly for such 
programs. After the passage of Proposition 209, however, these same 
advocates face the considerably more daunting task of mounting a 
statewide campaign to amend the California Constitution. At the same 
time, those seeking preferences based on any ground other than race or 
gender, such as age, disability, or veteran status, continue to enjoy access 
to the political process at all levels of government. Plaintiffs thus maintain 
that Proposition 209 denies them the equal protection of the laws by 
removing the authority to redress racial and gender problems-and only 
those problems-to a new and remote level of government, thereby singling 
out the interests of minorities and women for a special political burden. 


For the reasons noted earlier, the Court in testing Proposition 209 against 
the Equal Protection Clause focuses on a relatively narrow question: does 
Proposition 209's prohibition of constitutionally-permissible race- and 
gender-conscious affirmative action violate plaintiffs' right to equal 
protection of the laws? 


1. Does the Seattle-Hunter Doctrine Apply? 


Plaintiffs rely primarily on two Supreme Court cases, Hunter and Seattle, 
to support their equal protection claim. "These cases yield a simple but 
central principle. [T]he political majority may generally restructure the 
political process to place obstacles in the path of everyone seeking to 
secure the benefits of governmental action. [But] the State [may not] 
allocate governmental power nonneutrally by explicitly using the racial 
nature of a decision to determine the decisionmaking process." Id. at 470. 


In Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385 (1969), the Supreme Court addressed 
the efforts of citizens of Akron, Ohio, to overturn duly-enacted legislation 
prohibiting racial discrimination in housing. After the city council adopted 
a fair housing law, the citizens by referendum amended the city charter to 
require that fair housing ordinances be put to a citywide vote before they 
could take effect. This requirement, set out in section 137 of the charter, 
not only affected future fair housing efforts, but also reached back to 
suspend the previously-enacted ordinance. See id. at 387. The Supreme 
Court found that section 137 singled out local legislation of special 
interest to minorities for a unique political burden; while those seeking to 
enact ordinances regulating real estate on any basis other than race merely 
had to persuade the Akron City Council, "for those who sought protection 
against racial bias, the approval of the City Council was not enough." Id. 
at 390. The Supreme Court ultimately concluded that Akron's restructuring 
of the political process violated the 14th Amendment. 


The Supreme Court's analysis of section 137 turned on two particular 
features of the measure. First, section 137 raised equal protection concerns 
because it singled out an issue of particular interest to racial minorities-
racial discrimination in housing. Had the measure imposed a new political 
burden on all legislation, the Supreme Court was quick to point out, it 
would not have run afoul of the 14th Amendment. Id. at 393-95 (Harlan, 
J., concurring). Second, section 137 was suspect because it imposed a 
novel political burden on all future efforts to enact fair housing legislation. 
Had the citizens of Akron used the referendum process simply to repeal 
the fair housing ordinance previously adopted by the Akron City Council, 
this action alone would have raised no equal protection difficulty. Id. at 
390 n.5; see also Crawford, 458 U.S. at 539. Although neither of these two 
features of section 137, standing alone, would have offended the 14th 
Amendment, the Supreme Court held that the confluence of the two 
factors-the targeting of a racial issue and the reordering of the political 
process-constituted a racial classification that required the most exacting 
judicial scrutiny. 


In Washington v. Seattle School District No.1, 458 U.S. 457 (1982), the 
Supreme Court reaffirmed its ruling in Hunter, applying the rationale of 
that case to a statewide initiative designed to prohibit the mandatory 
busing of students to achieve racial integration in schools. After a Seattle 
school district took steps to establish a mandatory busing plan, the voters 
of Washington passed Initiative 350, which provided that "no school board 
shall directly or indirectly require any student to attend a school other than 
the school which is geographically nearest or next nearest the student's 
place of residence." Id. at 462. Three school districts that had previously 
initiated busing efforts challenged the initiative in court, and these 
challenges ultimately presented the Supreme Court with an "extraordinary 
question: whether an elected school board may use the Fourteenth 
Amendment to defend its program of busing for integration from attack by 
the State." Id. at 459 (emphasis in original). 


Despite its facially neutral language, the Supreme Court found that 
Initiative 350 in reality barred only busing plans aimed at achieving racial 
integration while permitting busing for other purposes. In striking down 
the initiative, the Court found that it, like the enactment in Hunter, singled 
out an issue of concern to minorities-racial busing-and imposed special 
political burdens on those who supported the issue. These features of 
Initiative 350 led the Court to find that the facially-neutral measure was, in 
reality, a racial classification subject to the most searching judicial 
scrutiny. Id. at 485. In the words of the Court, "It is beyond dispute that 
the initiative was enacted 'because of,' not merely 'in spite of,' its adverse 
effects upon busing for integration." Id. at 471. As in Hunter, the Supreme 
Court concluded that, viewed in this light, Initiative 350 violated the 14th 
Amendment. 


Before the Court applies these precedents to the case at bar, it notes that 
Proposition 209 shares several characteristics with the measures struck 
down in Hunter and Seattle. All three initiatives are facially neutral. All 
three grew from controversial efforts aimed at rolling back legislative 
gains that were intended as remedies for historical discrimination suffered 
by particular groups. Perhaps most importantly, in the wake of all three 
measures, those seeking to reenact such remedies could no longer use the 
same political mechanisms that had been available prior to the passage of 
the enactments. 


As plaintiffs themselves concede, however, one difference between Seattle 
and Hunter and the matter at bar is readily apparent: Seattle and Hunter 
exclusively address racial issues,[FOOTNOTE 21] whereas Proposition 
209 addresses both race and gender preferences. Defendants urge this 
Court not to import the Supreme Court's Seattle and Hunter reasoning into 
the context of gender. 


The Supreme Court "has repeatedly recognized that neither federal nor 
state government acts compatibly with the equal protection principle when 
a law or official policy denies to women, simply because they are women, 
full citizenship status." United States v. Virginia, 116 S. Ct. at 2275. 
Because "our Nation has had a long and unfortunate history of sex 
discrimination," equal protection jurisprudence requires that gender 
classifications must survive heightened judicial scrutiny. J.E.B. v. 
Alabama ex rel T.B., 511 U.S. 127, 114 S. Ct. 1419, 1425 (1994) (quoting 
Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 684 (1973)). Gender and racial 
classifications, however, do not receive identical treatment under the 
Equal Protection Clause; to date, the Supreme Court has reserved strict 
scrutiny for racial classifications. United States v. Virginia, 116 S. Ct. at 
2275 n.6. Gender classifications, meanwhile, are subject to less stringent 
intermediate scrutiny review. Id. at 2274. 


The differing levels of judicial scrutiny accorded race and gender 
classifications, however, do not render the reasoning of Seattle and Hunter 
inappropriate in the context of gender. On the contrary, the doctrinal 
approach of those cases is wholly consonant with the heightened scrutiny 
applicable to gender classifications. When a measure is challenged under 
the Equal Protection Clause, a court is required, as a threshold matter, to 
determine whether the challenged measure contains a race or gender 
classification. See Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 115 S. Ct. 2097, 
2105 (1995) (noting that presence of a race classification made the 
Arlington Heights intent analysis unnecessary); Personnel Adm'r. of Mass. 
v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 273-74 (1979) (noting different equal protection 
analysis when no explicit gender classification is present). It is this 
threshold question that the Seattle-Hunter analysis is meant to answer. 
Only after concluding that a racial classification was involved did the 
Supreme Court in Seattle and Hunter proceed to subject the challenged 
enactments to strict scrutiny. Seattle, 458 U.S. at 485; Hunter, 393 U.S. at 
391-92. In the gender context, similarly, a court should first apply the 
Seattle-Hunter analysis to determine whether a gender classification exists, 
and then apply the appropriate intermediate equal protection scrutiny. It is 
precisely by applying the Seattle-Hunter doctrine in cases involving 
gender that a court fulfills its obligation to scrutinize gender classifications 
carefully. 


Irrespective of the applicability of the rationale of Seattle and Hunter to 
gender, defendants maintain that the present case is not controlled by these 
precedents. Simply put, the defendants insist that because this case is 
different in kind from Seattle and Hunter, the Seattle-Hunter doctrine is 
wholly irrelevant. 


First, defendants argue that Proposition 209, unlike the Washington and 
Akron initiatives, expressly prohibits classifications based on race and 
gender, and thus cannot be read to create such classifications. Defendants 
essentially ask this Court to read the plain language of Proposition 209, 
which concededly contains no classification on its face, and go no further. 
While it would certainly streamline the inquiry, this approach is expressly 
disapproved in Hunter and Seattle. Despite the facial neutrality of the 
challenged enactments in both of those cases, the Supreme Court looked 
beyond the plain language of the measure in question and inquired 
whether, "in reality, the burden imposed by [the] arrangement necessarily 
falls on the minority." Seattle, 458 U.S. at 468 (emphasis added, internal 
quotations omitted); see also Hunter, 393 U.S. at 391.[FOOTNOTE 22] 


Defendants' argument, moreover, asks this Court to overlook the central 
purpose of the Seattle-Hunter doctrine: to determine whether facially 
neutral enactments in reality rest on "distinctions based on race" or gender. 
Seattle, 458 U.S. at 485. Defendants cannot use Proposition 209's facial 
neutrality as a shield against the application of the Seattle-Hunter analysis; 
it is precisely the measure's facial neutrality that makes application of 
those cases appropriate. Compare id. (applying Hunter to find that a 
facially neutral measure operated as a racial classification) with Crawford, 
458 U.S. at 539 (applying the Hunter analysis to find that a facially neutral 
measure did not embody a racial classification). Defendants have simply 
mistaken the starting point of the equal protection analysis with its ending 
point. 


Defendants next attempt to distinguish the Seattle and Hunter cases by 
shifting the focus of the inquiry from the initiatives themselves to the 
legislative efforts they effectively bar. From this standpoint, the 
defendants make two arguments that are variations on a single theme to 
distinguish Seattle and Hunter from the case at hand. 


In the first argument, defendants contend that neither the mandatory 
busing programs barred by Initiative 350 nor the fair housing legislation 
barred by Akron's section 137 placed a burden upon the equal protection 
rights of nonminorities. Defendants insist that Proposition 209, in contrast, 
would outlaw preferences that by their very nature inflict injury on 
nonminorities. See Adarand, 116 S. Ct. at 2114 ("[W]henever the 
government treats any person unequally because of his or her race, that 
person has suffered an injury ."); Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 
U.S. 267, 280-83 (1986) (opinion of Powell, J.) (discussing the burden 
placed on nonminorities by affirmative action programs aimed at 
remedying past discrimination). On this theory, Proposition 209 is 
distinguishable from the initiatives in Seattle and Hunter because it only 
interferes with "zero-sum" antidiscrimination efforts-those that help 
minorities, but do so at the expense of nonminorities. 


The second argument focuses on the judicial scrutiny that attends the 
efforts banned by the challenged initiatives. According to defendants, the 
affirmative action efforts prohibited by Proposition 209 are, under existing 
14th Amendment principles, themselves constitutionally suspect and 
subject to heightened scrutiny. See Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2117. The fair 
housing ordinance and the busing programs that were overturned by the 
initiatives in Seattle and Hunter, defendants argue, did not themselves 
trigger heightened equal protection scrutiny. 


Defendants' proposed distinctions, although not implausible on their face, 
both fail for the same reason: nothing in Seattle or Hunter suggests that the 
Supreme Court holdings turned on these features of the challenged 
amendments.[FOOTNOTE 23] If the application of the Seattle-Hunter 
doctrine to Initiative 350 turned on whether or not Seattle's mandatory 
busing plan could be characterized as "zero-sum," as the defendants 
contend, the Supreme Court would presumably have addressed this 
difficult threshold issue. The opinion in Seattle, however, applied Hunter 
without examining whether mandatory busing presented a "zero-sum" 
scenario.[FOOTNOTE 24] Similarly, the Supreme Court in Seattle 
expressly declined to reach the question of what level of equal protection 
scrutiny was applicable to Seattle's busing plan. Seattle, 458 U.S. at 472 
n.15. Consequently, defendants' contention that Seattle's holding turns on 
the scrutiny applicable to Seattle's busing program is unpersuasive. 


Defendants' view of Initiative 350, moreover, overlooks the raging 
controversy that surrounded the issue of mandatory busing in 1978 and 
that constituted the backdrop for the Supreme Court's decision in Seattle. 
See Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. Washington, 473 F. Supp. 996, 1005-10 
(W.D. Wash. 1979), aff'd, 633 F.2d 1338 (9th Cir. 1980), aff'd, 458 U.S. 
457 (1982) (findings regarding the political controversy surrounding 
Seattle's busing efforts). It is evident that many who supported Initiative 
350 felt that Seattle's busing plan benefited minority students at the 
expense of the majority. This is borne out by the fact that shortly after the 
implementation of the plan, four school board members who supported the 
plan narrowly avoided recall. Seattle, 458 U.S. at 460 n.1. As a result, 
defendants' conclusion that the busing plan in Seattle did not burden 
majority interests is, at best, both factually and legally ambiguous. Id. at 
495 n.9 (Powell, J., dissenting) (suggesting that busing aimed at 
desegregation might, in fact, be viewed as burdensome to nonminority 
students). 


Finally, defendants' focus on the particular legislation barred by Initiative 
350, Akron's section 137, and Proposition 209, rather than on the 
initiatives themselves, suffers from a more fundamental flaw. Accepting 
defendants' arguments would essentially require that this Court read 
Seattle and Hunter as cases about the limits on state-sponsored remedies 
for past discrimination. This is the inevitable conclusion that emerges from 
a primary focus on the legislation blocked, rather than on the blocking 
intiative. As this Court has pointed out, however, the instant case, as well 
as Seattle and Hunter, are more appropriately understood as cases about 
access to the political process. 


Because the Seattle-Hunter doctrine is designed to determine whether 
facially neutral enactments single out race and gender issues for unique 
political burdens, and thus are suspect classifications, defendants' efforts to 
distinguish Seattle and Hunter must fail. If, in reality, Proposition 209 
does not single out a racial or gender issue for unfavorable treatment in the 
political process, the initiative will emerge from the Seattle-Hunter 
analysis unscathed. See Crawford, 458 U.S. at 539 (simple repeal of 
antidiscrimination law raises no equal protection concern). If, on the other 
hand, Proposition 209's facial neutrality masks a racial or gender 
classification, the Equal Protection Clause requires that the measure be 
subjected to heightened scrutiny. See Seattle, 458 U.S. at 485. It is to this 
inquiry that this Court now turns.[FOOTNOTE 25] 


2.Application of the Seattle-Hunter Doctrine 


The Seattle opinion sets out the framework for analysis: if an "initiative 
removes the authority to address a racial problem-and only a racial 
problem-from the existing decisionmaking body, in such a way as to 
burden minority interests," it must be examined for equal protection 
purposes as if it were a racial classification. Id. Keeping the earlier 
discussion regarding the extension of this analysis to the gender context in 
mind, the Court applies the Seattle test to Proposition 209. 


a.Racial Focus


Just as the Supreme Court did in Seattle, this Court begins its analysis by 
asking whether Proposition 209, despite its facial neutrality, singles out an 
issue of special interest to minorities or women, and thus has a "racial [or 
gender] focus." Id. at 474. 


In concluding that Initiative 350 had a racial focus, the Supreme Court 
relied in part on the perceptions of Washington voters. The Court found 
that despite Initiative 350's neutral language, proponents of the measure 
assured voters that it would affect only racial busing. Id. at 471. Given the 
nature of the political campaign that surrounded its passage and the 
measure's practical effect, the Supreme Court had no difficulty joining the 
District Court and Court of Appeals in concluding that Initiative 350 was 
"effectively drawn for racial purposes." Id. 


The record likewise suggests that the campaign for Proposition 209 had a 
racial and gender focus. As described in the Findings of Fact, the 
independent LAO, as well as the supporters and opponents of Proposition 
209, characterized Proposition 209 as a referendum on race- and gender-
conscious affirmative action. Named defendant Governor Pete Wilson 
himself signed the Argument in Favor statement, which opens with the 
following: 


THE RIGHT THING TO DO!


A generation ago, we did it right. We passed civil rights laws to prohibit 
discrimination. But special interests hijacked the civil rights movement. 
Instead of equality, governments imposed quotas, preferences, and set-
asides. 


Pls. Exh. 2. Just as the voters of Washington perceived Initiative 350 as a 
referendum on busing, the evidence presently before the Court indicates 
that people of California viewed Proposition 209 as a referendum on 
affirmative action. 


The Supreme Court, in evaluating whether Initiative 350 had a racial 
focus, also considered the enactment's practical effect. In Seattle, despite 
Initiative 350's non-racial language regulating student transportation, the 
practical effect of the measure was to prohibit only busing for racial 
integration, while leaving school districts free to employ busing for other 
purposes. Seattle, 458 U.S. at 474-75. Similarly, while Proposition 209's 
general language barring discrimination merely duplicates existing state 
and federal law, and thus does not materially alter existing state practices, 
Proposition 209's prohibition on preferences will have a practical effect on 
existing programs. The California Legislative Analyst, for example, 
concluded that Proposition 209's ban on race and gender preferences 
would eliminate existing state and local race- and gender-conscious 
affirmative action efforts in contracting, employment, and education. Pls. 
Exh. 2. The defendants, moreover, despite repeated questioning by 
plaintiffs and the Court, have not yet identified a single existing program, 
other than race- and gender-conscious affirmative action programs, that 
would be affected by Proposition 209.[FOOTNOTE 26] 


While all parties concede that Proposition 209, at the very least, will 
prohibit race- and gender-conscious affirmative action efforts, it is equally 
plain that preferences unrelated to race and gender remain unaffected by 
Proposition 209. The University of California, for example, remains free 
after Proposition 209 to continue its practice of considering in its 
admissions decisions "California residence , physical and learning 
disabilities, educational disadvantage, family income, and whether a 
student comes from a two-parent or single-parent family, is first-
generation college bound or has special talents (for example, artistic or 
athletic ability) or experiences." Young Decl. para. 13. Thus, the primary 
practical effect of Proposition 209 is to eliminate existing governmental 
race- and gender-conscious affirmative action programs in contracting, 
education, and employment and prohibit their creation in the future, while 
leaving governmental entities free to employ preferences based on any 
criteria other than race or gender. 


The opinion in Seattle, after concluding that the practical effect of 
Initiative 350 was to prohibit racial busing, addressed whether racial 
busing was an issue of special interest to minorities. Satisfied that 
Proposition 209 singles out race- and gender-conscious affirmative action, 
the Court turns to a similar question: is affirmative action an issue of 
special interest to minorities and women? The Court finds that the record 
fully supports plaintiffs' contention that state-sponsored race- and gender-
conscious affirmative action "inures primarily to the benefit of the 
minority, and is designed for that purpose." Seattle, 458 U.S. at 472. As 
discussed in the Findings of Fact, plaintiffs have produced extensive 
evidence documenting the dramatic effect that affirmative action has had 
on the opportunities available to minorities and women in public 
contracting, employment, and education. 


Defendant-intervenor CADP stresses that, in recent years, the 
effectiveness and wisdom of race- and gender-conscious affirmative action 
programs have been called into question. In particular, CADP notes that as 
California becomes increasingly heterogeneous, affirmative action 
programs designed to benefit one racial minority can actually harm the 
interests of another racial minority. This insight, however, has no bearing 
on the "racial focus" inquiry mandated by Seattle. The fact that African 
Americans and whites could be found on both sides of the busing debate in 
that case did not prevent the Supreme Court from concluding that 
Initiative 350 addressed a racial issue. Id. at 472 (noting that "Negroes and 
whites may be counted among both the supporters and the opponents of 
Initiative 350"). 


In any event, the "racial focus" inquiry set down in Seattle does not 
depend on the wisdom or efficacy of any particular affirmative action 
program. "In the absence of a constitutional violation, the desirability and 
efficacy" of race- and gender-conscious affirmative action "are matters to 
be resolved through the political process." Id. at 474. Rather, the question 
posed by Seattle is whether the issue in question is generally perceived as 
one of special interest to minorities and women, and if the issue has been 
singled out for unfavorable political treatment. As the Supreme Court held 
in Seattle, an enactment is unconstitutional if it "removes the authority to 
address a racial problem-and only a racial problem-from the existing 
decisionmaking body, in such a way as to burden minority interests." Id. 
(emphasis added). This Court has no trouble concluding that affirmative 
action is appropriately understood as "racial problem" and, similarly, a 
"gender problem" in the sense meant by the Supreme Court. Id. ("For 
present purposes, it is enough that minorities may consider busing for 
integration to be legislation that is in their interest.") 


For the foregoing reasons, the Court is satisfied that plaintiffs have 
demonstrated that Proposition 209 "was enacted 'because of,' not merely 
'in spite of,' its adverse effects upon" affirmative action, and thus that the 
measure was effectively drawn for racial purposes.[FOOTNOTE 27] Id. at 
471. 


b.Restructuring the Political Process


The Court next must ask whether Proposition 209 restructures the political 
process to the detriment of the interests of minorities and women. 


The Supreme Court in Seattle addressed this issue by comparing the 
political burden faced by those seeking race-based busing with the burden 
faced by those seeking student assignment policies for nonracial reasons. 
Prior to the passage of Initiative 350, the state left virtually all matters of 
education policy, including busing to achieve integration, to local school 
boards. Id. at 477-82. The Court found that, after Initiative 350, "[t]hose 
favoring the elimination of de facto school segregation now must seek 
relief from the state legislature, or from the statewide electorate." Id. at 
474. Those interested in busing for other purposes, in contrast, could 
continue to petition their local school boards for such programs. The Court 
concluded that this restructuring of political authority imposed a 
"comparative burden on minority participation in the political process." Id. 
at 480 n.23. 


In evaluating Proposition 209, this Court employs the same comparative 
approach utilized in Seattle. The defendants here concede that prior to 
Proposition 209, those seeking preferences-whether based on race, gender, 
disability, veteran status, economic disadvantage, age, residency, or any 
other basis-in public contracting, employment, and education could 
directly petition their state and local governmental entities for such 
preferential treatment. After the enactment of Proposition 209, those 
seeking race- and gender-conscious affirmative action must first mount a 
statewide campaign to amend the state constitution, while those seeking 
preferential treatment on all other grounds need not surmount any new 
political hurdle. 


The record compiled by plaintiffs indicates that this changed political 
landscape imposes a substantial burden on the interests of women and 
minorities. The Coalition, for example, has been instrumental in 
persuading the City and County of San Francisco ("San Francisco") to 
adopt contracting ordinances that include race- and gender-conscious 
provisions designed to remedy the city's history of discrimination in 
contracting ("MWBE Ordinance").[FOOTNOTE 28] Since the adoption of 
the MWBE Ordinance, the Coalition has continued to support the 
program, periodically proposing modifications designed to enhance its 
effectiveness and ensure its conformity with federal and state 
law.[FOOTNOTE 29] 


After Proposition 209, the doors of San Francisco government are closed 
to groups like the Coalition. The Coalition thus faces not only the prospect 
that San Francisco's MBWE Ordinance might fall to a court challenge 
brought under Proposition 209,[FOOTNOTE 30] but also must embark on 
a statewide campaign to repeal or amend Proposition 209 if they are to 
enact any similar legislation in the future. As detailed in the Findings of 
Fact, the evidence before the Court indicates that this additional political 
hurdle is a high one: the Coalition would need to collect approximately 
700,000 valid signatures to qualify an initiative, and then would have to 
mount an expensive statewide media campaign to persuade voters to vote 
in its favor at the polls. This political burden stands in stark contrast to the 
local effort the Coalition faced prior to the passage of Proposition 209. 


The example of San Francisco's MWBE Ordinance also demonstrates that 
Proposition 209, like Initiative 350, burdens minority interests by 
indiscriminately eliminating even programs that do not arouse popular 
opposition. Despite Proposition 209's statewide victory, the voters of San 
Francisco opposed the measure by a margin of 70.5% to 
29.4%.[FOOTNOTE 31] In the words of the Supreme Court, 


In such situations the initiative makes the enactment of racially beneficial 
legislation difficult, though the particular program involved might not 
have inspired opposition had it been promulgated through the usual 
legislative processes used for comparable legislation. This imposes direct 
and undeniable burdens on minority interests. 


Seattle, 458 U.S. at 483-84 (internal footnote omitted); see also Hunter, 
393 U.S. at 395-96 (noting that section 137 has its real impact only where 
fair housing ordinances do not arouse opposition, because truly 
controversial measures would presumably be repealed via the existing 
referendum procedure). 


In response to plaintiffs' showing regarding political burden, defendants 
insist that Proposition 209 in no way reorders the political process with 
respect to race and gender preferences. In their view, the proper forum for 
addressing fundamental issues regarding individual rights has always been 
the state constitution, and Proposition 209 merely modifies the existing 
constitutional guarantee of equal treatment at the appropriate 
governmental level. 


This argument has substantial merit with respect to Proposition 209's 
broad antidiscrimination provision-the general ban on invidious race and 
gender discrimination is certainly a matter of constitutional 
decisionmaking. As the Court has pointed out, however, it is Proposition 
209's ban on preferences, not its general ban on discrimination, that is the 
focus of the instant suit. In this narrower context, defendants' argument 
falls short. Prior to the passage of Proposition 209, the discretion to adopt 
constitutionally-permissible race- and gender-conscious affirmative action 
programs was, as defendants' counsel conceded at oral argument, lodged 
with state and local government entities, not reserved at the constitutional 
level. 


Moreover, the Supreme Court explicitly rejected defendants' argument in 
Seattle. In that case, Washington argued that it exercised plenary power 
over matters concerning public education, and that Initiative 350's ban on 
racial busing should thus be understood as change in policy by the body 
ordinarily charged with policymaking discretion. Seattle, 458 U.S. at 475-
76. In rejecting this view, the Supreme Court emphasized that the issue 
was not whether the state had the power to ban race-based busing, but 
rather whether it had "exercised its power in such a way as to place 
special, and therefore impermissible, burdens on minority interests." Id. at 
476 n.18. Similarly, in the instant case no one challenges California's 
power to modify its basic constitutional guarantees of individual rights. 
The "single narrow question" before this Court is whether the state has 
exercised that power in a manner that violates the 14th Amendment. Id. 


The foregoing discussion also addresses defendants' contention that the 
present case is controlled by the Supreme Court's decision in Crawford v. 
Board of Education, 458 U.S. 527 (1982), which was handed down on the 
same day as Seattle. That case involved a California constitutional 
amendment, Proposition 1, that the voters enacted in 1979. Proposition 1 
aligned the authority of state courts to that of the federal courts with 
respect to court-ordered racial busing. In reviewing this initiative, the 
Supreme Court held that it merely repealed the prior constitutional 
language that had been interpreted to grant state courts more flexibility in 
ordering busing than was possessed by federal courts. Id. at 539. The 
Supreme Court further found that the repeal did not distort the political 
process-in the Supreme Court's view, what the people of California gave 
via the constitution, they chose to repeal via the same mechanism. Id. at 
541; id. at 547 (Blackmun, J., concurring). Local school boards, which had 
been free to adopt certain busing programs aimed at desegregation, 
remained free after Proposition 1 to adopt such programs.[FOOTNOTE 
32] Id. at 535-536 (noting that this feature of Proposition 1 distinguished it 
from the initiative in Seattle). 


As should be clear from the earlier discussion, the present case is 
dramatically different from Crawford. First, Proposition 209 cannot be 
characterized as a mere repeal. Proposition 209, by its terms, not only 
repeals all existing state and local affirmative action programs, but also 
prohibits the adoption of such programs in the future. In so doing, 
Proposition 209 displaces authority with respect to a race and gender issue 
to "a new and remote level of government," Seattle, 458 U.S. at 483, and 
thus reorders the political process to the detriment of women and 
minorities. Hence, rather than supporting defendants' position, Crawford 
underscores the troubling features of Proposition 209. 


Because the Court finds, based on the foregoing, that Proposition 209 
singles out an issue of special concern to minorities and women-race- and 
gender-conscious affirmative action-and alters the political process solely 
with respect to this issue, it concludes that the initiative "plainly rests on 
distinctions based on race." Id. at 485 (internal quotes omitted). 


c.Heightened Scrutiny


Where a governmental enactment rests on a racial or gender classification, 
a court must expose it to "a most searching examination." Adarand, 115 S. 
Ct. at 2111 (quoting Wygant, 476 U.S. at 273 (opinion of Powell, J.)). In 
examining race and gender classifications, however, the Supreme Court 
has employed two different standards, reserving the most exacting judicial 
scrutiny for situations involving race.[FOOTNOTE 33] United States v. 
Virginia, 116 S. Ct. at 2275 n.6. Because this Court finds that Proposition 
209 fails to survive the lesser scrutiny due its inherent gender 
classification, it need not apply the more stringent strict scrutiny 
test.[FOOTNOTE 34] 


In applying the intermediate scrutiny test appropriate to gender 
classifications, the Court is mindful of the Supreme Court's recent cases in 
this area. See United States v. Virginia, supra; J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. 
T.B., supra. According to the Supreme Court, "Today's skeptical scrutiny 
of official action denying rights or opportunities based on sex responds to 
volumes of history." United States v. Virginia, 116 S. Ct. at 2274. In order 
to survive this scrutiny, a gender classification must be supported by an 
"exceedingly persuasive justification." Id. at 2275. The state has the 
burden of showing that the challenged classification "serves important 
governmental objectives" and that the means employed are "substantially 
related to the achievement of those objectives." Id. 


In applying this demanding test, the Court asks a simple question: what 
important governmental interest is served by reordering the political 
process to the detriment of women's interests? With respect to this 
question, the defendants have not shouldered their burden. Defendants first 
suggest that Proposition 209 serves the important state interest of ending 
discrimination on the basis of race and gender. While undoubtedly 
important, however, this state interest is a non-sequitor with respect to 
Proposition 209. The Court fails to see how this purported interest is 
related to, much less justifies, the nonneutral reordering of the political 
process that is at issue in this case. As Seattle and Hunter make clear, it is 
not Proposition 209's prohibition on affirmative action that raises equal 
protection concerns; rather, it is the reordering of the political process that 
triggers exacting judicial scrutiny. Defendants have not identified any 
feature of the prior political process that was discriminatory, and thus their 
invocation of a state interest in eliminating discrimination cannot justify 
the nonneutral reordering of that process. 


The defendants also suggest that Proposition 209 serves an important state 
interest in avoiding liability under the 14th Amendment for affirmative 
action programs that have not yet been tested in court. As an initial matter, 
the Court notes that defendants have cited no cases suggesting that a state's 
abundance of caution can, by itself, constitute an important interest that 
would justify a gender classification. Even assuming that such an interest 
could justify a gender classification, Proposition 209 is a hopelessly 
overbroad means to that end. Proposition 209, far from being limited to 
affirmative action programs implemented by state agencies that have not 
been tested in court, prohibits all preferences, whether at the state or 
municipal level, and whether tested or untested in court. 


3.Conclusion


The Court turns finally to defendants' reductio ad absurdum attack on the 
plaintiffs' equal protection argument. Defendants submit that the Seattle 
and Hunter cases cannot be read to invalidate Proposition 209, because 
such a reading would necessarily lead to an absurd reordering of the 
relationship between states and subordinate local government units. 
According to this argument, if the Court accepts plaintiffs' position, such a 
holding would, in effect, permit local govermental bodies to preempt state 
authority on any racial or gender issue, at least where the local entity has 
acted to confer a benefit on minorities or women. 


In making this argument, defendants rely primarily on concerns expressed 
by Justice Powell in his dissenting opinion in Seattle. 458 U.S. at 494-95, 
498 n.14. As the majority in that case pointed out, however, the difficult 
dilemma posed by Justice Powell was not presented by Initiative 350. Id. 
at 480 n.23. Similarly, the dilemma posed by defendants does not follow 
from plaintiffs' equal protection claim in the instant case. Nothing about 
plaintiffs' argument requires that the state of California be forever barred 
from addressing a race- or gender-conscious affirmative action program 
where a local authority has acted first. The Seattle-Hunter doctrine merely 
regulates the manner of any state intervention, preventing the state from 
nonneutrally reordering the political process to burden the interests of 
minorities or women. A state, for example, remains free to restructure the 
political process in a neutral manner, even where such a change indirectly 
burdens the political participation of women and minorities. A state may 
also intercede where it can articulate a justification that survives equal 
protection scrutiny. What a state may not do, according to the Seattle-
Hunter doctrine, is single out an issue of special interest to minorities and 
women and require that such legislation run a unique political gauntlet. 


Plaintiffs' argument does not require that, once supporters of race- and 
gender-conscious affirmative action have suceeded at the ballot box, their 
victory can never be undone. Nothing in the Constitution requires that the 
political system guarantee victory to those who support affirmative action. 
The body that enacts an affirmative action measure is free, of course, to 
repeal it.[FOOTNOTE 35] See Crawford, 458 U.S. at 539. In short, those 
who support race- and gender-conscious affirmative action must compete 
within the neutral rules of the political process-the 14th Amendment 
expects that in the democratic struggle, the interests of minorities and 
women will sometimes prevail, and will sometimes be defeated. See 
Hunter, 393 U.S. at 394 (Harlan, J., concurring) (noting that neutral rules 
structuring the political process "will sometimes operate in favor of one 
faction; sometimes in favor of another"). 


Once those who support race- and gender-conscious affirmative action 
prevail at one level of government, however, the Equal Protection Clause 
will not tolerate an effort by the vanquished parties to alter the rules of the 
game-solely with respect to this single issue-so as to secure a reversal of 
fortunes. Plaintiffs have borne their burden of showing that Proposition 
209, by removing authority over race- and gender-conscious affirmative 
action to "a new and remote" level of government, has precisely such an 
effect. Such a reordering of the political process is tantamount to vote 
dilution in the most literal sense: the relevant voting pool is effectively 
expanded until the prior victory is undone. Cf. Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 
U.S. 339 (1960) (holding that a state may not impair the voting rights of 
minorities under the guise of reapportionment). Where such a political 
restructuring is aimed at a subject of particular interest to minorities and 
women, it is particularly problematic, and the Equal Protection Clause 
demands that it be subjected to heightened judicial scrutiny. "A law 
declaring that in general it shall be more difficult for one group of citizens 
than for all others to seek aid from the government is itself a denial of 
equal protection in the most literal sense." Romer v. Evans, 116 S. Ct. 
1620, 1628 (1996). 


For the reasons set forth above, the Court finds that plaintiffs have 
demonstrated a probablity of success on the merits of their equal 
protection claim. 


B.Likelihood of Success on Plaintiffs' Preemption Claims 


1.Introduction


Plaintiffs assert that Proposition 209 violates the Supremacy Clause of the 
United States Constitution by proscribing governmental entities from 
voluntarily employing race- and gender-conscious affirmative action as a 
remedy for the effects of past and present discrimination. Plaintiffs base 
their contention on the hypothesis that Congress intended to preserve 
voluntary affirmative action as a means to attain the goals embodied in 
three federal civil rights acts-Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964 and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.[FOOTNOTE 
36] By outlawing race- and gender-conscious affirmative action, plaintiffs 
argue, Proposition 209 conflicts and interferes with the objectives of the 
three federal civil rights acts. Consequently, plaintiffs conclude that 
Proposition 209 must be invalidated by the Supremacy Clause of the 
United States Constitution. 


Article VI of the United States Constitution states, in part, "[t]his 
Constitution and the Laws of the United States shall be the supreme Law 
of the Land." In general, preemption is not to be lightly presumed under 
the Supremacy Clause. California Federal Sav. and Loan Ass'n v. Guerra, 
479 U.S. 272, 281 (1987). Nevertheless, the Supremacy Clause has been 
interpreted to require preemption of state laws in certain 
circumstances.[FOOTNOTE 37] The Supreme Court has enunciated two 
basic doctrines of preemption: conflict preemption and field preemption. 


2.Preemption of State Law by Title VII 


a.Field Preemption


Plaintiffs raise no field preemption claim and Congress plainly did not 
intend to "fill the field" of employment antidiscrimination law when it 
enacted Title VII. 42 U.S.C. section 2000h-4 ("Nothing contained in any 
title of this Act shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of 
Congress to occupy the field in which any such title operates to the 
exclusion of state laws on the same subject matter "); See Guerra, 479 U.S. 
at 282.[FOOTNOTE 38] 


b.Conflict Preemption


Conflict preemption bars the application of any state law that contravenes 
federal law. This type of preemption occurs when an individual or entity 
cannot simultaneously conform to state and federal law. Florida Lime & 
Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U.S. 132, 142-143 (1963) When 
compliance with both federal and state law is impossible the state law 
must relent. California v. ARC America Corp., 490 U.S. 93, 100 (1989) 
(quoting Florida Lime, 373 U.S. at 142-143). 


State law is also preempted when it "stands as an obstacle to the 
accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of 
Congress." International Paper Co. v. Ouellette, 479 U.S. 481, 492 (1987) 
(quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67 (1941)). As under other 
forms of preemption, the ultimate touchstone of an obstacle preemption 
analysis is the Congressional purpose embodied in the federal legislation. 
Wisconsin Dept. of Industry, Labor and Human Relations v. Gould, Inc., 
475 U.S. 282, 290 (1986). Obstacle preemption, however, further requires 
a court to examine the methods Congress has chosen to achieve its 
purposes. To the extent a state law interferes with the manner in which 
Congress intended the federal law to operate, the state law is preempted-
even where the state and federal laws share common goals. Gade v. 
National Solid Wastes Management Ass'n., 505 U.S. 88, 103 
(1992).[FOOTNOTE 39] 


i.Actual Conflict Preemption


Plaintiffs contend that Proposition 209 is in actual conflict with Title VII. 
See Florida Lime, 373 U.S. at 142-143. To establish that an entity cannot 
simultaneously comply with both Title VII and Proposition 209, a plaintiff 
must demonstrate that some action required by Title VII simultaneously 
violates Proposition 209. Plaintiffs argue that, at times, voluntarily-
adopted race- or gender-conscious remedies are the sole means of 
compliance with Title VII, and therefore Proposition 209 must be 
preempted under Florida Lime. Plaintiffs sole citation regarding this 
supposition is the First Circuit's review of the Boston Police Department's 
consent decree under the standard enunciated in Croson. Stuart v. Roache, 
951 F.2d 446 (1st Cir. 1991). While Stuart presents a factual predicate that 
likely could have served as the basis for a successful Title VII action, it is 
by no means obvious that the development of an affirmative action plan 
was the only alternative available that would have allowed the police 
department to avoid liability. Cf. 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(j). 


Plaintiffs further argue that Proposition 209 is in actual conflict with Title 
VII because that an entity might not be able to comply simultaneously 
with Proposition 209 and a court order pursuant to Title VII that mandates 
a race- or gender-conscious remedy.[FOOTNOTE 40] Plaintiffs have not 
demonstrated that the "actual conflict" preemption doctrine of Florida 
Lime applies with equal force when an entity cannot concurrently obey the 
dictates of state law and a court order pursuant to a federal 
law.[FOOTNOTE 41] 


For the foregoing reasons the Court finds that plaintiffs have not 
demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that 
Proposition 209 actually conflicts with Title VII. 


ii.Obstacle Preemption


Plaintiffs further urge this Court to find that Proposition 209 runs afoul of 
the obstacle preemption doctrine because it interferes with the 
congressional purposes embodied in Title VII. Before this Court can find 
that Proposition 209 "stands as an obstacle" to the fulfillment of 
Congressional purposes, it must determine that one of those purposes was 
to preserve voluntary race- and gender-conscious affirmative action as an 
option for employers under Title VII. Merely showing that such 
affirmative action is permissible under Title VII is insufficient to support a 
finding of preemption. If Congress did not intend to preserve voluntary 
affirmative action as an option, and if such affirmative action is simply 
one of several equally effective means available to reach the goals of Title 
VII, banning voluntary affirmative action would not impede the realization 
of Congress' purpose. 


While plaintiffs must demonstrate more than the permissibility of 
voluntary race- and gender-conscious affirmative action, they need not, as 
defendants suggest, show that affirmative action is mandated by Title VII. 
Rather, demonstrating either that (1) the discretion to utilize voluntary 
affirmative action is necessary to achieve the objectives of Congress or (2) 
such affirmative action is a method Congress intended to preserve under 
Title VII is sufficient to establish that the prohibition of affirmative action 
would interfere with Congressional intent. 


The primary source of Congressional intent is the plain language of the 
statute. Unfortunately, the statutory language of Title VII fails to address 
whether Congress intended to preserve the option of utilizing voluntary 
race- and gender-conscious affirmative action. The sole reference to race- 
and gender-based preferences in Title VII simply indicates that Title VII 
should not be construed to require the adoption of preferences. 42 U.S.C. 
section 2000e-2(j) ("Nothing contained in this subchapter shall be 
interpreted to require any [entity] subject to this subchapter to grant 
preferential treatment to any individual or to any group because of the 
race, color, religion, sex, or national origin of such individual or group 
").[FOOTNOTE 42] 


Because Title VII is silent on the issue of Congress' intent regarding the 
role of voluntary race- and gender-conscious affirmative action under the 
Title VII schema, this Court must to turn to the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission's ("EEOC") interpretation of the statute. 
Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 
U.S. 837, 842-843 (1984) ("If the court determines Congress has not 
directly addressed the precise question at issue, the court does not simply 
impose its own construction on the statute the question for the court is 
whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the 
statute."). 


The EEOC Guideline explaining the role of voluntary affirmative action 
under Title VII states: "Voluntary affirmative action to improve 
opportunities for minorities and women must be encouraged and protected 
in order to carry out the Congressional intent embodied in title VII." 29 
C.F.R. 1608.1(c). The EEOC guideline recognizes that Congress intended, 
as one of its central objectives, to encourage voluntary compliance with 
the statute. "The principle of nondiscrimination in employment and the 
principle that each person subject to Title VII should take voluntary action 
to correct the effects of past discrimination without awaiting litigation, are 
mutually consistent and interdependent methods of addressing social and 
economic conditions which precipitated the enactment of Title VII." Id. 
The EEOC has thus concluded that permitting voluntary affirmative action 
is crucial if entities are to comply voluntarily with Title VII: "The 
importance of voluntary affirmative action on the part of employers is 
underscored by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Executive Order 
11246, and related laws and regulations-all of which emphasize voluntary 
action to achieve equal employment opportunity." 29 C.F.R. section 
1607.17(1). 


The EEOC guidelines, which were developed to clarify "uncertainty as to 
the meaning and application of Title VII, [which could] threaten the 
accomplishment of the clear Congressional intent to encourage affirmative 
action," 29 C.F.R. 1608.1(a), reveal that Congress intended to safeguard 
the discretion to employ voluntary race- and gender-conscious affirmative 
action as a means to allow "flexibility in modifying employment systems 
to comport with the purposes of Title VII." 29 C.F.R. 1608.1(c). 


A court must give substantial deference to all enforcing agency's 
reasonable explications of a statute. NationsBank of North Carolina, N.A. 
v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 115 S. Ct. 810, 813 (1995) ("'It is well 
settled that courts should give great weight to any reasonable construction 
of a regulatory statute adopted by the agency charged with enforcement of 
the statute."); Chevron, 467 U.S. at 845 (quoting U. S. v. Shimer, 367 U.S. 
374, 382 (1961)). Courts have not hesitated to show deference to agencies 
in the context of a preemption analysis. The Supreme Court, for example, 
in finding that a South Dakota statute was preempted by the federal 
Payment in Lieu of Taxes Act, gave "substantial deference" to the 
Department of Interior's construction of the federal statute. Lawrence 
County v. Lead-Deadwood School Dist., 469 U.S. 256 (1985); See also 
Retirement Fund Trust of Plumbing v. Franchise Tax Bd., 909 F.2d 1266, 
1284-1286 (9th Cir. 1990) (court places significant reliance on Treasury 
Department's interpretation of ERISA to find that federal law does not 
preempt California Employment Development Department's withholding 
procedure); California Hosp. Ass'n v. Henning, 770 F.2d 856 (9th Cir. 
1985) (modified, 783 F.2d 946 (9th Cir. 1986)) (relying on Department of 
Labor's regulation clarifying Congress' intentions in adopting ERISA, 
court finds that California statute not preempted.); cf. Southern Pacific 
Transp. Co. v. Public Service Com'n of Nevada, 909 F.2d 352, 356 (9th 
Cir. 1990) (appellate court reverses district court's preemption analysis 
because "district court failed to accord sufficient deference to the 
Department of Transportation's construction of its own regulations"). 


The Supreme Court has generally given the same level of deference to the 
EEOC's interpretations of Title VII as it gives to other agency 
interpretations of statutes they are charged with enforcing. For example, in 
Oscar Mayer & Co. v. Evans, 441 U.S. 750, 761 (1979), the Supreme 
Court stated that the EEOC guidelines are entitled to "great deference." 
See also Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 431 (1975); 
Espinoza v. Farah Mfg. Co., Inc., 414 U.S. 86, 94 (1973); Griggs v. Duke 
Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 433-434 (1971)). Those holdings were 
reaffirmed in E.E.O.C. v. Commercial Office Products Co., 486 U.S. 107, 
115 (1988) ("It is axiomatic that the EEOC's interpretation of Title VII, for 
which it has primary enforcement responsibility, need not be the best one 
by grammatical or any other standards [it] need only be reasonable to be 
entitled to deference.") (emphasis added).[FOOTNOTE 42] 


As explained below, the EEOC conclusion that Congress intended to 
preserve the option to utilize race- and gender-conscious affirmative action 
under Title VII surpasses the standard of reasonableness.[FOOTNOTE 43] 
See, e.g., Local No. 93, Intern. Ass'n of Firefighters, AFL-CIO C.L.C. v. 
City of Cleveland, 478 U.S. at 516. 


The EEOC's conclusion is based on a two-tiered rationale: (1) Congress 
intended voluntary compliance to be a purpose of Title VII, and (2) that 
the preservation of voluntary affirmative action is central to that 
compliance. The EEOC rationale is consistent with court decisions that 
have found that permitting voluntary compliance is integral to the 
purposes of Title VII. Local No. 93, 478 U.S. at 515 ("Congress intended 
voluntary compliance to be the preferred means of achieving the 
objectives of Title VII."); Weber, 443 U.S. at 204 ("The very statutory 
words [were] intended as a spur or catalyst to cause 'employers and unions 
to self-examine and to self-evaluate their employment practices and to 
endeavor to eliminate, so far as possible, the last vestiges of an unfortunate 
and ignominious page in this country's history.'"). 


The EEOC's corollary finding that voluntary affirmative action is not 
merely permissible, but essential to allow voluntary compliance is also 
buttressed by Supreme Court interpretation of Title VII. According to the 
Supreme Court, "the imposition of a requirement that public employers 
make findings that they have engaged in illegal discrimination before they 
engage in affirmative action programs would severely undermine public 
employers' incentive to meet voluntarily their civil rights obligations . This 
result would clearly be at odds with this Court's and Congress' consistent 
emphasis on 'the value of voluntary efforts to further the objectives of the 
law.'" Wygant, 476 U.S. at 290 (O'Connor, J., concurring); accord Local 
93, 478 U.S. at 516 (quoting EEOC guideline that states voluntary 
affirmative action must be "encouraged and protected" in the context of a 
finding that "Congress intended voluntary compliance to be the preferred 
means of achieving the objectives of Title VII"). 


In sum, the EEOC Guidelines explicitly state that Congress intended to 
"encourage and protect" voluntary affirmative action as a method to 
achieve the objectives of Title VII. It is manifest from the Guidelines and 
the jurisprudence supporting their rationale that Congress meant to 
preserve the option to comply voluntarily with Title VII and that the 
capacity to utilize race- and gender-conscious affirmative action is 
fundamental to maintaining the potential of voluntary compliance. The 
EEOC's interpretation of Title VII compels this Court to find that 
Congress intended to preserve discretion for employers to utilize voluntary 
affirmative action.[FOOTNOTE 44] 


The Defendant-Intervenors argue that even if Congress intended to 
preserve the discretion to use race- and gender-conscious affirmative 
action under Title VII, Proposition 209 merely reflects California's 
decision not to exercise that discretion. The plain language of Title VII 
and the rationales behind voluntary affirmative action's role under the 
statute, however, necessitate the conclusion that Congress intended that 
the discretion to use race- and gender-conscious preferences be exercised 
employer level. 


Congress created the alternative to use voluntary affirmative action as a 
method of voluntary compliance with Title VII that would not engender 
further liability. As noted on several occasions by the Supreme Court, 
Title VII could potentially have put employers in the untenable position 
between Title VII liability for past acts of discrimination and Title VII 
liability for future preferences to remedy discrimination. See, e.g., 
Wygant, 476 U.S. at 291 (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("[P]ublic employers 
are trapped between the competing hazards of liability to minorities if 
affirmative action is not taken to remedy apparent employment 
discrimination and liability to nonminorities if affirmative action is 
taken."); Weber, 443 U.S. at 210 (Blackmun, J., concurring) ("If Title VII 
is read literally, on the one hand [employers] face liability for past 
discrimination against blacks, and on the other they face liability to whites 
for any voluntary preferences adopted to mitigate the effects of prior 
discrimination against blacks."). 


While the plain language of Title VII places employers between these 
equally perilous alternatives, voluntary affirmative action affords a safe 
passage. See Johnson, 480 U.S. at 645 (Stevens, J., concurring) ("The 
logic of antidiscrimination legislation requires that judicial constructions 
of Title VII leave 'breathing room' for employer initiatives to benefit 
members of minority groups."). It follows that Congress intended the 
persons or entities potentially liable under Title VII to be entrusted with 
the power to avail themselves of the safe passage provided by voluntary 
affirmative action.[FOOTNOTE 45] 


This conclusion is supported by the legislative history of Title VII. When 
enacting Title VII, Congress chose neither to mandate nor prohibit the use 
of affirmative action; instead it decided to leave determinations regarding 
the appropriateness of affirmative action to persons making the day-to-day 
employment decisions. "[T]he problems raised by these controversial 
questions [surrounding preferential treatment and quotas in employment] 
are more properly handled at a governmental level closer to the American 
people and by communities and individuals themselves." Weber, 443 U.S. 
at 207 n.7 (quoting 110 Cong. Rec. 15893 (1964)); Local 93, 478 U.S. at 
520 (quoting H.R. Rep. No 914, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2, p. 29 (1962)) 
(noting that key support for Title VII was only obtained after it was 
apparent that "management prerogatives, and union freedoms [were] to be 
left undisturbed to the greatest extent possible").[FOOTNOTE 46] 


The State of California is not subject to employer liability under Title VII 
for all past and present discriminatory actions taken against all state, local, 
and municipal public employees in the state nor does the State of 
California make the day-to-day decisions regarding the public employees 
in California. As a result, Congress could not have intended that the State 
of California would be the appropriate body to exercise, on behalf of every 
individual public employer in California, the discretion to use voluntary 
race- and gender-conscious affirmative action. 


c.Conclusion


In light of the EEOC Guideline and supporting case law, we conclude that 
Congress intended to protect employers' discretion to utilize race- and 
gender-conscious affirmative action as a method of complying with their 
obligations under Title VII. Proposition 209, by eliminating the discretion 
to utilize race- and gender-conscious affirmative action, contravenes this 
Congressional purpose. Further, Congress intended to allow employers to 
use affirmative action as a safe passage to compliance with Title VII. 
Proposition 209 obstructs the passageway and forces many employers into 
a place akin to the Strait of Messina where they confront the Scylla of 
Title VII and Charybdis of Proposition 209. Proposition 209, therefore, 
also contravenes Congress' intent regarding the use of affirmative action as 
a method to achieve the goals of Title VII. 


For these reasons, this Court finds that plaintiffs have demonstrated a 
likelihood of prevailing on the theory that Proposition 209 violates the 
Supremacy Clause under the doctrine of obstacle 
preemption.[FOOTNOTE 47] 


3.Preemption of State Law by Titles VI and IX 


Plaintiffs further contend that Proposition 209 violates the Supremacy 
Clause by interfering with the purposes and methods of Titles VI and IX. 
In order to establish a likelihood of prevailing on this theory, plaintiffs 
must show, just as they must show in the Title VII context, that Congress 
intended to accord voluntary race- and gender-conscious affirmative action 
a hallowed position within the structure of Titles VI and IX. 


As in the Title VII context, nothing on the face of Titles VI or IX indicates 
that Congress intended to maintain voluntary affirmative action under the 
two statutes.[FOOTNOTE 48] As noted above, where a statute is silent, a 
court must look for guidance from the agencies charged with enforcing the 
statute. Agency interpretations of Titles VI and IX have addressed some 
aspects of affirmative action, but have not reached the question of whether 
Congress intended the statutes to preserve the option of using voluntary 
affirmative action. 


Agency regulations, on the one hand, state that in some instances, Title VI 
and IX regulations require the use of affirmative action, "[i]n 
administering a program which the recipient has previously discriminated 
against persons the recipient must take affirmative action to overcome the 
effects of prior discrimination." 34 C.F.R 100.3(b)(6); 34 C.F.R. 106.3(a) 
("[i]f the Assistant Secretary finds that a recipient has discriminated 
against persons on the basis of sex such recipient shall take such remedial 
action as the Assistant Secretary deems necessary to overcome the effects 
of such discrimination."). 


A showing that affirmative action is, at times, required under Title VI and 
IX cannot support a finding of preemption. Failure to comply with Titles 
VI and IX generally results in a cessation of federal funds. Consequently, 
affirmative action that is required by Titles VI and IX is permissible under 
Proposition 209. Cal. Const. art. 1, section 31(e) ("Nothing in this section 
shall be interpreted as prohibiting action which must be taken to establish 
or maintain eligibility for any federal program, where ineligibility would 
result in a loss of federal funds to the state."). Because Proposition 209 
allows required actions under Titles VI and IX no conflict could transpire 
between actions required by the statutes and Proposition 209. 


The regulations interpreting Title VI and IX also discuss the permissive 
use of affirmative action. "Even in absence of such prior discrimination, a 
recipient in administering a program may take affirmative action to 
overcome the effects of conditions which resulted in limiting participation 
by persons of a particular race, color, or national origin." 34 C.F.R. 
100.3(b)(6)(ii); 34 C.F.R. 106.3(b) ("[i]n the absence of a finding of 
discrimination on the basis of sex a recipient may take affirmative actions 
to overcome the effect of conditions which resulted in limited participation 
therein by persons of a particular sex."). 


The mere fact that affirmative action is permissible under the Title VI and 
IX regulations, and some judicial interpretation, does not require 
preemption of a state law that prohibits affirmative action. Simply 
obstructing an action that is allowed under federal law does not, in itself, 
raise preemption concerns unless there is some showing that the action is 
necessary to fulfilling the purposes of the federal law. The plain language 
and agency interpretations of Titles VI and IX do not establish that any 
Congressional purposes are thwarted by Proposition 209. 


Recognizing the shortcomings of the typical sources of Congressional 
intent regarding the role of voluntary affirmative action under Titles VI 
and IX, plaintiffs attempt to employ interpretations of Title VII as a means 
to elucidate the legislative intent behind Titles VI and IX. It is apparent, 
however, that the intent and purposes of Titles VI and IX, which must be 
the central focus for preemption purposes, are not identical to those of 
Title VII. When Title VI was passed, "Congress was legislating to assure 
federal funds would not be used in an improper manner. Title VII, by 
contrast, was enacted pursuant to the commerce power . Title VII and Title 
VI, therefore, cannot be read in pari materia" in all contexts. Weber, 443 
U.S. at 206 n.6. Likewise, Title IX was enacted under Congress' spending 
power and also cannot be read as precisely parallel to Title 
VII.[FOOTNOTE 49] 


It is especially clear that plaintiffs cannot rely on Title VII to establish 
Congress' intent regarding Titles VI and IX in the context of affirmative 
action. The Supreme Court has already noted that Congress had differing 
intentions for what constitutes permissible affirmative action under the 
three statutes: "[W]e do not regard as identical the constraints of Title VII 
and the Federal Constitution on voluntarily adopted affirmative action 
plans." Johnson, 480 U.S. at 632. Meanwhile, the constraints of Title VI 
parallel those established by the Constitution. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 285. 
Further, unlike under the Title VI paradigm, the standard for what 
constitutes permissible affirmative action under Title IX cannot be based 
on current Constitutional limitations.[FOOTNOTE 50] 


The statutory language, agency interpretation, and legislative history of 
Titles VI and IX do not establish that Congress intended to preserve 
voluntary race- and gender-conscious affirmative action as an option for 
entities covered by the two statutes. It is apparent, moreover, that plaintiffs 
cannot rely on the methods Congress chose to effectuate Title VII to 
establish that Proposition 209 is preempted by Titles VI and IX. 
Consequently, plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate to the Court a 
likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that Proposition 209 
violates the Supremacy Clause because it stands as an obstacle to the 
methods Congress intended entities to employ in furthering the purposes 
of Titles VI and IX. 

C.Irreparable Injury


As noted above, plaintiffs have demonstrated a probability of success on 
the merits of their equal protection claim. They have also demonstrated a 
likelihood of success on one of their preemption claims. Although some 
courts have held that this showing sufficiently demonstrates a possibility 
of irreparable harm, see, e.g., Bery v. City of New York, 97 F.3d 689, 693-
94 (2d Cir. 1996), the Court will separately address this issue, focusing 
both on the irreparability and the immediacy of the harm alleged by 
plaintiffs. 


Where the deprivation of a constitutional right is involved, courts 
generally hold that no further showing of irreparability is required. See 
Associated Gen. Contractors, 950 F.2d at 1412; 11A Wright & Miller, 
Federal Practice and Procedure section 2948.1. The Court is satisfied, at 
least with respect to plaintiffs' equal protection claim, that the deprivation 
of a constitutional right-"the right to full participation in the political life 
of the community"-is squarely at issue in the present case. Seattle, 458 
U.S. at 467. To the extent Proposition 209 imposes a new and substantial 
political burden on those, and only those, who support race- and gender-
conscious affirmative action, it inflicts an immediate and ongoing injury 
that is not amenable to monetary remedy. The very real threat that the 
enforcement and implementation of Proposition 209 may lead to the 
dismantling of existing, otherwise constitutional, affirmative action 
programs also constitutes an irreparable harm to members of the plaintiff 
class. 


Turning to the imminence of the alleged injury, the Court is also satisfied 
that plaintiffs have shown that injury to members of the plaintiff class is 
not only possible, but almost certain, in the absence of a preliminary 
injunction. Proposition 209 is self-executing, and thus immediately 
binding on all state and local governmental units. The defendant class 
representatives, Governor Wilson and Attorney General Lungren, have, for 
their part, made plain their intention to implement Proposition 209 as 
expeditiously as possible, and have taken a number of preliminary steps to 
that end. The University of California system has also indicated its 
intention, in the absence of a preliminary injunction, to implement 
Proposition 209 immediately. Other members of the defendant class have 
also announced their intention, in the absence of an injunction, to modify 
their activities in accordance with Proposition 209. In addition, a number 
of private suits have been brought against defendant class members in 
state court challenging existing affirmative action programs, including 
suits brought by Governor Wilson and defendant-intervenor CADP. 
Perhaps most importantly, the Court notes that the core equal protection 
injury identified by plaintiffs-impaired access to the political process at all 
levels of state and local government-would, in the absence of a 
preliminary injunction, be felt by the plaintiff class immediately. 


The balance of hardships, moreover, tips decidedly in plaintiffs' favor. In 
contrast to the injury outlined above, a preliminary injunction would 
impose little hardship on members of the defendant class, who would 
merely be required to suspend their Proposition 209 implementation plans 
pending trial.[FOOTNOTE 51] 


The public interest also favors the entry of a preliminary injunction. As an 
initial matter, a number of named defendants have urged this Court to act 
swiftly and give clear guidance with respect to Proposition 209. This 
request, of course, is neutral with respect to the granting or denial of the 
present motion. Nonetheless, the Court believes the preservation of the 
pre-election status quo not only serves the public need for plain guidance, 
but also harmonizes that interest with the compelling interest in remedying 
discrimination that underlies existing constitutionally-permissible state-
sponsored affirmative action programs threatened by Proposition 209. 


VI.CONCLUSION


Based on the foregoing Findings and Conclusions, this Court rules that: 


(1) Plaintiffs have standing to bring this action. 


(2) Plaintiffs have demonstrated a probability of success on their claim 
that Proposition 209 violates the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection 
guarantee to full participation in the political life of the community. 


(3) Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on their 
claim that Proposition 209 violates the Supremacy Clause because it 
conflicts with, and thus is preempted by, Titles VI and IX of the 1964 
Civil Rights Act. (4) Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success 
on their claim that Proposition 209 violates the Supremacy Clause because 
it conflicts with, and thus is preempted by, Title VII of the 1964 Civil 
Rights Act. 


(5) Plaintiffs have demonstrated that a preliminary injunction is necessary 
to protect the plaintiff class from the possibility of irreparable injury. 


Accordingly, and good cause appearing, it is HEREBY ORDERED 
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65 that defendants Governor Pete Wilson and 
Attorney General Dan Lungren and all members of the defendant class 
that they represent, and their officers, agents, servants, employees and 
attorneys, and those in active concert or participation with them, are 
restrained and enjoined, pending trial or final judgment in this action, from 
implementing or enforcing Proposition 209 insofar as said amendment to 
the Constitution of the State of California purports to prohibit or affect 
affirmative action programs in public employment, public education or 
public contracting. 


The aforesaid preliminary injunction shall not preclude the following: 


1. all defendants, including members of the defendant class, from 
identifying, reviewing and analyzing existing affirmative action 
programs.[FOOTNOTE 52] 


2. all defendants, including members of the defendant class, from 
defending private actions seeking remedies under Article 1, section 31 of 
the California Constitution. 


3. proceedings in pending state court actions related to Article 1, section 
31, including, Wilson v. State Personnel Bd., Sacramento County Superior 
Court No. 96 CS01082 and Californians Against Discrimination and 
Preferences, Inc. v. The Bd. of Governors of the Calif. Community 
Colleges, Sacramento County Superior Court, No. 96 CS03010, and 


4. the California Attorney General from defending Article 1, section 31 in 
any legal proceeding challenging its validity under the United States 
Constitution.[FOOTNOTE 53] 


:::::::::::::::::::: FOOTNOTES :::::::::::::::::::: 


FN1. For the sake of brevity, the Court will use the term "race" to cover all 
of the categories identified in Proposition 209 other than sex. 


FN2. The Fourteenth Amendment and   7(a) of the California Constitution 
both provide that no person may be denied "the equal protection of the 
laws." Titles VI and VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.   2000d-e 
et seq. prohibit, respectively, discrimination in any project or activity 
receiving federal financial assistance on the basis of race, and in 
employment on the basis of race and sex. As the ballot argument in favor 
of Proposition 209 noted, the initiative "restates the historic Civil Rights 
Act." Pls. Exh. 2. 



FN3. The city of San Francisco, for example, adopted a race- and gender-
conscious affirmative action program after finding that it was necessary to 
counter established discriminatory practices, including "old boy 
networks," that prevented minority and women contractors from obtaining 
city contracts. Associated Gen. Contractors of Calif. v. Coalition for 
Economic Equity, 950 F.2d 1401, 1413-18 (9th Cir. 1991). 


FN4. We note that while the exact relationship between the terms 
"affirmative action" and "preferences" has yet to be determined, the 
following is clear. First, the term "preferences" includes, at a minimum, 
programs or policies that use racial or gender classifications. Second, the 
term "affirmative action" is generally understood to include, at a 
minimum, programs designed to remedy the continuing effects of past 
and/or present discrimination which contain a race- or gender-conscious 
component. The term "affirmative action" as used in this decision is 
intended to refer to such programs. However, to ensure clarity on this 
point, and because the term "affirmative action" may be used in other 
contexts to refer to programs that are not race- or gender-conscious, the 
Court will generally use the longer, but more precise, phrase "race- and 
gender-conscious affirmative action" to refer to programs affected by 
Proposition 209. 


FN5. Pursuant to this Court's Order of November 25, 1996, plaintiffs 
represent a class of all persons or entities who, on account of race, sex, 
color, ethnicity, or national origin, are or will be adversely affected by 
Proposition 209's prohibition of affirmative action programs operated by 
the State of California, any state or municipal agency, or any other 
political subdivision or governmental instrumentality of the State of 
California. The plaintiff class is represented by named plaintiffs Coalition 
for Economic Equity, California NAACP, Northern California NAACP, 
California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, Council of Asian American 
Business Associations, California Chinese American Citizens' Alliance, 
California Chapter of the Women Construction Business Owners and 
Executives, United Minority Business Entrepreneurs, Chinese For 
Affirmative Action, Black Advocates in State Service, Asian Pacific 
American Labor Alliance, La Voz Chicana, Black Chamber of Commerce 
of California, and several named individuals. 


FN6. Pursuant to this Court's Order of December 16, 1996, defendants 
represent a class of all state officials, local government entities or other 
governmental instrumentalities bound by Proposition 209. The defendant 
class is represented by named defendants Governor Pete Wilson and 
Attorney General Daniel Lungren. 


FN7. Section 3.5 of Article 3 of the California Constitution provides that 
an administrative agency is without power to declare a statute 
unconstitutional unless an appellate court has first made a determination 
that the statute is unconstitutional. Thus, state agencies may not declare a 
state statute invalid under Proposition 209, or otherwise refuse to enforce a 
state statute based on Proposition 209, absent a state appellate court ruling 
that the statute is unconstitutional. 


FN8. At the outset, this Court must address defendants' contention that 
these proceedings should be stayed under the "Pullman abstention" 
doctrine. Railroad Comm'n of Tex. v. Pullman, 312 U.S. 496 (1941). After 
having carefully reviewed the circumstances that defendants have 
forwarded in support of their request for abstention, this Court chooses not 
to abstain. Defendants have not presented an interpretation of challenged 
state law that this Court, in its discretion, believes warrants abstention. 
This Court, however, will revisit this area and consider all subsequent 
developments and arguments when it considers defendants' regularly 
noticed motion to abstain scheduled for January 6, 1997. 


FN9. The Legislative Analyst is required, pursuant to the California 
Elections Code, to prepare a "concise summary" of the general meaning of 
each initiative as well as an analysis. Cal. Elec. Code    9085-86. 



FN10. In formulating this description, the LAO extensively reviewed 
materials pertaining to Proposition 209, including "documents from 
proponents and opponents, journal articles, media coverage, legislative 
hearings, numerous conversations with proponents, opponents, 
government officials and other experts." Pls. Exh. 2, Taylor Decl.   2. 



FN11. Ward Connerly, co-signer of this ballot argument, also made it 
clear in his public statements that Proposition 209 was intended to end 
affirmative action programs. In March 1996, for example, Connerly 
explained to reporters why he had decided against trying to end racial 
preferences in the University of California's ("UC") outreach programs for 
high school students and financial aid criteria: "Connerly said Wednesday 
that UC had already been torn apart by his successful push last summer to 
end racial preferences in admissions and hiring, and that affirmative action 
programs in California schools would most likely be banned anyway by 
[Proposition 209]. 'What do I gain by going ahead and forcing a 
showdown  [?] The public's going to end affirmative action in November.'" 
Pls. Exh. 4. Governor Wilson, another co-signor of the ballot initiative, 
also told reporters in March of 1995 that although the California 
Legislature was unwilling to "confront the issue of reverse discrimination 
arising from affirmative action programs the people of California will get 
that opportunity at the ballot box." Id. 


FN12. The racial and gender breakdown of the vote was as follows: 
VOTER YES(%)NO(%) Male     61%     39% Female  48%      52% 


White   63%      37%
Black   26%      74%
Latino  24%      76%
Asian   39%      61%


Pinkus Decl. and attachment. As the above reflects, none of the above 
groups voted entirely for or against Proposition 209. However, "White 
voters were the only racial or ethnic group supporting 209." Id. 


FN13. Prior to the November election, Governor Wilson filed suit in 
Sacramento Superior Court (96-CS01082) against state agencies 
challenging the constitutionality of certain affirmative action programs. 
After the election, Governor Wilson promptly moved to amend his suit to 
include Proposition 209 as a basis for invalidating the challenged 
programs. On November 14, 1996, the California Court of Appeal ruled 
that the amendment could not be made pending resolution of a writ 
petition on a judicial disqualification order. However, Governor Wilson 
intends to add a Proposition 209 claim to the case "at the earliest available 
opportunity." Defendants' Supplemental Memorandum in Opposition to 
Motion for Preliminary Injunction at 5 n.2. 


FN14. We also note that on November 25, 1996, the Governor and 
Attorney General both declined to agree to a moratorium on actions to 
enforce Proposition 209 pending further proceedings in this case. See 
Order Re Temporary Restraining Order, November 27, 1996, at 6. 


FN15. Given the self-executing nature of Proposition 209, all other 
members of the defendant class are also required to implement Proposition 
209 immediately. See Cal. Const. art. 1,   31(h). 



FN16. The record in this case includes references to a range of affirmative 
action programs currently in effect in California. Some of these programs 
have been subjected to judicial challenge and found to be constitutionally 
permissible. See, e.g., Assoc. General Contractors v. Coalition for Econ. 
Equity, 748 F. Supp. 1443 (N.D. Cal. 1990), aff'd, 950 F.2d 1401 (9th Cir. 
1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 985 (1992). Others have never been 
challenged. With respect to these latter programs, the Court does not, of 
course, make any judgment with respect to their constitutionality. 


FN17. State civil service affirmative action programs "encourage some 
consideration of race, ethnicity and gender in hiring qualified civil service 
applicants and in choosing private firms to handle contracts for state 
services." California Senate Office of Research, The Status of Affirmative 
Action in California (1995), Pls. Exh. 5 at 2. 


FN18. An analysis of the estimated effects of Proposition 209 on 
enrollments at just the U.C. Berkeley campus showed similar results. 
Specifically, it estimated that African American enrollment would drop 
from 222 (6.5%) in the 1995 class to 85-119 (2.5 - 3.5%) in the 1998 
class; Latino enrollment would drop from 531 (15.6%) to 205 - 287 (6 - 
8.4%); Native American enrollment would drop from 63 (1.8%) to 20 - 28 
(.6 - .8%), Asian American enrollment would increase from 1268 (37.2%) 
to 1516 - 1582 (44.5 - 46.4%), and White enrollment would increase from 
1,018 (29.9%) to 1116 - 1164 (32.8 - 34.2%). Pls. Exh. 13. 


FN19. This would include, for example, constituents seeking preferential 
treatment for veterans or the disabled in employment, for local businesses 
in contracting, or for athletes, artists or California residents in admissions 
to public schools. 


FN20. Defendants have not questioned the substantial evidence before the 
Court showing that women and minorities continue to face the effects of 
past and present discrimination and thus will continue to have an interest 
in using the political process to seek remedial action through affirmative 
action programs. 


FN21. The referendum at issue in Hunter also burdened the interests of 
religious minorities, see 393 U.S. at 386, but the Supreme Court's analysis 
of   137 focused primarily on its racial component, see id. at 391. 



FN22. Defendants' very argument, moreover, was before the Supreme 
Court in Seattle. As Justice Powell points out in his Seattle dissent, 458 
U.S. at 491 n.5, Judge Wright, dissenting in the Ninth Circuit opinion in 
Seattle, concluded that "Initiative 350 does not treat persons differently on 
the basis of race." Seattle Sch. Dist. No.1 v. Washington, 633 F.2d 1338, 
1351 (9th Cir. 1980) (Wright, J., dissenting). This conclusion did not win 
the approval of the Supreme Court, however, which affirmed the Ninth 
Circuit majority. 


FN23. The Court also notes that the defendants have not cited any 
authority addressing whether men suffer an equal protection injury of the 
sort set forth in Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2114, when a governmental body 
adopts a gender-conscious affirmative action program. 


FN24. The Court also notes that the language of Proposition 209 itself 
undermines defendants' proposed "zero-sum" distinction. Defendants urge 
that Seattle ought not apply where the challenged measure interferes only 
with "zero-sum" antidiscrimination efforts. By its terms, however, 
Proposition 209 prohibits all race and gender preferences, not merely those 
that operate in a "zero-sum" fashion. Consequently, Proposition 209's 
reach may extend beyond mere "zero-sum" antidiscrimination efforts. Put 
another way, Proposition 209 itself appears to be oblivious to the very 
distinction urged by defendants on its behalf. 


FN25. Counsel for defendants at oral argument suggested that, to the 
extent the present Supreme Court might not embrace the rationale of 
Seattle and Hunter, this Court is not bound by those opinions. The Court 
does not so interpret the law, and thus declines to adopt defendants' 
argument. It is not for this Court to decide whether the Supreme Court 
might overturn its previous rulings. See Rodriguez de Quijas v. 
Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989) (lower court 
must follow Supreme Court precedent until it is overturned). 


FN26. Counsel for defendant-intervenor CADP suggested at oral argument 
that there may be municipal programs granting preferences to certain 
ethnic groups that might be barred by Proposition 209. Aside from 
counsel's oral representation, however, the Court has nothing on the record 
from which to conclude that Proposition 209 has a substantial impact 
beyond the race- and gender-conscious affirmative action context. 


FN27. In so finding, the Court does not pass on whether any 
discriminatory intent lay behind the adoption of Proposition 209. The 
Supreme Court in Seattle made it plain that such an inquiry is not required 
under the Seattle-Hunter analysis. 458 U.S. at 484-86. The Court 
nevertheless notes that the Supreme Court in Seattle also suggested that 
any measure that ran afoul of the Seattle-Hunter analysis "inevitably raises 
dangers of impermissible motivation." Id. at 486 n.30. 


FN28. The MWBE Ordinance is codified at San Francisco Administrative 
Code   12D and has been the subject of extensive litigation in this Court. 
See, e.g., F.W. Spencer & Son, Inc. v. City and County of San Francisco, 
C 95-4242 TEH; Associated Gen. Contractors v. City and County of San 
Francisco, 748 F. Supp. 1443 (N.D. Cal. 1990), aff'd, 950 F.2d 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 985 (1992). 



FN29. As CADP notes, the Equal Protection Clause itself imposes a 
considerable burden on governmental entities seeking to adopte race- and 
gender-conscious affirmative action programs, and thus indirectly places a 
considerable burden on organizations like the Coalition that lobby for such 
programs. See Associated Gen. Contractors, 950 F.2d at 1413-18 (after 
examining San Francisco's MWBE Ordinance using exacting equal 
protection scrutiny, holding that the ordinance does not offend the 14th 
Amendment). What the Equal Protection Clause does not do, however, is 
force organizations like the Coalition to take their petition to "a new and 
remote" level of government, as does Proposition 209. 


FN30. San Francisco admits that legal challenges to its MWBE Ordinance 
based on Proposition 209 are imminent. The Court expresses no opinion 
on the merits of such a claim, should it ultimately be pressed by a party to 
this or any other suit. 


FN31. The Court takes judicial notice of these figures. See San Francisco 
Elections Commission election summary, available at 
http://www.ci.sf.ca.us/election/update.htm. 


FN32. A number of such voluntarily adopted desegregation programs, in 
fact, may well be threatened by Proposition 209. See Pls. Exh. 8 (Los 
Angeles Unified School District, Fingertip Facts: Student Integration 
Services, 1995-96, Reference Guide No. 10 (Rev.)). 


FN33. The Supreme Court has never squarely decided whether 
classifications based on gender are inherently suspect and thus deserving 
of strict scrutiny review. The rule drawn from the cases is that gender 
classifications must survive at least intermediate scrutiny. See United 
States v. Virginia, 116 S. Ct. 2264, 2275 (1996) (gender classifications 
must clear "at least" intermediate scrutiny); J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., 
114 S. Ct. 1419, 1425 n.6 (1994) (Court "need not decide whether 
classifications based on gender are inherently suspect"); Harris v. Forklift 
Systems, Inc., 114 S. Ct. 367, 373 (1993) (Ginsburg, J., concurring) 
(noting that "it remains an open question whether classifications based on 
gender are inherently suspect") (citations and internal quotes omitted). 
Because Proposition 209 fails to survive intermediate scrutiny, this Court 
need not decide whether gender classifications are inherently suspect. 


FN34. Other courts have suggested that Seattle and Hunter can be 
explained as cases involving the fundamental right of all citizens to 
participate equally in the political process. See, e.g., Evans v. Romer, 854 
P.2d 1270, 1279-82 (Colo. 1993), aff'd on other grounds, 116 S. Ct. 1620 
(1996). On this theory, any law that infringed this fundamental right would 
be subject to strict scrutiny, regardless of the race or gender focus of the 
enactment. This Court's application of intermediate scrutiny to the gender 
classification inherent in Proposition 209 is not meant as a rejection of the 
fundamental rights approach. Rather, because the parties have not argued 
this issue, the Court expressly declines to pass on the merits of this theory. 


FN35. The University of California, for example, has acted on its own 
accord to discontinue the use of race and gender preferences in 
admissions, contracting, and employment decisions. Pls. Exh. 11 
(discussing Regents Resolutions SP-1 and SP-2). Governor Wilson has 
also issued an executive order repealing race- and gender-conscious 
affirmative action programs under his immediate control. Defendants' 
Request for Judicial Notice, Exh. 2 (Executive Order W-124-95, June 1, 
1995). 


FN36. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on 
the basis of race, color, or national origin in any program or activity 
receiving federal financial assistance. 42 U.S.C.   2000d et seq. Title VII 
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination on 
the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. 42 U.S.C.   2000e 
et seq. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits 
discrimination on the basis of sex in any education program or activity 
receiving federal financial assistance. 20 U.S.C.   1681. 



FN37. Here, the state law being challenged under the Supremacy Clause is 
an amendment to the California Constitution, the most puissant of state 
laws; that fact however is irrelevant in a preemption analysis. Under the 
Supremacy Clause, "[t]he relative importance to the State of its own law is 
not material when there is a conflict with federal law .[a]ny state law, 
however clearly within a State's acknowledged power, which interferes 
with or is contrary to federal law, must yield." Free v. Bland, 369 U.S. 
663, 666 (1962). 


FN38. The doctrine of field preemption commands that a state law yield 
when it operates in an area where the "'scheme of federal regulation [is] so 
pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room 
for the States to supplement it,' or where an Act of Congress 'touch[es] a 
field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system 
will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same 
subject.'" English v. General Electric Co., 469 U.S. 72, 79 (1990) (quoting 
Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947)). 


FN39. The Court notes that many of the cases employing obstacle 
preemption involve federal laws in areas where Congress has so fully 
regulated that the courts could nearly conclude that Congress left no room 
for states to legislate. See, e.g., Gade, 505 U.S. at 104, n.2 ("Although we 
have chosen to use the term 'conflict' preemption, we could as easily have 
stated that the promulgation of a federal safety and health standard 'pre-
empts the field '"); Hines, 312 U.S. at 66 ("[F]ederal government, in the 
exercise of its superior authority in [the field of regulation of aliens] has 
enacted a complete scheme of regulation "); Gould, 475 U.S. at 286 ("It is 
now commonplace that in passing the NLRA Congress largely displaced 
state regulation of industrial relations."). It is apparent, however, that the 
application of obstacle preemption is not limited to circumstances where 
Congress has nearly filled the field. The Supreme Court has employed this 
form of preemption in fields where states are explicitly permitted to 
legislate. See, e.g., Michigan Canners and Freezers Ass'n., Inc. v. 
Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Bd., 467 U.S. 461, 469 (1984) 
(Michigan Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Act preempted by 
Agricultural Fair Practices Act (AFPA), despite the fact that AFPA 
reflects no congressional intent to occupy the field); Felder v. Casey, 487 
U.S. 131 (1988) (Wisconsin notice-of-claim statute interferes with the 
purpose of Congress in enacting   1983); Lawrence County v. Lead-
Deadwood School Dist., 469 U.S. 256 (1985) (Payment in Lieu of Taxes 
Act preempts South Dakota statute which obstructs congressional 
purpose). 



FN40. Subdivision (d) of Proposition 209 permits race- and gender-
conscious affirmative action pursuant to court orders and consent decrees 
predating the enactment of Proposition 209, but makes no exception for 
orders or consent decrees entered after the Proposition 209 effective date. 
Cal. Const. art. 1,   31(d) ("Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as 
invalidating any court order or consent decree which is in force as of the 
effective date of this section."). 



FN41. The Court's preliminary investigation of actual conflict preemption 
cases only reveals factual circumstances where an entity was trapped 
between a state and a federal law. No cases discussed the application of 
actual conflict preemption where an entity was unable to comply 
simultaneously with a state law and a remedy imposed by a court pursuant 
to a federal law. See, e.g., Hook v. State of Ariz., 907 F. Supp. 1326, 
1340-41 (D.Ariz. 1995) (Court rejects defendants' defense that it was 
"legally impossible" to comply with federal court orders and an Arizona 
statute). 


FN42. The Supreme Court's consideration of Congress' intent regarding 
affirmative action under Title VII has been limited to determining whether 
affirmative action is, at times, required under the statute and whether Title 
VII permits affirmative action. See, e.g., Johnson v. Transportation 
Agency, Santa Clara County, Cal., 480 U.S. 616, 644 (1987) (Stevens, J., 
concurring) ("It remains clear that the Act does not require any employer 
to grant preferential treatment .") (emphasis in original); United 
Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO-CLC v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193, 208 
(1979) ("We therefore hold that Title VII's prohibition against racial 
discrimination does not condemn all private, voluntary affirmative action 
programs."); Local 28 of Sheet Metal Workers' Intern. Ass'n v. E.E.O.C., 
478 U.S. 421, 464 (1986) ("Our examination of the legislative policy 
behind Title VII leads us to conclude that Congress did not intend to 
prohibit a court from [ordering affirmative action in appropriate 
circumstances] "). 


FN42. In a subsequent case involving the EEOC guidelines, the Supreme 
Court drifted from its strong precedents requiring deference to agency 
interpretations. Justice Rehnquist, without reference to Commercial Office 
Products or the other post-Chevron holdings giving substantial deference 
to the EEOC guidelines, and solely drawing upon his own pre-Chevron 
opinion in General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125 (1976), determined 
that "the level of deference afforded [to an EEOC Guideline] 'will depend 
upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its 
reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all 
those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control." 
E.E.O.C. v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 257 (1991). Justice 
Scalia, concurring, reproaches Justice Rehnquist for disregarding the 
Court's precedent: "In an era when our treatment of agency positions is 
governed by Chevron the 'legislative rules v. other action' dichotomy of 
Gilbert is an anachronism; and it is not even a correct description of that 
anachronism to say that Gilbert held that the EEOC is not entitled to 
deference." Id. at 260. For the reasons that follow, this Court determines 
that, in this context, the EEOC Guidelines must be accorded, under the 
Arabian Oil test, the same substantial deference as required by 
Commercial Office Products. There is no evidence that the EEOC gave the 
two guidelines at issue here, which are comprehensive statements on 
Congress' intent regarding the use of affirmative action under Title VII, 
anything less than thorough consideration. The reasoning of the EEOC is 
coherent and is supported by the plain language and legislative history of 
the statute. In the thirty years since the passage of Title VII no agency 
interpretation of Title VII has drawn a conclusion inconsistent with those 
reached in the current EEOC guidelines. Finally the persuasive value of 
the guidelines at issued is enhanced by the fact that they function as a legal 
safe harbor for any person taking action in good faith reliance on the 
Guidelines. The Court finds that the EEOC Guidelines at issue here amply 
fulfil the requirements under Arabian Oil and must be given substantial 
deference. 


FN43. The proposition that the EEOC Guidelines are indicative of 
Congress' intent is strengthened by the fact that Congress has made no 
effort to modify or overturn the Guidelines in the twenty years following 
their promulgation. This does not suggest that Congressional inaction is 
somehow determinative; the Supreme Court, however has "often taken 
Congress' subsequent inaction as probative to varying degrees." Patterson 
v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 200 (1989) (Brennan, J., 
concurring in part, dissenting in part). In the context of Title VII, the 
Supreme Court has noted that the barriers of the legislative process do not 
adequately explain a failure of Congress to act. "[W]hen Congress has 
been displeased with our interpretation of Title VII, it has not hesitated to 
amend the statute to tell us so." Johnson, 480 U.S. at 629 n.7. 


FN44. Recognizing the importance of the EEOC guideline in making this 
finding and the unique position held by the EEOC in interpreting Title 
VII, this Court invites the EEOC to submit an amicus brief. 


FN45. Those liable under Title VII are limited to "employers." In general, 
an employer under Title VII is, at a minimum, a person who has a 
modicum of control over the statutorily required number of employees. 
See Magnuson v. Peak Technical Services, Inc., 808 F. Supp. 500 
(E.D.Va. 1992) (For the purposes of Title VII, "employer" encompasses 
those persons who control aspects of individual's compensation, terms, 
conditions, or privileges of employment.); Ryals v. Mobile County 
Sheriff's Dept., 839 F. Supp. 25 (S.D.Ala. 1993) (Alabama County not 
employer of deputy sheriff under Title VII absent evidence that county had 
any control over any area of deputy's employment. Fact that county issued 
checks for deputies was insufficient to confer employer status.). 


FN46. While these legislative comments occurred during the 1964 
enactment of Title VII when it covered only private employers, "there is 
also no indication that Congress intended to leave governmental 
employers with less latitude under Title VII than had been left to 
employers in the private sector when Title VII was originally enacted." 
Local 93, 478 U.S. at 520 n.10. 


FN47. Subdivision (h) of Proposition 209 states "[i]f any part or parts of 
this section are found to be in conflict with federal law or the United 
States Constitution, the section shall be implemented to the maximum 
extent that federal law and the United States Constitution permit. Any 
provision held invalid shall be severable from the remaining portions of 
this section." The Court recognizes that Title VII only applies to 
employment relationships, while Proposition 209 applies to employment, 
contracting, and education. It would be premature, however, to address 
questions regarding severance at this preliminary stage of the proceedings. 


FN48. The legislative history of Title VI contains one reference to the 
importance of voluntary compliance with the statute, but does not address 
whether voluntary affirmative action is central to compliance with Title 
VI. See H.R. Rep. No. 914(II), 88th Cong., 1st Sess. 25-26 (1964); H.R. 
Rep. No. 914, 88th Cong. 1st Sess. 25 (1964). The Supreme Court has 
only examined affirmative action under Titles VI and IX in limited 
contexts. Two pluralities have held that Title VI is not violated by a 
constitutionally permissible affirmative action program. Fullilove v. 
Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 492 n.77 (1980) (opinion of Burger, C.J.); id. at 
517, n.15 (Powell, J., concurring); id. at 517, n.1 (Marshall, J., 
concurring); Bakke, 438 U.S. at 287 (opinion of Powell, J.); id. at 341, 
n.17 (Brennan, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part). In the context of 
Title IX, the First Circuit recently determined that "[l]ike other anti-
discrimination statutory schemes, the Title IX regime permits affirmative 
action." Cohen v. Brown University, No. 95-2205, 1996 WL 665423 (1st 
Cir. Nov. 21, 1996). 


FN49. Plaintiffs footnote two Ninth Circuit cases and several regulations 
which adopt Title VII's disparate impact test in the context of Titles VI and 
IX. Larry P. v. Riles, 793 F.2d 969 (9th Cir. 1984); Jeldness v. Pearce, 30 
F.3d 1220 (9th Cir. 1994). While this may show that comparable actions 
will engender liability under Titles VI, VII, and IX, it does not reveal 
Congress' intent regarding the role of voluntary affirmative action under 
the three statutes. 


FN50. Congress' intent regarding affirmative action under Title IX was 
manifested when the statute was enacted in 1972-well in advance of the 
currently controlling Constitutional standard of heightened scrutiny for 
gender classifications. See U.S. v. Virginia, 116 S.Ct. at 2275-2276 
(tracing history of heightened scrutiny for gender classifications). 
Consequently, unlike Title VI, where Congress intended to track the 
standards of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress could not have 
intended to import the Fourteenth Amendment standards for gender into 
Title IX. 


FN51. Defendants argue that a state has a strong interest in seeing that 
legitimate enactments, especially at the constitutional level, not be 
stymied. Defendants certainly cannot, however, contend that the state has 
a strong interest in enforcing a measure that violates the United States 
Constitution. Because that is the very issue of the present suit, defendants 
invocation of this strong state interest is somewhat premature. 


FN52. The preliminary injunction does not, of course, interfere with the 
ability of any defendant or member of the defendant class to voluntarily 
adopt, retain, amend or repeal an affirmative action program. It does 
preclude any defendant or member of the defendant class from taking any 
action with respect to an affirmative action program in order to enforce, 
implement, or otherwise comply with, Proposition 209. 


FN53. Defendants have not requested that plaintiffs post a bond pursuant 
to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c). This Court agrees that in this case it is appropriate 
to waive the bond requirement. See generally Crowley v. Local No. 82, 
679 F.2d 978, 1000 (1st Cir. 1982); Canterbury Career School, Inc. v. 
Riley, 833 F. Supp 1097, 1106 (D.N.J. 1993).

<P>A Circuit Court judge in Hawaii barred the state from denying marriage licenses to gay couples. An appeal, which is expected, would send the case back to the Hawaii Supreme Court, which ruled in 1993 that the denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples amounts to gender discrimination under the state constitution's Equal Rights Amendment. In this Dec. 4, 1996 ruling, Judge Kevin Chang says that the state had not shown any compelling interest to deny gay and lesbian couples the right to marry.</P>

R.S. Yamada, clerk

IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
STATE OF HAWAII

CIVIL NO. 91-1394

FINDINGS OF FACT AND
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW


NINIA BAEHR, GENORA DANCEL,
TAMMY RODRIGUES, ANTOINETTE
PREGIL, PAT LAGON, AND
JOSEPH MELILLO,

Plaintiffs,

vs .

LAWRENCE H. MIIKE, in his
official capacity as Director
of the Department of Health,
State of Hawaii,

Defendant.


FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

This case came on for trial before the Honorable Kevin S.C.
Chang on September 10, 1996. Plaintiffs Ninia Baehr, Genora
Dancel, Tammy Rodrigues, Antoinette Pregil, Pat Lagon, and
Joseph Melillo were represented by attorneys Daniel R.
Foley, Evan Wolfson and Kirk H. Cashmere. Defendant
Lawrence H. Miike was represented by Deputy Attorney
Generals Rick J. Eichor and Lawrence Goya. The Court having
reviewed all the evidence admitted at the trial and having
considered the arguments and other written submissions of
counsel for the parties and the briefs filed by the amicus
curiae, hereby makes the following Findings of Fact and
Conclusions of Law.


FINDINGS OF FACTS

I. THE PARTIES

1. At all times relevant herein, Plaintiffs Ninia Baehr,
Genora Dancel, Tammy Rodrigues, Antoinette Pregil, Pat
Lagon and Joseph Melillo (hereinafter collectively referred
to as "Plaintiffs") were or are residents of the City and
County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii.

2. Defendant Lawrence H. Miike ("Defendant") is a resident
of the City and County of Honolulu. State of Hawaii.
Defendant Miike is sued in his official capacity as
Director of Department of Health, State of Hawaii. [When
this lawsuit was commenced, John Lewin was the Director of
Department of Health, State of Hawaii. Thereafter, pursuant
to Rule 43(c) of the Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure,
Defendant Miike was automatically substituted for Defendant
Lewin when he assumed the position of the Director of
Department of Health, State of Hawaii. A Notice of
Substitution of Parties was also filed by defense counsel
on April 23, 1996.]


II. RELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY

3. Plaintiffs filed their Complaint for Injunctive and
Declaratory Relief ("Complaint") on May 1, 1991.

4. In pertinent part, Plaintiffs' Complaint alleges that on
or about December 17, 1990, Defendant and his agent denied
the applications for marriage licenses presented by
Plaintiffs Baehr and Dancel, Plaintiffs Rodrigues and
Pregil and Plaintiffs Lagon and Melillo, respectively,
solely on the ground that the couples are of the same sex.
Plaintiffs sought a judicial declaration that the
construction and application of Hawaii Revised Statutes
("HRS") 572-1 to deny an application for a license to marry
because an applicant couple is of the same sex is
unconstitutional.

5. Defendant filed an Amended Answer to Complaint on June
7, 1991. In pertinent part, Defendant admitted that
Plaintiffs Baehr and Dancel, Plaintiffs Rodrigues and
Pregil and Plaintiffs Lagon and Melillo applied for
marriage licenses on December 17, 1990, and that the
couples applications for marriage licenses were denied by
Defendant through his agent on the ground that the couples
are of the same sex.

6. On July 9, 1991, Defendant filed a Motion For Judgement
on the Pleading which sought a dismissal of the lawsuit.
Defendant asserted, in pertinent part, that Plaintiffs in
their Complaint had failed to state a claim against
Defendant upon which relief could be granted.

7. A hearing was held on Defendant's Motion for Judgment on
the Pleadings on September 3, 1991.

8. An Order Granting Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the
Pleading was filed on October 1, 1991. A Judgment in favor
of Defendant and against Plaintiffs was also filed on
October 1, 1991. 9. Plaintiffs filed their Notice of Appeal
to the Supreme Court of the State of Hawaii on October 17,
1991.

10. In Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 852 P.2d 44 (1993), the
Hawaii Supreme Court vacated the circuit courts order and
judgment in favor of Defendant and remanded the case to the
circuit court for further proceedings. In pertinent part,
the Hawaii Supreme Court directed the following.


On remand, in accordance with the "strict scrutiny"
standard, the burden will rest on [Defendant] to overcome
the presumption that HRS 572-1 is unconstitutional by
demonstrating that it furthers compelling state interests
and is narrowly drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgments of
constitutional rights.


Id., 74 Haw. at 583 (citations omitted).

11. On May 17, 1993, Defendant filed a motion for
reconsideration or clarification to the Hawaii Supreme
Court.

12. On May 27, 1993, the Hawaii Supreme Court granted
Defendant's motion for reconsideration, or, in the
alternative, for clarification in part, and clarified the
mandate on remand as follows.


Because, for the reasons stated in the plurality opinion
filed in the above-captioned matter on May 5, 1993, the
circuit court erroneously granted Lewin's motion for
judgment on the pleadings and dismissed the plaintiffs'
complaint, the circuit court's order and judgment are
vacated and the matter is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with the pluralitv opinion. On remand, in
accordance with the "strict scrutiny" standard, the burden
will rest on [Defendant] to overcome the presumption that
HRS 572-1 is unconstitutional by demonstrating that it
furthers compelling state interests and is narrowly drawn
to avoid unnecessary abridgments of constitutional rights.


Baehr v. Lewin 74 Haw. 530, 852 P.2d 44 (1993),
reconsideration and clarification granted in part, 74 Haw.
645, 852 P.2d 74 (1993) (citations omitted).

13. An Order of Early Assignment to Trial Judge was filed
on May 5, 1995.

14. On July 13, 1995, Defendant Director of Health's Motion
for Reservation of Questions to the Supreme Court of Hawaii
and for Stay Pending Appeal, or, in the alternative for
Stay Pendinq the Action of The Commission on Sexual
Orientation and the Law and of The Eighteenth Legislature
filed on July 5, 1995, was granted in part, and the trial
in the above-captioned case was rescheduled from September
25, 1995 to July 15, 1996. See Order Denying Defendant
Director of Health's Motion for Reservation of Questions to
the Supreme Court of Hawaii and for Stay Pending Appeal,
and Granting Alternative Motion for Stay of Trial Pending
the Action of The Commission on Sexual Orientation and the
Law and of The Eighteenth Legislature filed on September 7,
1995.

15. A Notice of Change of Responsible Deputy was filed on
April 18, 1996, which stated that responsibility for
handling of the case on behalf of the Defendant had been
changed to Deputy Attorney General Rick J. Eichor.

16. Following a status conference with counsel on April 19,
1996, a Stipulation to Continue Trial Date and Order was
filed on May 9, 1996. As a result, the trial in the
above-captioned case was continued from the week of August
1, 1996 to September 10, 1996.


III. DEFENDANT'S POSITION

17. The directive of the Hawaii Supreme Court is clear.
Pursuant to the mandate of the Supreme Court, Defendant has
the burden of proof in this case. Id.

18. Defendant's First Amended Pretrial Statement was filed
on May 13, 1996. In pertinent part, Defendant stated the
following.


[A]ll that remains is for the State to show that there is
a compelling State interest to deny Plaintiff marriage
licenses because they are of the same sex and that this
compelling interest is narrowly drawn to avoid unnecessary
abridgments of constitutional rights.

The following substantial and compelling state interests
will he shown:

a. That the State has a compelling interest in protecting
the health and welfare of children and other persons. . . .

b. That the State has a compelling interest in fostering
procreation within a marital setting. . . .

c. That the State has a compelling interest in securing or
assuring recognition of Hawaii marriages in other
jurisdictions. . . .

d. That the State has a compelling interest in protecting
the State's public fisc from the reasonably foreseeable
effects of State approval of same-sex marriage in the laws
of Hawaii. . . .

e. That the State has a compelling state interest in
protecting civil liberties, including the reasonably
foreseeable effects of State approval of same-sex
marriages, on its citizens.


Defendant's First Amended Pretrial Statement at pages 2-4.

19. Defendant's Pre-Trial Memorandum was filed on September
6, 1996. In pertinent part, Defendant asserted the
following.


The State of Hawaii has a compelling interest to promote
the optimal development of children. . . . It is the State
of Hawaii's position that, all things being equal, it is
best for a child that it be raised in a single home by its
parents, or at least by a married male and female. . . .

The marriage law furthers the compelling state interest of
securing or assuring recognition of Hawaii marriages in
other jurisdictions. . . .

The marriage law furthers the compelling state interest in
protecting the public fisc from the reasonably foreseeable
effects of approval of same-sex marriage.


Defendant's Pre-Trial Memorandum at pages 1, 2 and 4.

20. Defense counsel acknowledged Defendant's burden of
proof and, in pertinent part, stated the following in his
Opening Statement. "The State has a compelling interest in
promoting the optimal development of children. . . . It is
the State's policy to pursue the optimal development of
children, to unite children with their mothers and fathers,
and to have mothers and fathers take responsibility for
their children." Trial Transcript ("Tr.") 9/10/96. pages
4-5.


IV. DEFENDANT'S WITNESSES

21. Defendant presented testimony from the following expert
witnesses: (1) Kyle D. Pruett, M.D.; (2) David Eggebeen,
Ph.D.; (3) Richard Williams, Ph.D.: and (4) Thomas S.
Merrill, Ph D.

22. Dr. Kyle Pruett is an expert in the field of
psychiatry, specializing in child development. Beginning in
1981 and continuing for a ten-year period, Dr. Pruett
conducted a longitudinal study of fifteen families with
young children with regard to the developmental competence
of children raised primarily by their fathers in intact
families. At the end of his study, Dr. Pruett found that
children raised by families with primarily paternal care in
the early months and years of life are competent and robust
in their development, and are not sources of clinical
concern.

23. In pertinent part, Dr. Pruett found that there were
unique paternal contributions made by a father which had a
positive effect on the following: (1) a child's self-esteem
and feelings of being loved and important to the family;
(2) a child's ability to cope with frustration and
discouragement; (3) a child's interest in generative or
creative matters; and (4) a child's gender flexibility.

24. However, Dr. Pruett also stated that the unique or
non-replicable contributions offered by a father (and the
unique contributions offered by a mother) are "small", in
comparison to the contributions that parents make together
to their children. Tr. 9/10/96, page 84. Dr. Pruett
conceded that the beneficial results described above are
not essential to being a happy, healthy and well-adjusted
child. Tr. 9/10/96, pages 86-87.

25. Dr. Pruett testified that biological parents have a
predisposition which helps them in parenting children. The
predisposition is based upon the following factors: (1)
chromosomal or genetic contributions; (2) the parents'
choice and timing of conception or procreation; (3) the
physical changes to the mother's body and the father's
observations and interaction with those changes; (4)
immediate bonding upon the child's birth; and (5) a
predisposition to sacrifice and make one's self secondary
to the needs of the child.

26. Dr. Pruett also expressed his belief that children
which are adopted or are the result of assisted
reproduction live in a "burden[ed] system." Tr. 9/10/96,
pages 58, 62.

27. Dr. Pruett stated that same-sex relationships do not
provide the same type of learning model or experience for
children as does male-female parenting, because there is an
overabundance of information about one gender and little
information about the other gender. Tr. 9/10/96, page 63.

28. Nevertheless, Dr. Pruett also stated that same-sex
parents can, and do, produce children-with a clear sense of
gender identity. Tr. 9/10/96, pages 106.

29. Dr. Pruett stated the following with respect to raising
children in a same-sex marriage environment.


Q. And in comparing same sex parenting with opposite sex
parenting, which is more likely to pose greater
developmental difficulties for children?

A. In terms of probability, same-sex marriages are more
likely to provide a more burdened nurturing domain.


Tr. 9/10/96, page 63.

30. It is Dr. Pruett's opinion that most children are more
likely to reach their optimal development being raised in
an intact family by their mother and father. According to
Dr. Pruett, this family configuration presents the fewest
burdens on child development. Tr. 9/10/96, page 63.

31. However, Dr. Pruett also stated that single parents,
gay fathers, lesbian mothers and same-sex couples have the
potential to, and often do, raise children that are happy,
healthy and well-adjusted. Tr.  9/10/96, page 69.

32. Dr. Pruett testified that single parents, gay fathers,
lesbian mothers, adoptive parents, foster parents and
same-sex couples can be, and do become, good parents. Tr.
9/10/96, page 71. Significantly, Dr. Pruett knows the
foregoing to be true based on his clinical experience. Tr.
9/10/96, page 72.

33. More specifically, Dr. Pruett stated that parents'
sexual orientation does not disqualify them from being
good, fit, loving or successful parents. Tr. 9/10/96, page
72.

34. Dr. Pruett agreed that, in general, gay and lesbian
parents are as fit and loving parents as non-gay persons
and couples. Tr. 9/10/96, page 73.

35. Same-sex couples have the same capability as
different-sex couples to manifest the qualities conducive
to good parenting. Tr. 9/10/96, page 75.


Dr. Pruett testified as follows.

Q. And you've seen same-sex couples that have those
qualities [to being good parents]?

A. Yes.

Q. And have made good parents?

A. And have made good parents, yes.

Q. And good parents as a couple?

A. Yes.


Tr. 9/10/96, page 75.

36. Dr. Pruett also agreed that same-sex couples should be
allowed to adopt children, provide foster care and to take
children in and raise and care for them. Tr. 9/10/96, page
73.

37. Importantly, Dr. Pruett testified that the quality of
the nurturing relationship between parent and child could,
and would, outweigh any limitation or burden imposed on the
child as a result of having same-sex parents. Tr. 9/10/96,
page 79.

38. Finally, when questioned regarding research performed
by Charlotte Patterson regarding children raised by
same-sex couples, Dr. Pruett expressed his agreement with
the general conclusions reached by Dr. Patterson. Tr.
9/10/96, pages 132-133.

More specifically, Dr. Pruett agreed with the following
conclusions, that gay and lesbian parents "are doing a good
job" and that "the kids are turning out just fine." Tr.
9/10/96, pages 133-134.

Dr. Pruett was not surprised by Dr. Patterson's
conclusions. In fact, they are what he expected to see, and
although Dr. Pruett questions Dr. Patterson's research
methodology, he is not aware of any data, research or
literature which disputes Dr. Patterson's findings and
conclusions. Tr. 9/10/96, pages 132-134.

39. Dr. David Eggebeen is an expert in the field of
sociology with a special emphasis in demographics related
to family and children.

40. In pertinent part, Dr. Eggebeen testified regarding
changes or trends which have occurred in partnering, child
bearing and labor force behavior in the United States. For
example, Dr. Eggebeen testified regarding the following
facts: (1) the marriage rate in the U.S. population has
declined over the past twenty years; (2) the median age of
marriage for women in the U.S. population has risen over
the past twenty years; (3) the annual divorce rate in the
U.S. population has increased over the past approximate
thirty years; (4) the number of young adults currently
cohabiting has increased over the past eight years; (5) the
birth rate for women in the U.S. population has decreased
over the past twenty years; (6) the number of proportionate
births to non-married women in certain racial groups has
increased over the past thirty years; and (7) the number of
women in the labor force in the U.S. population and the
number of working mothers with children under the age of
six has increased dramatically over the past thirty years.

41. Based on his studies of the changes referred above, Dr.
Eggebeen testified as follows.


[C]hildren are going through fundamental changes in the
structure of childhood and what we're seeing today is
children today are living in very different circumstances
than was evident or the case in the past. It's common today
to find children in single parent families. It's common
today to find children in single parent families. It's
common today to find children living with a mother who
never married. It's common today to find children in
remarried families. It's common today to find children in
dual earner families where both parents participate in the
type of work. It is common or getting common to find
children whose parents never married and they're
cohabiting.


Tr. 9/11/96, pages 32-33.

42. However, Dr. Eggebeen also testified that, as of 1990,
almost six out of ten children in the United States are
living in families where their parents are married and both
of the parents are biological parents of the child.

43. Dr. Eggebeen explained further that ". . . children
have gone through substantial changes in their lives. . .
[T]here is greater diversity in living arrangements and
family --- in families that children live today in the
'9Os. However, a substantial percentage of children remain
or will spend their childhood in . . . traditional kinds of
family structures." Tr. 9/11/96, page 38.

44. Based on his research, Dr. Eggebeen concluded that
marriage is a "gateway to becoming a parent," and marriage
is synonymous with having children. Tr. 9/11/96, page 42.

45. However, Dr. Eggebeen also testified that individuals
get married without intending to have children, or marry
and are biologically unable to have children. Further, the
absence of the intent or the ability to have children does
not weaken the institution of marriage.

In fact, Dr. Eggebeen recognized that people marry and want
to get married for reasons other than having children; that
those reasons are valuable and important; and that
regardless of children, it is beneficial to society for
adults to marry. Dr. Eggebeen testified that individuals
should not be prohibited from marriage simply because they
cannot have children. Tr. 9/11/96, pages 55-57.

46. Dr. Eggebeen testified that children raised in a single
parent home are at a "heightened risk", as compared to
children raised in a married couple family. Tr. 9/11/96,
page 43. According to Dr. Eggebeen, children in a single
parent family are at greater risk  for the following: (1)
poverty or economic hardship; (2) poor academic
performance; (3) behavior problems and conduct disorders;
and (4) premarital or teenage birth for girls.

47. Dr. Eggebeen stated that remarriage or cohabiting with
a step-parent does not lessen or eliminate the risks to
children from single parent families. "[C]hildren in a
remarriage family. . . do not seem to perform any
differently than children who remain in single parent
families and therefore their performance or the risk of
poor outcomes is about the same as is for children in
single parent families." Tr. 9/11/96, page 46.

48. Dr. Eggebeen suggested that the lack of improvement in
risk factors in remarriage or step-parent families may be
attributable to "the role ambiguity of step parent
relationships," characteristics which a step-parent brings
to the family and which adversely affect the children or
the absence of a biological relationship with the children.
Tr. 9/11/96, pages 46-48. With respect to the latter, Dr.
Eggebeen related the story of Cinderella and her evil
stepmother. Tr. 9/11/96, page 48.

49. Dr. Eggebeen equates a same-sex couple with children to
a step-parent situation with all of the above-described
risk factors. Specifically, Dr. Eggebeen testified that
"same-sex marriages where children [are] involved is by
definition a step parent relationship," because there is
one parent who is not the biological parent of the child.
Tr. 9/11/96, pages 49.

50. However, Dr. Eggebeen conceded that there are some
situations involving a same-sex couple which would not fit
the classic step-parent scenario. For example, a situation
involving a same-sex couple that sought and received
reproductive assistance and in which the non-biological
parent was fully involved from the beginning of the
planning process, was present throughout the nine month
period and at birth, and thereafter, raised the child as
though they were the biological parents of the child. Tr.
9/11/96, pages 114-115.

51. Dr. Eggebeen also testified that single parents,
adoptive parents, lesbian mothers, gay fathers and same-sex
couples can create stable family environments and raise
healthy and well-adjusted children. Tr. 9/11/96, page 82.

52. It is Dr. Eggebeen's opinion that gay and lesbian
couples can, and do, make excellent parents and that they
are capable of raising a healthy child. Tr. 9/11/96, page
83.

53. Dr. Eggebeen agrees that gay and lesbian parents should
be allowed to adopt children and serve as foster parents.
Tr. 9/11/96, page 85.

54. Dr. Eggebeen testified that cohabiting same-sex couples
are less stable than married couples. However, the sole
basis for Dr. Eggebeen's conclusion is a chart taken from
the book entitled American Couples, co-authored by Pepper
Schwartz, Ph.D. The chart which summarizes approximately
twenty year old information is Defendant's Exhibit Q, and
depicts a comparison of the percentages of married, gay and
lesbian couples, respectively, which had stayed together or
broken up over periods of time.

Dr. Eggebeen testified that Exhibit Q is the best data that
he could find which proves that gay and lesbian couples
have substantially higher break up rates over time than
married different sex couples. Tr. 9/11/96,-pages 73-74.
Dr. Eggebeen admitted that he has done limited research on
the subject of same sex couples and gay and lesbian
parenting, and agrees that Charlotte Patterson and Pepper
Schwartz are experts in the fields. Tr. 9/11/96, pages
131-132.

55. Finally, and importantly, Dr. Eggebeen stated that
children of same-sex couples would be helped if their
families had access to or were able to receive the
following benefits of marriage: (1) state income tax
advantages; (2) public assistance; (3) enforcement of child
support, alimony or other support orders; (4) inheritance
rights; and (5) the ability to prosecute wrongful death
actions. Dr. Eggebeen also agreed that children of same-sex
couples would be helped if their families received the
social status derived from marriage. Tr. 9/11/96, pages
89-92.

56. Dr. Richard Williams is an expert in the field of
psychology with special expertise in qualitative and
quantitative research and research methods, statistical
analysis and construction of research studies.

57. Dr. Williams was asked by defense counsel to review and
analyze studies of children raised by gay and lesbian
parents. He reviewed approximately twenty to thirty
studies, and eventually selected nine studies to critique.

58. At trial, Dr. Williams presented commentary regarding
nine research studies which defense counsel anticipated
that Plaintiffs' expert witnesses would rely upon for their
testimony and opinions in this case.

Dr. Williams' general criticism of the nine studies
included the following: (1) there was non-representative
sampling of heterosexual, gay and lesbian parents; (2)
inadequate sample size was employed; and (3) comparison
groups used in the studies were not comparable in terms of
household make up. Dr Williams also presented specific
criticism as to each of the nine referenced studies .

59. The testimony of Dr. Williams is not persuasive or
believable because of his expressed bias against the social
sciences, which include the fields of psychology and
sociology.

For example, Dr. Williams believes that a majority of the
studies in the social sciences have theoretical or
methodological flaws. Tr. 9/12/96, pages 71-72. According
to Dr. Williams, modern psychology is so flawed that no
fix, reconciliation or overhaul can correct it. Tr.
9/12/96, page 70.

60. Further, even assuming that research studies are
conducted properly, Dr. Williams still doubts the ultimate
value of psychology and other social sciences. Tr. 9/12/96,
page 73.

61. At times, Dr. Williams expressed severe views. For
example, Dr. Williams believes that there is no scientific
proof that evolution occurred. Tr. 9/12/96, page 80.

62. Finally, Dr. Williams admitted that his critique of
studies regarding gay and lesbian parenting is a minority
position. Tr. 9/12/96, pages 74-75.

63. Defendant's last witness was Thomas Merrill, Ph.D. Dr.
Merrill is an expert in the field of psychology, including
the areas of human development, gender development and
relationships relative to children and their development.

64. Dr. Merrill is a psychologist in private practice in
Honolulu, Hawaii. His clinical experience with families
involving one or two gay or lesbian parents is limited. Dr.
Merrill has not testified as an expert in Family Court
cases which involved the sexual orientation of a parent or
a same-sex couple and the custody of a child. He has not
participated in or conducted any study which focused on the
children of gay and lesbian parents. Tr. 9/13/96, page 36.

65. Dr. Merrill examined the issue of same-sex versus
opposite sex parent and child development for the first
time as a result of his retention in this case. Tr.
9/13/96, page 35.

66. In pertinent part, Dr. Merrill testified that the
parental relationship is an important learning model for
children and that it is significant to have opposite sex
parents for a child's learning. Tr. 9/13/96, pages 12-13.

67. Dr. Merrill stated that different-sex parents are
important because both parents serve as models and as
objects for a child's learning and development. Dr. Merrill
explained as follows:


We interact with -- and when I say identify, we measure and
develop ourself in relationship to our same gender parent.
We also identify our relationship with our opposite sex
parents and there are different developmental stages where
that relationship with the opposite sex parent is equal to
or more important than our development -- our relationship
at the moment with the same gender parent.


Tr. 9/13/96, page 13.

68. According to Dr. Merrill, although replacement of a
biological parent is certainly possible, as in the case of
remarriage and adoption, it would result in the presence of
a different influence on the child and the child's
developmental outcome may be different. Tr. 9/13/96, pages
20-21.

69. Dr. Merrill testified that same-sex parents do provide
a learning experience for a child. However, Dr. Merrill
stated that there is insufficient information regarding the
effects of being raised by gay or lesbian parents on the
development of a child. Tr. 9/13/96, page 22.

As a result, Dr. Merrill has no opinion regarding the
development of children in a family with same-sex parents.
Specifically, he cannot say whether or not children raised
in a same-sex family environment will develop to be
healthy, well-adjusted adults. Tr. 9/13/96, page 38.

70. At the close of his direct examination, Dr. Merrill
presented the following opinions.


Q. In your opinion, to a reasonable degree of psychological
probability, in what family structure are children most
likely to reach their optimal development?

A. Children are most apt to reach their optimal level of
development as exhibited in terms of their adjustment as
adults in a family in which there is a limited amount of
strife, a maximum amount of nurturing, a maximum amount of
support, a maximum amount of guidance, a maximum amount of
leadership, and a very strong and intimate bond between
parents and child.

Q. And does the presence of the mother and father improve
the likelihood that there will be a strong bond?

A. That would be a significant part of the maximum optimum
environment in which to raise a child, yes.


Tr. 9/13/96, pages 32-33.

71. Dr. Merrill testified that the sexual orientation of a
parent is not an indication of parental fitness. Tr.
9/13/96, page 46.

72. Dr. Merrill also agreed that gay and lesbian couples
with children do have successful relationships. Tr.
9/13/96, page 46.

73. On one occasion, Dr. Merrill was retained by two
attorneys to do a custody evaluation in a case involving a
same-sex relationship on the mother's side. In part, he was
asked to address children's development issues. Dr. Merrill
testified that the fact that there was a same-sex
relationship on the mother's side was not an issue and did
not affect his evaluation in the case. Tr. 9/13/96, page
34.

74. Finally, and in pertinent part, Dr. Merrill testified
as follows.


Q. Now, doctor, do you think the children, regardless of
whether they have a mother and a father, male-female
parents, single parents, adoptive parents, gay and lesbian
parents, same gender parents, should have the same
opportunity in society to reach their optimum development,
each child?

A. Yes, I do.


Tr. 9/13/96, page 45.

Dr. Merrill further stated that children should not be
denied benefits, such as health care, education and housing
based on the status of their parents. Opposite-sex,
same-sex, single and adoptive parent status should not be
a basis to deny benefits to children. Tr. 9/13/96, page 46.


V. PLAINTIFFS' WITNESSES

75. Although Plaintiffs do not have the burden of proof in
this case, they nevertheless presented testimony from the
following expert witnesses: (1) Pepper Schwartz, Ph.D; (2)
Charlotte Patterson, Ph.D.; (3) David Brodzinsky, Ph.D; and
(4) Robert Bidwell, M.D.

76. The court found the testimony of Dr. Schwartz and Dr.
Brodzinsky to be especially credible.

Dr. Schwartz and Dr. Brodzinsky are well-qualified
individuals. See Plaintiffs' Exhibits 1 and 2,
respectively.

At trial, each of them testified in a knowledgeable,
informative and straightforward manner worthy of belief. In
general, the expert opinions of Dr. Schwartz and Dr.
Brodzinsky appear to be well-founded based on their
significant research and analysis, and their clinical and
professional experience, respectively.

77. Dr. Schwartz is an expert in sociology and
interdisciplinary studies of sexuality with a special
expertise in gender and human sexuality, marriage and the
family, and same-sex relations in parenting and research.
She testified, in pertinent part, to the following.

78. Initially, Dr. Schwartz discussed her book, American
Couples. Dr. Schwartz specifically addressed a chart taken
from the book and relied upon by Defendant. According to Dr
Schwartz, the data contained in Defendant's Exhibit Q
represents the following: (1) that there is a substantially
higher break up rate for all three kinds of couples (gay
men, lesbian and cohabitors) than there is for married
couples; and (2) married couples have an advantage that
keeps them together longer than other kinds of couples. Tr.
9/16/96, pages 47-48.

79. Dr. Schwartz noted that the data presented in American
Couples was collected in the late '70s and up until 1980 or
1981. Since that time, there have been significant changes
in society. For example, the entry of AIDS into gay male
life and society, has made people more cautious and less
likely to have multiple partners and more desirous of
settling down. Gay men, in particular, have been hardest
hit by the disease and it has made monogomy and couplehood
more attractive.

Additionally, there is now a trend in which people
contemplate and want to be more serious, to make families
and to engage in long-term committed relationships. This is
a large change from the attitudes of the late '70s and
early '80s. Tr. 9/16/96, page 54-56.

80. Dr. Schwartz testified that heterosexual and homosexual
people want to get married. Tr. 9/16/96, pages 58-59, 65.
The doctor stated specifically:


[T]hey want companionship, they want love, they want trust,
they want someone who will be with them through thick and
thin. They're looking for a live and a love partner. . . .
[I]n our own [culture] it's an aspiration for --- for
intimacy and security. And that is the definition of
marriage as people first and primarily think of it."


Tr. 9/16/96, page 59.

81. Dr. Schwartz stated that same-sex couples can, and do,
have successful, loving and committed relationships. Tr.
9/16/96, page 129.

82. Dr. Schwartz also identified practical, economic,
legal, social and psychological benefits of marriage and
reasons for people to marry. Tr. 9/16/96, pages 59-65.

83. Dr. Schwartz testified that the sexual orientation of
parents is not an indicator of parental fitness. Tr.
9/16/96, page 128.

84. Dr. Schwartz also testified that gay and lesbian
parents and same-sex couples are as fit and loving parents,
as non-gay persons and different-sex couples. Tr. 9/16/96,
page 127.

85. Dr. Schwartz believes that the primary quality of
parenting is not the parenting structure, or biology, but
is the nurturing relationship between parent and child. Tr.
9/16/96, page 129.

86. Dr. Schwartz also believes that children should not be
denied benefits and protections because of the status of
their parents. Tr. 9/16/96, pages 129-130.

87. Dr. Schwartz has the following opinions.

First, there is no reason related to the promotion of the
optimal development of children why same-sex couples should
not be permitted to marry. Tr. 9/16/96, page 130.

Second, allowing same-sex couples to marry would not have
a negative impact on society or the institution of
marriage. Dr. Schwartz testified, "[T]here would be no
dishonor and no ultimate fragility to the institution [of
marriage] by including gays and lesbians." Tr. 9/16/96,
pages 130-131. Third, allowing same-sex couples to marry
would have a positive impact on society and the institution
of marriage. Dr. Schwartz stated the following.


I think that marriage is really a high state of hope and
effort for people. I think when we deny it to people we say
that --- that there's some other location for love and
raising children and that we're not as concerned about
these kids' welfare or in some ways we don't think it would
be good for them to be in a married home. It's not that
those children don't exist, it's not that those families
don't exist, they do.

To me, I think that most Americans believe in marriage
strongly. I believe by taking other people into the fold
and asking that they behave as responsible to their
children to give them support to have both rituals to enter
into their relationships and legal complications by exiting
them, that we shore up how important we think marriage is.
I think it --- I think it in no way undermines it and I
think it strengthens it by our insistence about how
important it is and why we hope this will be available for
all families.


Tr. 9/16/96, pages 131-132.

88. Dr. Charlotte Patterson is an expert in the field of
psychology of child development with a special expertise in
lesbian and gay parenting and the development of children
of lesbian and gay parents. She testified, in pertinent
part, to the following.

89. Dr. Patterson is a professor at the University of
Virginia. She has completed two studies regarding the
children of lesbian and gay parents.

90. The first study is known as the Bay Area Family Study.
The study involved thirty-seven families, all of which had
at least one child between the ages of four and nine. In
every case, the children had either been born to women who
identified themselves as lesbian at the time of the study,
or who adopted children early in life. Data in the Bay Area
Family Study was collected in 1990 and 1991.

91. According to Dr. Patterson, the main result of the Bay
Area Family Study was a conclusion that the particular
group of children, when compared to available norms,
appeared to be developing in a normal fashion. Tr. 9/17/96,
pages 23-24.

However, Dr. Patterson also noted a finding that the
children of the lesbian mothers sample were more likely to
express that they felt (within a normal range) symptoms of
stress in their lives, as compared to children in the
normal sample. The children who described symptoms of
stress also said that they felt an overall sense of
well-being about themselves in their lives. Although she
has two plausible explanations, Dr. Patterson does not have
a definitive interpretation or explanation for the above
finding. Tr. 9/17/96, page 25.

Dr. Patterson agreed that the sample group of lesbian
mothers in the Bay Area Family Study, when considering
ethnic background, education, income, and other
socioeconomic factors is not representative of women and
all mothers in America. Tr. 9/17/96, pages 81-84.

92. Dr. Patterson's second study is known as the
Contemporary Family Study. The study involved eighty
families who conceived a child using the resources of the
Sperm Bank of California. and all of which had at least one
child that was at least five years old at the time of the
study. Fifty-five of the families were headed by lesbian
mothers. The remaining twenty-five families were headed by
heterosexual parents. Most of the data for this study was
collected in 1994 and 1995.

93. The three main conclusions of the Contemporary Family
Study are as follows: (1) as a group, the children born as
a result of donor insemination were developing normally;
(2) sexual orientation of the parents was not a good
predictor of how well children do in terms of a child's
well-being and adjustment; and (3) irrespective of their
parents' sexual orientation, children who live in a
harmonious family environment had better reports from
parents and teachers. Tr. 9/17/96, pages 36-37.

94. Based on her studies and review of other research, Dr.
Patterson testified as follows. A biological relationship
between parent and child is not essential to raising a
healthy child. The quality of parenting which a child
receives is more important than a biological connection or
the gender of a parent. Tr. 9/17/96, pages 42-43.

95. According to Dr. Patterson, there is no data or
research which establishes that gay fathers and lesbian
mothers are less capable of being good parents than non-gay
people and which supports denying gay people the ability to
adopt and raise children. Tr. 9/17/96, page 52.

96. Dr. Patterson believes that gay and lesbian people and
same-sex couples are as fit and loving parents as non-gay
people and different-sex couples. Further, sexual
orientation is not an indicator of parental fitness. Tr.
9/17/96, pages 53-54.

97. Dr. Patterson testified that same-sex couples can, and
do, have successful, loving and committed relationships.
Tr. 9/17/96, pages 54.

98. Dr. Patterson presented the following opinion. There is
no reason related to the promotion of the development of
children why same-sex couples should not be permitted to
marry. Tr. 9/17/96, page 55.

99. Dr. David Brodzinsky is an expert in the fields of
psychology and child development with a special expertise
in adoption and other forms of nonbiological parenting and
the development of children raised by nonbiological
parents.

100. Dr. Brodzinsky counsels children and families in a
clinical setting and also has an academic appointment at
Rutgers University. In the academic setting, Dr. Brodzinsky
does research, teaches, directs a program on counseling
foster children and does clinical supervision. He has been
at Rutgers University since 1974.

Dr. Brodzinsky serves as a consultant to several adoption
agencies in New Jersey and New York and is a founding
director of the Adoption Institute, a newly formed
nonprofit organization, whose mission is to provide
information and education and promote research regarding
adoption and adoption practices. In the past ten to fifteen
years, he has conducted research and written extensively on
the psychology of adoption, foster care, stress and coping
in children.

101. In his clinical practice, Dr. Brodzinsky has worked
with gay and lesbian parents. He has provided counseling
over the years to approximately forty families headed by
same-sex parents and same-sex couples. In pertinent part,
Dr. Brodzinsky testified as follows.

102. Dr. Brodzinsky stated the following with respect to
the following question: "Are there advantages to being
raised by one's biological parents?"


The issue is not the structural variable, biological versus
nonbiological, one parent versus two parent. Those are kind
of --- they hide, I think, really what is going on. The
issue is really the process variables, how children are
cared for, is the child provided warmth, is the child
provided consistency of care, is the child provided a
stimulated environment, is the child given support. Those
are the factors we can call, for lack of a better way of
saying it, sensitive care-giving which transcend whether
you're a single parent, two parent, biological,
nonbiological. The research shows that --- that those are
the factors that carry the biggest weight. And when you
take a look at structural variables, there's not all that
much support that structural variable in and of themselves
are all that important.


Tr. 9/18/96, page 42.

103. Dr. Brodzinsky noted that same-sex parent adoptions
occur and it is his opinion that same-sex parent adoptions
should be allowed. Tr. 9/18/96, page 49. Dr. Brodzinsky
explained as follows.


Q. As an expert in adoption and as a psychologist, do you
believe that gay men and lesbians, same-sex couples, should
be continue to be allowed to adopt children?

A. Absolutely.

Q. Why?

A. Because they are able to provide, like heterosexual
couples or single parents, warm and loving environments.
They're --- they're adopting children now. They're doing a
good job of it. Obviously, you know, when we --- when a
person seeks to adopt, there is an evaluation. It would be
the same kind of an evaluation. We would exclude a gay or
lesbian individual for the same reason that we would
exclude a heterosexual individual. That is, if they had a
significant emotional problems or some other kind of factor
that we felt, as -- as, you know, agency consultants, you
know, would not -- would not predict well to a child's
well-being.


Tr. 9/18/96, pages 56-57.

104. Dr. Brodzinsky testified that the research shows that
same-sex couples and different-sex couples can be highly
competent care-givers. The sexual orientation of parents is
not an indicator of parental fitness. Tr. 9/18/96, page 50.

105. According to Dr. Brodzinsky, the primary quality of
good parenting is not the particular structure of the
family or biology, but is the nurturing relationship
between parent and child. Tr. 9/18/96, page 63.

106. Dr. Brodzinsky believes that children adopted by
same-sex couples are not at any increased risk for
behavioral or psychological problems. Tr. 9/18/96, page 50.

107. Dr. Brodzinsky expressed his strong view regarding the
issue of whether there is a best family environment to
raise children.


Q. Now, the State's arguments seem to suggest that we
somehow need to identify a best family for children, or as
between mothers and fathers, we have to pick a best parent.
What's your position on that?

A. I find that offensive truthfully. I find it offensive
because it tends to suggest that there's only one way of
being a parent. It excludes all nonbiological parenting
which would be adoptive parenting, stepparenting, foster
parenting, parenting by gay and lesbians. It suggests that
if there are some additional issues that come with some of
these nontraditional families that should be reason for
excluding rather than taking that information and using it
not in a punitive way but in a proactive, kind of
supportive way to help families deal with the inevitable
issues that come up in life. And there are going to be some
unique issues in varying forms of family. But to talk about
one form of family that is best, I find that, you know,
truthfully offensive and a distortion of the research
literature. And that's really why I'm here, you know, to
make sure that message comes across.


Tr. 9/18/96, pages 58-59.

108. Finally, it is Dr. Brodzinsky's opinion that there is
no reason related to the promotion of the development of
children why same-sex couples should not be permitted to
marry. Tr. 9/18/96, page 63.

109. Dr. Robert Bidwell is an expert in pediatrics with a
subspecialty in adolescent medicine. Dr. Bidwell is the
Director of Adolescent Medicine at Kapiolani Medical Center
and is also employed at the University of Hawaii Department
of Pediatrics with the John A. Burns School of Medicine.
Dr. Bidwell teaches medical students and pediatric
residents in training, provides patient care, and practices
adolescent medicine and general pediatrics at Kapiolani
Medical Center.

110. In his clinical practice, Dr. Bidwell has treated
children of same-sex parents. He has provided medical
services to hundreds of children with families which
included a single gay or lesbian parent or same-sex
parents. In pertinent part, Dr. Bidwell testified as
follows.

111. Dr. Bidwell described the best environment to raise a
healthy, well-adjusted child or adolescent as being one in
which "there's all those things that we associate with
family, which is love and nurturance and guidance,
protection, safety." Tr. 9/19/96, pages 27-28.

112. According to Dr. Bidwell, gay and lesbian parents and
same-sex couples can, and do, provide an environment for
their children. Tr. 9/19/96, page 29.

113. Dr. Bidwell testified that gay and lesbian parents and
same-sex couples raise children that are just as healthy
and well-adjusted as those raised by different-sex couples.
Tr. 9/19/96, page 38.

114. Dr. Bidwell conceded -- that he has worked with
adolescents and teen-aged children living in a same-sex
family environment that have experienced embarrassment,
distress or a "difficult time" because their family "is not
the same as the majority of families that surround them."
However, the doctor also described the situation as a phase
in the child's development. He said the following.


What's been reassuring to me is that -- that this has been
a phase in their development, that I do not know of any
teenager who has not gotten through this phase intact as a
healthy adolescent. And, yes, I think there was pain. I
think that there may have been tears from time to time,
wishing that things were different. But I think it's -- I
mean it's what we call growing up. I mean there are many
different kinds of families. And all of our parents are
different in some way from what we would like to see. . . .

So I think my experience has been for the same -- has been
the same for the children of gay and lesbian parents, is
that they may go through a rough time. And not all of them
do. Remarkably, most of them, they make their
accommodations. They find ways to deal with it. But they
get through these periods. And if anything, I think they
grow stronger through that experience. They learn about
life. They learn about diversity. And the research -- and
although I'm not a heavy-duty research person, I do look at
the research. The research confirms that --that teenagers
get through this period.

But I guess to get back to your question, yes, there is a
special experience for these young people, and sometimes
it's painful. But it doesn't do developmental damage to
these kids. If anything, it creates strength and promotes
growth.


Tr. 9/19/96, pages 30-32.

115. Finally, Dr. Bidwell believes that children of
same-sex parents would benefit, with respect to their
health, development and adjustment, if their parents were
married. Tr. 9/19/96, page 38.


VI. SPECIFIC FINDINGS

116. The following are specific findings of fact for this
case based on the credible evidence presented at trial.

117. Defendant presented insufficient evidence and failed
to establish or prove any adverse consequences to the
public fisc resulting from same-sex marriage.

118. Defendant presented insufficient evidence and failed
to establish or prove any adverse impacts to the State of
Hawaii or its citizens resulting from the refusal of other
jurisdictions to recognize Hawaii same-sex marriages or
from application of the federal constitutional provision
which requires other jurisdictions to give full faith and
credit recognition to Hawaii same-sex marriages. See
Article IV, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution (The Full
Faith and Credit Clause).

119. Defendant presented insufficient evidence and failed
to establish or prove the legal significance of the
institution of traditional marriage and the need to protect
traditional marriage as a fundamental structure in society.

120. There is a public interest in the rights and
well-being of children and families. See H.R.S. Chapters
571 and 577.

121. A father and a mother can, and do, provide his or her
child with unique paternal and maternal contributions which
are important, though not essential, to the development of
a happy, healthy and well-adjusted child.

122. Further, an intact family environment consisting of a
child and his or her mother and father presents a less
burdened environment for the development of a happy,
healthy and well-adjusted child.

There certainly is a benefit to children which comes from
being raised by their mother and father in an intact and
relatively stress free home.

123. However, there is diversity in the structure and
configuration of families. In Hawaii, and elsewhere,
children are being raised by their natural parents, single
parents, step-parents, grandparents, adopted parents, hanai
parents, foster parents, gay and lesbian parents, and
same-sex couples.

124. There are also families in Hawaii, and elsewhere,
which do not have children as family members.

125. The evidence presented by Plaintiffs and Defendant
establishes that the single most important factor in the
development of a happy, healthy and well-adjusted child is
the nurturing relationship between parent and child.

More specifically, it is the quality of parenting or the
"sensitive care-giving" described by David Brodzinsky,
which is the most significant factor that affects the
development of a child.

126. The sexual orientation of parents is not in and of
itself an indicator of parental fitness.

127. The sexual orientation of parents does not
automatically disqualify them from being good, fit, loving
or successful parents.

128. The sexual orientation of parents is not in and of
itself an indicator of the overall adjustment and
development of children.

129. Gay and lesbian parents and same-sex couples have the
potential to raise children that are happy, healthy and
well-adjusted.

130. Gay and lesbian parents and same-sex couples are
allowed to adopt children, provide foster care and to raise
and care for children.

131. Gay and lesbian parents and same-sex couples can
provide children with a nurturing relationship and a
nurturing environment which is conducive to the development
of happy, healthy and well-adjusted children.

132. Gay and lesbian parents and same-sex couples can be as
fit and loving parents, as non-gay men and women and
different-sex couples.

133. While children of gay and lesbian parents and same-sex
couples may experience symptoms of stress and other issues
related to their non-traditional family structure, the
available scientific data, studies and clinical experience
presented at trial suggests that children of gay and
lesbian parents and same-sex couples tend to adjust and do
develop-in a normal fashion.

134. Significantly, Defendant has failed to establish a
causal link between allowing same-sex marriage and adverse
effects upon the optimal development of children.

135. As noted herein, there is a benefit to children which
comes from being raised by their mother and father in an
intact and relatively stress-free home.

However, in this case, Defendant has not proved that
allowing same-sex marriage will probably result in
significant differences in the development or outcomes of
children raised by gay or lesbian parents and same-sex
couples, as compared to children raised by different-sex
couples or their biological parents.

In fact, Defendant's expert, Kenneth Pruett, agreed, in
pertinent part, that gay and lesbian parents "are doing a
good job" raising children and, most importantly, "the kids
are turning out just fine."

136. Contrary to Defendant's assertions, if same-sex
marriage is allowed, the children being raised by gay or
lesbian parents and same-sex couples may be assisted,
because they may obtain certain protections and benefits
that come with or become available as a result of marriage.
See Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 560-561, 852 P.2d 44, 59
(1993), for a list of noteworthy marital rights and
benefits.

137. In Hawaii, and elsewhere, same-sex couples can, and
do, have successful, loving and committed relationships.

138. In Hawaii, and elsewhere, people marry for a variety
of reasons including, but not limited to the following: (1)
having or raising children; (2) stability and commitment;
(3) Pmne1onal closeness (4) intimacy and monogamy; (5) the
establishment of a framework for a long-term relationship;
(6) personal significance; (7) recognition by society; and
(8) certain legal and economic protections, benefits and
obligations. See Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 560-561, 852
P.2d 44, 59 (1993) for a list of noteworthy marital rights
and benefits.

In Hawaii, and elsewhere. gay men and lesbian women share
this same mix of reasons for wanting to be able to marry.

139. Simply put, Defendant has failed to establish or prove
that the public interest in the well-being of children and
families, or the optimal development of children will be
adversely affected by same-sex marriage.

140. If any of the above findings of fact shall be deemed
conclusions of law, the Court intends that every such
finding shall he construed as a conclusion of law.


CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter and
the parties to this action. Venue is proper in the First
Circuit Court. HRS 603-21.5 and 603-36.

2. The trier of fact determines the credibility of a
witness and the weight to be given to his or her testimony.
In pertinent part, the trier of fact may consider the
witness' demeanor and manner while on the stand, the
character of his or her testimony as being probable or
improbable, inconsistencies, patent omissions and
discrepancies in his or her testimony or between the
testimony of other witnesses, contradictory testimony or
evidence, his or her interest in the outcome to the case
and other factors bearing upon the truthfulness or
untruthfulness of the witness' testimony. Younq Ah Chor v.
Dulles, 270 F.2d 338! 341 (9th Cir., 1959); and Nani Koolau
Co. v. Komo Construction, Inc., 5 Haw. App. 137, 139-140,
681 P.2d 580, 584 (1984). In a non-jury trial, the
credibility of a witness is a matter for the trial court to
determine and the court can accept or reject the testimony
of a witness in whole or in part. Lee v. Kimura, 2 Haw.
App. 538, 544, 634 P.2d 1043, 1047-1048 (1981).

3. Defendant's burden in this case is to "overcome the
presumption that HRS 572-1 is unconstitutional by
demonstrating that it furthers a compelling state interest
and is narrowly drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgements of
constitutional rights." Baehr, 74 Haw. 530, 583, 852 P.2d
44, 74 (1993) citing Naqle v. Board of Education, 63 Haw.
389, 392, 629 P.2d 109, 111 (1987) and Holdman v. Olim, 59
Haw. 346, 349, 581 P.2d 1164, 1167 (1978).

4. There is no fundamental right to marriage for same sex
couples under article I, section 6 of the Hawaii
Constitution. Marriage is a state-conferred legal status
which gives rise to certain rights and benefits. Baehr v.
Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 557 and 560-561, 852 P.2d 44, 57
(1993).

5. The Department of Health, State of Hawaii, has the
exclusive authority to issue licenses to marriage
applicants. Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 560, 852 P.2d 44,
59 (1993).

6. There are certain rights and benefits which accompany
the state-conferred legal status of marriage See Baehr v.
Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 560-561, 852 P.2d 44, 59 (1993) for a
list of noteworthy marital rights and benefits.

7. If Plaintiffs, and other same-sex couples, were allowed
the state-conferred legal status of marriage, they would be
conferred with these and other marital rights and benefits.

8. HRS 572-1, on its face and as applied, regulates access
to the status of marriage and its concomitant rights and
benefits on the basis of the applicants' sex. As such, HRS
Sec. 572-1 establishes a sex-based classification. Baehr v.
Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 572, 852 P.2d 44, 64 (1993).

9. Sex is a "suspect category" for purposes of equal
protection analysis under article I, section 5 of the
Hawaii Constitution. Consequently, HRS 572-1 is subject to
the "strict scrutiny" test. Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530,
580, 852 P.2d 44, 67 (1993).

10. Defendant, rather than Plaintiffs, carries a heavy
burden of justification. Nachtwey v. Doi, 59 Haw. 430, 435,
583 P.2d 955, 959 (1978) citing San Antonio School District
v. Rodriquez, 411 U.S. 1, 16-17, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 1288, 36
L.Ed.2d 16, 33 (1973).

11. Specifically, HRS 572-1 is presumed to be
unconstitutional and the burden is on Defendant to show
that the statute's sex-based classification is justified by
compelling state interests and the statute is narrowly
drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgments of constitutional
rights. Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 583, 852 P.2d 44, 67
(1993), reconsideration and clarification granted in part,
74 Haw. 645, 646, 852 P.2d 74 (1993).

12. Article IV section 1 of the U.S. Constitution provides,
in pertinent part, that all states must recognize the
"public acts, records and judicial proceedings of every
other state."

Whether other states will recognize or avoid recognizing
same-sex marriages which take place in Hawaii and the
consequences to Hawaii residents of other states'
recognition or non-recognition of same-sex marriage (and
all of the rights and benefits associated with marriage) is
an important issue.

However, except for asking the court to take judicial
notice of the Defense of Marriage Act, P.L. 1-4-199
("DOMA"), Defendant introduced little or no other evidence
with regard to this significant issue of comity and
same-sex marriage, conflict-of-laws, and/or the effects, if
any, of the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S.
Constitution.

13. Except for the affidavit testimony of Kenneth K. M.
Ling and Michael L. Meaney, which provided statistical,
budgetary and operational information regarding the Family
Court of the First Circuit Court and the Child Support
Enforcement Agency, State of Hawaii, respectively Defendant
presented little or no other evidence which addressed how
same-sex marriage would adversely affect the public fisc.
Defendant did not offer any testimony which explained the
significance of the above and Defendant did not
specifically explain or establish how same-sex marriage
would adversely impact the Family Court or the Child
Support Enforcement Agency.

14. Defendant presented meager evidence with regard to the
importance of the institution of traditional marriage, the
benefits which that relationship provides to the community
and, most importantly, the adverse effects, if any, which
same-sex marriage would have on the institution of
traditional marriage and how those adverse effects would
impact on the community and society. The evidentiary record
in this case is inadequate to thoughtfully examine and
decide these significant issues.

15. Finally, Defendant's argument that legalized
prostitution, incest and polygamy will occur if same-sex
marriage is allowed disregards existing statutes and
established precedent [for example, State v. Mueller, 66
Haw. 616, 671 P.2d 1351 (1983) (upholding ban on
prostitution)] and the Supreme Court's acknowledgment of
compelling reasons to prevent and prohibit marriage under
circumstances such as incest. Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530,
562 n.19, 852 P.2d 44, 59 n.19 (1993).

16. In Dean v. District of Columbia, 653 A.2d 307 (D.C.App.
1995), two homosexual males filed a complaint against the
District of Columbia which sought an injunction to require
the Clerk of the Superior Court to issue them a marriage
license. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor
of the District of Columbia. On appeal, the District of
Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's order
granting summary judgment.

In the Dean case, Judge Ferren wrote a lengthy opinion
concurring in part and dissenting in part, and in which the
majority joined in part.

Judge Ferren would have reversed summary judgment and
remanded the case for trial to decide (1) the level of
scrutiny constitutionally required, and (2) whether the
District of Columbia has demonstrated a compelling or
substantial enough governmental interest to justify
refusing plaintiffs a marriage license. The portion of
Judge Ferren's opinion which deals with the question of
whether the District of Columbia could demonstrate at trial
a substantial or compelling state interest is useful and
informative. In pertinent part, Judge Ferren wrote the
following.


[I]f the government cannot cite actual prejudice to the
public majority from a change in the law to allow same-sex
marriages . . . then the public majority will not have a
sound basis for claiming a compelling, or even a
substantial, state interest in withholding the marriage
statute from same-sex couples; a mere feeling of distaste
or even revulsion at what someone else is or does, simply
because it offends majority values without causing concrete
harm, cannot justify inherently discriminatory legislation
against members of a constitutionally protected class -- as
the history of constitutional rulings against racially
discriminatory legislation makes clear.

Suppose, on the other hand, that scientifically credible
"deterrence" evidence were forthcoming at trial, so that
either the heterosexual majority or the homosexual minority
would be prejudiced in some concrete way, depending on
whether the marriage statute was, or was not, available to
homosexual couples. In that case, the ultimate question of
whose values should be enforced, framed in terms of what a
substantial or compelling state interest really is, would
pose the hardest possible question for the court as
majority and minority interests resoundingly clash.


Dean at 653 A.2d at 355-356 (1995) (footnotes omitted).

17. In this case, the evidence presented by Defendant does
not establish or prove that same-sex marriage will result
in prejudice or harm to an important public or governmental
interest.

18. Defendant has not demonstrated a basis for his claim of
the existence of compelling state interests sufficient to
justify withholding the legal status of marriage from
Plaintiffs.

As discussed hereinabove, Defendant has failed to present
sufficient credible evidence which demonstrates that the
public interest in the well-being of children and families,
or the optimal development of children would be adversely
affected by same-sex marriage. Nor has Defendant
demonstrated how same-sex marriage would adversely affect
the public fisc, the state interest in assuring recognition
of Hawaii marriages in other states, the institution of
traditional marriage, or any other important public or
governmental interest.

The evidentiary record presented in this case does not
justify the sex-based classification of HRS 572-1.

Therefore, the court specifically finds and concludes, as
a matter of law, that Defendant has failed to sustain his
burden to overcome the presumption that HRS 572-1 is
unconstitutional by demonstrating or proving that the
statute furthers a compelling state interest.

19. Further, even assuming arguendo that Defendant was able
to demonstrate that the sex-based classification of HRS
572-1 is justified because it furthers a compelling state
interest, Defendant has failed to establish that HRS 572-1
is narrowly tailored to avoid unnecessary abridgments of
constitutional rights. Nachtwey v. Doi, 59 Haw. 430, 435,
583 P.2d 955, 958 (1978) (citations omitted) (quoting San
Antonio School District v. Rodriquez, 411 U.S. 1, 16-17, 93
S.Ct. 1278, 1288, 36 L.Ed.2d 16, 33 (1973).

20. If any of the above conclusions of law shall be deemed
findings of fact, the court intends that each such
conclusion be construed as a finding of fact.

21. Based on the foregoing, in accordance with the mandate
of the Hawaii Supreme Court, and applying the law to the
evidence presented at trial, judgment shall be entered in
favor of Plaintiffs Ninia Baehr, Genora Dancel, Tammy
Rodrigues, Antoinette Pregil, Pat Lagon and Joseph Melillo
as follows:


IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED THAT:

1. The sex-based classification in HRS 572-1, on its face
and as applied, is unconstitutional and in violation of the
equal protection clause of article I, section 5 of the
Hawaii Constitution.

2. Defendant Lawrence H. Miike, as Director of Department
of Health, State of Hawaii, and his agents, and any person
in acting in concert with Defendant or claiming by or
through him, is enjoined from denying an application for a
marriage license solely because the applicants are of the
same sex.

3. To the extent permitted by law, costs shall be imposed
against Defendant and awarded in favor of Plaintiffs.

DATED: Honolulu. Hawaii. December 3, 1996.

<H2>Texaco Discrimination Case</H2>

<P>Less than two weeks after it was disclosed that top Texaco executives had been caught on tape apparently plotting to destroy documents and using racial slurs against African-Americans, Texaco agreed Nov. 15 to pay $176.1 million to settle a 2-year-old race discrimination suit.</P>

<P>At a news conference in Washington, an attorney for the plaintiffs said the settlement included a $115 million cash payment, $26.1 million in pay raises over five years for black employees and $35 million in sensitivity and diversity training programs. The following are some of the key documents in the case.</P>


<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><A HREF="diversity_plan.html">Texaco's Diversity Plan</a><br>
Civil rights leaders halted a nationwide boycott of Texaco following the oil company's pledge to give women and minorities better treatment. The following is Texaco's new diversity policy outlined in a press release on December 18, 1996.</P>



<P><A HREF="lundwald.html">Former Texaco Executive Indicted</a><BR>

Former Texaco executive, Richard Lundwall, has been charged with obstruction of justice in connection with the racial discrimination lawsuit against Texaco. Lundwall secretly taped conversations in which Texaco executives allegedly belittled minority groups and plotted to conceal and shred documents crucial to the plaintiffs' case. Lundwall turned over these tapes to plaintiffs' attorneys after he was fired from Texaco in August. The following is the November 19, 1996 Department of Justice press release along with the criminal complaint.</P>  



<P><A HREF="settlement.html">The Settlement Agreement</A><BR>

Texaco settles the largest ever racial discrimination suit, agreeing to pay $115 million to approximately 1,400 class members, $26.1 million in raises over the next five years to minority workers, and $35 million to fund a Task Force to implement changes in the company's human resources programs.</P>

<P><A HREF="shareholder.html">Derivative Suit by Shareholders</A><BR>

Edith Citron and Martin Philip are lead plaintiffs in a shareholder's derivative action brought against Texaco. The complaint charges that the company's named directors and officers "grossly" mismanaged the company, breached their fiduciary duty, and damaged Texaco. As a result of this mismanagement, plaintiffs claim that "the image, reputation and financial condition of Texaco have been damaged, it has been exposed to substantial financial liability, it was the target of an extensive investigation by the [EEOC] regarding possible violations of the federal and state civil rights laws, as well as having been named in several litigations alleging violations of the civil rights statutes."</P>



<P><A HREF="report.html">Report from Independent Investigator</A><BR>
Texaco released this report titled "Interim Report of Independent Counsel" appointed to investigate allegations that Texaco executives had used racial slurs in a meeting and discussed destroying documents. This interim report addressed the first of these allegations, concluding that executives were misquoted and that the references to "black jelly beans" did not appear to have been intended as derogatory to African-Americans.</P>

<P><A HREF="order.html">Order to Show Cause</A><BR>
Attorneys representing African-American Texaco employees successfully sought an order to show cause why Texaco should not be sanctioned for discovery abuse. Also included is an affidavit from one of plaintiffs' counsel describing audio tapes in which Texaco executives disparage minority employees and discuss shredding and purging certain documents, as well as excerpts from those tapes.</P>

<P>The estate of slain civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is 
suing CBS for violation of the estate's copyright on the historic "I Have A 
Dream" speech. Dr. King delivered the the speech to a crowd of 200,000 
in August 1963, and, according to the complaint, registered three different 
versions of the speech with the U.S. Copyright Office. The King estate 
alleges that a videotape on the civil rights movement produced and 
distributed by CBS, which includes footage of most Dr, King's speech, 
violates their copyright. Here is the November 19, 1996 suit.</P>  
 
<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT>  
<PRE>  
 
 
IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA 
ATLANTA DIVISION 
 
 
ESTATE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., INC.,  
 
Plaintiff, 
 
v. 
 
CBS INC., 
 
Defendant. 
 
 
CIVIL ACTION 
 
FILE NO. 1 96-CV-3052 
 
 
COMPLAINT FOR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT - JURY 
DEMANDED  
 
 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
 
1. 
 
This is an action for copyright infringement arising under the Copyright 
Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C. Sec. 101 et. seq. This court has jurisdiction of this 
action under 28 U.S.C. Secs. 1331 and 1338(a).  
 
2. 
 
Defendant resides or may be found in this district and venue is proper in 
this district under 28 U.S.C. Secs. 1391(b) and 1400(a).  
 
 
PARTIES 
 
3. 
 
Plaintiff, the Estate of Martin Luther King, Jr., Inc. (the "Estate"), is a 
corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Georgia, 
having its principal place of business in Atlanta, Georgia.  
 
4. 
 
Upon information and belief, Defendant, CBS Inc. ("Defendant"), is a 
New York corporation with its principal place of business located at 51 
West 52nd Street, New York, New York. Defendant resides in this district.  
 
 
BACKGROUND FACTS 
 
5. 
 
The Estate is, and at ail times relevant to the matters alleged in this 
complaint has been, the owner of the copyrights in various speeches and 
other literary works by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. ("Dr. King"). Among 
those works, the copyrights in which are owned by plaintiff, is the speech 
titled and universally known as "I Have a Dream," delivered by Dr. King 
on the afternoon of August 28, 1963, before some 200,000 people gathered 
before the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.  
 
6. 
 
The historic "I Have a Dream" speech was instantly acclaimed throughout 
the world and is heralded today as one of the greatest orations of the 
Twentieth Century. The immediate reaction to the speech is, perhaps, best 
summarized by an article that appeared on the front page of The New York 
Times by James Reston, former Chief of the Times Washington Bureau, 
the day following Dr. King's 1963 delivery:  
 
"I Have a Dream" he cried again and again. Each time the dream was a 
promise out of our ancient articles of faith: Phrases from the Constitution, 
lines from the great anthem of the nation, guarantees from the Bill of 
Rights, all ending with a vision that they might one day all come true.  
 
* * * 
 
Dr. King touched all of the themes of the day, only better than anybody 
else.  
 
7. 
 
On or about September 3, 1963, Dr. King registered his "I Have a Dream" 
speech with the U.S. Copyright Office, by mailing a copy of the speech, 
along with an application form and check for the requisite registration 
fees, to the Copyright Office. Dr. King registered his work as a "Lecture or 
Similar Production Prepared for Oral Delivery" - the category established 
by the Copyright Office for speeches. In fact, ultimately three different 
versions of Dr. King's "I Have a Dream" speech were registered with the 
Copyright Office to protect against unlawful infringement by those 
seeking to profit from his writings. Copies of the Registrations of 
Copyright as issued by the U.S. Copyright Office under Registration 
Numbers 16099, 653834, and 688840 are attached as Exhibits A, B, and 
C, respectively.  
 
8. 
 
In the years immediately after the speech was delivered, would-be 
profiteers attempted to pirate Dr. King's copyrighted work for their own 
financial gain. In October of 1963, less than two months after the 
Washington March, Dr. King was forced to sue a record company for 
selling phonographs of "I Have A Dream." In ruling for Dr. King, a federal 
court in New York observed that once a speech by someone "in the 
forefront of public life" has been delivered and the "immediate news 
importance has passed," the speech belongs "appropriately to [the] 
creator." King v. Mister Maestro Inc., 224 F. Supp. 101, 107 (S.D.N.Y. 
1963).  
 
9. 
 
Dr. King's copyrighted works are part of his legacy, and Dr. King 
recognized the importance of protecting his copyrights in his writings. 
According to records in the Library of Congress, prior to his death Dr. 
King personally registered his copyrights in many other speeches, books, 
sermons and articles, including his 1965 "Address at the Conclusion of the 
Selma to Montgomery March" and his 1967 "Declaration of Independence 
from the War in Vietnam."  
 
10. 
 
On December 6, 1991, Coretta-Scott King, as administratrix for the Estate 
of Dr. King, renewed the claims of copyright reflected in the three 
Registrations of Copyright for the "I Have a Dream" speech pursuant to 
the provisions of 17 U.S.C. Sec. 304. Copies of the Certificates of 
Renewal Registration as issued by the U.S. Register of Copyrights to Ms. 
King are attached as Exhibits D, E, and E.  
 
11. 
 
The Estate is currently, and at all times relevant has been, the proprietor of 
the copyrights in the speech "I Have a Dream," which has been produced 
and distributed in conformity with the provisions of the Copyright Act of 
1976 and all of the laws governing copyright.  
 
12. 
 
Although the Estate and the King family strive to protect Dr. King's 
copyrighted works from unauthorized, for-profit misappropriation, the 
Estate and the King family historically and routinely have permitted 
schools, charities, and other non-profit organizations to use Dr. King's 
copyrighted works on a royalty-free basis.  
 
13. 
 
Defendant is a diversified television entertainment company with 
operations throughout the United States.  
 
14. 
 
On information and belief, Defendant, directly or through a licensee, agent 
or assign, has produced, distributed and performed, and continues to 
produce, distribute and perform, for the home video, television and other 
commercial markets, a video cassette tape (the "Tape Product") that 
contains and reproduces the great majority and the heart of the copyrighted 
"I Have a Dream" speech. On information and belief, Defendant sells or 
authorizes the sale of videocassette copies of the Tape Product for profit 
and licenses its exhibition for profit through commercial television.  
 
15. 
 
Defendant never obtained permission from the Estate to market and 
exploit to the home video or television industries copies of the "I Have a 
Dream" speech by means of the Tape Product. No fee was paid and no 
acknowledgment of the Estate's copyrights was included, as required by 
the Estate as a condition of any such publication or exploitation. A copy of 
the Tape Product is attached as Exhibit G.  
 
16. 
 
On information and belief, Defendant routinely registers and vigorously 
enforces its own copyrights. In fact, Defendant and its subsidiaries have 
brought copyright infringement actions when their own works were 
infringed.  
 
17. 
 
Defendant's violation of Plaintiff's copyrights in the "I Have a Dream" 
speech is contrary to Defendant's scrupulous efforts to protect and enforce 
its own copyright interests. Ironically, Defendant's Tape Product itself 
begins with a "WARNING" to all viewers that unauthorized reproduction 
of the program contained within would constitute a violation of federal 
criminal law.  
 
18. 
 
Exacerbating Defendant's wrongful conduct is the fact that, without so 
much as acknowledging Dr. King's registered copyrights in his "I Have a 
Dream" speech, which constitutes the focal point of one of the 
documentaries in Defendant's Tape Product, Defendant includes its own 
notice of copyright at the conclusion of the program, suggesting that 
Defendant is the owner of the copyrighted material contained in the Tape 
Product.  
 
19. 
 
Defendant, directly or through a licensee, agent or assign, knowingly and 
willfully copied, distributed and performed for profit the "I Have a Dream" 
speech, and continues to engage in these acts.  
 
20. 
 
On information and belief, the Estate has lost and will continue to lose 
revenues from the sale of unlawful copies of the Tape Product containing 
the "I Have a Dream" speech. Defendant's wrongful conduct also has 
deprived and will continue to deprive the Estate of opportunities for 
licensing its copyrights and expanding its goodwill and has and will create 
the false and damaging impression that the work "I Have a Dream" is 
without copyright protection and may be copied and exploited freely.  
 
21. 
 
On information and belief, Defendant, directly or through a licensee, agent 
or assign, continues to reproduce, distribute, perform and offer for sale, 
unlicensed copies of the Tape Product, despite demands by the Estate and 
its counsel that Defendant account to the Estate and enter into a license as 
a condition for such further activity.  
 
22. 
 
The natural, probable and foreseeable result of Defendant's wrongful 
conduct has been and will continue to be to deprive the Estate of the 
benefits of licensing its copyrights and other products, to deprive the 
Estate of goodwill and to injure the Estate's relations with present and 
prospective licensees.  
 
23. 
 
As a direct and proximate result of the acts of Defendant alleged above, 
the Estate already has suffered irreparable damage and sustained lost 
revenues. The Estate has no adequate remedy at law to redress the injuries 
that Defendant has caused. The Estate will continue to suffer irreparable 
damage and sustain lost revenues until Defendant's actions alleged above 
are enjoined by this court.  
 
24. 
 
By its actions alleged above, Defendant has infringed and will continue to 
infringe the Estate's copyrights in the speech "I Have a Dream" by 
producing, distributing, performing and placing upon the market direct 
copies of the work in its Tape Product.  
 
25. 
 
The Estate is entitled to an injunction restraining Defendant, its officers, 
agents and employees, and all persons acting in concert with them, from 
engaging in any further such acts in violation of the copyright laws.  
 
26. 
 
The Estate is further entitled to recover from Defendant the damages, 
including attorneys' fees, it has sustained and will sustain, and any gains, 
profits and advantages obtained by Defendant as a result of Defendant's 
acts of infringement alleged above. At present, the amount of such 
damages, gains, profits and advantages cannot be fully ascertained by the 
Estate.  
 
 
REQUEST FOR RELIEF 
 
WHEREFORE, the Estate requests judgment against the Defendant as 
follows:  
 
1. 
 
That the court find that Defendant has infringed the Estate's copyrights in 
the speech "I Have a Dream."  
 
2. 
 
That the court find a substantial likelihood that Defendant will continue to 
infringe the Estate's copyrights in the speech "I Have a Dream" unless 
enjoined from doing so.  
 
3. 
 
That Defendant, its officers, directors, agents, servants and employees, and 
all other persons in active concert, privily or participation with them, be 
enjoined from directly or indirectly infringing the Estate's copyrights in 
the speech "I Have a Dream," or any works derived or copied from it.  
 
4. 
 
That Defendant be ordered at its expense to affix to each copy of the Tape 
Product in its inventory, and upon all other copies in its possession, 
custody or control, a notice in a form, format and location to be approved 
by this court, listing all speeches of Dr. King copied in whole or in part by 
Defendant, and informing Defendant's customers that the speech "I Have a 
Dream" and all such works of Dr. King are protected by copyright, and 
that permission to reprint such speeches and works of Dr. King, or 
significant portions thereof, must be secured in writing from the Estate or 
its authorized representative.  
 
5. 
 
That Defendant be required to account to the Estate and this court as to the 
disposition, and the proceeds therefrom, of all copies of the Tape Product, 
and any other infringed or compromised works or properties of the Estate.  
 
6. 
 
That Defendant be required to account to the Estate and this court for all 
gains, profits and advantages derived from its acts of infringement of the 
speech "I Have a Dream" and any other works of the Estate.  
 
7. 
 
That judgment be entered for the Estate and against Defendant for the 
Estate's actual damages according to proof, and for any profits attributable 
to infringements of the Estate's copyrights, in accordance with proof.  
 
8. 
 
That judgment be entered for the Estate and against Defendant for 
statutory damages in the amount of $100,000 for each violation based 
upon Defendant's acts of infringement, pursuant to the Copyright Act of 
1976, in particular 17 U.S.C. Sec. 504(c).  
 
9. 
 
That the Estate have judgment against Defendant for the Estate's costs and 
attorneys' fees as authorized by the Copyright Act of 1976, in particular 17 
U.S.C. Sec. 505.  
 
10. 
 
That the Estate have a trial by jury on all issues triable to a jury.  
 
11. 
 
That the court grant such other, further and different relief as the court 
deems proper under the circumstances.

<P>Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, in a speech before The Catholic University of 
America, advocates literal interpretation of the Constitution, declaring "[t]he words are 
the law." On the issue of the right-to-die, which will be argued before the court this 
session, Scalia says, "the Constitution means what it ought to mean...Absolutely plain 
that there is no right to die; there were laws against suicide."  Here is the text of the 
October 18, 1996 speech.</P> 
 
 
<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT> 
<PRE> 
 
"A Theory of Constitution Interpretation"  
 
Remarks at The Catholic University of America Washington, D.C. Oct. 18, 1996  
 
by Justice Antonin Scalia 
 
[What is the object of the Court?] This is a matter of interest to not only judges and 
lawyers, but any intelligent American citizen, philosopher or not. What do you think your 
judges are doing when they interpret the Constitution? It's sad to tell you after 200 years, 
there is not agreement on this rather fundamental question: What is the object of the 
enterprise?  
 
I belong to a school, a small but hardy school, called "textualists" or "originalists." That 
used to be "constitutional orthodoxy" in the United States. The theory of originalism 
treats a constitution like a statute, and gives it the meaning that its words were understood 
to bear at the time they were promulgated. You will sometimes hear it described as the 
theory of original intent. You will never hear me refer to original intent, because as I say I 
am first of all a textualist, and secondly an originalist. If you are a textualist, you don't 
care about the intent, and I don't care if the framers of the Constitution had some secret 
meaning in mind when they adopted its words. I take the words as they were promulgated 
to the people of the United States, and what is the fairly understood meaning of those 
words.  
 
I do the same with statutes, by the way, which is why I don't use legislative history. The 
words are the law. I think that's what is meant by a government of laws, not of men. We 
are bound not by the intent of our legislators, but by the laws which they enacted, which 
are set forth in words, of course. As I say, until recently this was constitutional 
orthodoxy. Everyone at least said that: That the Constitution was that anchor, that rock, 
that unchanging institution that forms the American polity. Immutability was regarded as 
its characteristic. What it meant when it was adopted it means today, and its meaning 
doesn't change just because we think that meaning is no longer adequate to our times. If 
it's inadequate, we can amend it. That's why there's an amendment provision. That was 
constitutional orthodoxy. When I say constitutional orthodoxy, I don't mean its just 
judges and lawyers. Judges and lawyers are not very important. It's ultimately the 
American people. What do they think this document is?  
 
That they thought the way I think is demonstrated by the 19th amendment, adopted in 
1920. That is the amendment which guaranteed women the right to vote. As you know, 
there was a national campaign of "suffragettes" to get this constitutional amendment 
adopted, a very big deal to get a constitutional amendment adopted. Why? Why did they 
go through all that trouble? If people then thought the way people think now, there would 
have been no need. There was an equal protection clause, right there in the Constitution 
in 1920. As an abstract matter, what in the world could be a greater denial of equal 
protection in a democracy than denial of the franchise. [sic] And so why didn't these 
people just come to the court and say, "This is a denial of equal protection"? Because 
they didn't think that way. Equal protection could mean that everybody has to have the 
vote. It could mean that. It could mean a lot of things in the abstract. It could meant that 
women must be sent into combat, for example. It could meant that have to have unisex 
toilets in public buildings. But does it mean those things? Of course it doesn't mean those 
things. It could have meant all those things. But it just never did. That was not its 
understood meaning. And since that was not its meaning in 1871, it's not its meaning 
today. The meaning doesn't change.  
 
There have been a lot of reasons why you could deny the vote, not only on the basis of 
sex, but also on the basis of property ownership. On the basis of literacy. It was never 
regarded as a denial of equal protection. And since it never was, it isn't. That's how they 
thought. Now you know that that wouldn't happen today. You know that that issue today 
would be resolved in the Supreme Court. People would come to the court and would say, 
"The equal protection clause should mean this, and therefore it does meant that. 
Nevermind what it originally meant."  
 
How much things have changed is reflected in our case law, most clearly in our 8th 
amendment jurisprudence. The 8th amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishments. 
Some of our cases in recent years say that what constitutes cruel and unusual punishments 
depends on the age. What comes with the 8th amendment changes according to, and this 
the phrase that our opinions use, "to reflect the evolving standards of decency of a 
maturing society." Every day, in every way, we get better and better. Now you know that 
Pollyanish attitude is not the attitude that is possessed by people who adopt a bill of 
rights. People who adopt a bill of rights know that societies not only evolve, they also rot. 
And they are worried that future generations may not have the integrity and the wisdom 
that they do, so they say, "Some things we are going to freeze in, and they will not 
change." But no, with all this development, away from originalism, has [sic] occurred 
within the past forty years. [sic] Today, we say in our opinions, We believe, the court 
believes, and worst of all the American people believe that not only the 8th amendment 
but the whole Bill of Rights, the whole Constitution, "reflects the evolving standards of 
decency of a maturing society." Or, to put it more simply, the Constitution means what it 
ought to mean. Not what it did mean, but what it ought to mean. And so, all sorts of 
rights that clearly did not exist at the time of the Constitution today. It's plain that the 
right to an abortion was not thought to exist in 1791 or at the time that post-Civil War 
amendments were adopted; absolutely plain. There were laws against them in all the 
states.  
 
Absolutely plain that there is no right to die; there were laws against suicide.  And you 
can go right down the list.  
 
This is not, I caution you, a liberal versus conservative issue.  Conservatives are fully as 
prepared to create new rights under this evolutionist theory of the Constitution, as liberals 
are.  Last term, we created a big brand new one that the liberals like, when we held in 
Rohmer that a state could not be constitutional amendment prohibit its subunits from 
providing special treatment on the basis of homosexuality.  Liberals like that one.  But the 
same term, in fact within weeks of it, I believe, we also said that there is a federal 
constitutional right, which my Constitution doesn't reflect, not to have an excessive jury 
verdict.  We struck down excessive punitive damages.  Now there have been excessive 
jury verdicts for over 200 years. Nobody ever thought that it was a federal matter, that it 
violated the federal Constitution.  Punitive damages are no different in that respect from 
excessive compensatory damages.  So it's not liberal/conservative.  
 
It's modernist versus the traditional view of the Constitution.  It should not be thought, 
although it is often argued, that this new way of looking at the Constitution is desirable 
because it promotes needed flexibility.  That's the argument you sometimes hear.  The 
argument is usually made in anthropomorphic terms, like the people who talk about the 
stock market is resting for a new assault at the 4000 level.  They do the same thing with 
Constitution.  The argument is "The Constitution is meant for a living society.  If it could 
not grow and evolve with the society, it would become brittle and snap.  You have to 
provide the flexibility."  A very plausible argument.  It sounds wonderful until you start 
to think, "Now, wait a minute.  Do these people, who want to chuck away the old 
original, constitution, is it flexibility they're looking for?"  What was the situation, before 
Roe vs. Wade?  If you wanted a right to an abortion, create that right the way a 
democratic society creates most rights.  Pass a law.  If you don't want it, pass a law 
against it.  Or capital punishment.  I have sat with three colleagues on the Supreme Court 
who thought that capital punishment is unconstitutional.  Even though the Constitution 
mentions capital punishment.  The clause you're all familiar with: "No person shall be 
deprived of life, liberty or property without due process..."  What do you think they're 
talking about?  They're talking about the death penalty.  And elsewhere, it says you shall 
not be sentenced for a capital crime without a grand jury indictment.  What do think 
they're talking about?  They're talking about the death penalty, clearly approved in the 
text of the Constitution. It doesn't matter.  For the constitutional evolutionist, everyday is 
a new day.  And so, the death penalty may be unconstitutional.  Now does that produce 
flexibility? Under the original disposition, you want to have the death penalty?  Enact it.  
You don't want it?  Repeal it.  That's flexibility.  
 
So these people who go around talking about the need for growing and bending -- that's 
nonsense.  What these people want is to impose a view of things on the whole society 
from coast to coast, and it is most quickly and most effectively done through the 
Constitution.  Now there's several vices to a non-originalist approach to the text of the 
Constitution.  The first difficulty with it, and the most important really, is the question of 
legitimacy.  The Constitution of the United States nowhere says that the Supreme Court 
shall be the last word on what the Constitution means.  Or that the Supreme Court shall 
have the authority to disregard statutes enacted by the congress of the United States on 
the ground that in its view they do not comport with the Constitution.  It doesn't say that 
anywhere.  We made it up.  Now, we made it up very sensibly, because what we said was 
"Look, a constitution is a law, it's sort of a super-law."  This is what Marbury v. Madison 
said.  And what the law means is the job of courts. They have to say it all the time.  
Courts frequently have to try to reconcile conflicting statutes, for example.  In doing so, 
they have to interpret them.  If they cannot reconcile them, they simply say the more 
recent one prevails over the older one.  And in the case of a "super- law" such as the 
Constitution, when they can't reconcile the law and the "super-law", the constitution 
prevails. And, says John Marshall, "That's what courts do.  It is assuredly the function of 
the courts to say what the law is."  
 
It's lawyer's work.  But if that is not what the Constitution is, if it is not a text, like a 
statute, which means what it meant when it was passed.  If it is rather sort of an empty 
bottle that contains the aspirations of the society, just all sorts of wonderful aspirations, 
the precise content of which is quite indeterminate.  No cruel and unusual punishment 
today, it may mean the death penalty is ok, tomorrow it won't.  Due process of law, 
whatever that means.  We're just in love with these abstractions, and the Supreme Court 
in the future shall decree for us what these abstractions mean.  Now if that's what the 
Constitution is, it's a sort of list of aspirations, not a real law, then Marbury v. Madison is 
wrong.  
 
I'm not very good at determinating what the aspirations of the American people are.  I am 
so out of touch with the American people.  I don't even try to be in touch.  People 
mention movie stars and I don't know who they're talking about.  I get a blank look on my 
face.  If you want somebody who's in touch with what are the evolving standards of 
decency that reflect a maturing society, ask the congress.  And of course that's the way it's 
done in the United Kingdom.  The parliament says what the English constitution consists 
of.  So if you really believe in the evolving theory, we made a mistake in Marbury v. 
Madison, and the Supreme Court shouldn't stick its nose into this stuff at all.  It should be 
up to the congress to determine where we evolve.  What makes you think a committee of 
nine lawyers ought to tell where we're evolving to.  I mean, I'm a philosophy minor, but I 
didn't train as a philosopher. I'm just a lawyer, just between you and me.  That's what I'm 
really good at.  The second problem with non-originalism is suggested by what I call it.  
By the name, "non-originalism."  
 
There is saying in politics that you can't beat somebody with nobody.  No matter how bad 
the candidate run by the other party is, unless you put somebody up you're going to loss.  
It's the same thing for philosophies of constitutional interpretation.  If you don't like 
originalism, and some originalism pause to debate. Originalism has a lot of problems.  It's 
not always easy to do.  Sometimes it's very hard.  Sometimes it's awful hard to tell what 
the original meaning was.  I'll acknowledge all of that.  But the real problem is not 
whether it's the best thing in the world, but whether there's anything better. And what you 
have to ask the non-originalist law professor or whoever else is, "what do you propose?" 
What does a judge consult, if not the original understanding of the text? What binds the 
biases of judge? Prevents him from simply implementing his own prejudices? What is the 
standard? And the fact is, I have never heard another one that has a snowball's chance in 
hell of ever being adopted by more than two people. What are you going to use? The 
philosophy of Plato? Natural law? That's handy. That will tell judges what to do. Some 
suggest the philosophy of John Raule. Public opinion polls? Is that what you want? What 
do you want to use? If you don't take what I suggest, what is the standard? The answer is, 
there isn't any.  
 
And so imagine what a court that is confronted with a constitution believed to be an 
empty bottle; imagine how a case must be decided. For example, whether there's a right 
to die. Now if you come tome as a lawyer, I say, oh, I can tell you where there's a right to 
die. I can look up all these cases. It was criminal in all the states. Nobody thought it was 
unconstitutional. Clearly understood not to be any federal right to die. But if that doesn't 
matter, if every day is a new day, and we're talking about the evolving standards of 
decency of a maturing society, how do I decide it? I don't have any books I can run to. So 
you can imagine how it must be decided: "Do you think there ought to be a right to die? 
How about you? Well, that's fine, there must be a right to die." What else are you going 
to use? And finally I will mention the last deficiency of non-originalism. And that is, in 
the run[sic], it is the death knell of the constitution[sic]. As I suggested earlier, the whole 
purpose of the constitution[sic] is to prevent a future society from doing what it wants to 
do. That's the whole purpose. To change, to evolve, you don't need a constitution, all you 
need is a legislature and a ballot box. Things will change as fast as you want. You want to 
create new rights, destroy old ones? That's all you need. The only reason you need a 
constitution is because some things you don't want the majority to be able to change. 
That's my most important function as a judge in this system. I have to tell the majority to 
take a hike. I tell them, "I don't care what you want, but the bill of rights[sic] says you 
cannot do it." Now if there is no fixed absolute, if the constitution evolves to mean what 
it ought to mean today. What makes you think the majority is going to leave it to me or to 
my colleagues to decide what it ought to mean? They will do that if they think it's 
lawyer's work. If that's no[sic] what the game is about, if that's not what our judges do on 
the supreme court[sic], if they are supposed to tell us what are the evolving standards of 
decency that reflect a maturing society I won't look for that quality in my judges. I will 
look for judges, and a majority of the people will look for judges who agree with them as 
to what the constitution[sic] means. And so you have the absolutely crazy. We are 
conducting a mini plebicite[sic] on the meaning of the constitution[sic] every time we 
select a new person for the supreme court[sic]. Isn't that what's happening? Does it make 
any sense? but I suggest that is the inevitable result if you abandon originalism and move 
to a constitution that means what if ought to mean. The people are going to decide what it 
ought to mean, who will leave technical legal questions to lawyers. But if the question is 
simply, should it be a denial of equal protection, not was it, but should it be a denial of 
equal protection for women not to have the vote, they're not going to let a committee of 
nine lawyers decide that question. They're going to pick the committee that agrees with 
them. So at the end of this long process, this great evolution from stuffy old originalism 
to an evolutionary constitution we arrive at the point where the meaning of the 
constitution[sic], the most important part of the constitution[sic], the bill of rights[sic], is 
decided upon by the very body that the bill of rights is supposed to protect you as an 
individual against. Namely, the majority. That seems to me the inevitable demonstration 
that the only sensible way to construe a constitution is the way you construe statutes. 
What did its words mean when they were adopted? I think we depart from the traditional 
view of the constitution[sic] at our own risk. Unfortunately, we've affected the world with 
this novel view of the constitution[sic]. Many European countries envy the United States 
supreme court[sic] because of its wonderful power to create rights that ought to exist and 
eliminate rights that ought not. I suggest this is a very new enterprise. We've only been 
doing it for forty years. We haven't lasted for 200 years doing it. And we haven't gone far 
down the road. I think at the end of it, at the end of the road, there is really a serious 
weakening of constitutional democracy. Thank you.

<P>The Department of Justice issued a statement on October 25, 1996 that it has informed Richard Jewell's attorney that Jewell is not a target of the ongoing investigation of the bombing at Olympic Centennial Park. </P>

STATEMENT REGARDING RICHARD JEWELL

The following statement has been issued by
United States Attorney Kent Alexander:

"Today I have delivered a letter to counsel for Richard Jewell
advising him that based on the evidence developed to date Mr. Jewell
is not a target of the Centennial Olympic Park bombing investigation.
Due to the extensive  coverage of Mr. Jewell, and in fairness to him,
I am also issuing this public statement.

A 'target' is a person whom the government can link to a crime with
substantial evidence and, in the judgment of the prosecutor, is a
likely defendant. In close consultation with the FBI and after a
careful review of the evidence, including Mr. Jewell's recent
interview with the FBI, I have determined that Mr. Jewell is not a
target at this time. Barring any newly discovered evidence, that
status will not change.

The FBI is thoroughly and vigorously investigating the brutal
Centennial Olympic Park bombing that left two people dead and over 100
wounded. The public expects nothing less. Unfortunately, criminal
investigations often intrude upon the lives of private citizens like
Mr. Jewell and his mother. In this case, the Jewells have regrettably
also endured highly unusual and intense publicity that was neither
designed nor desired by the FBI, and in fact interfered with the
investigation. The public should bear in mind that Richard Jewell has
at no time been charged with any crime in connection with the bombing,
and the property that was seized pursuant to court-authorized search
warrants has been returned.

The FBI and its partner law enforcement agencies are working
tirelessly to bring to justice the person(s) responsible for the
Centennial Olympic Park bombing. I hope that the investigation can now
move forward with no further premature publicity about the identity of
individuals who have been and continue to be investigated in this
case."

(News Media Note: Interviews on the statement or the investigation
will not be available. Early next week, after consulting with the
Court and counsel for Mr. Jewell, the sealed search warrant affidavits
and related pleadings, as redacted by the Court, will be made
available to the public. For further assistance, contact Patrick
Crosby, Public Affairs Officer, United States Attorney's Office, at
404-581-6016. The Internet address for the HomePage for the U.S.

<P> Richard Jewell made the following statement to the press on 
October 28, 1996. Over the weekend, Jewell received word from 
investigators that he was no longer a focus of the 
FBI investigation. </P> 
 
<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT> 
<PRE>  
Richard Jewell's Statement 
 
Text of the statement by Richard Jewell at his news conference 
Monday in Atlanta:  
 
Thank you for coming here today. This is the first time I have ever 
asked you to turn the cameras on me.  
 
You know my name, but you do not really know who I am. My name 
is Richard Jewell.  
 
As I told you on July 30th, and as the government has admitted to you 
two days ago, I am not the Olympic Park bomber.  
 
I am a man who from July 30th until October 26th lived every waking 
minute of those 88 days afraid that I would be arrested and charged 
with a horrible crime - a crime I did not commit.  
 
For 88 days, I lived a nightmare. For 88 days, my mother lived a 
nightmare, too.  
 
Mom, thanks for standing by me and believing in me. I love you.  
 
And like a brother, Watson Bryant, you stood by my side and defended 
me ever chance you got for 88 days. Thank you Watson, from the 
bottom of my heart.  
 
To all the other members of my legal team, Lin Wood, Wayne Grant 
and Jack Martin, who unfortunately could not be here today, thank you 
for your hard work and tireless efforts. I will never be able to repay 
you. Please remember guys, there is still a lot to do.  
 
Today is a new and different day, part of my nightmare is ended. The 
criminal investigation is over. Now I must face the other part of my 
nightmare. While the government can tell you that I am an innocent 
man, the government's letter cannot give me back my good name or 
my reputation.  
 
The difficult task of trying to restore my reputation begins today, as I 
try to tell you something about the Richard Jewell that you do not 
know.  
 
I am a citizen with rights, just like everybody else. I am a human 
being, with feelings, just like everybody else.  
 
In its rush to show the world how quickly it could get its man, the FBI 
trampled on my rights as a citizen. In its rush for the headline that the 
hero was the bomber, the media cared nothing for my feelings as a 
human being.  
 
In their mad rush to fulfill their own personal agendas, the FBI and the 
media almost destroyed me and my mother.  
 
On the evening of July 27th, 1996, at Centennial Olympic Park, I did 
not set out to be a hero. I set out that night simply to do my job and to 
do it right. I was then and remain now an individual committed to the 
principles of law enforcement and the protection of the public.  
 
I was trained to spot the unattended packages and to report such 
packages to the next person in the security chain of command.  
 
That is what I did on the 27th of July. All I did was my job.  
 
I moved people away from the unattended package and I evacuated 
people from the sound tower. All I did was my job.  
 
When the explosion occurred, I saw my fellow officers and friends 
flying through the air. I saw people lying on the ground hurt, badly 
hurt.  
 
The media started calling me a hero. I did not consider myself a hero. 
The bomb technician who crawled on his belly and got next to the 
bomb was a hero. The officers who took the shrapnel by placing their 
bodies between the package and where the people were in the park 
were the heroes.  
 
The paramedics and firemen who responded so quickly and treated the 
injured were the heroes.  
 
And then, the FBI and the media decided to portray me as the bomber. 
It was like being broadsided. Anybody who knew me understood that I 
could never hurt another person. I love people. I love children. I am a 
public servant. I felt numb, sick, I was in shock and felt helpless.  
 
As the days passed, I kept waiting for the FBI to uncover the evidence 
that would point them in the right direction. But it did not happen, 
because they were looking in the wrong direction - they were still 
looking at me.  
 
You the media were looking, too. Your cameras trained on my mother 
and me. Your cameras and the FBI followed my every move. I felt like 
a hunted animal, followed constantly, waiting to be killed.  
 
The media said I fit the profile of a lone bomber. That was a lie.  
 
The media said I was a former law enforcement officer, a frustrated 
police wannabe. That was a lie. I was then and am now a law 
enforcement officer.  
 
The fact that I was between jobs and took a position as a security guard 
at the Olympics did not change that fact.  
 
The media said I was an overzealous officer. That was a lie. I always 
performed my job to the best of my ability and gave 110 percent. 
That's not being overzealous. That's being dedicated.  
 
The media said I sought publicity for my actions. That was a lie. I did 
not seek to be called a hero, and I did not seek any publicity for doing 
my job. AT&T wanted the publicity, not me.  
 
I have read the search warrant affidavits and I have either read or heard 
all the many things that have been said about me to try to make me 
look like a bomber. It was all a lie.  
 
Now that I have received the government's letter, I feel a sense of 
relief, even though I don't think the fact that I have been cleared has 
fully sunk in.  
 
After 88 days of hell, it is hard to believe that it is really over.  
 
I want to thank my friends, who stood by me during the darkest of 
days. Many of them were subjected to FBI harassment, but they still 
stood by me and told the truth. I thank all of you out there in America 
and around the world who expressed support for me and outrage for 
what happened to me.  
 
I hope and pray that no one else is ever subjected to the pain and the 
ordeal that I have gone through. In the future I hope that the authorities 
move with caution and not be overzealous in their desire to solve 
crimes.  
 
The authorities should keep in mind the rights of the citizens. I hope 
that the media will curb its appetite for the substantial story by staying 
objective, by reporting truthfully, and not distorting the facts.  
 
Let the headline be based on the facts. Don't shape the facts to make 
the headline.  
 
I will now move on with my life. I have not had time to focus on any 
definite plans, but I am going to try to re-enter law enforcement.  
 
People might ask can I do that? Why would I want to do that, after all 
that has happened to me?  
 
I do not look at law enforcement as a job. I love helping people. That's 
what I do, that's what I have done, and that's what I want to continue to 
do in the future.  
 
During the 88 days of this living nightmare, the knowledge that I did 
my job and the thought that in the process I may have saved lives 
helped keep me going.  
 
My faith in God, and knowing that I was innocent, giving me piece of 
mind, that if I kept going forward, one day at a time, one day it would 
be over. I thank God that it has now ended, and that you now know 
what I have known all along. I am an innocent man. 
Thank you.

AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT OF SEARCH WARRANT

Diader Rosario, Special Agent (SA) of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), being duly sworn, deposes and states as follows:

1. I have been an FBI Agent for over 25 years, and have been assigned
to the Atlanta Division since June, 1987. I am presently assigned to
the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF), and am assisting in the
investigation of the bombing incident at the Olympic Centennial Park
(Centennial Park) which occurred during the early morning hours of
July 27, 1996. I have approximately ten (10) years of specialized
experience investigating domestic terrorist organizations including
both formal in-service training relating to domestic security,
domestic terrorism and international terrorism, and on-the-job
experience.

I have participated in the investigation of the above described
bombing incident at the Centennial Park and as a result of my personal
participation in this investigation and through the analysis of
reports, both oral and written, which have been submitted by other
Special Agents of the FBI and/or other federal, state and local law
enforcement personnel, I state that I am familiar with the facts and
circumstances set forth hereinafter. This affidavit contains only
information which is necessary to support this application.

2. This affidavit is submitted in support of an application for a
search warrant for the premises located at 3649 Buford Highway,
Apartment F-3, Atlanta, Georgia, and for a vehicle described as a 1984
blue Toyota pickup truck bearing Georgia license plate QE44557.
Probable cause exists to believe that the person, the premises and the
vehicle contain evidence and instrumentalities as described on the
application and the exhibits attached thereto which items are evidence
of violations of Sections 844(i) (destruction of property used in
interstate or foreign commerce by means of fire or an explosive), and
2332a (use of weapons of mass destruction) of Title 18, United States
Code.

3. The following facts in support of this affidavit were obtained by
the FBI during the period from approximately July 27, 1996 to July 30,
1996.

4. Affiant states the 26th Olympiad is being held in Atlanta, Georgia
(July 19, 1996 through August 4, 1996). In connection with this
Olympiad, thousands of foreign dignitaries, visitors and athletes have
come to Atlanta, Georgia, to attend and participate in the Olympic
events. As part of the celebration of the event, the Atlanta Committee
for the Olympic Games (ACOG) established the Centennial Park at the
intersection of Techwood Drive and Baker Street in the downtown area
of Atlanta, Georgia, located in the Northern District of Georgia, as
the focal point of the Olympics. The park, which has numerous
entertainment venues and commercial establishments, is a popular
location for thousands of foreign and domestic Olympic visitors
throughout each day.

5. On Saturday, July 27, 1996, at 12:58 a.m., a telephone call was
received by the 911 emergency system at Atlanta Police Department
(APD). The caller, believed to be a male, stated: "There is a bomb in
Centennial Park, you have 30 minutes." The caller then hung up.

6. At approximately the same time that the 911 call was being
received, Richard Allenwortz Jewell, an AT&T security employee
assigned to Centennial Park, advised a law enforcement official that
he had observed a suspicious package in his patrol area. Subsequently,
a two-man law enforcement explosive [TEXT REDACTED] team assigned to
the Centennial Park venue by the Olympic [TEXT REDACTED] Center [TEXT
REDACTED] was dispatched to investigate this package. The
investigating Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) agents observed [TEXT
REDACTED] the inside of the backpack [TEXT REDACTED] Immediately
following these observations [TEXT REDACTED] law enforcement
authorities initiated evacuation of the immediate area of the sound
tower.

7. On July 27, 1996, [TEXT REDACTED] advised that he was at the
Centennial Park to work a 4:00 P.M. to 2:00 A.M. shift at the AT&T
Light and Sound Tower. His job was to be a "sound mixer" for the bands
that played at Centennial Park. Sometime after 1:00 A.M., while
working in the sound tower, he was told by an AT&T security guard
named Richard (last name unknown), to evacuate the sound tower because
a suspicious, unattended package had been found to the rear of the
tower. [TEXT REDACTED] and others who were working in the sound tower
were moved to the front of the sound tower which was approximately
fifty feet diagonally from where the package had been found. Soon
after evacuating the sound tower there was an explosion from the front
of the sound tower.

8. At approximately 1:20 A.M., the device detonated. There were over
one hundred persons injured and two people were killed as a result of
the bombing.

9. A 911 tracking system that determines originating telephone numbers
for incoming calls indicated that the 911 telephone call (see
paragraph 5, supra) originated at a pay telephone, number
404/521-3798, outside the Days Inn, 300 Spring Street, Atlanta,
Georgia. This pay telephone is located in a bank of 10 telephones
outside the hotel and is in close proximity to the Centennial Park.

[TEXT REDACTED]

12. On July 28, 1996, Assistant Special Agent in Charge Tom Davis of
the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Assistant Law Enforcement
Commander, Centennial Park, advised that at approximately 12:55 A.M.
on Saturday, July 27, 1996 as he was walking south on the pavement
adjacent to the southwest corner of the sound tower in Centennial
Park, Richard Jewell, an AT&T security officer, requested his
assistance in dealing with several drunken persons sitting on a bench
in the front area of the sound tower who had been throwing beer cans
and bothering a cameraman. As Davis approached the front of the sound
tower they observed that the group described by Jewell had departed
the area.


13. While in the area of the sound tower, Jewell pointed under a bench
and said: "one of them must have left that pack." Davis observed a
[TEXT REDACTED] container [TEXT REDACTED] that [TEXT REDACTED] He and
Jewell attempted unsuccessfully to locate the owners of the backpack.
Subsequently, Davis radioed the Command Post [TEXT REDACTED] to
examine a suspicious package. A two-man FBI/ATF EOD diagnostic arrived
to examine the unattended suspect package. Davis was advised by one of
the members of the diagnostic team [TEXT REDACTED] inside the
container and that he should initiate evacuation of the area and the
establishment of a perimeter. Davis was assisted by other law
enforcement personnel and by Richard Jewell in evacuating the area in
the vicinity of the stage and the sound tower.

14. While Davis was speaking to other officials about evacuating the
rest of Centennial Park, an explosion occurred from the area of the
suspect package. Davis believes that Jewell was on the other side of
the sound tower when the explosion occurred. After the explosion,
Jewell told Davis that the men who had been rowdy in the area had been
taking beer out of another backpack similar to the one which had
exploded.

15. On July 27, 1996, [TEXT REDACTED] advised the FBI that be and his
wife, who also knew Jewell, had been watching television and observed
Richard Jewell being interviewed regarding the explosion at Centennial
Park. [TEXT REDACTED] stated that he and his wife shared concerns
regarding Jewell's stability and the fact that his appearance on
television was out of character.  [TEXT REDACTED] explained that
Jewell was "an individual who lived for the moment, he was an
adrenalin junkie who would thrive in this situation, yet, he appeared
just the opposite, he was nervous and stressed."

16. [TEXT REDACTED] continued by stating that Jewell had been
discharged by the Habersham County Sheriff's Office after he wrecked a
police car and another car in a high speed chase. It was [TEXT
REDACTED] understanding that this incident was the second or third
time that Jewell had over-reacted and wrecked a police car in a chase.
After being discharged from the HCSO, Jewell was hired as a part-time
campus security officer at Piedmont College in Demorest, Georgia,
where he lived. Jewell was subsequently made a full-time security
officer for the college. [TEXT REDACTED] advised that despite orders
to the contrary, Jewell would often exceed his responsibilities as a
campus security officer and conduct traffic stops on vehicles off
campus. The nature of the stops included improper tags, burned out
taillights, etc. [TEXT REDACTED] stated that there was an agreement
between the City of Demorest and Piedmont College that normal
procedures would dictate that traffic stops outside of the campus
would be the responsibility of the City of Demorest. After repeated
counseling, Jewell was put in a probationary status on May 20, 1996.
[TEXT REDACTED] stated that Jewell resigned his position on May 21,
1996.

17. [TEXT REDACTED] stated that at work Jewell was always reading and
talking about "cop stuff." [TEXT REDACTED] stated that this included
guns and ballistic comparisons. [TEXT REDACTED] stated that Jewell was
"totally engrossed in his job, he ate, slept, and breathed it...he
didn't have a girlfriend, just the job." According to [TEXT REDACTED]
Jewell was currently trying to get back into law enforcement.

18. [TEXT REDACTED] further stated that on Saturday after the bombing
in Centennial Park he talked to [TEXT REDACTED], a part-time employee
at Piedmont College [TEXT REDACTED] who also knows Jewell. [TEXT
REDACTED] recalled having told Worrell that Jewell had found the bomb
and having commented that he [TEXT REDACTED] didn't think Jewell would
know anything about a bomb. Worrell disagreed and advised [TEXT
REDACTED] that Jewell had knowledge of bombs [TEXT REDACTED]

19. On July 29, 1996 [TEXT REDACTED] advised that he has known Richard
Jewell for about five or six years. [TEXT REDACTED] knew Jewell when
Jewell was employed with the HCSO. [TEXT REDACTED] stated that if
there had been a more thorough psychological profiling, Jewell would
not have been hired. Jewell lives and breathes police stories, spy
stories and SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics). Jewell had discussed
bombs in the past with [TEXT REDACTED] and [TEXT REDACTED] got the
impression that Jewell had gone to a continuing education course
coning bombing matters.  [TEXT REDACTED] stated that Richard Jewell
was exposed to explosives and bomb instruction and lectures on two
separate occasions. The first occasion was on July 26, 1991 during
Jewell's basic mandated Peace Officer certification. The other
occasion was an in service training period which took place on May 13,
1992. [TEXT REDACTED] stated that Richard Jewell has received a total
of approximately four hours of class time on explosives. The
instruction that Jewell received covered the basics of explosives,
bombs and incendiary devices, black powder explosives, blasting caps
and basic power train physics. Pipe bombs were specifically included
in the curriculum and pipe bomb models were used as instructional
aids.

20. FBI agents interviewed [TEXT REDACTED] on July 30, 1996.  [TEXT
REDACTED] advised that Jewell had told him that Jewell had been on a
task force that handled bombs. One day [TEXT REDACTED] in late 1995,
Jewell was asked if he knew anything about bombs. Jewell advised [TEXT
REDACTED] that he had dealt with homemade pipe bombs which had a
closed chamber, contained shrapnel, and were set off with blasting
caps.

21. [TEXT REDACTED] also stated that Jewell had a [TEXT REDACTED] bag
he kept equipment in. [TEXT REDACTED] described Jewell's bag as being
[TEXT REDACTED] stated that when Jewel advised him and others that he
was going to be at the Olympics, Jewell said that he hoped that he
could be right in the middle of it if something happened.

22.  On July 28, 1996, advised the FBI that Richard Jewell was
employed as a security guard. In the days preceding the explosion at
the Centennial Park, Jewell was going to be assigned to a different
tower than where the IED was placed. Jewell did not want anyone else
to work at his sound tower. He worked the sound tower seven days a
week for twelve hours a day and did not want any days off. Jewell put
up a significant argument to stay at the tower where the explosion
subsequently occurred, and he was assigned to that tower at the time
of the explosion.

23. On July 29, 1996, an associate of Jewell, [TEXT REDACTED] who has
known him on a professional basis for several years, provided the
following information concerning Jewell. This associate stated that he
believed that Jewell could have been capable of placing a bomb if
Jewell thought that no one would have been hurt by it. The associate
stated that Jewell had not been able to obtain full-time employment as
a police officer after leaving the Habersham County Sheriff's Office.
The associate opined that Jewell might have believed that this
(setting off an explosion in his area of responsibility) could make
him appear heroic and would enable him to get employed as a police
officer again. The associate stated that Jewell was sort of black
balled from law enforcement employment due to the general knowledge of
his actions while employed at the HCSO.

24. Special Agent [TEXT REDACTED] interviewed [TEXT REDACTED] on July
30, 1996. [TEXT REDACTED] stated that he was at the scene of the
explosion, and that Richard Jewell introduced himself several days
prior to the incident. On the night of the explosion, before the
discovery of the bag by Jewell, [TEXT REDACTED] did not see Jewell at
his post in front of the tower. The first time that [TEXT REDACTED]
saw him was when their eyes met as Jewell was standing near the bag,
and motioned to [TEXT REDACTED] went over to Jewell, who said, "It's a
bomb. I've already called law enforcement. Let's get out of here."
Five to ten seconds later, the bomb exploded.

25. Special Agent [TEXT REDACTED] interviewed [TEXT REDACTED] on July
30, 1996. According to Ms. [TEXT REDACTED], between 12:20 and 12:30
a.m. [TEXT REDACTED] was not feeling well and went to sit down on a
bench behind the media tower. While Ms. [TEXT REDACTED] was
approaching the bench, Jewell stepped in front of her and sat down on
the bench. According to Ms. [TEXT REDACTED], when she attempted to sit
down, Jewell said "I'm sorry, you cannot sit here. This bench is
reserved for the police officers when they want to take a break. If
you would like to walk around to the front of the light tower, there
are some benches there that were vacant a few minutes ago. There are
some policemen that are standing on their feet for long periods of
time and that's why we reserve this bench for them." Ms. [TEXT
REDACTED] thanked Jewell and attempted to find another bench. Your
affiant at this time is uncertain whether the bench in question is the
one under which the bomb exploded.

26. Affiant states that after the explosion at Centennial Park, during
an interview with the Cable News Network (CNN) on July 27, 1996,
Jewell said he hoped to get a job in law enforcement in the Atlanta
area after the Olympics.

27. Investigation has determined that Richard Jewell is a white male
born on 12/17/62 and resides at apartment F-3, 3649 Buford Highway,
Atlanta, Georgia,with his mother, Barbara Jewell. These premises are
on the east side of Buford Highway in Atlanta. The building containing
apartment F-3 is a three level, brick building with wooden siding.
Apartment F-3 is on the second level. Telephone number 404-320-7576 is
subscribed to by "B.A. Newell" at these premises. Richard Jewell is
currently employed as a contract Security Guard for AT&T Security
Department. He is described as a white male, 5'9" tall, 210 pounds,
blond hair, and blue eyes.

28. Special Agents of the FBI [TEXT REDACTED] observed him depart the
apartment F-3 at 3649 Buford Highway on July 29, 1996 and return to it
at approximately 5:21 P.M. on the same date. He was driving the 1984
blue Toyota pickup, Georgia license QE44557. Additionally, during a
statement he gave to an official of AT&T Corporate Security on July
27, 1996 Jewell stated that his address is Apartment F-3, 3649 Buford
Highway, Atlanta, and his home telephone number is 404-320-7576.
Telephone records confirm that telephone number 404-320-7576 is
located at that address. A check of vehicle registration records
determined that the 1984 blue Toyota pickup truck bearing Georgia
license plate number QE44557 is registered to Richard Jewell.

29. Richard Jewell has given numerous statements since the bombing on
July 27, 1996. In one statement, Jewell stated that after the
explosion, he was the First responder," actively involved in assisting
victims and in keeping people from reentering the tower. A videotape
of the scene after the explosion showed that Jewell ran around the
tower shortly after the blast, looked at the scene of the explosion,
and ran back around the tower, away from the victims.

30. Your affiant states that a law enforcement officer met with
Richard Jewell on July 29 and July 30, 1996 at his apartment located
at 3649 Buford Highway, Apartment F-3, and observed a 5 X 7 steno pad
in which Jewell maintained notes and drawings concerning the bombing
in Centennial Park. Also observed were unlabeled video tapes journals,
[TEXT REDACTED]


FURTHER AFFIANT SAYETH NOT.



SUPPLEMENT TO AFFIDAVITS IN SUPPORT OF SEARCH WARRANTS

Diader Rosario states that reasonable cause exists for execution of
the instant search warrant at any time in the day or night. The
television and newspaper media have reported that Richard Jewell is a
suspect in this investigation. In addition, the FBI interviewed
Richard Jewell earlier this evening, and Richard Jewell terminated the
interview. It is likely that Richard Jewell will attempt to destroy
and conceal existing evidence as soon as he can. In addition, the
alleged crime occurred nearly four days ago; it is essential that
efforts to obtain evidence not be delayed.

Affidavit attached to the Application for Search Warrant 1:96-M-681
attached hereto as Attachment a, and incorporated herein by reference,
[TEXT REDACTED]

Further, [TEXT REDACTED] although it was initially thought that
Jewell's residence would be the only place where he would have
complete privacy, and thus a logical place at which he would store
materials, agents have since learned that Jewell leases a storage unit
where he stores many of his possessions. Specifically, as described
below, Jewell has stored many of his possessions in Storage Unit 93,
in a blue aluminum building behind Forrest Lake Mini Hart and Pawn
Shop, 2811 Level Grove Road, Cornelia, Georgia.

had stored his furniture Band other stuff" in Locker 93, Forrest Lane
Mini Mart, Level Grove Road, Cornelia, Georgia. Jewell provided to the
agents off of his key ring keys to two padlocks on that storage unit.
Jewell provided this information and the keys to the FBI in the
presence of and with the consent of his attorney.

4. Agents of the FBI have observed that Storage Unit 93 is located in
a building with a blue aluminum exterior, located behind Forrest Lane
Mini Mart & Pawn Shop, 2811 Level Grove Road, Cornelia, Georgia. The
rental application for that unit is in the name Richard A. Newell; the
unit was rented on 5-28-96.

5. For the reasons stated in Attachment B. I believe there is probable
cause that additional items listed in Attachment A are located inside
that storage unit.

AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT OF SEARCH WARRANT

Diader Rosario, Special Agent (SA) of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), being duly sworn, deposes and states as follows:

1. I have been an FBI Agent for over 25 years, and have been assigned
to the Atlanta Division since June, 1987. I am presently assigned to
the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF), and am assisting in the
investigation of the bombing incident at the Olympic Centennial Park
(Centennial Park) which occurred during the early morning hours of
July 27, 1996. I have approximately ten (10) years of specialized
experience investigating domestic terrorist organizations including

circumstances set forth hereinafter. This affidavit contains only
information which is necessary to support this application.

2. This affidavit is Submitted in support of an application for a
search warrant for the person of Richard Allensworth Jewell, a white
male, date of birth December 17, 1962, approximately 5'9", weighing
approximately 210 pounds, light brown hair, blue eyes, who currently
resides at 3649 Buford Highway, Apartment F-3, Atlanta, Georgia.
Probable cause exists to believe that the hair samples of Richard

package.  The investigating EDT agents observed [TEXT REDACTED] he
inside of the backpack [TEXT REDACTED] Immediately following these
observations [TEXT REDACTED] law enforcement authorities initiated
evacuation of the immediate area of the sound tower.

7. On July 27, 1996, [TEXT REDACTED] advised that he was at Centennial
Park to work a 4:00 P.M. to 2:00 A.M. shift at the AT&T Light and
Sound Tower. His job was to be a "sound mixer" for the bands that
played at Centennial Park. Sometime after 1:00 A.M., while working in
the sound tower, he was told by an AT&T security guard named Richard
(last name unknown) to evacuate the sound tower because a suspicious,
unattended package had been found to the rear of the tower.  [TEXT
REDACTED] and others who were working in the sound tower were moved
too One front of the sound tower which was approximately fifty feet
diagonally from where the package had been found.

8. At approximately 1:20 A.M., soon after the sound tower was
evacuated, the device detonated. There were over one hundred persons
injured, one of whom died from shrapnel wounds, and one of whom died
of a heart attack.

9. A 911 tracking system that determines Originating telephone numbers
for incoming calls indicated that the 911 telephone call (see
paragraph 5, supra) originated at a pay telephone, number
404/521-3798, outside the Days Inn, 300 Spring Street, Atlanta,
Georgia. This pay telephone is located in a bank of 10 telephones
outside the hotel and is in close proximity to the Centennial Park. 
[TEXT REDACTED]

12.  On July 28, 1996, Assistant Special Agent in Charge Tom Davis of
the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Assistant Law Enforcement
Commanders Centennial Park, advised that at approximately 12:55 A.M.
on Saturday, July 27, 1996, as he was walking south on the pavement
adjacent to the southwest corner of the sound tower in Centennial
Park, Richard Jewell, an AT&T security officer, requested his
assistance in dealing with several drunken persons sitting on a bench
in the front area (northeast corner) of the sound tower who had been
throwing beer cans and bothering a cameraman. As Davis approached the
front of the sound tower, he observed that the group described by
Jewell had departed the area.

13. While in the area of the sound tower, Jewell pointed under a bench
and said:  "one of them must have left that pack." Davis observed a
[TEXT REDACTED] container [TEXT REDACTED] that appeared to be a
backpack. [TEXT REDACTED] He and Jewell attempted unsuccessfully to
locate the owners of the backpack. Subsequently, Davis radioed the
Command Post for the explosives team to examine a suspicious package.
A two-man FBI/ATF explosives diagnostic team arrived to examine the
unattended suspect package one of the members of the diagnostic team
[TEXT REDACTED] inside the container and that he should initiate
evacuation of the area and the establishment of a perimeter. Davis was
assisted by other law enforcement personnel and by Richard Jewell in
evacuating the area in the vicinity of the stage and the sound tower.

14. While Davis was speaking to other officials about evacuating the
rest of Centennial Park, an explosion occurred from the area of the
suspect package. Davis saw Newell near the benches along the
southwestern side of the tower. (Affiant notes the explosion occurred
at the northeastern corner of the tower.) After the explosion, Jewell
told Davis that the men who had been rowdy in the area had been taking
beer out of another backpack similar to the one which had exploded.

15. FBI Special Agents [TEXT REDACTED] and [TEXT REDACTED] interviewed
[TEXT REDACTED] on July 31, 1996. [TEXT REDACTED] was employed as a
stage hand at the Swatch pavilion in Centennial Park next to the AT&T
light and sound tower. [TEXT REDACTED] met Richard Jewell a day or two
before the bombing occurred. On the morning of July 27, 1996, [TEXT
REDACTED] left his position at the Swatch pavilion at about 12:30 a.m.
to take a break. He walked to a park bench located in the grassy area
in front of the stage. The AT&T tower was located to his right. After
listening to approximately three or four songs (which [TEXT REDACTED]
estimated to be five to six minutes in length), [TEXT REDACTED] looked
to his right and saw Richard Jewell walking from around the corner of
the AT&T tower. [TEXT REDACTED] caught Jewell's eye and saw that
Jewell had a look of urgency about him. Jewell appeared to be talking
on a radio. [TEXT REDACTED] said that when he first made eye contact
with Jewell, Jewell was in no way attempting to clear people from the
area; Jewell was walking alone as park spectators continued to walk in
the direction of the forthcoming blast. At that time, [TEXT REDACTED]
walked over to Jewell and asked him what was going on. Jewell stated,
"I'm reporting a suspicious package at the corner of the tower to law
enforcement authorities. Let's get out of here." Approximately ten
seconds later, the bomb went off. Immediately after, [TEXT REDACTED]
and Jewell directed people away from the area. Jewell repeatedly
yelled, "I'm in charge here." [TEXT REDACTED] then attempted to assist
in clearing the AT&T tower, but Jewell told him, "No, I've already
cleared it."

16.  On July 27, 1996, [TEXT REDACTED] advised the FBI that after
Richard Jewell was discharged from the Habersham County Sheriff's
Office (HCSO), Jewell was hired as a part-time campus security officer
at Piedmont College in Demorest, Georgia, where he lived. Jewell was
subsequently made a full-time security officer for the college. [TEXT
REDACTED] advised that despite orders to the contrary, Jewell would
often exceed his responsibilities as a campus security officer and
conduct traffic stops on vehicles off campus. The nature of the stops
included improper tags, burned out tail lights, etc. [TEXT REDACTED]
stated that there was an agreement between the City of Demorest and
Piedmont College that normal procedures would dictate that traffic
stops outside of the campus would be the responsibility of the City of
Demorest. After repeated counseling, Jewell was put in a probationary
status on May 20, 1996. [TEXT REDACTED] stated that Jewell resigned
his position on May 21, 1996.

17. [TEXT REDACTED] stated that at work Jewell was always reading and
talking about "cop stuff. [TEXT REDACTED] stated that this included
guns and ballistic comparisons. [TEXT REDACTED] stated that Jewell was
"totally engrossed in his job, he ate, slept, and breathed it...he
didn't have a girlfriend, just the job."  According to [TEXT REDACTED]
Jewell was currently trying to get back into law enforcement.

18. [TEXT REDACTED] further stated that on Saturday after the bombing
in Centennial Park he talked to [TEXT REDACTED] a part-time employee
at Piedmont College [TEXT REDACTED] who also knows Jewell.  [TEXT
REDACTED] recalled having told [TEXT REDACTED] that Jewell had found
the bomb and having commented that he [TEXT REDACTED] didn't think
Jewell would know anything about a bomb. [TEXT REDACTED] disagreed and
advised [TEXT REDACTED] that Jewell had knowledge of bombs [TEXT
REDACTED]

19.  FBI agents interviewed [TEXT REDACTED] on July 30, 1996. [TEXT
REDACTED] advised that Jewell had told him that Jewell had been on a
task force that handled bombs. One day [TEXT REDACTED] in late 1995,
Jewell was asked if he knew anything about bombs.  Jewell advised
[TEXT REDACTED] that he had dealt with homemade pipe bombs which had a
closed chamber, contained shrapnel, and were set off with blasting
caps.

20. On July 29, 1996, [TEXT REDACTED] advised that he has known
Richard Jewell for about five or six years. [TEXT REDACTED] knew
Jewell when Jewell was employed with the Habersham County Sheriff's
Office.  [TEXT REDACTED] stated that if there had been a more thorough
psychological profiling, Jewell would not have been hired. Jewell
lives and breathes police stories, spy stories and SWAT (Special
Weapons and Tactics). Jewell had discussed bombs in the past with
[TEXT REDACTED] and [TEXT REDACTED] got the impression that Jewell had
gone to a continuing education course concerning bombing matters.

21. [TEXT REDACTED] also stated that Jewell had a [TEXT REDACTED] bag
he kept equipment in.  [TEXT REDACTED] described Jewell's bag as being
[TEXT REDACTED] backpack [TEXT REDACTED] stated that when Jewell
advised him and others that he going to be at the Olympics, Jewell
said that he hoped that he could be right in the middle of it if
something happened.

22.  On July 30, 1996, [TEXT REDACTED] stated that Richard Jewell was
exposed to explosives and bomb instruction and lectures on two
Separate occasions. The first occasion was on July 26, 1991, during
Jewell's basic mandated Peace Officer certification. The other
occasion was an in service training period which took place on May 13,
1992. [TEXT REDACTED] stated that Richard Jewell has received a total
of approximately four hours of class time on explosives. The
instruction that Jewell received covered the basics of explosives,
bombs and incendiary devices, black powder explosives, blasting caps
and basic power train physics. Pipe bombs were specifically included
in the curriculum and pipe bomb models were used as instructional
aids.

23. On July 28, 1996, [TEXT REDACTED] advised the FBI that Richard
Jewell was employed as a security guard. In the days preceding the
explosion at the Centennial Park, Jewell was going to be assigned to a
different tower than where the bomb was placed. Jewell did not want
anyone else to work at his sound tower. He worked the sound tower
seven days a week for twelve hours a day and did not want any days
off. Jewell put up a significant argument to stay at the tower where
the explosion subsequently occurred, and he was assigned to that tower
at the time of the explosion.

24. On August 1, 1996, [TEXT REDACTED] employed [TEXT REDACTED] in
Centennial Park, advised FBI that he met Richard Jewell when Jewell
started working at the Park. Approximately 4 to 6 weeks ago while
[TEXT REDACTED] was assisting the construction of one of the sound
towers, Jewell approached and asked if the,towers were made out of
aluminum.  [TEXT REDACTED] informed Jewell that the towers were made
out of steel. Jewell then asked [TEXT REDACTED] if he believed the
tower would "stand up" to an explosion. [TEXT REDACTED] replied that
he did not know the answer to that question.

25. Your affiant states that on August 1, 1996, [TEXT REDACTED] a
Security employee for ACOG, assigned to the Centennial Park venue,
advised she relieved Richard Jewell from his duties at the sound tower
at approximately 9:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. on July 27, 1996, prior to
the explosion.  [TEXT REDACTED] did not observe his whereabouts during
this period.

26. On August 1, 1996, [TEXT REDACTED] stated that on the evening
before the explosion she was on the outside perimeter of the
Centennial Olympic Park when she was bumped by an unknown white male. 
[TEXT REDACTED] said that the man was carrying [TEXT REDACTED]
knapsacks He placed the bag on the outside of a tall black fence. 
[TEXT REDACTED] said that the man carried the bag in his right hand
along his side, carefully placed the bag on the ground and immediately
left the area. [TEXT REDACTED] believed that this incident occurred at
about 9:50 p.m. to 10:20 p.m. [TEXT REDACTED] further recalls seeing
the Swatch building as she continued down the street. [TEXT REDACTED]
believed that in the vicinity where the man dropped the bag off there
was an entrance labeled "For employees only," and that as she walked
down the street there was a public entrance with a sign that said
"Free admission" and another sign for "Blood sweat and tears." From
the way that the man was carrying the bag, [TEXT REDACTED] concluded
that the bag was heavy.  [TEXT REDACTED] described the man carrying
the knapsack [TEXT REDACTED] described his clothing [TEXT REDACTED]
also said that the man appeared to be alone.

27. Affiant states that after the explosion at Centennial Park, during
an interview with the Cable News Network (CNN) on July 27, 1996,
Jewell said he hoped to get a job in law enforcement in the Atlanta
area after the Olympics.

28. Richard Jewell has given numerous statements since the bombing on
July 27, 1996. In one Statement, Jewell stated that after the
explosion, he was the First responder," actively involved in assisting
victims and in keeping people from reentering the tower. A videotape
of the scene after the explosion showed that Jewell ran around the
tower shortly aster the blast, looked at the scene of the explosion,
and ran back around the tower, away from the victims. The videotape
showed that immediately after the blast Richard Jewell was wearing a
white ball cap, a white shirt, tan shorts, and black shoes.

29. Your affiant states that on July 30, 1996, pursuant to a warrant
authorized by Search Warrant 1:96-M-687, for the current residence of
Richard Jewell and his mother, Barbara Jewell, a search was conducted
at 3649 Buford Highway, Apartment F-3, Atlanta, Georgia, by Special
Agents of the FBI. During the search, numerous items were located
including, but not limited to, a [TEXT REDACTED] fragmentation from
the bomb scene [TEXT REDACTED] an FBI Bomb Technician, was present at
both the bomb scene and search of the apartment and states that the
items found at the apartment are similar to the items they observed at
the bomb scene.

30. On July 31, 1996, agents began to execute a consent (search at 140
Highway 115, Clarkesville, Habersham County, Georgia. Richard Jewell
was a tenant at that address until approximately May 1996. In a shed
located on the property which the owners advised that to their
knowledge has not been disturbed since Jewell left, [TEXT REDACTED]

F. Lee Bailey claims that he accepted 600,000 shares of stock worth approximately $6 million from drug dealer Claude Duboc as payment for legal fees and expenses. Bailey alleges government officials agreed to the arrangement until the value of the stock increased sharply to $16 million. Bailey was incarcerated for contempt on February 29, 1996 and was later ordered to forfeit the stock to the United States. Bailey is suing the United States for breach of contract and seeks the return of his forfeited assets and payment for his representation of Duboc. This is the suit filed on October 22, 1996.

<PRE> 
IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS 
 
 
F. LEE BAILEY 
 
Plaintiff, 
 
v. 
 
THE UNITED STATES 
 
Defendant. 
 
 
COMPLAINT 
 
Plaintiff, F. Lee Bailey ("Bailey"), for his complaint 
against defendant alleges as follows: 
 
 
JURISDICTION 
 
1. Jurisdiction is conferred upon this Court pursuant to 28 
U.S.C. Sec. 1491. The plaintiff brings this action to 
enforce an oral contract entered into between the plaintiff 
and the defendant, The United States. 
 
2. The amount in controversy exceeds $10,000.00. 
 
 
THE PARTIES 
 
3. Plaintiff, F. Lee Bailey, is a resident of Palm Beach 
County, Florida. Further, Bailey is an attorney licensed in 
the State of Florida and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
with his principal of office in West Palm Beach, Florida, 
and a central office in Boston, Massachusetts. 
 
4. Defendant is the United States of America. 
 
 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
 
5. On or about the last week of March, 1994, Bailey was 
retained to represent Claude Luis Duboc in the matter of 
United States of America v. Claude Luis Duboc, United 
States District Court for the Northern District of Florida, 
Gainesville Division, Case No. GCR-01009-MMP, hereinafter 
referred to as the "Duboc case". 
 
6. Mr. Duboc was to stand trial on a multiple-count 
indictment charging him with various offenses against the 
United States, including international drug importation, 
money laundering and criminal forfeiture. 
 
7. Shortly after Bailey began representing Mr. Duboc, 
Bailey informed the federal prosecutors that Mr. Duboc was 
willing to negotiate a plea of guilty. 
 
8. One of the issues that was negotiated between Bailey and 
members of the United States Attorney's Office for the 
Northern District of Florida, who were authorized to 
represent the United States,  the defendant in the instant 
action, were the matters of Bailey's fees and finding of 
expenses associated with Bailey's representation of Mr. 
Duboc, and Bailey's performance of various tasks associated 
with the maintenance, liquidation and repatriation of vast 
quantities of property to be transferred Duboc to the 
defendant United States. 
 
9. In light of the criminal forfeiture pending against Mr. 
Duboc, Bailey wanted to be assured that his fees, which had 
been set at $US 3,000,000.00, an amount that was agreeable 
to the government's counsel would be secured by 
non-forfeitable assets. 
 
10. Bailey made the government aware of his concern that he 
be protected on the matter of his fees. 
 
11. On or about April 25, 1994, a meeting was held between 
Bailey, Mr. Duboc, Special Agent Carl Lilley of the United 
States Drug Enforcement Agency, and various Assistant 
United States Attorneys from time to time. 
 
12. At said meeting, a list of Mr. Duboc's assets was 
prepared. 
 
13. On or about April 26, 1994, a private meeting was 
conducted between Bailey and Assistant United States 
Attorney Gregory R. Miller ("A.U.S.A. Miller"). 
 
14. At said meeting, A.U.S.A. Miller assured Bailey that 
Bailey would be protected with respect to his requested 
fees and expenses in the Duboc case. 
 
15. A.U.S.A. Miller, using the previously prepared list of 
Mr. Duboc's assets, offered to unconditionally transfer to 
Bailey a cash account maintained at UBS in Luxembourg which 
contained approximately three and a half million dollars 
($U.S. 3,500,000.00) from which Bailey's fees and expenses 
would be paid. 
 
16. In order to accomplish this objective, A.U.S.A. Miller, 
on behalf of the United States, agreed to exempt said 
account from any forfeiture claim by the government. 
 
17. Mr. Miller acknowledged that the money would be 
transferred to Credit Suisse in Geneva, and that such a 
transfer would be illegal under Swiss law unless the 
property so transferred was not forfeitable to the United 
States. 
 
18. During the course of the April 26th meeting, Special 
Agent Lilley recommended that, instead of transferring the 
cash account to Bailey, it would be more advantageous to 
all parties to transfer to Bailey, six hundred and two 
thousand (602,000) shares of Biochem Pharma, a Canadian 
pharmaceutical company publicly traded on the NASDAQ 
Exchange. 
 
19. Lilley explained that by law the United States 
government could not hold the stock and would have to sell 
it in one block immediately, thus jeopardizing its value 
 
20. As with the cash account, the transfer of these shares 
would have been illegal under Swiss law without the 
understanding that the property was not forfeitable to the 
United States. 
 
21. On or about April 26, 1994, Biochem Pharma was trading 
at approximately nine dollars ($US 9.00) per share. 
 
22. On or about April 26, 1994, at the behest of A.U.S.A. 
Miller, a private conference was had between Bailey and 
A.U.S.A. Miller 
 
23. During said conference, A.U.S.A. Miller, acting on 
behalf of the United States, told Bailey that he would have 
the right to sell any and all shares of Biochem Pharma at 
any time, and in any fashion, Bailey chose. 
 
24. A.U.S.A. Miller further informed Bailey that if the 
Biochem Pharma stock were to decrease in value there would 
be no other source from which Bailey could recover his fees 
and expenses. 
 
25. A.U.S.A. Miller explained to Bailey that in effect the 
United States government would be transferring to Bailey 
approximately six million dollars ($US 6,000,000.00) and 
that any fluctuation in the stock's value was Bailey's risk 
and responsibility. 
 
26. Bailey agreed to accept the said stock as a cash 
equivalent for its then value of approximately $US 
6,000,000.00, as the source of various fees and expenses in 
connection with the Duboc case, in lieu of the cash 
previously offered or other form of payment. 
 
27. The only condition made part of this agreement by the 
parties thereto was that the U.S. District Court would 
ultimately be required to approve legal fees deriving from 
Bailey's representation of Mr. Duboc. 
 
28. Under this agreement any increase in the value of the 
stock was clearly not subject to consideration by the Court 
in approving legal fees. 
 
29. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Duboc, with the assistance of 
Special Agent Lilley, prepared and executed a letter 
directing the 602,000 shares of Biochem Pharma be 
transferred to an account maintained by Bailey at Credit 
Suisse in Geneva, Switzerland. 
 
30. The transfer was accomplished by agents of the United 
States. 
 
31. On or about May 9, 1994, all 602,000 shares of Biochem 
Pharma were transferred to Bailey's account at Credit 
Suisse in Geneva, Switzerland. 
 
32. All 602,000 shares of Biochem Pharma were transferred 
to Bailey's account unconditionally and in fee supple. 
 
33. No document limiting Bailey's ownership was ever 
prepared, discussed or contemplated 
 
34. The United States had no further involvement with 
respect to the Biochem Pharma stock until January, 1996. 
 
35. In or about December, 1995,or early January, 1996, the 
government learned that the share price of Biochem Pharma 
had risen dramatically. 
 
36. On or about January 22, 1996, The United States of 
America filed a motion entitled "Emergency Motion to 
Surrender Property", to wit: the 602,000 shares of Biochem 
Pharma stock. 
 
37. In or about February, 1996, the United States of 
America, through its agents, filed a Motion and Memorandum 
for Issuance of an Order of Forfeiture seeking forfeiture 
of the 602,000 shares of Biochem Pharma stock. 
 
38. On or about February 29, 1996, Bailey was incarcerated 
as a result of an Order of civil contempt entered by Chief 
Judge Paul of the United States District Court for the 
Northern District of Florida 
 
39. On or about March 22, 1996, the District Court 
conducted a hearing on the government's forfeiture motion 
and entered a Stipulated Order of Forfeiture forfeiting all 
602,000 shares of Biochem stock to the United States of 
America. 
 
40. At the time that the shares of Biochem Pharma were 
forfeited the value of the stock then remaining was in 
excess of sixteen million dollars ($US 16,000,000 00). 
 
41. To date, Bailey has received no compensation for his 
representation of Mr. Duboc in the Duboc case; including 
his efforts regarding the maintenance, liquidation and 
repatriation of various foreign properties, and he has not 
received a sum equal to the increased value of the 602,000 
shares of Biochem Pharma transferred to Bailey in fee 
simple.

42. Bailey repeats and reavers the allegations contained in 
Paragraphs 1 through 41 of the Complaint as is fully set

shares of Biochem Pharma stock from its value when the 
United States agreed to and orchestrated the transfer of 
said stock to Bailey in fee simple (approximately $US 
6,000,000.00) to its value on the date of forfeiture

agents and/or employees, acted in such a manner as to 
manifest an intention to be contractually bound by their 
conduct. 
 
47. The course of dealings between the defendant, United 
States of America, and Bailey were such that a reasonable

America, Bailey has been damaged financially, including but

Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others
similarly situated, for their Complaint, state as follows:

OVERVIEW OF ACTION

Individual and representative plaintiffs file this action
on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated
against defendant Swiss banks which participated in a
common scheme and course of conduct to: (1) launder Nazi
Regime (defined herein) money, and fund and profit from
Nazi World War II atrocities; (2) knowingly and/or
recklessly accept looted or cloaked assets stolen or
forcibly taken by the Nazi Regime during World War II; (3)
knowingly and/or recklessly accept profits generated by
Nazi Regime forced slave laborers; and (4) act
intentionally and in concert to conceal and prevent the
recovery of assets deposited in Swiss banks by victims of
the Nazi Regime.  The extent of the misconduct and the
complicity of the banks in providing active financial aid
to the Nazi Regime war effort and the Holocaust have only
recently come to light through the availability of archived
documents.

Plaintiffs seek to represent three classes:

Class A:  Rightful Owners of Nazi Regime Looted Assets
and/or Their Heirs,

Class B:  Slave Laborers and/or Their Heirs, and

Class C:  Certain Swiss Bank Depositors and/or Their Heirs.

Plaintiffs seek equitable and compensatory relief including
a full accounting and disgorgement by defendant Swiss banks
of Nazi Regime "looted assets," "cloaked assets" and
"deposited assets" held in Swiss banks; all interest
accrued on the assets in such accounts; and all profits
derived by the defendant Swiss banks in connection with the
holding, investing or otherwise using the assets of these
accounts.

PARTIES

Plaintiffs

Plaintiff Jacob Friedman is a United States citizen and a
resident of Brooklyn, New York.  Jacob Friedman was born to
Jewish parents January 7, 1921, and is presently 75 years
old.  He was born in Chust, Czechoslovakia, and grew up in
Satu Mare, Romania. Jacob Friedman is the only surviving
heir of his father, Marton Friedman, and his mother,
Margita Friedman, who were gassed to death in Auschwitz in
the spring of 1944.

In 1936, Marton Friedman, a businessman dealing in
commodities such as wheat, cattle and wood, traveled to
Zurich, Switzerland, and opened three bank accounts.  Jacob
Friedman does not know how much was deposited by his father
at that time.  On information and belief, Marton Friedman
did not open the accounts under his own name, because it
was illegal for Romanian citizens to have foreign accounts
at that time.

During the years 1937 and 1938, Jacob Friedman, then 17
years old, made seven trips to Switzerland to make deposits
in his father's accounts.  He traveled primarily by train
from Temishora, Romania, to Vinkovczy to Zagreb to Lubiana
to Trieste to Milano and to Zurich.  He arrived at 7:00
a.m. in Zurich and stayed with an acquaintance of his
father named Reiger, who lived at Amvant Strasse 60, near
a synagogue.  Each time he went to Zurich he was instructed
by his father on which bank to go to and he was given an
envelope that contained an account number.  Jacob
Friedman's best recollection is that each deposit was
converted to approximately 22,500 Swiss Francs.  On one
occasion Jacob Friedman also brought two kilograms of gold
into Switzerland and was sent to the town of Le Locle to
have the gold melted down to assess its purity, after which
he was given 10,000 Swiss Francs to deposit.  Jacob
Friedman's best recollection is that he made one
22,500-Swiss-Franc deposit at the Wohl and Landau Bank in
Zurich, three 22,500-Swiss-Franc deposits in the
Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft (Union Bank of Switzerland)
in Zurich, three 22,500-Swiss-Franc deposits in the
Schweizerische Bankverein (Swiss Bank Corporation) in
Zurich, and an additional 10,000-Swiss-Franc deposit at the
Schweizerische Bankverein (Swiss Bank Corporation) in Le
Locle.  Jacob Friedman did not receive any receipts to the
best of his knowledge.  The receipts were provided to
Reiger, the acquaintance of his father.  His father and
Reiger confirmed the deposits by telephone conversations,
conducted in code.

In 1939, Jacob Friedman moved to Budapest and returned to
visit his parents in 1940 or 1941, when he was beaten by
"police officers."  In the spring of 1944, Jacob Friedman's
parents, along with the other residents of Satu Mare, were
placed in a Jewish "ghetto" by officers of the Nazi Regime
and their home and possessions were looted.  Soon
thereafter, Jacob Friedman's parents, along with the other
residents of Satu Mare, were placed on railroad "cattle"
cars, taken to Auschwitz and gassed to death.

In approximately 1970, an acquaintance of Jacob Friedman's,
a Mr. Beck, met with representatives of the Union Bank of
Switzerland in Zurich.  He was informed by bank officials
that accounts belonging to Marton Friedman could not be
identified without an account number.  In July 1996, Senate
Banking Committee Chairman the Honorable Alfonse D'Amato
wrote letters to the Union Bank of Switzerland and the
Swiss Bank Corporation regarding Jacob Friedman and his
father's bank accounts.  Representatives of each bank
answered and stated that the accounts could not be
identified and also stated that they were aware that Jacob
Friedman had sent an inquiry to more than one bank.  On
information and belief, these banks have communicated with
each other regarding personal and confidential information
concerning the bank accounts holding the funds of Marton
Friedman.  Also in the summer of 1996, Jacob Friedman,
through his son Robert Friedman, made telephone inquiries
to Mr. Toothaker of the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York
City, and Mr. Martin Wirz of the Swiss Bank Corporation in
Basel, Switzerland.  He also sent a fax inquiry to the
Swiss Banking Ombudsman.  Jacob Friedman has been unable to
recover any of the funds from his father's accounts in
Swiss Banks.

Plaintiff Lewis Salton is a United States citizen and a
resident of New York City.  He was born to Jewish parents
on October 6, 1911, in Krakov, Poland, and is presently 85
years old.  Lewis Salton is the only surviving heir of his
father, Bernard Salamon and his wife.  Mr. Bernard Salamon
was executed by Nazi Regime SS shooting commanders in the
Polish National Forest of Neipolomice in 1942.  Lewis
Salton's stepmother and stepsister (14 years younger than
Salton) were asphyxiated in the Belzec concentration camp
in Poland in 1942.

Lewis Salton's father Bernard Salamon was born in 1878 in
Wieliczka, Poland, and worked as a lawyer in Milowka,
Poland.  He collected stamps as a hobby and traded stamps
with others throughout Europe, including Luder Edelman in
Zurich, Switzerland.  Mr. Salamon was known throughout
Europe as a stamp collector.  To Lewis Salton's best
recollection, he knew his parents had traveled to
Switzerland, he knew his father conducted stamp
transactions with Edelman in Zurich, and he overheard his
father's telephone calls discussing stamp-related banking
transactions occurring in Switzerland; therefore, he
believes his father had a Swiss bank account.  It was
illegal at the time for Poles to send money out of Poland.

Lewis Salton last saw his father in 1939.  In 1940, Lewis
Salton left Poland and made his way to America through
Russia, Japan, and Panama.  Early in World War II, he
received mail from his father stamped "CENSORED."  Later in
the war he was unable to contact his father by mail or any
other means.  His letters sent to his father were returned
stamped "addressee unknown."

In 1945, a friend of Bernard Salamon wrote to Lewis Salton
in New York and told him his entire family, including his
mother and father, had been killed by the Nazi Regime.  The
letter stated that his family had been shipped by "cattle"
car to a concentration camp called Belzec where they were
stripped naked and gassed.  He was later informed by a
German legal official and provided a court paper
documenting the death of some 612 Jews, including his
father, in the Polish National Forest of Niepolomice in
1942.  Mr. Salamon had been separated from his wife,
daughter and other relatives and transported by truck to
the forest where, the day before, Poles had been ordered to
dig large trenches.  The Nazi Regime SS commanders murdered
the 612, ten people at a time, by lining them up naked on
the ground in front of the trenches and shooting them to
death.   Mr. Salton believes his father's home and all
possessions were looted at the time he was detained and
murdered.

In 1947, Lewis Salton returned to Switzerland to claim his
father's accounts.  He inquired at a number of Swiss banks
but could obtain no information whatsoever.  In 1954 Mr.
Salton inquired to the U.S. Embassy in Bern seeking
assistance in identifying his father's accounts.  The
Embassy made inquiries and determined that the Swiss
Banking Association reported that they did not have any
information which would assist Mr. Salton.  Mr. Salton has
been unable to identify a bank holding his father's account
or to recover any funds from any Swiss bank.

Plaintiff Elizabeth Trilling-Grotch is a United States
Citizen and a resident of El Cerrito, California.
Elizabeth Trilling-Grotch was born to Jewish parents in
Bialystok, Poland, on May 6, 1938, and is presently 58
years old.  Mrs. Trilling-Grotch is the only surviving heir
of her father Roman Trilling and mother Rose Trilling.  To
the best of her knowledge, her father was arrested in 1939,
detained in a Russian "Gulag" and died.  Her mother was
confined to the Jewish "ghetto" in Warsaw, Poland, and
later died in a concentration camp.  Elizabeth was smuggled
out of Warsaw by Jania Zilow, a Polish Christian nanny to
the Trilling family.

Prior to World War II, Roman Trilling, his brother Max, and
father Oswald, owned and operated a large textile mill
named Oswald Trilling and Son in Bialystok, Poland.  On
information and belief Roman Trilling established accounts
in Swiss banks to safeguard his savings.

According to Ms. Zilow's account as relayed to Max Trilling
(Roman's brother) and Ida Tumarkin (Rose's sister) and then
to Elizabeth, Rose Trilling was forced to live in the
Jewish ghetto in Warsaw with Elizabeth beginning in
approximately 1940.  In the ghetto Rose Trilling was
required to do slave labor in a factory manufacturing
raincoats.  While detained in the ghetto Rose Trilling
attempted to escape by providing the factory superintendent
with a "note" to withdraw 3,000 gold Francs from a Swiss
bank account.  The superintendent reported Rose Trilling to
the Nazi Regime authorities, after which time she was
transported to a concentration camp where she perished.

Rose Trilling had told Jania Zilow that the Trillings had
money in a Swiss bank account.  In approximately 1942, Ms.
Zilow smuggled Elizabeth out of the Warsaw ghetto to Lvov
and then to Lublin in Poland.  While in Lublin, a man who
was working to reunite families put her in touch with her
parents' siblings in the United States.  Mrs.
Trilling-Grotch eventually came to the United States in
1950 through Sweden and Cuba.  To the best of her knowledge
her father's company and all of her family's possessions
were looted and ultimately seized by the Nazi Regime when
Poland was overrun.

On November 12, 1946, Mrs. Ida Tumarkin, Rose Trilling's
sister and Elizabeth's aunt, wrote to the U.S. Secretary of
State on behalf of her niece to inquire as to the Swiss
bank account of Roman and Rose Trilling.  The State
Department brought her letter to the attention of the Swiss
Compensation Office, who replied to the State Department on
July 20, 1947, that no account could be found.

In March, 1950, Elizabeth Trilling's uncle, Max Trilling,
wrote to the U.S. State Department asking for help to find
the monies of his brother Roman in Swiss banks.  The State
Department referred Mr. Trilling to the Swiss Government
and the Swiss Compensation Office.  Max Trilling died in
1984, without being able to recover any funds.  Elizabeth
Trilling-Grotch has not been able to recover any of the
funds from her father Roman Trilling's Swiss bank account.


Plaintiff Charles Sonabend is a British citizen and a
resident of England.  He was born to Jewish parents
February 2, 1931,  in Brussels, Belgium, and is presently
65 years old.  Charles Sonabend and his sister Sabine
Sonabend are the only surviving heirs of their parents
Simon and Lili Sonabend, who perished at Auschwitz.

Charles Sonabend's father Simon was a watch dealer who
imported Swiss watches and was well known in Switzerland.
He resided with his family in Brussels, Belgium.  In the
summer of 1942, the Nazi Regime was rounding up Jews in
Belgium and issued papers for Sabine, then 15 years old, to
"present herself" to the authorities.  Fearing the capture
and murder of his family, Simon Sonabend made arrangements
for the family, including Charles who was 11 years old, to
flee Belgium and move to Switzerland in August 1942.

On August 14, 1942, the family reached Switzerland.  The
family had packed in their suitcases their personal wealth,
including currency and jewelry.  On August 15, the family
declared themselves to the Swiss authorities in Biel,
Switzerland.  The Swiss police immediately sought to deport
the entire family.  Three prominent Swiss watch
manufacturers, and a member of the Swiss parliament, who
knew Simon Sonabend tried to prevent the family from being
deported by stating that the Sonabends would not be a
burden on the Swiss economy.  Their intervention was in
vain.

Prior to the deportation, the Swiss police interrogated
Simon Sonabend, as documented by a 1942 police dossier
recovered recently.  A Swiss police report written in 1963
pursuant to an investigation by Sabine Buchbinder-Sonabend
(then married) referenced the 1942 dossier.  The dossier
documents two suitcases, one containing currency and given
to a Swiss family and the other, also containing currency,
left with the police to be given to a different family.
The report also mentions a 1942 deposit of $200 in the Biel
branch of the Bank Cantonale of Bern in the name of Simon
Sonabend.  The 1963 police report indicates that the report
was sent to Sabine Buchbinder-Sonabend in Antwerp, Belgium.
Mrs. Buchbinder-Sonabend did not receive the 1963 report
because she has never lived in Antwerp nor had an Antwerp
address.  The report did not become known to Charles
Sonabend or his sister until July 1996.  Mrs.
Buchbinder-Sonabend had first inquired of the Swiss police
in 1946-47 what became of her family's belongings and was
told at that time that there were no records.

On August 17, 1942, the family was deported by Swiss police
who deposited Simon Sonabend, his wife, and two children at
the French border in the night without a map.  The Sonabend
family was immediately captured by Nazi Regime soldiers and
were imprisoned in Belfort, France.  The parents were
separated from the children.  Their private possessions,
including currency and jewelry, were looted.  In addition,
upon information and belief, all of the Sonabend's other
property was looted by the Nazi Regime.  The parents were
put on a train to Drancy and then transported to Auschwitz
where they were executed on August 24, 1942.  The children
were shipped to Paris to be cared for by the Jewish
community there.  (A July 1942 roundup and arrest of 14,000
French Jews, including children, had overwhelmed the Nazi
Regime's capacity to imprison children, so in August
additional child prisoners were temporarily handed over to
Jewish welfare organizations to be cared for.)

After the war, Sabine Sonabend attempted to recover her
father's assets in Swiss banks and elsewhere.    One of the
men who had tried to prevent the Sonabend's deportation, a
Mr. Brailowski, told Sabine after the war that there were
200,000 Swiss francs in a Swiss bank account in her
father's name. In 1946, she went to several Swiss banks in
Biel and to the police office.  She was unable to uncover
any information regarding her father or his assets,
including the $200 deposit documented in the 1942 dossier.
Around 1950, her future father-in-law Mr. Buchbinder and an
acquaintance of her father notified Sabine that Simon
Sonabend had a New York bank account.  In 1951, Sabine was
able to recover the funds from the New York bank.

In July 1996, Charles Sonabend located the 1963 police
report which documented the 1942 police dossier and the
deposit in the Cantonale Bank, and he then wrote the
Cantonale Bank of Bern to inquire as to his father's
assets.  He did not receive a reply until a Swiss
television reporter interceded, at which time he received
a telephone reply that there were no records of the account
since records were not kept longer than ten years.  The
bank then asked permission for their auditor to research
the account.  The audit took place and the auditors did
find documentation of the $200 deposit but did not document
the 200,000 Swiss francs spoken of by Mr. Brailowski.

To date, neither Charles Sonabend nor Sabine
Buchbinder-Sonabend have been able to recover any of the
funds from their father's account in a Swiss bank.

Plaintiff David Boruchowicz is a Canadian citizen and a
resident of Toronto, Canada.  David Boruchowicz was born to
Jewish parents, Chanina and Rifka Boruchowicz, on August
17, 1925 in Warsaw, Poland, and is presently 71 years old.
Mr. Boruchowicz was forced to perform slave labor from 1940
to 1943 for a German company named Transavia.

David Boruchowicz, his parents, and his five sisters lived
in Warsaw, Poland.  In 1939-1940, David Boruchowicz was
attending a trade school located at 36 Stawki Street in
Warsaw.  In February 1940, the Nazi Regime occupied the
school, seized the equipment, surrounded the school with
Nazi Regime soldiers and forced the students to perform
slave labor for 12 hours a day, six days a week.  The slave
labor "school" or "factory" was converted to manufacture
airplane parts for a company called Transavia.  The
"student" slave laborers, all Jewish, were given two meals
a day and no compensation.  Mr. Boruchowicz and the other
"students" were allowed to visit their parents on Sunday in
the Warsaw Jewish ghetto until 1941 when the ghetto was
closed.

In the spring of 1943, the "final solution" for the Warsaw
ghetto was implemented by the Nazi Regime and all residents
of the ghetto were transported to concentration camps.
David Boruchowicz's parents and five sisters and all the
rest of his family were transported to the Majdanak
concentration camp.  Mr. Boruchowicz never heard from them
again.  Upon information and belief, all of Mr.
Burochowicz's family perished in the camps and all the
family's possessions were looted by the Nazi Regime.  In
June of 1943, the Nazi Regime closed the Transavia slave
labor factory and deported the students to the Majdanek
concentration camp.

One month later, Mr. Boruchowicz was taken from Majdanek to
work at a camp called Buna for the company I.G.
Farben-Buna, right outside Auschwitz.  From there he was
taken to Buchenwald, then to Teresienstadt, from which he
escaped in April 1945, three weeks before the liberation of
the camp.  Eventually, in 1959, he came to Canada.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

I.     THE NAZI REGIME AND SWISS NEUTRALITY:  1933 -
1946[FN1]Switzerland has been recognized as a permanently
neutral country since the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815).
From 1933 until at least 1946, Switzerland, however, had
close ties to the Nazi Regime which were knowingly used and
exploited to further the war objectives of that Regime.
The actions and conduct of Switzerland in general exceeded
the bounds of neutrality.

Switzerland was the Nazi Regime's foremost supplier of
foreign exchange.

Switzerland was a critical provider of vital industrial
products and raw materials to the Nazi Regime.  This matter
was of such importance that, in 1944, the Allies considered
proposals to bomb certain Swiss rail lines in order to halt
this traffic.

Swiss francs were made available to the Nazi Regime for
other than recognized trade purposes.

Swiss financial markets were favorably used by the Nazi
Regime to cloak and shield its financial operations and
dispose of the spoils of their illegal plundering.

Switzerland was used as a safehaven to disguise
subsidiaries of businesses operating in furtherance of the
illegal objectives and acts of the Nazi Regime.

Swiss industry, in general, had close, historical and
interlocking ties to significant German businesses
operating to further the illegal objectives of the Nazi
Regime.

Officials of the Swiss legation of the International
Committee of the Red Cross in Istanbul were part of a
smuggling ring with a German bank involved in the
laundering of looted assets in Switzerland.

Agents of the Nazi Regime reportedly had remarkable access
to Swiss diplomatic passports, pouches, couriers and
transport, which were used to convey looted assets across
national borders.

Switzerland adopted and implemented policies and practices
with respect to persons seeking the asylum of her professed
neutrality which had the purpose and effect of aiding
religious, racial and political persecution by the Nazi
Regime:

a.Before World War II, the Jewish population in Switzerland
numbered 18,000, or 0.4 percent of the total population.
From the time the Nazi Regime rose to power in Germany in
January 1933, Switzerland was faced with thousands of Jews
seeking asylum, in addition to non-Jewish refugees from
occupied countries.

b.During the Nazi period (1933-1946), an estimated 300,000
foreigners passed through Switzerland, and ten percent
(30,000) of them were Jews.  In the early stages of the
Nazi Regime, several thousand Jews went to Switzerland, and
most eventually departed for other locations.  However,
once Germany annexed Austria in March 1938, the numbers
greatly increased.  Swiss officials opposed such an influx,
not desiring to be identified with the refugee problem, and
refused to host a conference that President Roosevelt had
called in the summer of 1938 to discuss the refugee
issue.[FN2]c.Swiss Chief of Police Heinrich Rothmund
suggested distinguishing the passports of German and
Austrian Jews with a special mark so that they could not
enter Switzerland as German tourists (who did not require
a visa).  In the fall of 1938, Switzerland and Germany
agreed on this policy, and on October 5, 1938, the Reich
Ministry of the Interior issued a decree ordering all Jews
of German or Austrian nationality to submit their passports
so they could be stamped in red with a capital J (for Jude
or "Jew").  The Germans later applied this ordinance to all
the Jews of Germany, which easily enabled other countries
to isolate Jews from all those seeking entry and bar them
from entering.[FN3]  d.Swiss railway personnel collaborated
with the Nazi Regime in targeting and identifying Jews who
sought refuge in Switzerland, turning them over to the
Nazis.  "Jews and other politically persecuted persons,
prisoners who wanted to escape in railway cars

--. . . were their daily victims. . . ."[FN4]e.As expressed in
a challenge to Swiss Minister Stucki concerning the
government's conduct toward refugees during this period:Mr.
Minister, your statements clearly showed that you were
greatly surprised that the Anglo-Saxons not only gave you
a cool and unfriendly reception, but at times even showed
a hostile attitude.  This attitude did not just happen; it
was caused by the peculiar opinion of neutrality held by
responsible Swiss circles despite all criticisms... You
have forgotten, Mr. Minister, that we turned back refugees
from our border although we must have known that this
refusal was equivalent to a death sentence.[FN5]


II.    THE NAZI REGIME AND THE SWISS BANKS

During the period 1933
through at least 1946, representatives of the Nazi Regime
and of industries acting on behalf of and in furtherance of
the policies and practices of that Regime were in positions
of influence and control of the Swiss banks.  The Swiss
banks knowingly cooperated and closely collaborated with
the Nazi Regime and the businesses acting on its behalf to
provide a sanctuary in Switzerland for the deposit of
looted and cloaked assets and a conduit through which such
assets could be transferred or funnelled to secret accounts
in other countries.

US Treasury officials noted that:

Switzerland has been called the German Reich's foremost
supplier of foreign exchange.  Her financial role in the
Axis economy is principally dependent upon this function,
which is closely linked with her economic role as a
supplier of critical and industrial products.  In addition,
the Axis finds in the Swiss financial markets the most
favorable conditions for the cloaking of its financial
operations in both hemispheres... In addition to dealings
through the [German-Swiss] clearing agreement, the Nazis
have been able to use freely the Swiss financial markets to
dispose of the spoils of their conquests.[FN6]As noted by
the U.S. Treasury Department:


The Swiss Bank Corp. of Basle, with assets of approximately
$385,000,000, is the largest joint stock bank in
Switzerland.   Its directors and managers have for many
years maintained intimate connections with German industry.
Of the 24 officers of the Swiss Bank Corp., at least 15 are
known to have such affiliation at present.... The Swiss
Bank Corp. is among those listed as having accepted looted
gold.[FN7]The report further states  "it should be borne in
mind that the business affiliations and political
sympathies of these individuals (the Board of Directors)
are of the utmost importance."  "The Swiss Bank Corporation
has consistently maintained an impenetrable secrecy with
respect to the deposits of alien nationals and
corporations.  The quality of its management is therefore
a vital clue to its policy.  Affiliations should indicate
the attitude of the Bank toward acceptance of German
property and the sheltering of German subsidiaries... The
integrity of the bank officials has been the sole guarantee
of any dubious transaction."[FN8]The report noted the
relationship between German industry and Swiss banking
practices:In general the Swiss Bank Corporation officials
have served the German and Italians in the field of
chemicals and pharmaceuticals, foodstuffs, electricity, and
metal products.  The principal firms served are: Pirelli,
Farbe, Schering, Ciba, Lonza, Franck, La Roche.
Brown-Bveri, Atlantic, Alliance Aluminum, and Mannesmann...
Of twenty-four officers of the Swiss Bank Corporation...
fifteen at least are known to have abetted the German
strategy of avoiding confiscation of foreign assets by the
spurious sale to convenient Swiss holding companies.


In reviewing the business records of the policy group of
the Swiss Bank Corporation, it is difficult to avoid the
conclusion that any measure unfavorable to overseas Axis
assets would not be adopted by men who for many years have
been the agents and instruments thereof.[FN9]Swiss Bank
Corporation Directors (in 1945) included:


Felix Iselin:  "Swiss representative of I.G. Farben, and a
leading agent in cloaking its extra-European properties
[and] ... president of I.G. Chemie in Basle....  "The
Iselin family has for many years served as custodians for
the foreign subsidiaries of German chemical and
pharmaceutical cartels... Iselin himself also is active in
Ciba, Sandoz and Geigy... Iselin was placed on the
Proclaimed List on May 22, 1942."[FN10]Rudolph Speich:
"Rudolph Speich is on the board of Ciba and represents the
Swiss Bank Corporation in the listed [Proclaimed List] firm
of Continentale Elektrizitaets -- Union AG of Basle"


Maurice Golay:  "Maurice Golay, believed to be the largest
stockholder of the Swiss Bank Corporation, is Chairman of
the Board of the Lonza Electric and Chemical Works and is
known to be a director of two additional German companies
on the Statutory List... His pro-Axis sympathies are
well-known"


Ernest Homberger: "Homberger is President of the Swiss
branch of the notorious German Franck companies -- INGA and
Inter Franck"


Jacob Brodbeck:  "Brodbeck is President of Ciba, Sandoz and
Geigy, and is associated with the enemy-related firm of
Brown Boveri.


Albert Nussbaumer, of the Swiss Bank Corp.:  Was considered
"one of the most notorious agents for Axis capital, and was
delegated as a principal representative for
Switzerland...."[FN11]The Swiss Bank Corp. likewise directly
cloaked foreign subsidiaries of German firms in order to
preserve them from confiscation.  Among firms so cloaked
were Schering, Mannesmannn and Franck under the Swiss Bank
creations "Forinvent," "Chepha" and "Sonora".[FN12]Given the
Swiss Bank Corporation's role as the "virtual owner of the
entire capital stock of Forinvent and Chepha":The Swiss
Bank Corporation was therefore one of the principal
accomplices of the Nazis in their effort to re-arm for an
aggressive war.  Foreign exchange accumulated by these
subsidiaries was received by the Nazis before and during
the course of the war through the collusion of the Swiss
Bank Corporation officials who willingly offered Swiss
domicile and direction to German enterprises.  Through
Forinvent and Chepha fees, and profits accrued for the use
of German enterprise, the entity of German firms was
preserved during hostilities."[FN13]German banks had large
assets in Switzerland "which consisted . . . of gold and
Swiss Francs to the value of several million Reichsmarks
and . . . [were] deposited with banks in Zurich."  US
Embassy in London officials stated:We know from our own
records that the Deutsche Bank, Istanbul, has accounts with
Credit Suisse (Zurich and Neuchatel) and with Swiss Bank
Corporation, Union de Banques Suisses and the Banque
Federale in Zurich.[FN14]German businesses cooperating with
the Nazi Regime established numerous holding companies and
private investment trusts, generating a tremendous amount
of activity in Swiss banking circles.  Orvis Schmidt,
Director of the U.S. Treasury Department's Foreign Funds
Control, stated that total deposits in Swiss banks
increased from 7 billion to over 16 billion in the years
1941 and 1942, and the number of Swiss banks increased from
295 to 372.[FN15]  The numerous and varied economic ties
between the Nazi German economy and the Swiss banking
industry were summarized in a Treasury Department Division
of Monetary Research document:[FN16]Gold is by no means the
only asset disposed of by the Germans in Switzerland.  The
Swiss Government never has introduced restrictions on the
commerce of foreign currencies, and the export as well as
the import of bills of all national banks of the world is
admitted freely by the Swiss authorities... The rates on
black markets all over the continent are set in Geneva.  It
is under these favorable circumstances that the Nazis
disposed of the currency looted in her conquest.


In the same fashion the Nazis find a ready market for
looted securities... The Swiss have required that
securities be accompanied by a certificate of ownership,
but this only applies to non-bearer securities and though
it has in some instances restricted negotiability of
Axis-held securities it is only slightly prejudicial as
they can still be disposed of at a discount through the
accepted black market dealers.


There is also an active market in paintings and other works
of art, obtained primarily from French galleries and
private collections.  Reportedly these sales yield the
Germans approximately 10 or more million francs annually
and the Swiss themselves benefit from a nominal customs
tariff and a 2 percent import fee.


Individual Germans... frequently buy Swiss blocked
accounts, particularly securities accounts, at reduced
prices, possibly making use of stolen assets to finance
their purchases...


As the supply of gold and other assets available in the
occupied countries themselves has run out, the Germans have
attempted to maintain their supply of free foreign exchange
by the sale of exit permits to persons in the occupied
areas.  A frequent arrangement is that these persons are
permitted to leave the occupied territory on deposits... in
a German-controlled account in a neutral country... The
intermediaries through which these transactions are carried
on are Swiss nationals, and some of the depositories for
the extorted money are located on Swiss soil.


III.   LOOTED ASSETS

A.General  Background

As the Nazis occupied territory across Europe, they
systematically plundered gold, foreign exchange, assets,
securities, jewelry, and art treasures.  Part of this loot
went back to Germany to accounts in the Reichsbank.  Much
of the looted gold and foreign exchange made its way to
secret accounts in Switzerland.  The Swiss Bank Secrecy Act
of 1934 designed to protect accounts was instead used to
protect looted assets in accounts of such war criminals as
Hitler, Goering, Goebbels, Ribbentrop, and Himmler.  It was
recognized that "[t]he traditional stock in trade of Swiss
Bankers, Notaries, Realtors, Insurance Companies,
Attorneys, . . . [was] the concealment of assets."[FN17]
B.German BanksLooted assets became a source of capital and
trade for German banks during the Nazi Regime.  Reichsbank
President Hjalmar Schacht, who also served as the German
Minister of Economics, was charged with "having made profit
for his agency from the looting of Jewish property and even
of valuables taken from inmates of the death camps prior to
their being put to death."[FN18]Six SS torturers from
Majdanek concentration camp who were captured and
interrogated  revealed that gold and jewels taken from the
internees were sent to the Reichsbank.[FN19]  The Reichsbank
in Frankfurt received numerous shipments of concentration
camp loot:[FN20]  Shipment #1:4173 bags said to contain 8307
gold bars inasmuch as these gold bars may, after proper
assay and expert consideration, be determined to represent
melted down gold teeth fillings.Shipment #52:4 boxes and 2
cartons said to contain jewelry and effects of persons from
Dachau Concentration Camp.Shipment #64:1 box diamonds and
jewelry.Shipment #70:1 sack Goering jewels.Other documents
have noted that:The Reichsbank received some 76 deliveries
of SS loot between August 1942 and February 1945.  Sale of
about half the loot realized RM 24,000,000 suggesting a
total value approaching RM 50,000,000.[FN21]An official
register of nearly 3,000 victims from Dachau concentration
camp lists the victims' names, nationalities, camp ID
numbers, and the amount of gold on them -- including teeth
-- when they entered the camp.  In an orderly manner, the
victims were asked to write this information on an envelope
and place their belongings in it for "safekeeping.[FN22]Three
accounts labeled "Buchenwald" were found in two banks in
Germany.  One Buchenwald account at the Thuringer
Staatsbank held 514,596.40 Reichsmarks in cash.  While the
money was listed as holdings from the SS Cantine at the
camp, US officials noted that the account "came from the
money taken from the prisoners on their arrival at the
camp, since the director acknowledged having received in
several instances foreign moneys to be exchanged into
Reichsmarks."[FN23]  The Reichsbank held two Buchenwald
accounts, one for 1,810.09 Reichsmarks.  The other
contained 2,812,388.62 Reichsmarks, "an account coming
solely from prisoners as they arrived in camp."  However,
these may have been conservative figures:

In several instances large exactions were made by the camp
command without giving any reason.  It is thus highly
probable that the total amount taken from all the inmates
of the camp is much greater than this amount... The total
amount which should revert to Buchenwald camp is
3,328,795.111 Reichsmarks.[FN24]The Reichsbank also profited
from concentration camp gold.  An informant stationed in
the dental station at Mauthausen concentration camp stated
that incoming camp prisoners were separated based on the
amount of dental gold, and some of those with more gold
were sent to more intensive labor camps in order to
expedite their death:Those prisoners who had a conspicuous
amount of dental gold were either assigned to special labor
camps where they soon died of hunger and fatigue, or were
kept at Mauthausen and taken care of by the SS guards and
the prisoners (mostly professional criminals) whom they had
appointed overseers and block leaders.... [A]ccording to
records kept by informant, the following amounts of pure
gold were collected, the March quota being from 528 bodies:
January - 2,685.4 grams, February - 2,425.6 grams, March -
3,085.3 grams.[FN25]Melted dental gold from Thereseinstadt
concentration camp victims may have been smelted into ten
bars of gold sent to Germany by the Vermoegensamt, a Nazi
agency operating in Prague:

The bars in question are the subject of a Czechoslovak
restitution claim, the Czechs having stated that the gold
content of the bars was obtained by the Nazi agency from
political, racial and religious persecutees resident in
Czechoslovakia in the form of rings, bracelets, brooches,
teeth, etc... [There is a] possibility that the
Vermoegensamt also took property from persecutees who were
only temporarily in Czechoslovakia and whose normal
domicile was elsewhere.  The Czech reference to gold teeth
as one of the sources for the contents of the bars, points
to Terezin, a notorious Nazi extermination camp in
Czechoslovakia to which persecutees from all over Europe
were shipped.[FN26]An attached secret OMGUS document
mentions:[The] Czechs themselves admit ref bars include
gold from teeth, thus indicating possibility extermination
camps origin at least of portion thereof, and the fact that
one of the principal Nazi extermination camps for
persecutees assembled from numerous European countries
[was] located at Terezin in Czecho.[FN27]The monthly report
submitted to the SS Wirtschaftsbund Verwaltungshauptamt Amt
D III (SS Economic Office, Section D III),
Oranienburg/Berlin, by the SS HQ dental stations of all
concentration camps, included a secret account of the
dental gold recovered from deceased prisoners.  The SS
Economic Office had ruled that this gold was the property
of the SS.[FN28] The Reichsbank, for example, acted "as the
personal agent of Himmler in converting SS loot into
orthodox financial assets."[FN29]  The Reichsbank concealed
these activities by the use of cover names; loot went into
the "MELMER;" its value after assessment was credited to
the account of MAX HEILINGER."[FN30]   "Also implicated in
handling the loot are the Reich Finance Minister, the Mint,
the Reich's Pawnshop, and the precious metals firm Deutsche
Gold - und Silber Scheideranstalt, Degussa, (associated
with I.G. Farben)."[FN31]C.Knowing Complicity and
Collaboration of Swiss Banks In Receiving Looted Assets

The Swiss banking industry knowingly participated in and
collaborated with representatives and agents of the Nazi
Regime in depositing looted assets in concealed accounts in
Switzerland and otherwise aiding and abetting in the
funnelling or transfer of such assets to disguised accounts
in other countries.

Switzerland purchased huge amounts of gold from Germany:

During the six-month period ending in January, 1942, the
Germans are reported to have sold in Switzerland 260
million francs in gold, most of which came from the
occupied areas and Vichy holdings in North Africa.
Extensive transactions of this nature have continued
through 1942.[FN32] German and Swiss banks -- especially the
German Reichsbank and the Swiss National Bank -- cooperated
closely.  The Reichbank maintained a gold depot in the SNB
throughout the war.  The bulk of all German gold shipments
abroad during the war were destined for the Swiss National
Bank.  Such shipments included approximately $123,000,000
worth of Belgian gold stolen by the Germans in France.
This gold was resmelted and sent to the Swiss National
Bank.  Other shipments of looted gold went to the Bank for
International Settlements, located in Switzerland which now
admits that some 25 percent of German gold received by it
during this period was looted by the Nazi
Regime.[FN33]Reichsbank officials personally escorted gold
transports through Switzerland to the Bank of Portugal.
FFC officials reported "from a most reliable source" that
in under two months -- from the end of October to the
beginning of December 1941 -- "more than 21 tons of gold
passed through Basle, Switzerland, en route from Berlin to
Berne and escorted by Reichsbank officials."[FN34]FFC
Director Orvis Schmidt said that the Portuguese
acknowledged receiving $45,000,000 worth of gold from
Germany -- including gold from the Reichsbank account with
SNB-- and $67,000,000 worth of gold from Switzerland
(possibly originating from Germany).[FN35]  In addition,
clearly identifiable looted gold such as fillings and
jewelry was sent to Portugal and sold to buyers to be
melted down and made into ornaments.[FN36]Black market agents
for the Nazi Regime in Istanbul were used to transfer funds
to Switzerland, using Swiss francs as the medium of
exchange.  These agents established numbered accounts in
their own names with Swiss banks, including Union des
Banques Suisses in Geneva, Societe des Banques Suisses in
Zurich, and Banque Federal in Basel.[FN37]Swiss bankers were
repeatedly warned about the looted origins of the gold they
purchased.  A memo from US Treasury official Seymore Rubin
stated:

[T]he question of gold policy had been directly raised with
all of the European neutrals.  Statements were made to the
European neutrals that Germany had long since exhausted all
of its pre-war gold resources and any possible accumulation
from current production, and that, by necessity, any gold
offered by Germany must be presumed to be looted.[FN38] The
State Department noted that:Monetary statisticians all over
world knew that Germany at the start of war possessed
monetary gold reserve of about $70,000,000 worth of gold
which she had spent in her war effort at latest by
mid-1943.  Therefore, if Swiss accepted one-hundred tons
gold offered by Germans in 1943 worth $123,000,000, how can
Swiss concede having acted in good faith? Furthermore, how
can they claim good faith when acquiring this gold which
they know was refused by Swedes for those reasons?[FN39]Even
allowing for private German holdings and possible purchases
of bullion from early in the war, the conclusion was
inescapable that most of this was looted gold, from
government stocks of the invaded countries, from private
hoards, or perhaps from the teeth of concentration camp
victims.[FN40]At a "Gold Committee" meeting in March 1946,
Swiss delegates defended such purchases, stating that "it
is incumbent upon a bank of issue to honor, without
question, all commitments and accept all offers in order to
protect the position and stability of a free currency."[FN41]
Also, the bankers claimed, due to Allied blocking measures,
the Swiss had to purchase gold from Germany, and that
refusing to do so "would have been an unneutral
act."[FN42]However, Reichsbank Vice President Emil Puhl later
stated that the Swiss bankers knew about the looted
gold.[FN43]  The Swiss banks aided the concealment of looted
assets in various ways:The well-reputed bank of V. ERNST in
BERN is actively occupied transferring German capital out
of Switzerland.  German assets in Sweden ... are declared
as Swiss property.  This is done as follows:  RUEEGG,
Director of the bank, finds Swiss who, in return for
bribes, sign 'Affidavits' declaring that they were in
possession of those assets in Sweden before a certain date
in 1940/41... The Enskilda Bank in Stockholm and the
Gotaland-Bank are collaborating with the Bank V. Ernst in
these transactions.[FN44]An examiner described the account
"as a 'fund' in which were placed the assets and titles of
property taken by the Nazis from Jewish businessmen in
Germany and the occupied countries."[FN45]

The use of the Swiss banks and the complicity and collusion
of the Swiss bankers and representatives and agents of the
Nazi Regime was so pervasive that accounts were brazenly
opened in Switzerland for Adolf Hitler, Herman Goering and
Joachim Von Ribbentrop.[FN46]

D.Transfers to New York Banks

Either as a result of their concerns about the safety of
looted assets in Switzerland and/or a mere desire to move
these assets outside of Switzerland, Swiss banks
transferred the looted assets into concealed accounts in
the State of New York.

In August 1939, the Swiss Bank Corporation of Basle
Switzerland established an agency in New York, New York,
which commenced operation later that fall.  Three years
later, Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau approved a
proposal to place a group of Treasury officials in the New
York agencies of the Swiss Bank Corporation, the Swiss
American Corporation, and Credit Suisse "for the purpose of
examining all the files and records of these agencies."[FN47]
At the start of the investigation, the Treasury Department
had information that Representatives of these banks
participated actively in the affairs of Swiss-German
industrial concerns in this country and in the management
of Swiss firms which we believe are still camouflaging for
German interests.[FN48]The Treasury Department noted that the
Swiss banks had intentionally and repeatedly violated US
law by its deliberate cloaking of funds and concealment of
transactions from US authorities.

U.S. officials noted that:

Most of the securities attributed before the war to Swiss
holders are held by banks and brokers in New York... These
securities are almost without exception held in the name of
a Swiss bank, banker, other agent or of some corporate
title or rubric.  The actual beneficial owners of these
securities has never been disclosed to the authorities in
this country.  In defense of this concealment the American
bankers contend that they have no knowledge of the real
owners of these securities and no way of obtaining it from
their Swiss correspondents.[FN49]Treasury Department
investigators concluded that "[the Swiss American
Corporation] and the New York Agency... continued to
conceal the true ownership of funds and securities held in
the United States and did thereby conspire to violate and
evade the provisions of Executive Order 8389 and/or the
amendments thereto. . . ."[FN50]

Overt violations included the deliberate refusal to provide
information needed on US TFR300 reports:

Irrespective of such knowledge [of how to fill out the
reports] and in complete disregard of the regulations and
instructions issued pursuant to Executive Order 8389, as
amended, and with intent to violate and evade the
provisions of said Order, the Agency did falsely state in
"Part D" of substantially all of said TFR 300 reports filed
by it, that the name of any person other than the national
in whose name the report was filed, having an interest in
the property reported was [unknown.][FN51]The Treasury
Department noted that credits were transferred between a
bank in the US and one outside the US without a license.
In addition, the Bank refused to file  reports with respect
to nationals who had an interest in property subject to the
jurisdiction of the United States:

The agency not only failed to disclose in the respective
TFR 300 reports filed, knowledge it possessed relative to
the names, ... of actual owners of certain securities, but
it also failed in each instance to file a TFR 300 report
with respect to each foreign national whose name was
known.[FN52]CONCLUSIONS include:[FN53]1.  "The Swiss Bank
Corporation, its officers and managers in Switzerland,
conspired with its agents in New York to evade and/or
violate the provisions of Executive Order 8389, as
amended."2.  "The Swiss Bank Corporation, by its New York
agents, intentionally and knowingly filed with the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, seventy-four TFR reports, which
were false and lacking in essential details."3.   "The
Swiss Bank Corporation and its New York agents, in
violation of Executive Order 8389, failed to file TFR 300
reports with respect to certain foreign nationals having an
interest in property deposited with the New York Agency."


The presence of Swiss bank agencies in the US led US
officials and others to fear the influence of Nazi money
hidden in Swiss bank branches in the United States:

 . . . [W]e feel justified in our conclusion that, under
present conditions, the three Swiss institutions in New
York do not help us.  We feel safe in asserting that they
harm us.  We admit that such harm might be negligible at
present.  We insist it could be great if a choice had to be
made between safeguarding Swiss interests and violating
American national objectives.[FN54]E. Use of the Red Cross
and Swiss Diplomatic Pouches to Transfer Looted AssetsThe
Nazi Regime used members of the Swiss Legation of the
International Committee of the Red Cross ("ICRC") and the
Swiss diplomatic corps to effect and further the transfer
of looted assets across national borders for deposit in
accounts in Swiss banks.

Officials of the Swiss legation of the ICRC in Istanbul
were part of a smuggling ring with the Deutsche Bank of
Istanbul involved in the "export of contraband jewels,
watches, gold and money. . . ."  The "Division Speciale du
Consulat Suisse" -- a special division of the Swiss
Consulate in Istanbul -- was created expressly for the
hiding of German assets:  "The number of businesses in
which German nationals were interested and the number of
bank accounts involved is believed to have kept the
organization and certain members of the Swiss Legation well
occupied for some time."[FN55]US officials in Switzerland
investigated this ring and the "apparent evasions of normal
Swiss controls of German assets by Beretta and Courvoisier
of the International Red Cross":

It is suspected that some of this contraband [looted money,
gold and valuables], as well as enemy assets from the
Deutsche Orientbank, may have been transported to
Switzerland via the International Red Cross pouch with
Beretta's aid.[FN56]The Swiss Government directly or
indirectly aided agents of the Nazi Regime, who reportedly
had remarkable access to Swiss diplomatic passports,
pouches, couriers, and transport.  Such diplomatic
privileges simplified the German export of capital.  It has
been reported that: Swiss diplomatic pouches were used by
"Hitler, Goering, etc. to send funds to Argentina.  By
mid-1944 Germans had three billion pesos hidden in
Argentina. . . ."[FN57]

The Swiss diplomatic pouch was reportedly also used for
transport of art treasures by agent Alois Meidl: 

As Goering's purchasing agent, he [Meidl] bought 17th
Century Dutch and Flemish paintings as well as
primitives... with German marks pumped into Dutch, Belgian
and French circulation by the Germans.  Other paintings
have been paid for in "occupation Guilders" or seized
Jewish property... Goering's two most precious paintings,
one a self-portrait by Van Gogh painted after he had cut
off his ear, and the other Cezanne's "House in the Park,"
were brought over to Switzerland by pouch
[diplomatic].[FN58]F.Allied Consideration Of The Bombing Of
Swiss Rail LinesAs a direct result of this complicity and
collaboration between the Nazi Regime and the Swiss banks
in providing the economic foundation for their activities
and the continued transportation of vital raw materials in
and through Switzerland, the Allied Forces considered
bombing certain railroad lines into and out of Switzerland
to stop the trade of materials.Secretary of War Henry
Stimson wrote to Secretary of State Cordell Hull concerning
continued shipping by Switzerland, Sweden and Spain to
Germany of "imports of materials and commodities of very
great value to the German war effort and of corresponding
great damage to ourselves and our forces who are now at the
critical point of their effort."[FN59]  Stimson asked Hull to
pressure the neutrals to "cease aiding our enemy," adding:

I sometimes feel that those of our assistants who are
carrying out the details of these matters do not adequately
realize the enormous change which has taken place in the
military situation since we had to use the policy of gentle
appeasement to these neutral nations.  These nations are no
longer justified in claiming that fear of German reprisals
makes it unsafe for them to cease sending these supplies to
Germany.[FN60]As Swiss traffic to Germany via German-occupied
Italy increased, US officials grew more concerned about
Swiss aid to the Axis.  The US Joint Chiefs of Staff looked
into various means of halting the flow of material and
supplies, including closing rail "routes by air action on
the Italian side of the Swiss border."[FN61]

The bombing suggestion was discussed among US officials.
Because of what was understood as the considerable aid to
the Nazi Regime being supplied by or through Switzerland ,
one high ranking U.S. official "...expressed a willingness
to turn the bombers loose and make life unpleasant for the
Swiss generally."[FN62]G.Acts Beyond NeutralityThe Swiss
banking industry knew that their complicity and
collaboration with the Nazi Regime, its agents and
representatives went beyond the obligations of a neutral.
Their conduct was reportedly dictated by the purely
mercenary objective of increasing their profit.

US intercepts of Swiss bank cables revealed "that Credit
Suisse performed activities on behalf of the Nazis whereby
a total of 1,930,731 Swiss francs were made available to
the Germans during the period from 9/26/44 to 11/24/44 for
purposes other than those for recognized trade purposes...
Credit Suisse also participated in two other transactions
which benefited the Reichsbank, Berlin, and the Deutsche
Bank, Hamburg."[FN63]  Intercepts reveal objectionable
activities of the Union Bank of Switzerland, as well.[FN64]

In a memorandum written to Treasury Secretary Morgenthau
dated June 2, 1942 requesting approval to "place a group of
Treasury men in the New York agencies of the Swiss Bank
Corporation, Swiss American Corporation, and Credit Suisse
for the purposes of examining all of the files and records
of these agencies," concern was expressed that high
officials in Swiss banks were apparently impressed by the
"new European order" being created by the Nazi Regime and
were favorably responding to its "success."

Representatives of these banks participated actively in the
affairs of Swiss-German industrial concerns in this country
and in the management of Swiss firms which have reason to
believe are still camouflaging for German interests.  Felix
Iselin, who represents I. G. Farben in Switzerland as
Chairman of I. G. Chemie, is on the board of the Swiss Bank
Corporation.  Iselin, together with Gottfried Keller who is
on the board of Credit Suisse, was added to the Proclaimed
List in the supplement of May 22, 1942.  A former top
executive of the Swiss Bank Corporation in Switzerland, who
now resides in New York, recently stated in a letter
written to a colleague that he had resigned because of the
fact that certain high officials of the Swiss Bank were
allowing themselves to be unduly influenced by Germany's
apparent success in establishing a new European
order.[FN65]As noted in another U.S. government
document:[Reports] of objectionable activities of Swiss
banks, including the Swiss National Bank, particularly
dealings in looted German gold... indicate the tremendous
amount of such assistance given by the Swiss to the enemy
[that] served to finance the enemy's purchases of critical
war material.[FN66]In addition, it should be pointed out that
their aid to the enemy in the banking field was clearly
beyond the obligations under which a neutral must continue
trade with a belligerent, and dictated solely by the profit
motive of the Swiss banks.[FN67]H.Estimates of Looted Assets

As a result of the Swiss banks' denial of accepting looted
assets and their active concealment of accounts which held
such assets, there is no presently available, accurate
estimate of the amount of such looted assets which were
deposited in or transferred through Swiss banks.

Various sources have estimated the value of these assets in
general as follows:

"Estimates of the wealth of the Jewish population, and thus
the amount of confiscated Jewish property  in countries
under Nazi domination"[FN68]Poland $2.1 Billion

Romania $1.4 Billion

Hungary $335 million

Germany $964 million

France $278 million

Czechoslovakia $415 million

Austria $215 million

Lithuania $80 million

Holland  $230 million

Belgium  $138 million

Latvia $75 million

Yugoslavia $70 million

Greece $54 million

Bulgaria $45 million

Italy $34 million

Estonia $3 million

Denmark  $2.25 million


According to British sources (the Ministry of Economic
Warfare and the Bank of England) in 1945, the total amount
of gold looted by Germany since 1939 was $545-550 million.
This figure includes $223 million of Belgian gold (taken
from France to whom it was transferred for safekeeping,
$193 million from Holland, and $19-24 million from Hungary.
These figures were based largely on information regarding
government-owned, not private gold:

In addition, large stocks of gold were undoubtedly
accumulated in the Reichsbank, hidden in Germany and placed
in overseas bank accounts, but apart from details obtained
from captured Reichsbank records or from private
information at the end of the war, there was, and is, no
way of discovering from documentation in the British
archives how much gold there was, where it was kept and in
whose names.[FN69]Reports estimated that looted Jewish assets
in Hungary alone totalled "approximately four billion
dollars."[FN70]


IV.     SLAVE LABOR

German industry and businesses outside of Germany which
were directly or indirectly owned in whole or in part
and/or which were controlled by German business, used
forced labor in furtherance of their operations.  No
company utilizing such slave labor provided any significant
monetary compensation to these laborers.

These German-owned, German-controlled and German-dominated
companies established accounts in Switzerland under
fictitious names and used fictitious means to cloak the
assets of their operations, which in part resulted from the
use of slave labor.  Certain amounts of such cloaked assets
were retained under cover of secrecy in accounts in banks
in Switzerland and in Swiss banks in the United States.

The Nurnberg Judgment found that:

Part of the "final solution" was the gathering of Jews from
all German-occupied Europe in the concentration camps.
Their physical condition was the test of life or death.
All who were fit to work were used as slave laborers in the
concentration camps; all who were not fit to work were
destroyed in gas chambers and their bodies burnt.[FN71]

German industry sought cheap labor, and many companies
appealed to the Reich for concentration camp workers as
slave laborers.  "Of the two million Jews who were used as
slaves in the German war production only 200,000
survived.[FN72]  Former SS Captain Karl Sommer testified at
Nurnberg that he knew of the allocation of 500,000 to
600,000 concentration camp inmates who had been requested
by various industries.[FN73]  Additional testimony by other
SS officials indicated that such workers were not assigned;
it was impossible to get slave labor without the company's
specific request.  Each German company was assigned a
secret code number which camp commanders were instructed to
use on all correspondence relating to the company.

As the war continued, the need for armaments increased, as
did the drain on German manpower.  In February 1942,
Himmler proposed to Nazi Minister for Armaments and
Munitions Albert Speer that armaments plants be built
inside the concentration camps so the inmates could work on
arms production.  German industries paid little if any
money to these slave laborers after the war. Some of these
industries had cloaked subsidiaries in Switzerland, and
hidden accounts in Swiss banks -- partially comprised of
profits resulting from slave labor.

During the war, IG Farben cloaked subsidiaries in
Switzerland, including IG Chemie.  IG Farben had a
production site adjacent to Auschwitz, a factory that
produced a synthetic rubber "buna," that was used by the
German air force and army.  On February 18, 1941, Goering
responded to a request from IG Farben head Krauch to
Himmler, and ordered that concentration camp inmates be
used to build the buna plant at Auschwitz, and 10,000 were
made available.  A camp annex was later built at the plant
site at Monowitz.  Inside Auschwitz itself, IG Farben
constructed a new plant in 1941 called "Auschwitz III."
The Nurnberg court found:

Auschwitz was financed and owned by Farben... The Auschwitz
construction workers furnished by the concentration camp
lived and labored under the shadow of extermination.... The
use of concentration camp labor and forced foreign workers
at Auschwitz with the initiative displayed by the officials
of Farben in the procurement and utilization of such labor,
is a crime against humanity."[FN74]

"Although no more than 10,000 persons were ever employed at
the Buna plant at any one time, it was reported that during
the three years of its operations, over 30,000 people
perished while working there for IG Farben."[FN75]  IG Farben
also manufactured Zyklon B, the poison gas used for mass
murder at the concentration camps.

After the war, the white-collar industrialists who had used
slave labor "came off relatively well. . . .  Most of the
company managers were never put on trial. . . . No
corporate director ever stood before the IMT (International
Monetary Tribunal)....  Many of the convicted corporate
officers were sentenced to long prison terms, but by
January 1951 not a single one was still in jail."[FN76]

After long negotiations and legal wrangling, IG Farben paid
DM 27 million to the Claims Conference in 1957.
Responding to an appeal by Polish claimants (whom, Farben
executives argued, were not eligible for funds because they
were not in Auschwitz because of their "race, religion or
ideology" but for their "nationality," and therefore did
not qualify as persecutees within the definition of German
indemnification laws[FN77]), IG Farben's legal brief to the
appellate court argued that despite Farben's strong
objection, the Reich (a decree from Goering was quoted) had
ordered Farben to build the buna factory at Auschwitz, and
brought three former Farben directors to testify.  All
three were convicted war criminals.  The Farben brief did
not mention that Farben had requested the order from
Goering.[FN78]  In October 1961, IG Farben demanded a refund
from the Claims Conference of DM 2 million to dispose of
non-Jewish Polish claims.

Krupp industries had cloaked subsidiaries in Switzerland.
Krupp served as "armorer of the Reich" and relied on slave
labor from nearby Auschwitz.  An estimated 12,000 Jewish
slave laborers "worked" for Krupp during the war.  A letter
from Alfred Krupp to Lieutenant von Wedel of the German
Army High Command stressed, "I can only say that a very
close cooperation exists between this office and Auschwitz,
and is assured also for the future."[FN79] At Nurnberg, it
was decided:

The horrors of the concentration camp are well known.  The
Krupp firm was the beneficiary of these camps... In the
early summer of 1944, the SS offered a large group of
concentration camp inmates to the armaments industry...
This labor was merely offered to industry, not allocated to
it... it was up to the enterprises to put in requests.[FN80]

The Nurnberg Tribunal convicted Alfred Krupp, sentenced him
to prison for twelve years and ordered the forfeiture of
his personal and professional property.  However, in July
1950, High Commissioner John McCloy announced clemency for
Krupp, who received back his liberty and his fortune.  The
restoration of German sovereignty in 1952 launched a new
period of prosperity for West German industry and for
Krupp.  Krupp's second wife, whom he married shortly after
his release from prison, revealed during later divorce
proceedings that -- apart from his holdings in Germany,
Alfred Krupp had deposited over a quarter of a billion
dollars in Swiss and other foreign accounts. Pictured on
the cover of Time magazine on August 19, 1957, Krupp was
described as "the wealthiest man in the world".[FN81]  In
1959, Krupp agreed to pay up to $2,380,000 to former Jewish
slave laborers, equal to about $1,190 to each former
laborer.

Allgemeine Elektricitats-Gesellschaft (AEG), Telefunken and
Siemens were Germany's major electrical concerns, who not
only provided electrical installations to the concentration
camps, but also staffed some of their production lines with
camp inmates.  The three electrical concerns formed a
partnership with the SS and relied on slave labor from
Auschwitz, Ravensbruck, Dachau and Mauthausen for slave
labor.  According to Foreign Funds Control Director Orvis
Schmidt, IG Farben, AEG and Siemens also ran camouflaged
German firms in Switzerland.[FN82]

Dynamit Nobel used cloaked subsidiaries to employ slave
laborers from Auschwitz, Dachau, Buchenwald, and Gross
Rosen.  Dynamit Nobel head Friedrich Flick had a personal
tour of Auschwitz, led by SS Chief Heinrich Himmler.  After
the war, Flick gained control of Daimler-Benz, manufacturer
of Mercedes automobiles.

Many other German firms used slave labor, including
Rheinmetall A.G; German aircraft companies Messerschmidt,
Junders and Heinkel; the German mining company Bragbag; BMW
(Bavarian Motor Works); Herman Goering Works; Moll;
Holzmann; and Hugo Schneider AG.

On August 10, 1944, "principal German industrialists,"
including representatives from Krupp, Volkswagen,
Rheinmetal, and the German Naval Ministry in Paris, met in
Straussbourg, France to discuss ways of exporting capital
from Germany.  In a smaller meeting that followed, the
industrialist leaders were informed by Nazi party officials
that the war was nearly over, and the industrialists must
increase Germany's strength and prepare to finance the Nazi
party if/when it should go underground.   The meeting
introduced a "new Nazi policy whereby industrialists with
government assistance will export as much of their capital
as possible... Two main banks through which this export of
capital operates are the Basler Handelsbank and the
Schweizerische Kreditanstalt Zurich."[FN83]

The Strasbourg meeting led to the formation of foreign
commercial alliances and economic bases abroad.  By one
estimate, German industry had roughly 350 direct
subsidiaries in Switzerland.[FN84]

In 1945, the Foreign Economic Administration specifically
cited as German cloaks the Swiss Bank Corporation, the
Johann Wehrli bank, Credit Suisse, Union Bank of
Switzerland, the Swiss Bank Corporation, Commercial Bank of
Basel, and the Swiss National Bank.[FN85]

It was also noted that there were instances of misconduct
of Swiss firms in the United States concerning cloaking by
Swiss insurance and  pharmaceutical companies, and agencies
of Swiss banks.  Named cloaks included I.G. Farben, Hoffman
LaRoche Inc., Kandos Chemical Works, Inc., Ciba and Geigy,
Swiss Reinsurance Company, Zurich General Accident and
Liability Insurance Company, the Swiss Bank Corporation,
Credit Suisse and the Swiss American Corporation.[FN86]

Swiss banks have never revealed the true identity of these
accounts, nor the amount of assets deposited as a direct
result of the use of slave labor.

Since the Swiss banks have never disclosed which accounts
reflected cloaked assets, nor accounted for what portion of
those cloaked assets are directly attributable to the use
of slave labor, there are no presently available, accurate
estimates of the amount of cloaked assets.

Various sources have generally reported, however, as
follows:

The section "Foreign holdings in Switzerland," outlines the
value of German assets in Swiss banks:

These holdings... are estimated to have a value of
considerably more than Swiss francs 500,000,000, equal to
more than $116,000,000 exclusive of real estate.  This
capital is mostly in such banks as the Credit Suisse, Swiss
Bank Corporation and the Banque Federale S.A., although
many sizable German investments may also be found in the
various small private banks which abound in the
country.[FN87]

V.   ASSETS DEPOSITED

Switzerland passed the Bank Secrecy Act in 1935 (the
"Act").  Its purpose was to enable the Swiss Banks to
attract the deposits of foreign persons and entities,
including Jews, who wanted their money held in confidence,
in a "safe" country, and for an indefinite period of time.

During the period 1933 through 1945, numerous Jewish
persons including the parents of the class representatives,
as well as others who were members of groups which were
subjected to racial, religious or political persecution by
the Nazi Regime, and others acting on its behalf, made
deposits of assets in various forms in defendant Swiss
banks.

The following reports are illustrative of such claimed
deposits:

a.Joseph S. Seaman asks for help in recovering funds of his
sister, a concentration camp survivor.  The funds --
100,000 RM -- were transferred through Bankhaus SEILER &
CO. in Munich to the Schweizer Kreditanstalt,
Zurich.[FN88]b.Letter to the State Department on behalf of
Gertrud Holtmann, Jewish, heir to the estate of Professor
Moritz Freiberger (10/25/48).[FN89]  Freiberger died in 1937,
and his wife "committed suicide in 1942 because she was
about to be deported."  The estate includes "substantial"
deposits with the Swiss Bank Corporation in Zurich, the
Stockholm Enskilda Bank in Sweden (Wallenberg), and bonds
by Brown Bros. Harriman & Co., New York.


c. laim sent to the Swiss Joint Commission's Secretariat on
behalf of Fritz Fenchel, a Jewish persecutee.  Fenchel's
company was aryanized, his money taken and placed in the
Swiss National Bank.  After the war, Fenchel was denied
access to this money.[FN90] d.R. Weill asks assistance in
recovering his father's money, "deposited in a banking
institution  in Basel":


I am heir to this money but I don't know its amount and
where it was deposited, because by obvious reasons the
facts regarding the money in Switzerland were known only to
my father and his wife Ida killed in Poland's concentration
camps.[FN91]e.A legal representative for relatives of
Holocaust victims write for help in finding the accounts of
Anna and Isabella Trepel who "had considerable funds on
deposit in banks in Switzerland:


They [the Trepels] were citizens of Germany and died during
the occupation of the Nazis  in Germany.  My client has
just learned that her two cousins committed suicide, both
being of Jewish faith, when they were to have been sent to
a concentration camp in Germany.[FN92]Upon information and
belief, these deposits have never been confirmed or found
by Swiss Banks and there has been no final resolution of
these claims.  From 1945 to date, Swiss banks have been
dilatory in responding to requests for the return of these
assets and deliberately obstructed efforts to have the
assets returned to their rightful owners.  The Swiss
banking industry has combined and conspired to delay or
deny the return of such assets to their rightful owners.

In 1962, in partial recognition of their failure to comply
with their obligations and duties to the rightful owners of
such assets, the Swiss government passed a bill which
required the Swiss banks, among other financial
institutions, as fiduciaries and trustees of depositors or
owners of accounts who were members of groups subjected to
racial, religious or political persecution by agents or
representatives of the Nazi Regime, to identify such
depositors or owners and to return such assets.

The Swiss Banking Association objected to the proposed
legislation.[FN93]Under the 1962 law, however, the Swiss
banks had ultimate decision-making power to control their
audit.  In concert, they deliberately failed to
affirmatively abide by their obligations to identify these
depositors and owners and return such monies.  In concert,
the Swiss banks combined and/or conspired to delay and/or
prevent such identification and return of assets.

For example, most recently, Senator Alfonse D'Amato wrote
to the Union Bank of Switzerland and the Swiss Bank
Corporation, on behalf of Jacob Friedman, requesting the
return of assets deposited in their banks.  The reply
letters from both banks contain similar language and
indicate that each bank knew of an inquiry regarding Jacob
Friedman at the other bank, despite the fact that no bank,
under Swiss Secrecy Law, is able to communicate with any
other bank concerning any other bank or deposit.[FN94]As
recently as April 23, 1996, Hans Baer, representing the
Swiss Banking Association and its member companies,
publicly stated that the issue of assets on behalf of
members of groups which were racial, religious or political
persecutees of the Nazi Regime has never been fully, fairly
or finally resolved.In testimony before the Senate Banking
Committee, Hans Baer, SBA Executive Board member, Chairman
of the Julius Baer Bank and Baer Holding, Ltd, stated on
behalf of the SBA and all of its member banks:

We are committed to resolving all outstanding questions
about assets that may have belonged to victims of the
Holocaust in a sensitive, equitable, open, accurate, and
professional manner...


I want to emphasize in the strongest terms possible our
determination that at the end of the current process, any
dormant assets in Swiss banks that may have belonged to
victims of the Holocaust will have been distributed to the
rightful heirs of the victims, or otherwise to worthy
charitable causes...


[L]et me reiterate the desire of the SBA and its members to
resolve this matter thoroughly and expeditiously, in
accordance with the highest standards of the Swiss banks
and the Jewish community.

Our single purpose is to put in place a plan that will
sensitively, openly, and effectively resolve this matter
once and for all.[FN95]As a result of the Swiss bank's denial
of "deposited assets" accounts and their obstruction and
delays in addressing the issue, there is no presently
available accurate estimate of the amount of "deposited
assets" in Swiss banks.  Their conduct, however, has
produced various, and potentially conflicting and
incomplete estimates.

For example, pursuant to the 1962 law, the Swiss Bankers
Association conducted a search through their files to
locate the assets of persecutees they had denied holding.
At the conclusion of the search, the SBA announced it had
found approximately 9 million Swiss francs, or about $2
million, belonging to 961 claimants.  However, some 7,000
claimants were turned down.  The validity of this search
was questioned, but nothing further was done until a new
search was conducted in 1995.  These accounts were said to
have been dormant for at least ten years and were opened
before 1945.  However, in his testimony before the Senate
Banking Committee on April 23, 1996, SBA representative
Hans Baer stated during questioning that the $32 million
figure represents all dormant accounts found, and that
perhaps only a portion of these accounts are Holocaust
related.[FN96]


VI.     ACTIVE CONCEALMENT

Through various schemes and devices, including the
disguising of accounts, the use of fictitious names and the
signing of false affidavits, Swiss banks, acting with
others, actively and affirmatively concealed the existence
of accounts which held looted and/or cloaked assets.  Since
the conclusion of World War II, Swiss banks have
deliberately and purposefully obstructed efforts to
identify such accounts and transfer the assets to the
rightful owners.  The Swiss banks have also affirmatively
misrepresented their knowledge with respect to accounts
dealing with looted and cloaked assets and those belonging
to racial, religious and political persecutees of the Nazi
Regime.

A.In General

Swiss banks aided the Nazi Regime through the cloaking of
German capital and industry:

The second basic financial service rendered to Germany by
Switzerland is furnishing of financial climate and
institutions requisite for the cloaking of German
industrial operations throughout the world.  Under Swiss
law and tradition of financial secrecy, the Germans are
able to conceal their ownership of nominally Swiss
companies which carry on trade in the Western Hemisphere
and elsewhere to the ultimate benefit of the Germans.  One
of the largest Swiss chemical companies, Hoffman-La Roche,
maintains its Swiss head office in the border city of
Basle, primarily as a routing station for products
manufactured across the German border.  In addition, Swiss
firms, with and without German ownership, have entered
readily into cartel agreements with the Germans. Many of
these were nominally severed in 1939, but will probably be
reestablished at the conclusion of the war.  The result of
these arrangements has been that Swiss companies hold
markets and sources of supply from which the German
companies are cut off during wartime.  These agreements are
believed important particularly in the chemical and
pharmaceutical industries, where four out of the five major
companies are affiliated with I.G. Chemie, the Swiss branch
of I.G. Farben; ... German ownership of Swiss companies in
Switzerland results in the use of these companies'
facilities as a direct aid to the German war
effort.[FN97]Close ties between bank directors and German
interests hindered US-Swiss progress on locating enemy
assets:

Agreement with Switzerland on disclosure of German property
has so far been unsuccessful.  Swiss officials have not
demonstrated good faith.  For example, in the conference of
April 1944 between Swiss bank officials and Anglo-American
representatives, Nussbaumer, of the Swiss Bank Corp., one
of the most notorious agents for Axis capital, was
delegated as a principal representative for Switzerland...
the decree blocking German assets as of February 17, 1945
likewise appears to have been violated.  Puhl of the
Reichsbank stated that he was still able to obtain francs
and "to use these francs to transfer funds to a third
country."[FN98]British and US representatives met in Lisbon
in May 1944 to discuss imposing additional restrictions on
Swiss bank dealings with Nazis.  It was agreed that the
Swiss should prevent the buying of foreign exchange in
Switzerland (escudos and Swedish crowns) and that the Swiss
should halt gold transactions between the Swiss and the
Reichsbank.  At the end of May, Reichsbank official Emil
Puhl met with Swiss National Bank Chairman Ernst Weber to
discuss blocked credits.  When US officials in Bern
informed OSS head General William Donovan of the results of
these talks, Donovan sent a memo to President Roosevelt,
relaying the Bern report:

Weber is personally friendly with Puhl.  By the terms of
this arrangement, it is possible for the Reichsbank, within
the framework of their previous gold transactions, to sell
gold for Swiss francs in accordance with a monthly quota.
This quota amounts to approximately 6,000 kilograms of
gold, worth approximately 30,000,000-40,000,000 Swiss
francs.  If it should become necessary, Weber stated, he
was ready to take even more gold than the amount fixed in
the monthly quota.  Under the fairly broad arrangement thus
reached, it will be possible to exchange Swiss francs just
as before for the foreign exchange of 3rd countries....


The effects of this smuggling and the outlook for the
following six months are still as good as they were before.
It is possible for us to anticipate that for the last half
of the current year, as in the initial half, Germany will
receive an additional 3,000,000 Swiss francs worth of ball
bearings through the means I have reported above.
Moreover, the ball bearings in question are the kind which
Germany requires most and on which deliveries are needed as
quickly as possible.[FN99]A State Department memo notes that:

No useful purpose could be served at the present time by
this delegation since the Swiss have not cooperated
satisfactorily in revising the War Trade Agreement of
December, 1943, and since the Swiss have been dilatory in
forwarding their counter-proposals concerning the Standard
of Conduct, which would be followed by banks in Switzerland
in dealing with the enemy... the Swiss have so far failed
to cooperate throughout the war and even at the present
time on general, financial and economic problems.


Even in 1945, the U.S. noted that the Swiss had
"categorically refused to fulfill their promise to provide
us with a report on the results of the census as of that
date and gave no assurance that any such report would be
forthcoming."  On the topic of restoring looted property,
the U.S. reported that:

The Swiss indicated that they propose to leave that matter
entirely to a case-by-case juridical determination and
Swiss stolen property legal procedure is singularly
inappropriate.  This, in effect, means that the Swiss have
taken no measures whatsoever to fulfill the pledge given by
them on March 8 [the Washington Accord] to enact such
legislation as necessary to assure the return of this
property to the legitimate owners.


A U. S. report notes that:

The economy of Switerland itself is so entwined with that
of Germany that the bankers and industrialists do not wish
to have revealed the extent of their collaberation.


In a letter from the head of the US Legation in Bern head
Harrison to US Treasury Secretary (10/23/45), Harrison
relays his anger at increased "Swiss dilatory tactics,"
stating that "there is some reason for doubting whether
they are making sincere efforts to locate and immobilize
assets in their country."  He expressed "doubts concerning
the good faith of [Swiss] officials" and cited the
Puhl/Fund correspondence and Puhl's boast that most of the
economic controls against the Germans "have been
successfully removed," including the unblocking of the
Reichsbank account.[FN100]

In a telegram from the American Embassy in Lisbon to the
State Department (9/3/46), the U.S. discusses the Swiss
refusal to provide Allies with information on the "bar
numbers of gold sold by the Reichsbank to Portugal from
Reichsbank depot in Switerland."[FN101]

B.Currie Mission/Kilgore Hearings

In February 1945, a special mission, later termed "The
Currie Mission," comprised of American, French and British
negotiators was sent to Switzerland.  The US delegation was
headed by Lauchlin Currie, Assistant to the President and
former FEA Deputy Administrator.  The direction of the war
seemed inevitable, and the Swiss feared being isolated in
the postwar world.  In anticipation of Allied demands, the
Swiss Government had issued two decrees freezing German
assets and forbidding dealings in foreign currency.  In the
negotiations, against the wishes of the Swiss banking
community, the Swiss Government agreed to block assets of
Axis satellites, to take a census of all assets held in
Switzerland, facilitate the return of looted property to
its rightful owners, and to halt future purchases of German
gold, except for "minor legitimate purposes."  However, the
Swiss refused to provide the Allies with information on
German assets in Switzerland.[FN102]

The Swiss agreement maintained bank secrecy, yet authorized
Swiss officials to investigate ownership of the numbered
accounts, and required that such assets held for Germans be
declared to the Swiss Government.  US officials sought more
concrete steps:

The action taken by the Swiss to date represents a formal
gesture to satisfy the U.S. which by itself has some value.
However, it carries no guarantee that German assets in
Switzerland will in fact be frozen.


Germans in Switzerland are permitted by the decree to
freely dispose of their assets for "normal" professional
and personal transactions, and no authorization is
required, among other things, for "normal administration"
of German assets... Unless the Swiss are strict in their
interpretation of "normal" and vigorous in their
investigation of ostensibly innocent professional, personal
and commercial transactions, agents in Switzerland will be
able to freely use German assets to further Nazi
underground activities.


The decree delegated to the appropriate Swiss officials
authority to request information from banking institutions,
with respect to the ownership of accounts within
Switzerland.  Much will depend here again, on how
vigorously this authority is exercised to remove German
assets from the Swiss protective law.[FN103]Before the
surrender of Germany in 1945, Senate Subcommittee for
Military Affairs Chairman, Senator Harley Kilgore, launched
an investigation  of German assets and the role played by
Swiss banks and the Bank Secrecy Act of 1934 in cloaking
financial operations of the Third Reich.  Foreign Funds
Control Director Orvis Schmidt reported that the Swiss
government had wilfully neglected to intervene in the
trafficking of Nazi loot through the Swiss banks upon
official invitation of German government.  Schmidt reported
on the tremendous growth of the Swiss banks, and that at
that time (later altered) German holdings in Swiss banks
amounted to 16 billion francs, adding that Swiss bank
secrecy keeps even the Swiss Government from knowing the
names of the depositors, and this favors German maneuvers.

It was noted that while the Swiss decreed illegal the
cloaking of German assets in Switzerland in March 1945, the
Swiss Federal Council nevertheless maintained bank secrecy,
rendering such an accord essentially ineffective.  Also,
the Swiss Government could not inquire about the names of
the owners, and only seven investigators were assigned to
the project.[FN104]    The Kilgore Committee reported that
Swiss banks, led by the Bank for International Settlements
and its member bank, the Swiss National Bank (they shared
directors and staff members) had violated post-war
agreements not to permit financial transactions that would
help Nazis hide their loot.  Senator Kilgore stated:

Despite... the assurances of the Swiss government that
German accounts would be blocked, the Germans maneuvered
themselves back into a position where they could utilize
their assets in Switzerland, could acquire desperately
needed foreign exchange by the sale of looted gold and
could conceal economic reserves for another war.  These
moves were made possible by the willingness of the Swiss
government and banking officials, in violation of their
agreement with the Allied Powers, to make a secret deal
with the Nazis.[FN105]German documents made public during the
Kilgore hearings revealed that Swiss banking and
governmental officials met secretly with Reichsbank Vice
President Emil Puhl, and collectively worked to find
loopholes in the Allied-Swiss Accord.  Puhl boasted to his
boss, Walther Funk, of the warm reception he received in
Berne, and his success:

Above all I have insisted [to the Swiss National Bank] on
our receiving [Swiss francs] in return for Reichsmarks
which the Reichsbank might release for any reason.  That is
important as it will enable us to use these francs to
transfer funds to a third country.[FN106]C.Washington AccordIn
or about March 1946, the Governments of Switzerland, the
United States, Great Britain, and France met to negotiate
the issue of the forcible removal of gold by Germany from
German-occupied countries to Switzerland.

Negotiations on the Washington Accord were long and
tedious.   The following correspondence excerpts between
William Rappard of the Swiss Legation in Washington, and
Randolph Paul, Special Assistant to the President at the
State Department, exemplifies the difficulties of the
negotiations.

In one letter, Rappard challenges the Allied assessment
that a minimum of $200,000,000 worth of gold looted by
Germany was transferred to Switzerland during the war.
Such numbers are "contrary to our own," Rappard writes, and
requests "further and more concrete data which alone would
allow us to understand fully your claims and their bases:"

How are the actual circumstances to be established under
which these predatory operations took place?  Is it known
when, where, by whom and in what way these different
amounts of gold came into the possession of the Germans?
And whether and to what amount direct or indirect
compensation was made to the previous holders or to the
original legal owners?  Is there any documentary evidence
available concerning these transactions?... The Swiss
Delegation would welcome a definition of looted property
as understood by the Allies...[FN107]Paul responded:[N]one of
the information requested has any relevance to acceptance
by you of the principle advocated by the Allied Delegation
that you will restore to the Allies looted gold that was
acquired from the Germans.  When agreement has been reached
on this principle, the Allied Delegation will be prepared
to furnish the Swiss Delegation with necessary additional
information[FN108]Rappard replied that the Allies "cannot
derive any legal claim for the surrender of the German
assets in Switzerland."  On the gold issue, "the Swiss
government is not in a position to accept as correct the
verbal and written declarations of the Allies and the
conclusions drawn therefrom."[FN109]Responding to questions
about the sale of looted gold to Switzerland.  Rappard
refused to assume responsibility and stated:[N]o blame can
justifiably be placed on the Swiss National Bank in
connection with its purchases of gold, and that the
question whether possibly looted gold should be restored to
the legitimate owner can solely be decided by the Swiss
Federal Tribunal.[FN110] Rappard reminded Paul of the Swiss
proposals of April 11, 1946, and the Swiss "readiness to
assume great sacrifices for which no legal obligation can
be recognized,...to open the way for a practical solution
of the existing differences."[FN111]  However, when a figure
is named, the Swiss delegation President halted
negotiations:

I submitted to my Delegation the sum of $130,000,000 which
the Allied Delegations demanded as an agreed settlement of
Allied claims of the question of gold... this sum very far
exceeded not only the possibilities offered by our
instructions but also those justified by the circumstances
of this case, as we see them, the Swiss Delegation were
unanimous in deeming it aimless to continue discussions on
this basis.[FN112]Randolph Paul, Special Assistant to the
President, wrote to Minister Stucki, relaying Allied
acceptance of the Swiss offer of 250 million Swiss francs,
with the assumption that information on German assets in
Switzerland would finally be provided, and he urged the
Swiss to turn over assets of heirless victims to the
Allies:

The Allied Delegations will invite the Swiss Delegation, in
entering into the accord, to recommend to the Swiss
Government that procedures should be established whereby
the property within Switzerland of victims of Nazi action
who have since died and left no heirs are put at the sole
disposal of the Allied Governments for the purposes of
relief.[FN113]The Swiss consented, although the Swiss
Government stated it was "unable to recognize the legal
basis of these claims but that it desired to contribute its
share to the pacification and reconstruction of
Europe..."[FN114]At the end of the war, the Berlin Protocol,
issued at the end of the Potsdam Conference of the Big
Three, called for war reparations to the Allies to be
provided from appropriate German external assets.  The
Swiss denied the Allied right to German property in
Switzerland, stating that Switzerland's  own claims against
Germany had to be satisfied first.  Swiss officials added
that estimates of German property in Switzerland had been
exaggerated, and that such funds would not even cover Swiss
claims, leaving no funds for war reparations.

At the beginning of the negotiations, $1.5 billion of Swiss
funds were blocked in the U.S.  Switzerland objected to the
US proposal to use German assets in Switzerland to cover
war reparations, claiming that such action would violate
Switzerland's neutrality.  Instead, Swiss officials
proposed that such assets instead be applied against German
debts to the Swiss, which the Swiss had estimated almost
equally at $250,000,000.  When the Allies estimated the
figure at three times that amount, the Swiss raised
additional claims against Germany.  An impasse resulted,
and Stucki flew back to Switzerland for new orders.

After six more weeks of negotiations, the Washington Accord
was signed on May 25, 1946.  The Accord was negotiated for
Switzerland by Walter Stucki, who served as its war-time
Ambassador to Vichy, France, and later Chief of its
Political Department.

Under the terms of the Accord, assets of German citizens
living in Germany or subject to repatriation were to be
divided 50-50 between Switzerland and the Allied
Reparations Agency.  In addition, Switzerland would
contribute 50,000,000 francs of the Allied share to aid
displaced persons, and would also pay 250,000,000 francs in
settlement of Allied claims for looted gold in Switzerland
(originally estimated at over five times that amount).

Just months after the signing of the Washington Accord, US
Treasury Representative James Mann questioned Swiss
motivations:

[T]he Swiss have furnished the Legation with an interim
report on the progress being made under the blocking and
census decrees which is a joke (and which to me clearly
proves, if any proof is needed, that the Swiss have no
intention of really doing anything in connection with the
discovery and immobilization of German assets except to
stall as long as they possibly can.)[FN115]D.Heirless
AssetsShortly after the war, it was also recognized that
there were significant issues relating to the
identification and return of assets of persons who were
persecuted for relgious, racial or political reasons by the
Nazi Regime.A State Department policy paper in 1949
outlined concerns on the persecutee issue:

[I]t has been considered that the [Washington] Accord
permits the seizure of the assets in Switzerland belonging
to the Jews who remained in Germany past February 1945.
This would include the category of those who were in
concentration or DP camps.[FN116]Four years after the
Washington Accord, issues relating to heirless assets and
persecutees remained unresolved.  The Allies held a
Tripartite meeting in Paris, to be followed by negotiations
in Bern.  The Swiss issued a precondition to the talks,
which the Allies found unacceptable, and the US delegation
left Switzerland "without ever having a meeting on the
subject."[FN117]E..Ongoing InvestigationsAs a result of the
above acts of concealment, obstruction and
misrepresentation, several investigations attempting to
address the issues of looted and deposited assets are
presently ongoing.

1.Volcker Commission

On May 2, 1996 in New York, the World Jewish Restitution
Organization and the World Jewish Congress, representing
also the Jewish Agency and Allied Organizations, signed a
Memorandum of Understanding with the Swiss Bankers
Association to:

cooperate to assure that the Swiss Government will deal
with the question of looted assets in Swiss banks or other
institutions which were not reported or returned under the
relevant laws during the years before, during and
immediately after the Second World War.[FN118]The parties
agreed to establish an "Independent Committee of Eminent
Persons" (ICEP) to appoint an international auditing
company to "search for accounts and assets in question."
The Committee appointed Paul A. Volcker, former Federal
Reserve Chairman, as committee Chairman.[FN119]

The memorandum of understanding creating the Committee
contains no time limit.  No mention is made of what the
Committee will do once the audit is completed.[FN120]

The SBA -- whose activities were questionable at best
regarding dealings with Nazis and looted gold -- is
supposed to "assure the auditors unfettered access to all
relevant files in banking institutions regarding dormant
accounts and other assets and financial instruments
deposited before, during and immediately after the war."
However, the memorandum of understanding makes no mention
of any enforcement mechanism.  The SBA has, in fact,
actively sought to block such investigations for over 50
years.

The Committee is apparently limited to a number of accounts
specifically selected by the SBA.  The memorandum of
understanding is silent as to the Committee's authority
beyond the pre-selected accounts.

2.Swiss Investigation

On September 16, 1996, the Swiss Federal Council supported
the draft "Federal Decree Concerning the Historical and
Legal Investigation of the Fate of Assets Which Reached
Switzerland as a Result of National Socialist Rule."[FN121]The
draft decree mandates an investigation into "the extent and
fate of assets of all kinds which were transferred to
banks, insurance companies, attorneys, notaries,
fiduciaries, asset managers or other physical or legal
persons or groups of persons residing or headquartered in
Switzerland for deposit, investment to transfer to third
parties or were received by the Swiss National Bank" and
belonged to Nazi victims, persecutees, or Nazi members.
The legislation should move to the Swiss Senate in
December.[FN122]

The following phase would be a ninety-day review, and
implementation would not begin until April, 1997.  In
addition, Swiss officials say the search may last up to
five years.  Provisions in the legislation allow the
Federal Council to "modify the scope of the investigation",
to choose its own "experts" to conduct the search, and
mandates that "the Federal Council has the sole control
over all material related to the investigation."[FN123]

3.State Department Investigation

On October 5, 1996, the State Department announced plans to
search its archives for information on lost gold and other
assets looted by Nazi Germany during World War II.
Promising a "thorough and immediate study," State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the State
Department's Office of the Historian under chief historian
Bill Slaney would scour the archives in response to
requests to find "what the US government knew about the
disposition of Nazi assets at that time and whether or not
we had diplomatic contact with the Swiss government."

Burns said the State Department regarded the issue as a
"highly urgent and priority matter," and that the study
would last two to three months, and the results would be
made public.

The State Department has not disclosed when the study will
commence, nor what steps will be taken -- if any -- at a
later point.


CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS

This action is brought and may properly be maintained as a
class action pursuant to the provisions of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a)(1)-(4) and 23(b)(1),
23(b)(2) and/or 23(b)(3).  Plaintiffs seek certification of
the following classes:


Class A:Rightful Owners of Nazi Regime Looted Assets and/or
Their Heirs

All persons or entities (or their heirs) from whom the Nazi
Regime obtained looted assets, as defined above, which
assets were in whole or in part the subject of any
transaction executed by or through a Swiss bank.

Class B:Slave Laborers and/or Their Heirs

All persons (or their heirs) who were forced to work as
slave laborers for the benefit of Nazi Regime entities, the
profits from which were deposited in, liquidated by, or
laundered through, commercial transactions with the Swiss
banks, which transactions included in whole or in part the
profits derived from that slave labor.

Class C: Swiss Banks Depositors and/or Their Heirs

All persons (or their heirs) who were persecuted, or feared
persecution, for religious, racial or political reasons by
the Nazi Regime, who deposited assets in Swiss banks
between 1933 and 1946 and who have not had the proceeds of
these deposits returned to them.

The class definitions exclude any entity in which
defendants have a controlling interest, and the officers,
directors, affiliates, legal representatives, heirs,
successors, subsidiaries, and/or assigns of any such
entity.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  Each of the proposed classes is
so numerous that individual joinder of all its members is
impracticable under the standards of Fed. R. Civ. P.
23(a)(1).  As the factual allegations demonstrate,
thousands of persons are members of each class.  While the
exact number and identities of the class members are
unknown at this time, such information can be ascertained
through appropriate investigation and discovery.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2) and 23(b)(3).  There are questions
of law and fact that are common with respect to each class,
which predominate over any individual issues which may
exist as to each Class.  Common questions of fact and law
include the following:

a.Did the defendant Swiss banks carry out banking
transactions involving Nazi Regime looted assets?

b.Did the defendant Swiss banks carry out banking
transactions involving Nazi Regime cloaked assets?

c.Did the defendant Swiss banks carry out banking
transactions that involved capital or assets which
included, in whole or in part, profits from Nazi Regime
entities who employed slave labor?

d.Did the defendant Swiss banks accept deposited assets and
then deny, block or obstruct access to the deposited assets
of persons (or their heirs) who were the object of
religious, racial or political persecution by the Nazi
Regime?

e.Did the defendant Swiss banks conspire with each other to
deny, block and/or obstruct access to the deposited assets
of persons (or their heirs) who were the object of
religious, racial or political persecution by the Nazi
Regime?

f.Were the defendant Swiss banks complicit in and
collaborating with the Nazi Regime's activities in
furtherance of their illegal war effort and in their
commission of violations of international law by the
liquidation, depositing, and/or laundering of, looted
assets or cloaked assets?

g.Did the defendant Swiss banks conspire with the Nazi
Regime or with each other in the Nazi Regime's illegal war
effort and in their commission of violations of
international law by the depositing, liquidating and/or
laundering of looted assets or cloaked assets?

h.Did the defendant Swiss banks violate applicable
standards of banking conduct?

i.Did the defendant Swiss banks knowingly or intentionally
conceal their participation in transactions involving
looted assets, cloaked assets, or assets of Nazi Regime
entities who employed slave labor; or conceal their efforts
to deny, block or obstruct access to deposited assets of
persons (or their heirs) who were the object of religious,
racial or political persecution by the Nazi Regime?

Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  Plaintiffs' claims are typical
of the claims of the members of each class.  Plaintiffs and
all members of the classes have been similarly affected by
defendant Swiss banks' common course of conduct, and the
members of each class have identical claims against the
Swiss bank defendants.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  The class representatives for
each class will fairly and adequately protect the interests
of the members of that class, and do not have interests
which are antagonistic to the interests of other class
members.  The class representatives have retained attorneys
experienced in the prosecution of complex litigation, and
class action litigation.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  A class action is superior to
other available methods for the fair, efficient and just
adjudication of this litigation.  Individual joinder of all
members of each class is impractical.  Even if individual
class members had the resources to pursue individual
litigation, it would be unduly burdensome to the courts in
which the individual litigation would proceed.  Individual
litigation magnifies the delay and expense to all parties
in the court system of resolving the controversies
engendered by defendant Swiss banks' common course of
conduct.  The class action device allows a single court to
provide the benefits of unitary adjudication, judicial
economy, and the fair and equitable handling of all
plaintiffs' claims in a single forum.  The conduct of this
action as a class action conserves the resources of the
parties and of the judicial system, and protects the rights
of each class member.  Furthermore, for many, if not most,
class members, a class action is the only feasible
mechanism that allows them an opportunity for legal redress
and justice.

This action is also certifiable under the provisions of
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1) and/or 23(b)(2) because:

Inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to
individual members of each class would establish
incompatible standards of conduct for the Swiss bank
defendants toward that class.

Adjudications of individual class members' claims with
respect to the Swiss bank defendants would, as a practical
matter, be dispositive of the interests of other members
not party to the adjudications, and could substantially
impair or impede the ability of other class members to
protect their interests.

With respect to each class, the defendant Swiss banks have
acted and refused to act on grounds generally applicable to
that class, thereby making equitable relief with respect to
that class as a whole appropriate.


COUNT I

CONSPIRACY TO VIOLATE AND/OR COMPLICITY IN
VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
(On Behalf of Classes A and B)

Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others
similarly situated, reallege, as if fully set forth, each
and every allegation contained in the preceding paragraphs.

From 1933 through at least 1946, the Swiss collaborated and
acted in complicity with and aided and abetted the
activities of the Nazi Regime in furtherance of the
commission of war crimes, crimes against humanity, crimes
against peace, slavery and slave labor, and genocide.
Specifically, the actions and conduct of the Swiss Banks
exceeded the obligation of a neutral country and actively
assisted the war objectives of the Nazi Regime.

The Swiss banks knew that the agents and representatives of
the Nazi Regime and the Regime itself was looting and
plundering the assets of others in furtherance of their war
crimes, crimes against humanity, crimes against peace, and
genocide.

The Swiss banks knowingly received a portion of those
looted assets for deposit; exchanged a portion of those
assets for hard currency; and otherwise transferred and
laundered such assets for and on behalf of the Nazi Regime,
its agents and representatives.

The Swiss banks also knew that the Nazi Regime, its
representatives and agents were depositing capital in
disguised accounts in Switzerland, a portion of which was
composed of profits of slave labor.

The Swiss banks knowingly hid, cloaked, liquidated and
laundered such funds and items, falsified records
pertaining to such funds and items and illegally channeled
such funds and items to third parties on behalf of the Nazi
Regime.

As to looted and cloaked assets deposited, laundered or
transferred into or out of accounts in Swiss banks, the
Swiss banks knowingly received stolen property or property
tainted by violations of international law, committed by
persons or businesses acting on behalf of the Nazi Regime.

 The Swiss banks engaged in a common scheme or conspiracy
in furtherance of their objective of profiting from their
activities in aiding and abetting, or acting in complicity
and collaboration with, the Nazi Regime with respect to
looting and slave labor activities.

The above-referenced actions by defendant Swiss banks were
in violation of numerous international treaties, customary
international laws, and fundamental human rights laws
prohibiting genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity,
crimes against peace, slavery, slave and forced labor, and
slave trade, including, or as reflected by, the Genocide
Convention; the United Nations Charter; the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights; the Geneva Convention of 1929;
the supplemental Geneva Convention on the Treatment of
Non-Combatants During War Time; the Nurnberg Principles;
the Slavery Convention of 1926; the Supplementary
Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade,
and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery; the
International Labor Conventions and Recommendations; the
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;  and the Hague
Convention of 1907.

 As a result of the above-referenced violations of
international law, plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff
classes have suffered injury and are entitled to damages in
excess of $50,000, the precise amount to be determined at
trial.

COUNT II

BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY
(On Behalf of Class C)

Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others
similarly situated, reallege, as if fully set forth, each
and every allegation contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Defendant banks, as entities who handle money and property
for the benefit of other persons, stand in a relation
implying and necessitating great confidence and trust on
the part of those, and family members of those, who deposit
such money and property with defendants.  As such,
defendants owe a fiduciary duty to plaintiffs and the
class.

As fiduciaries, defendants owe plaintiffs and the class a
duty of undivided and undiluted loyalty and candor.
Furthermore, defendants must act in the best interests of
the client in the handling of the client's account, which
includes an obligation to produce all information relating
to the client's transactions to the client or his legal
representatives and heirs upon request.

 A fiduciary duty by defendants also is established by the
unique factual circumstances existing prior to and during
World War II.  In 1935, the Swiss Bank Secrecy Act was
passed to attract the deposits of persons, including Jews,
who wanted their money held in a country not controlled by
the Nazi Regime.  Consequently, a special relationship of
confidence and trust between depositors and class members
and defendants was created by defendants, a relationship
carefully cultivated by defendant banks in their
self-proclaimed role as safe-harbors for assets during the
Nazi Regime era.

Defendants breached their fiduciary duties by, among other
things:

a.Disposing of assets of bank depositors without notice to
the depositors, for the financial benefit of the banks;

b.  Providing information about depositors and deposits to
the Nazi Regime;

c.Sharing information about depositors and deposits with
other Swiss banks in furtherance of the conspiracy detailed
above; and

d.Refusing to conduct a thorough, accurate and truthful
accounting of dormant assets and return such assets to
depositors or heirs of depositors.

As a result of the above-referenced breaches of fiduciary
duty, plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class have
suffered injury and are entitled to damages in excess of
$50,000, the precise amount to be determined at trial.


COUNT III

BREACH OF SPECIAL DUTY
(On Behalf of Class All Classes)

Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others
similarly situated, reallege, as if fully set forth, each
and every allegation contained in the preceding paragraphs.

In 1962, and again in 1995 and early 1996, defendants
assumed a special duty to protect (i) all persons (and
their heirs) who placed assets in Swiss banks between 1933
and 1946, and (ii) all persons or entities (and their
heirs) whose assets were looted by the Nazis between 1933
and 1946 and deposited in Swiss banks, and (iii) all
persons (or their heirs) who performed slave labor, the
profits from which were deposited in or cloaked by Swiss
banks.  Defendants assumed this special duty of protection
by representing that they were undertaking to examine,
identify and return such assets.

Defendants did not assume these duties gratuitously.
Rather, they made these representations to combat emerging
concerns over the status and location of such assets and
defendants' protracted refusal to account for such assets.

 A special duty by defendants also is established by the
unique factual circumstances existing prior to and during
World War II.  In 1935, the Swiss Bank Secrecy Act was
passed to attract the deposits of persons, including Jews,
who wanted their money held in a country not controlled by
the Nazi Regime.  Consequently, a special relationship of
confidence and trust between depositors and class members
and defendants was created by defendants, a relationship
carefully cultivated by defendant banks in their
self-proclaimed role as safe-harbors for assets during the
Nazi Regime era.

Defendants breached their special duties by, among other
things:

a.Failing to exercise due care in the conduct of the
accountings;

b.Intentionally, recklessly or negligently understating the
amount of such assets held by defendants;

c.Intentionally, recklessly or negligently suppressing
information that would assist plaintiffs and class members
in recovering such assets;

d.Engaging in a misinformation campaign designed to quell
all further debate over such assets and, thereby, seek to
keep heirs from pursuing the matter further; and

e.Failing to return the deposited, looted and cloaked
assets to their rightful owners.

Defendants continuing conduct in failing to fulfill their
special duty is a further breach of that duty.

As a result of the above-referenced breaches of special
duty, plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class have
suffered injury and are entitled to damages in excess of
$50,000, the precise amount to be determined at trial.

COUNT IV

BREACH OF CONTRACT
(On Behalf of Class C)


Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others
similarly situated, reallege, as if fully set forth, each
and every allegation contained in the preceding paragraphs.

 Plaintiffs, or those acting on their behalf, entered into
contracts with defendant Swiss banks by depositing assets
with defendant Swiss banks.

Class members have performed all contractual terms and
conditions precedent for defendant Swiss banks' performance
of their contractual obligations, or class members'
performance of such conditions is excused under the
doctrine of impossibility.

 Defendant Swiss banks have breached their contractual
obligations by failing to return to the plaintiff
depositors and/or their heirs all funds or other property
belonging to these plaintiffs upon demand.

Defendant Swiss banks violated the covenant of good faith
and fair dealing by accepting assets from depositors
knowing that the assets would be retained by the banks, and
the banks would work in concert to prevent depositors'
heirs from obtaining the assets.

As a direct and proximate result of the acts or omissions
of the defendant Swiss banks, the breach of contract
alleged herein has damaged plaintiff class members because
plaintiffs have been deprived of their property and assets,
the use and enjoyment of such assets, and of any interest
which could have been earned thereon.

As a result of the above-referenced breaches of conduct,
plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class have suffered
injury and are entitled to damages in excess of $50,000,
the precise amount to be determined at trial.

COUNT V

CONVERSION
(On Behalf of All Classes)


Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others
similarly situated, reallege, as if fully set forth, each
and every allegation contained in the preceding paragraphs.

 Defendants Swiss banks received property and assets
belonging to the plaintiffs from the Nazi Regime as a
result of the illegal activities of the Nazi Regime prior
to and during World War II, including the looting of assets
and the use of slave labor.  Defendants also received
deposits from, or on behalf of, persons persecuted by, or
fearing persecution from, the Nazi Regime.

The defendants Swiss banks are guilty of conversion of
assets of the plaintiffs, including, but not limited to,
gold, silver, jewelry, specific monetary deposits, dormant
accounts, looted assets and the products of slave labor .

The defendants' actions as described above amount to an
unauthorized assumption and exercise of the right of
ownership over goods belonging to others, specifically to
the plaintiffs and class members.

The defendants have dealt, and intend to deal, with the
subject property in a way which is inconsistent with
plaintiffs' rights, and the defendants' withholding of said
property from the true owners, the plaintiffs, is without
justification.

Alternatively, to the extent that any of the original
possession by the defendants of the subject property was
lawful, plaintiffs have demanded the return thereof and
defendants have refused to return said property to
plaintiffs.

By their misconduct, the defendant Swiss banks injured all
class members by depriving them of their property, and of
its use and enjoyment, and of any interest which could have
earned thereon.

As a result of the above-referenced conversion of
plaintiffs' assets, plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff
class have suffered injury and are entitled to damages in
excess of $50,000, the precise amount to be determined at
trial.

COUNT VI

UNJUST ENRICHMENT
(On Behalf of All Classes)


Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others
similarly situated, reallege, as if fully set forth, each
and every allegation contained in the preceding paragraphs.

 Defendant Swiss banks received property and assets
belonging to the plaintiffs, in part as a result of the
illegal activities of the Nazi Regime prior to and during
World War II, including deposited assets and looted and
cloaked assets.

By virtue of the Swiss banks' control of, liquidation of,
or laundering of plaintiffs' assets, including deposits and
looted and cloaked assets, a benefit has been conferred
upon the Swiss banks.

The acceptance, use, and/or retention of these assets by
the Swiss banks is inequitable by virtue of the fact that
these assets were obtained and/or retained as a result of
the illegal acts of the Nazi Regime and the complicity and
collaboration of the Swiss banks in those acts.

Plaintiffs have demanded the return of these assets and
defendants have refused to return said property to
plaintiffs.

By their misconduct, the defendant Swiss banks have been
unjustly enriched to the detriment and injury of all class
members by depriving them of their property, and of its use
and enjoyment, and of any interest which could have earned
thereon.

As a result of the above-referenced unjust enrichment,
plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class have suffered
injury and are entitled to damages in excess of $50,000,
the precise amount to be determined at trial.

COUNT VII

NEGLIGENCE
(On Behalf of All Classes)

Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others
similarly situated, reallege, as if fully set forth, each
and every allegation contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Defendants were and are under a duty to the class members
to handle with due care (i) assets placed in Swiss banks
between 1934 and 1946 by, or on behalf of, the class
members, (ii) assets looted by the Nazis between 1934 and
1946 and deposited in, liquidated by, or laundered through,
Swiss banks, and (iii) cloaked assets deposited in,
liquidated by, or laundered through, Swiss banks.

Defendants have breached this duty of due care by, among
other things:

a.Failing to account to the class for the existence,
location, and status of such assets;

b.Failing to exercise due care in maintaining adequate
records; and

c.Failing to return such assets.

As a result of the above-referenced breaches of special
duty, plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class have
suffered injury and are entitled to damages in excess of
$50,000, the precise amount to be determined at trial.

COUNT VIII

VIOLATIONS OF SWISS FEDERAL BANKING LAW
(On Behalf of Class C)


Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others
similarly situated, reallege, as if fully set forth, each
and every allegation contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Defendants had, and continue to have, a fiduciary duty to
plaintiffs and class members, as well as to their heirs,
to exercise reasonable care in the handling of plaintiffs'
and class members' assets deposited with the defendant
banks during the period 1934 to 1946.

Defendants breached their fiduciary duty to plaintiffs and
class members, as well as to their  heirs,  by virtue of
their conduct and actions as described above.

As a direct and proximate result of the intentional and/or
negligent conduct of defendants, plaintiffs and members of
the plaintiff class have suffered and continue to suffer
substantial injury and are entitled to damages in excess of
$50,000, the precise amount to be determined at trial.

As  creditors  of the defendants, plaintiffs and members of
the class are entitled to  recover damages under Article 41
of the Federal Banking Law of  Switzerland.


COUNT IX

VIOLATIONS OF SWISS COMMERCIAL CODE OF OBLIGATIONS
(On Behalf of Class C)


Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others
similarly situated, reallege, as if fully set forth, each
and every allegation contained in the preceding paragraphs.

During the period 1934 to 1946,  plaintiffs, and class
members, deposited with defendant Banks, in the course of
defendants' banking business, assets, including monies and
other property of value, subject to plaintiffs' or their
heirs' order.

In accepting  the deposits, the defendant Banks, as
principals, agreed to  carry out the business of plaintiffs
and class members, and to faithfully fulfill their
responsibilities to plaintiffs and class members.

As part of their responsibilities, the defendant banks were
legally obligated to account, on demand, for the management
of plaintiffs' and class members' assets deposited with the
defendant banks and to hand over what the defendant Banks
received from plaintiffs and class members.

Plaintiffs and class members, or their heirs,  have
expressly or implicitly demanded that the defendant banks
account for the management of  their assets deposited with
the defendant banks and to hand over to plaintiffs and
members of the class, or their heirs, the deposits.  The
defendant banks refused, and still do refuse, to provide
for such an accounting and hand over what the defendant
banks received from plaintiffs and class members.

The defendant banks' refusal constitutes a breach of their
obligations to plaintiffs and the members of the class, or
their heirs, under the Swiss Federal Code of Obligations.

As a direct and proximate result of defendants' violations,
plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class have suffered
and continue to suffer substantial injury and are entitled
to damages in excess of $50,000, the precise amount to be
determined at trial.

COUNT X

CONSPIRACY
(On Behalf of All Classes)


 Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others
similarly situated, reallege, as if fully set forth, each
and every allegation contained in the preceding paragraphs.

 Defendant Swiss banks, the unnamed co-conspirator Swiss
banks and the Swiss Banking Association agreed among
themselves to deny, block, and/or obstruct access to, or
knowledge regarding: (a) the deposited assets of persons
(or their heirs) who were the object of religious, racial
or political persecution by the Nazi Regime; (b) looted
assets; and (c) cloaked assets, in violation of standards
of banking conduct, thereby depriving class members of
their assets.

 Defendant Swiss banks took steps in furtherance of the
conspiracy, including refusing to return deposits to those
having a legal right to them; refusing to adequately
account for deposited, looted and cloaked assets; and
sharing information on accounts and/or engaging in acts
designed to ensure a uniform method of responding to
inquiries from individuals seeking the location of
deposited, looted or cloaked assets.

 By their misconduct, the defendant Swiss banks injured
plaintiffs members of the plaintiff class by depriving them
of their property, and of its use and enjoyment, and of any
interest which they could have earned thereon.

As a result of the above-referenced conspiracy, plaintiffs
and members of the plaintiff class have suffered injury and
are entitled to damages in excess of $50,000, the precise
amount to be determined at trial.


COUNT XI

FRAUD
(On Behalf of All Classes)


Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others
similarly situated, reallege, as if fully set forth, each
and every allegation contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Repeatedly, and through uniform statements made by the
defendant Swiss banks and their spokespersons, defendants
made direct and indirect misrepresentations regarding the
existence of dormant accounts, the existence of accounts
containing looted and cloaked assets, and the scope of
defendants' efforts to identify such accounts and assets.
As alleged above, such misrepresentations were false and
misleading.

In 1962, under pressure from the World War II Allies, the
Swiss passed legislation requiring banks to identify
unclaimed funds held by them for foreigners "persecuted for
racial, religious or political reasons."  The law did not
provide for outside supervision or enforcement.  After this
legislation was passed, the Swiss government received some
7,000 responses to an appeal for victims' relatives to lay
claims if they believed they had family money in Swiss
banks.  However, only 961 accounts were identified, with
total deposits of Sfr9.5 million.  Three-quarters of that
amount was returned to its rightful owners, and the rest
was distributed to a Swiss-Israeli association and a
refugee association.  The defendant Swiss banks made this
identification and distribution public, and, after 1962,
uniformly denied the existence of other such accounts, or
of accounts containing stolen assets.

It was not until January 1995 that there was finally
conducted another survey of the 20 largest Swiss banks.
The Swiss Banking Association published the results of its
survey.  According to this survey, there were an additional
440 foreigners' accounts opened before 1945 that had been
dormant for at least 10 years.  Their total value was set
at Sfr35 million, Sfr9 million of which originated in
Germany and Eastern Europe.

Shortly thereafter, the Swiss Banking Association carried
out yet another survey, contacting 400 financial
institutions in Switzerland.  In February 1996, the SBA
announced "final figures" on the basis of the second
survey, asserting that there were 36 banks which had
deposits dating from before the end of the war, totaling
Sfr38.7 million.

For years, the Swiss hid behind these false statements
regarding the amount of looted and cloaked assets, the
extent of their "searches," and the existence of dormant
accounts.  The banks coordinated with each other, and
through the Swiss Banking Association, to frustrate all
efforts to obtain a better accounting, or to identify
individual accounts.  The banks acted in concert, and
engaged in a common set of practices to prevent and derail
inquiries by heirs of victims of Nazi Regime atrocities
whose assets were deposited in Swiss bank accounts, and by
persons whose assets were looted and cloaked by the Nazis
and placed in Swiss bank accounts.

Defendants' representations as set forth above regarding
the existence of dormant accounts and looted and cloaked
assets, and the scope of defendants' efforts to identify
such accounts and assets, were false misrepresentations of
material fact that misrepresented, omitted and concealed
the existence, origin, nature, scope and status of the
accounts, and were made with the intent to induce
plaintiffs to act to defendants' benefit and plaintiffs'
detriment by foregoing or abandoning further attempts to
investigate, inquire, or make claims regarding the
accounts.  Specifically, the defendant Swiss banks intended
to induce class members into foregoing and abandoning their
search for accounts containing assets to which the class
members were entitled.

Without knowledge of the falsity, inaccuracy and
incompleteness of defendants' representations, plaintiffs
did rightfully rely, directly and indirectly, upon
defendants' willful representations to plaintiffs' injury,
as evidenced by plaintiffs' inability to identify and/or
recover their accounts and/or assets.

At the time the defendant Swiss banks made such
representations, each and every defendant knew or should
have known that it held undisclosed dormant accounts,
and/or accounts containing looted assets.  In addition,
each and every defendant knew or should have known that its
representations regarding the existence of such accounts
and assets in the scope of their search to identify such
accounts and assets were not as represented by defendants,
and that the defendants' representations that such accounts
could not be identified or disclosed were false and
intentionally misleading.

As a result of the fraud committed by each Defendant Swiss
bank, plaintiffs have been injured.  Plaintiffs have been
deprived of their property and assets, the use and
enjoyment of such assets, and of any interest which could
have been earned thereon.

The aforesaid acts of defendant Swiss banks were conducted,
in concert, knowingly, intentionally, and maliciously, with
a flagrant disregard for the rights and interests of all
class members.

As a result of the above-referenced fraud, plaintiffs and
members of the plaintiff classes have suffered injury and
are entitled to damages in excess of $50,000, the precise
amount to be determined at trial.

COUNT XII

FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT
(On Behalf of All Classes)


Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others
similarly situated, reallege, as if fully set forth, each
and every allegation contained in the preceding paragraphs.

The defendant Swiss banks had superior knowledge not
readily available to Plaintiff Class members regarding the
existence and nature of dormant accounts, and accounts
containing looted and cloaked assets.  The defendant Swiss
banks knew that class members would act to their detriment
on the basis of mistaken knowledge or lack of knowledge
regarding the existence of such accounts, and their
entitlement to the assets in them.  The banks were under a
duty to disclose information regarding the accounts,
generally to the class members and upon reasonable inquiry
by individual class members, and failed to do so.

Defendants failed to disclose and actively concealed from
plaintiff class members material facts regarding the
existence and/or scope of dormant accounts, and accounts
containing looted and cloaked assets.  As described above,
the defendant Swiss banks engaged in a pattern and practice
and common scheme to publicly understate or deny the
existence of dormant accounts and accounts containing
looted and cloaked assets.  In addition, defendant Swiss
banks engaged in a pattern and practice of uniformly
concealing from individual class members who made inquiries
of the banks the existence of such accounts.

Defendants knew or should have known that such material
information was not known to plaintiffs and that plaintiffs
would rely upon these non-disclosures and concealment to
defendant Swiss banks' benefit and to the detriment of the
plaintiff class members.

Without knowledge of the material information which was
suppressed and actively concealed by defendants, plaintiffs
did rightfully rely, directly or indirectly on mistaken
information to their detriment, and did not identify or
abated efforts to identify the accounts and assets to which
they are entitled, and which have been maintained in the
defendant Swiss banks.

Plaintiffs have been damaged as a result of such fraudulent
concealment and conspiracy by defendants as evidenced by
plaintiffs' failure to gain access to accounts and assets
which rightfully belonged to them.  Plaintiffs have been
deprived of their property and assets, the use and
enjoyment of such assets, and of any interest which could
have been earned thereon.

The aforesaid acts of defendant Swiss banks were conducted,
in concert, knowingly, intentionally, and maliciously, with
a flagrant disregard of the rights and interests of all
class members.



 By virtue of the activities of the defendant Swiss banks
to conceal the existence of deposited assets, looted assets
and cloaked assets, and their activities in concealing
their common scheme and purpose to deny, block and obstruct
access to and knowledge of these assets, which activities
are continuing in nature, the applicable statute of
limitations for all of the claims set forth in this
Complaint have been tolled.

 By virtue of the activities of the defendant Swiss banks
to conceal the existence of deposited assets, looted assets
and cloaked assets, and their activities in concealing
their common scheme and purpose to deny, block and obstruct
access to and knowledge of these assets, which activities
are continuing in nature, the defendants are equitably
estopped from raising the statute of limitations as a
defense to this action.

 By virtue of the activities of the defendant Swiss banks
to conceal the existence of deposited assets, looted assets
and cloaked assets, and their activities in concealing
their common scheme and purpose to deny, block and obstruct
access to and knowledge of these assets, which activities
are continuing in nature, the defendants are estopped from
raising the statute of limitations as a defense to this
action by operation of the doctrine of unclean hands.

A.Certify this case a class action pursuant to Rule 23 of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure;

B.Adjudge and decree that defendants have engaged in the

by the defendants through their use of these accounts;

(2)  order a constructive trust and the disgorgement of any
and all profits from slave labor still held by defendants,
including any interest accrued thereon, and all profits
derived therefrom by the defendants through the use of
these accounts, which shall be distributed to members of
the class;

G.With regard to the claims of the depositors:

(1)  order an identification and accounting of all existent

profits derived therefrom by the defendants through the use
of these accounts;;

(2)  order a constructive trust and the disgorgement of any
and all such accounts, including any interest accrued
thereon, and all profits derived therefrom by the
defendants through their use of these accounts, which shall
be distributed to members of the class;

H.Award damages to plaintiffs and the class for the actions
described above;

I.Award punitive damages against all defendants;

J.Award plaintiffs the costs of bringing this action,
including the payment of a reasonable attorneys' fee; and

K.Order such other and further relief necessary in the
interests of justice.

<P>FBI official, E. Michael Kahoe has been charged with obstruction of justice in 
connection with the criminal investigation of white separatists Randy Weaver and Kevin 
Harris. Weaver and Harris were charged and later acquitted of first-degree murder in the 
death of Deputy U.S. Marshal William Degan, who was shot and killed on August 21, 
1992, in a confrontation near Ruby Ridge, Idaho. Kahoe, former chief of the FBI's 
violent crime section, was ordered to prepare a critique of the Ruby Ridge incident. 
Prosecutors in this case allege that Kahoe withheld the critique from the Weaver 
prosecution team, destroyed his copies of the critique, and ordered a subordinate official 
to destroy all copies of the critique and to make it appear as if the critique never 
existed.</P>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 22, 1996


PRESS RELEASE

Michael R. Stiles
Acting United States Attorney
for the District of Columbia

U.S. Attorney Michael R. Stiles announced that obstruction of justice charges were filed 
today in the Ruby Ridge matter against E. Michael Kahoe, former Special Agent in 
Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Jacksonville, Florida, office. 

U.S. Attorney Stiles stated, "The Information alleges that Kahoe participated in the 
concealment and destruction of an FBI Headquarters document that was bought by 
prosecutors in preparation for the murder trial pertaining to the Ruby Ridge incident in 
Idaho." 

The Information charges Kahoe with Obstruction of Justice in connection with the federal 
criminal trial in 1993 of Randall C. Weaver and Kevin L. Harris. Weaver and Harris were 
charged with the first degree murder of Deputy U.S. Marshal William Degan, who was 
shot and killed on August 21, 1992, in a confrontation with Randall Weaver, his son 
Samuel, and Harris near Ruby Ridge, Idaho. Samuel Weaver was also killed in the 
firefight. 

The Information alleges that Kahoe was the Chief of the Violent Crimes and Major 
Offenders Section at the Headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") in 
Washington, D.C. during the relevant time period. Upon learning of the August 21, 1992, 
events at Ruby Ridge, officials at FBI Headquarters ordered the FBI's Hostage Rescue 
Team ("HRT") deployed to Idaho. On August 22, 1992, an HRT sniper fired two shots 
from a position overlooking the Weaver cabin. The first round struck and wounded 
Randall Weaver. The second struck and killed Weaver's wife, Vicki, and also wounded 
Harris. The ensuing stand-off between federal law enforcement and the surviving 
members of the Weaver family and Harris concluded when Harris surrendered on August 
30, 1992, and Weaver and his three daughters surrendered on August 31, 1992, 

The Information further alleges that after the stand-off at Ruby Ridge, Kahoe was ordered 
by superiors to prepare an "after action critique" of the FBI's conduct at Ruby Ridge. 
Kahoe accordingly organized and moderated an after action conference on the Ruby 
Ridge matter at FBI Headquarters in November of 1992. He then ordered that a written 
Ruby Ridge after action critique be prepared, and participated in the editing of that 
document. In early January of 1993, Kahoe received the Ruby Ridge after action critique, 
along with copies sufficient for distribution to the after action conference participants and 
his superiors. 

Meanwhile, a federal grand jury in Idaho returned an indictment charging Weaver and 
Harris with the first degree murder of Deputy U.S. Marshal Degan. Prosecution of that 
case was assigned to the United States Attorney's Office in Idaho. 

The Information alleges that the Idaho U.S. Attorney's Office requested FBI 
Headquarters' documentation related to the Ruby Ridge matter. The Idaho U.S. Attorney's 
Office informed the FBI that such material was needed in order to prepare its case 
effectively and to determine whether there were materials to which the defense was 
entitled under constitutional requirements, rules of criminal discovery, or local court 
practice. On January 6, 1993, the Idaho U.S. Attorney's Office wrote a letter to the FBI 
reiterating its need for FBI Headquarters documentation and specifically requesting any 
FBI "documents or reports of any evaluations or critiques" of the actions of the FBI HRT 
at Ruby Ridge. Kahoe allegedly received a copy of this letter soon after it was sent. 

The Information alleges that Kahoe and certain of his superiors at FBI Headquarters 
resisted the Idaho U.S. Attorney's Office request for Headquarters documents. As a result, 
officials at the Department of Justice in Washington were asked to intervene. The 
Department of Justice eventually ordered, and the FBI eventually agreed, that all of the 
Ruby Ridge related Headquarters documents, including any disputed documents, should 
be produced to the prosecution team in Idaho. 

The Information alleges that Kahoe supervised the production of these documents to the 
prosecution team. In order to ensure that the Ruby Ridge after action critique would not 
be available in the Weaver case, however, Kahoe allegedly withheld the critique from the 
documents to be delivered to the prosecution team, destroyed all of his copies of the 
critique, and ordered a subordinate FBI Headquarters official to destroy all copies of the 
critique and to make it appear as if the critique never existed. 

Under federal law, a violation of the obstruction of justice statute carries a maximum 
penalty of ten years in prison and a $250,000 fine. 

The charge contained in the Information is merely an allegation. Mr. Kahoe is presumed 
innocent until and unless he is proven guilty. 

U.S. Attorney Stiles commended the investigative work of a Joint Task. Force consisting 
of U.S. Postal Inspectors and FBI Agent". He also commended the work of Assistant U.S. 
Attorneys Eric W. Sitarchuk, Robert E. Goldman, Steven W. Pelak and Carol Fortine. 



UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA


UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

v.

H. MICHAEL KAHOE

Defendant.


CRIMINAL No.:
ORIGINAL:
VIOLATION:
18 U.S.C. Sec. 1512(b)(2)(B)
(Obstruction of Justice)


INFORMATION

The United States, informs the Court and charges that: 

1. At all times material to this Information, defendant E. MICHAEL KAHOE was the 
Chief of the Violent crimes and Major Offenders section at the Headquarters of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") in Washington, D. C. 


The Incident at Ruby Ridge

2. On or about August 21, 1992, near an area known as Ruby Ridge, Idaho, deputies of 
the United States Marshals Service came in contact with Randall C. Weaver, his son 
Samuel and a Weaver family friend, Kevin L. Harris. A fire-fight ensued. Deputy U.S. 
Marshal William F. Degan and Samuel Weaver were shot and killed. 

3. Upon receiving notification of the events near Ruby Ridge, officials at the headquarters 
of the FBI ordered the Hostage Rescue Team ("HRT") of the FBI deployed to Idaho. The 
FBI also activated its headquarters' strategic command center from which FBI 
headquarters officials participated in the management and coordination of FBI operations 
at Ruby Ridge. 

4. On or about August 22, 1992, FBI HRT sniper teams took positions overlooking the 
Weaver cabin. An HRT sniper then fired two shots. The first round struck And wounded 
Randall Weaver. The second struck both Weaver's wife, Vicki, and Harris. Vicki Weaver 
was killed almost instantly. Harris was wounded. 

5. A stand-off between federal law enforcement and the surviving member" of the 
Weaver family and Harris followed. It concluded when Harris surrendered on or about 
August 30, 1992, and Randall Weaver and his daughters surrendered on or about August 
31, 1992. 

6. On or about November 19, 1992, a federal grand jury in Idaho returned a second 
superseding indictment charging Weaver and Harris with, among other offenses, the first 
degree murder of Deputy U.S. Marshal Degan. The case was captioned United States v. 
Randall C. Weaver and Kevin L. Harris, D. Idaho Crim. No. 92-090-N-EJL (hereinafter 
"the Weaver Case"). The trial of that matter commenced on April 13, 1993 and a verdict 
was returned on July 8, 1993. 


The FBI's Ruby Ridge After Action Critique 

7. Following a major crisis, it was a practice of FBI Headquarters to analyze and critique 
the FBI's performance during the crisis. This typically included an after action 
conference, which was attended by FBI supervisory participants in the crisis, followed by 
the preparation of a written "after action critique." The written critique typically detailed 
the facts of the crisis, as described by participants in the crisis who attended the 
conference, and then summarized findings and recommendations made during the 
conference. 

8. After the stand-off at Ruby Ridge, defendant E. MICHAEL KAHOE was ordered by 
superiors, whose identities are known to the United States, to prepare an "after action 
critique" of the FBI's conduct at Ruby Ridge. As a result of this direction, defendant E. 
MICHAEL KAHOE organized and moderated an after action conference on the Ruby 
Ridge matter at FBI Headquarters on November 2, 1992. Conference attendees included 
FBI officials who participated in the crisis either at Ruby Ridge or FBI Headquarters. 

9. Thereafter, defendant E. MICHAEL KAHOE ordered that a written Ruby Ridge after 
action critique be prepared (hereinafter "the Ruby Ridge after action critique"), and 
participated in the editing of that document. 

10. In or about the first week of January, 1993, defendant E. MICHAEL KAHOE 
received the Ruby Ridge after action critique, along with copies sufficient for distribution 
to the after action conference participants and his superiors at FBI Headquarters. 


Destruction of the After Action Critique 

11. Prosecution of the Weaver case was assigned to the United States Attorney's Office in 
Idaho. Aware of the involvement of FBI Headquarters in the crisis, the Idaho U.S. 
Attorney's Office, with the assistance of local FBI agents assigned to the case, requested 
FBI Headquarters' documentation related to the Ruby Ridge matter. The Idaho U.S. 
Attorney's Office informed the FBI that such documentation was needed in order to 
prepare its case effectively and to determine whether there were materials to which the 
defense was entitled under constitutional requirements, rules of criminal discovery or 
local court practice. 

12. On or about January 6, 1993, the Idaho U.S. Attorney's Office wrote a letter to the 
FBI reiterating it" need for FBI Headquarters documentation. The letter also specifically 
requested any FBI "documents or reports of any evaluations or critiques" of the actions of 
the FBI HRT at Ruby Ridge. Defendant B. MICHAEL KAHOE received a copy of this 
letter soon after it was sent. 

13. The defendant, in conjunction with certain of his superiors at FBI Headquarters, 
whose identities are known to the United States, resulted the Idaho U.S. Attorney's Office 
request for Headquarters documents. As a result, officials at the Department of Justice in 
Washington were asked to intervene. 

14. Thereafter, beginning on or about January 7, 1993, and continuing through early 
April, 1993, a series of meetings and conversations on the issue of FBI Headquarters 
document production occurred between Department of Justice officials and FBI officials, 
including defendant E. MICHAEL KAHOE. 

15. At a meeting on or about January 7, 1993, it was agreed between the Department of 
Justice, defendant E. MICHAEL KAHOE and another mentor FBI official, whose 
identity $6 known to the United States, that the Idaho prosecutors would first be allowed 
to see, but not copy or retain, specific documents whose production the FBI continued to 
oppose. 

16. This procedure was designed to permit the Idaho prosecution team the opportunity to 
make specific arguments as to why they believed that either they or the defense were 
entitled to have the disputed documents. It was also designed to allow the Department of 
Justice to consider the arguments of both the prosecutors and FBI Headquarters with 
respect to whether those documents should be produced. 

17. Between on or about January 7 and January 12, 1993, defendant E. MICHAEL 
KAHOE supervised the compilation of the documents whose production the FBI 
disputed. In order to ensure that the Ruby Ridge after action critique would not be 
available in the Weaver case, however, defendant E. MICHAEL KAHOE withheld the 
Ruby Ridge after action critique from this compilation of documents, and failed 
otherwise to identify its existence. 

18. The Department of Justice eventually ordered, and the FBI eventually agreed, that all 
of the Ruby Ridge related Headquarters documents, including any disputed documents, 
should be produced to the prosecution team in Idaho. 

19. Defendant E. MICHAEL KAHOE supervised the production of these documents to 
the prosecution team. In order to ensure that the Ruby Ridge after action critique would 
not be available in the Weaver case, however, defendant J. MICHAEL KAHOE withheld 
the Ruby Ridge after action critique from the documents to be delivered to the U.S. 
Attorney's Office in Idaho or the local FBI case agents. 

20. To further ensure that the Ruby Ridge after action critique would not be available in 
the Weaver case, between on or about January 7, 1993 and early April, 1993, defendant 
E. MICHAEL KAHOE destroyed all of his copies of the Ruby Ridge after action critique. 

21. To further ensure that the Ruby Ridge after action critique would not be available in 
the Weaver case, between on or about January 7, 1993 and early April, 1993, defendant 
E. MICHAEL KAHOE ordered a subordinate FBI Headquarters official, whose identity 
its known to the United States, to destroy all copies of the Ruby Ridge after action 
critique and to make it appear as if the Ruby Ridge after action critique never existed. 

22. Between in or about January 7, 1993 and early April, 1993, in the District of 
Columbia and elsewhere, defendant 

E. MICHAEL KAHOE

did knowingly and corruptly persuade another person, and attempt to do so, with intent to 
cause and induce another person to destroy, mutilate and conceal the Ruby Ridge after 
action critique with the intent to impair its availability for use in an official proceeding, 
that is United States v. Randall C. Weaver and Kevin L. Harris, D. Idaho Crim. No. 92-
080-N-EJL. 

(Obstruction of Justice, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 
1512(b)(2)(B)). 

Respectfully submitted,

<P>Lawyer Lee Kreindler filed this Oct. 21, 1996 suit against TWA, seeking damages
resulting from the July 17th explosion of Flight 800, a Paris-bound jetliner.
The suit alleges that a "limited explosion of the center fuel cell
of the aircraft followed by a chain reaction structural failure and fire
caus[ed] the plane to break up in midair." Kreindler, who specializes in aviation cases, won $500 million for victims' families after the 1988 Pan Am jet exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
-------------------------------------x
ERIC C. JOHNSON, individually and as
personal representative and Executor
of the Estate of LEONARD JAMES
JOHNSON, deceased,

Plaintiff,

-against-

TRANS WORLD AIRLINES, INC., and
THE BOEING COMPANY,

Defendants.

-------------------------------------x

Civil No.:

COMPLAINT


PLAINTIFF DEMANDS A TRIAL BY JURY

Plaintiff Eric C. Johnson, by his attorneys Kreindler & Kreindler,
respectfully alleges:

GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

Jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C. Sec.
1332, in that: the passenger decedent Leonard James Johnson was a
citizen of Virginia; the plaintiff Eric C. Johnson was and is a
citizen of Virginia; the defendant Trans World Airlines, Inc. ("TWA")
is incorporated in Delaware and has its principal place of business in
Missouri; the defendant The Boeing Company ("Boeing") is incorporated
in Delaware and has its principal place of business in Washington; and
the amount in controversy exceeds the sum of $50,000, exclusive of
interest and costs.

The plaintiff Eric C. Johnson is the son of the decedent Leonard James
Johnson, and was appointed personal representative and Executor of the
Estate of Leonard James Johnson by the Circuit Court of Fairfax County
in the Commonwealth of Virginia and he brings this lawsuit in said
capacity on behalf of said Estate and the surviving family members of
Leonard James Johnson.

On and prior to July 17, 1996, defendant TWA was a major international
airline which operated regularly scheduled passenger flights and
performed aircraft maintenance at John F. Kennedy International
Airport in Queens, New York.

On July 17, 1996, defendant TWA operated a Boeing 747-100 aircraft,
registration N93119, serial number 20083 (hereinafter the "subject
Boeing 747"), as TWA flight 800 from Kennedy International Airport in
Queens, New York to Paris, France and Rome, Italy (hereinafter "TWA
flight 800").

Defendant Boeing manufactured, designed, assembled, inspected, tested,
distributed, sold, serviced, maintained and repaired the subject
Boeing 747 and wrote and/or approved instructions and warnings for the
subject Boeing 747, including its flight manual, maintenance manual,
maintenance instructions, service bulletins, inspection schedules and
service life schedules.

Defendant TWA owned, serviced, maintained and repaired the subject
Boeing 747 and, with the assistance of defendant Boeing, wrote and/or
approved instructions and warnings for the subject Boeing 747,
including its flight manual, maintenance manual, maintenance
instructions, service bulletins, inspection schedules and service life
schedules.

The subject Boeing 747 was first sold by defendant Boeing to defendant
TWA in 1971.

In the mid-1970's the subject Boeing 747 was sold by defendant TWA to
the Government of Iran and was later sold back to defendant TWA.

The subject Boeing 747 was originally designed and tested by defendant
Boeing to have a service life of 60,000 hours.

As of July 17, 1996, the subject Boeing 747 had been operated for
approximately 101,000 hours.

As of July 17, 1996, the subject Boeing 747 was beyond its useful
service life and should have been retired and in any event should not
have been used to carry passengers.

On July 17, 1996, Leonard James Johnson was a fare paying passenger
aboard TWA flight 800.

On July 17, 1996, at approximately 8:45 p.m., about eleven minutes
after TWA flight 800 took off from Kennedy Airport, a mechanical,
structural and/or electrical failure occurred aboard the subject
Boeing 747, causing a limited explosion of the center fuel cell of the
aircraft, followed by chain reaction structural failures and fires,
causing the plane to break up in mid-air.

The center fuel cell explosion caused burning fuel vapors to travel
through the vent lines of the right wing and out of the right wing
tip; the burning vapors then began to extinguish and receded back
toward the aircraft fuselage; as a result, ground eyewitnesses saw a
streak of light heading toward the aircraft which was in some accounts
mistaken for a missile.

The subject Boeing 747 broke apart in mid-air over the New York State
waters of the Atlantic Ocean south of Long Island, New York, and
subsequently crashed in the New York State waters of the Atlantic
Ocean.

As a result of the foregoing, Leonard James Johnson was forced to
endure severe mental anguish, fear of impending death, and ultimately
suffered severe physical injuries which caused his death.

As a result of the foregoing, the plaintiff Eric C. Johnson, the
decedent's daughter Christina L. Johnson, the decedent's siblings, and
the Estate of Leonard James Johnson are entitled to recover
compensatory damages under the law of Virginia, including losses of
support, services, protection, care, assistance, parental care,
guidance and education, solace, companionship, society, comfort,
guidance, kindly offices, advice and consortium together with the
survivors' sorrow, grief and mental anguish, the decedent's mental and
physical pain and suffering, and funeral and burial expenses and other
damages.


A FIRST CLAIM FOR WRONGFUL DEATH AND SURVIVAL DAMAGES AGAINST TWA

Plaintiff restates the allegations of paragraphs 1 through 17 above.

Defendant TWA is liable to pay full, fair and reasonable wrongful
death and survival damages to the plaintiff for the death of Leonard
James Johnson under the Warsaw Convention treaty, together with the
Montreal Agreement, which defendant TWA signed in 1966, and the
International Air Transport Association Intercarrier Agreement on
Passenger Liability, which defendant TWA signed in 1996.

Defendant TWA did not take all necessary measures to avoid the subject
disaster and the death of Leonard James Johnson.

As a result of the foregoing, defendant TWA is liable to the plaintiff
for compensatory damages in the sum of $25,000,000.


A SECOND CLAIM FOR WRONGFUL DEATH, SURVIVAL AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES
AGAINST TWA

Plaintiff restates the allegations of paragraphs 1 through 17 above.

Said failure, explosion, crash, injuries and death were caused by the
wilful misconduct of the defendant TWA, including its officers, agents
and employees, in continuing to fly the subject Boeing 747 beyond its
service life, in failing to restore the subject Boeing 747 to
airworthy condition after its sale to and purchase from Iran, and in
failing to properly maintain and service the subject Boeing 747,
thereby subjecting the passengers to the catastrophic risk of a
mechanical, structural and/or electrical failure and mid-air break up
of the aircraft.

As a result of the foregoing, defendant TWA is liable to the plaintiff
for compensatory and punitive damages in the sum of $50,000,000.


A THIRD CLAIM FOR WRONGFUL DEATH AND SURVIVAL DAMAGES AGAINST BOEING
BASED ON NEGLIGENCE

Plaintiff restates the allegations of paragraphs 1 through 17 above.

Said failure, explosion, crash, injuries and death were caused by the
negligence of defendant Boeing, including its officers, agents and
employees, in that it carelessly manufactured, designed, assembled,
inspected, tested, distributed, sold, serviced, maintained and
repaired the subject Boeing 747 and carelessly failed to warn of the
catastrophic dangers of a mechanical, structural and/or electrical
failure through the instructions and warnings for the subject Boeing
747, including its flight manual, maintenance manual, maintenance
instructions, service bulletins, inspection schedules and service life
schedules.

As a result of the foregoing, defendant Boeing is liable to the
plaintiff for compensatory damages in the sum of $25,000,000.


A FOURTH CLAIM FOR WRONGFUL DEATH AND SURVIVAL DAMAGES AGAINST BOEING
BASED ON STRICT PRODUCTS LIABILITY

Plaintiff restates the allegations of paragraphs 1 through 17 above.

On July 17, 1996, the subject Boeing 747, including its instructions
and warnings, was being operated and used for the purposes and in the
manner for which it was designed, manufactured, assembled, inspected,
tested, sold and intended to be used, in a manner reasonably
foreseeable to defendant Boeing, and in a condition without
substantial change from its original condition when sold by defendant
Boeing.

On July 17, 1996, the subject Boeing 747, including its instructions
and warnings, was defective and unreasonably dangerous and unsafe by
reason of defendant Boeing's defective design, manufacture, assembly,
inspection, testing, warnings and instructions, sale, service, repair
and maintenance of the subject Boeing 747.

Said failure, explosion, crash, injuries and death were caused by the
aforementioned defective, unreasonably dangerous and unsafe condition
of the subject Boeing 747, including its instructions and warnings.

As a result of the foregoing, Boeing is liable to the plaintiff for
compensatory damages in the sum of $25,000,000.


A FIFTH CLAIM FOR WRONGFUL DEATH AND SURVIVAL DAMAGES AGAINST BOEING
BASED ON BREACH OF WARRANTY

Plaintiff restates the allegations of paragraphs 1 through 17 above.

Prior to July 17, 1996, defendant Boeing expressly and/or impliedly
warranted and represented that the subject 747 aircraft, including its
instructions and warnings, was airworthy, of merchantable quality, fit
and safe for the purpose for which it was designed, manufactured,
assembled, inspected, tested, sold, serviced, repaired, maintained,
intended and used, and Boeing further warranted that the subject 747
aircraft was free from all defects.

Defendant Boeing breached said warranties in that the subject aircraft
was not airworthy, of merchantable quality, or fit and safe for the
purposes for which it was designed, manufactured, assembled,
inspected, tested, sold, serviced, repaired, maintained, intended and
used, and further was not free from all defects.

Said failure, explosion, crash, injuries and death were caused by the
aforementioned breach of warranties by defendant Boeing.

As a result of the foregoing, defendant Boeing is liable to the
plaintiff for compensatory damages in the sum of $25,000,000.


A SIXTH CLAIM FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES AGAINST BOEING

Plaintiff restates the allegations of paragraphs 1 through 17, 26, 27,
29 through 32 and 34 through 37 above.

Said failure, explosion, crash, injuries and death were caused by the
wanton and wilful misconduct of the defendant Boeing, including its
officers, agents and employees, in failing to warn of the catastrophic
risk of mechanical, structural and/or electrical failure, including
the potential for explosion of the center fuel tank and resulting
consequences, in approving defendant TWA to fly the subject Boeing 747
beyond its service life and by subjecting passengers to the risk of
mechanical, structural and/or electrical failure and mid-air break up
of the aircraft.

As a result of the foregoing, Boeing is liable to the plaintiff for
punitive damages in the sum of $25,000,000.


A SEVENTH CLAIM IN THE ALTERNATIVE AGAINST TWA FOR WRONGFUL DEATH,
SURVIVAL AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES

Plaintiff restates the allegations of paragraphs 1 through 17 above.

In the event that it is determined that a bomb caused the subject
disaster, plaintiff alleges in the alternative that said explosion,
crash, injuries and death were caused by the wilful misconduct of
defendant TWA through its deliberate, intentional and reckless
disregard for the safety of its passengers in failing to take
necessary and required security measures to prevent the bomb from
being carried aboard the aircraft.

As a result of the foregoing, TWA is liable to the plaintiff for
compensatory and punitive damages in the sum of $50,000,000.


WHEREFORE, plaintiff is entitled to a judgment against the defendant
TWA for compensatory and punitive damages in the total sum of
$50,000,000, and plaintiff is entitled to a judgment against the
defendant Boeing for compensatory and punitive damages in the total
sum of $50,000,000, together with interest, costs and other damages
that the Court may deem just under the circumstances.


Respectfully submitted,

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS
EASTERN DIVISION

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

v.

ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY,

Defendant

Criminal No.: 96-CR-00640


PLEA AGREEMENT

Archer Daniels Midland Company, a corporation organized and existing under the laws 
of the State of Delaware (hereinafter "ADM" or the "defendant"), the defendant, and the 
United States of America, pursuant to Rule 11 (e)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal 
Procedure (hereinafter Fed. R. Crim. P."), hereby enter into this Plea Agreement, which 
arises from federal investigations of violations of federal criminal laws in the lysine 
industry, and agree as follows: 

RIGHTS OF DEFENDANT

1. The defendant understands its rights: 

(a) to be represented by an attorney;

(b) to be charged by Indictment;

(c) to plead not guilty to any criminal charge brought against it; 

(d) to have a trial by jury, at which it would be presumed not guilty of the charge and the 
United States would have to prove it guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; 

(e) to confront and cross-examine witnesses against it and to subpoena witnesses in its 
defense at trial; 

(f) to appeal its conviction if it is found guilty at trial; 

(g) to appeal the imposition of sentence against it; and 

(h) to be charged in the State and District where the offense occurred. 

WAIVER OF RIGHTS AND OFFENSE CHARGED

2. The defendant waives the rights set out in Paragraphs 1 (b)- (h) above. Pursuant to 
Rule 7(b), Fed. R. Crim. P., the defendant will waive indictment and the United States 
will file a two-count Criminal Information to the United States District Court for the 
Northern District of Illinois. Count I of the Information will charge the defendant with 
participating, from in or about June 1992 until June 27, 1995, in a conspiracy to suppress 
and eliminate competition by fixing the price and allocating the sales volumes of lysine, 
an amino acid feed additive, in the United States and elsewhere, in violation of the 
Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. s 1. The defendant understands that the maximum 
penalty which may be imposed against it upon conviction for this violation of the 
Sherman Antitrust Act is a fine in an amount equal to the largest of (a) $10 million (15 
U.S.C. s 1); (b) twice the gross pecuniary gain derived from the crime; or (c) twice the 
gross pecuniary loss caused to the victims of the crime (18 U.S.C. s 3571), and a term of 
probation of at least one year but not more than five years (18 U.S.C. s 3561(c)(1)). In 
addition, the defendant understands that, pursuant to s 8B1.1(a)(2) of the United States 
Sentencing Commission Guidelines (hereinafter "U.S.S.G."), the Court may order it to 
pay restitution to the victims of the offense and that 18 U.S.C. s 3013(a)(2)(B) requires 
the Court to order the defendant to pay a $200.00 special assessment upon conviction for 
the charged crime. 

3. Count II of the Information will charge the defendant with participating, from at least 
as early as January 1993 until June 27, 1995, in a conspiracy to suppress and eliminate 
competition by fixing the price and allocating the sales volumes of citric acid in the 
United States and elsewhere, in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. s 1. 
The defendant understands that the maximum penalty which may be imposed against it 
upon conviction for this violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act is a fine in an amount 
equal to the largest of: (a) $10 million (15 U.S.C. s 1); (b) twice the gross pecuniary gain 
derived from the crime; or (c) twice the gross pecuniary loss caused to the victims of the 
crime (18 U.S.C. s 3571), and a term of probation of at least one year but not more than 
five years (18 U.S.C. s 3561(c)(1)). In addition, the defendant understands that, pursuant 
to s 8B1.1(a)(2) of the U.S.S.G., the Court may order it to pay restitution to the victims of 
the offense and that 18 U.S.C. s 3013(a)(2)(B) requires the Court to order the defendant 
to pay a $200.00 special assessment upon conviction for the charged crime. 

4. The defendant, pursuant to the terms of this Plea Agreement, will plead guilty at 
arraignment to the antitrust criminal charges described in Paragraphs 2 and 3 above, and 
will make a factual admission of guilt to the Court in accordance with Rule 11, Fed. R. 
Crim. P., as set forth in paragraphs 5 and 6 below. 

FACTUAL BASIS FOR LYSINE OFFENSE

5. Had this case gone to trial, the United States would have presented evidence to prove 
the following facts: 

(a) The defendant is, and from at least June 1992 until June 27, 1995 ("the relevant time 
period") was, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of 
Delaware with its principal place of business in Decatur, Illinois. The defendant is, and 
throughout the relevant time period was, a producer of lysine. Lysine is an amino acid 
feed additive used in poultry and swine feed in the United States and elsewhere. 
Throughout the relevant time period, the defendant was engaged in the sale of lysine in 
the United States and elsewhere. 

(b) During certain periods of time during the relevant time period, the defendant, through 
several of its representatives, participated in a conspiracy among the major lysine-
producing firms. The primary terms of the conspiracy were to fix the price of lysine sold 
in the United States and elsewhere, and to allocate among the lysine-producing firms the 
volume of sales of lysine in the United States and elsewhere. In furtherance of the 
conspiracy, the defendant, through several of its representatives, engaged in conversations 
and attended meetings with representatives of the other major lysine-producing firms. At 
one or more of these meetings and during one or more of these conversations, agreements 
were reached as to the prices the firms would charge for lysine in the United States and 
elsewhere and the volume of lysine each firm would sell in the United States and 
elsewhere. The purpose of the scheme was to restrict the output and raise the price of 
lysine in the United States and elsewhere. 

(c) These conspiratorial meetings and conversations took place in the United States and 
elsewhere, and at least one of these meetings, attended by representatives of the 
defendant, occurred in this District and Division. During the relevant time period, lysine 
sold by one or more of the conspirator firms, and equipment and supplies necessary to the 
production and distribution thereof, as well as payments therefor, traveled in interstate 
commerce. The business activities of the defendant and co-conspirators in connection 
with the production and sale of lysine were within the flow of, and substantially affected, 
interstate trade and commerce. 

(d) Acts in furtherance of this conspiracy were carried out within the Northern District of 
Illinois, Eastern Division. 

FACTUAL BASIS FOR THE CITRIC ACID OFFENSE 

6. Had this case gone to trial, the United States would have presented evidence to prove 
the following facts: 

(a) The defendant is, and from at least June 1992 until June 27, 1995 ("the relevant time 
period") was, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of 
Delaware with its principal place of business in Decatur, Illinois. The defendant is, and 
throughout the relevant time period was, a producer of citric acid. Citric acid is an 
organic acid used in various food products and beverages, cosmetics, medicine, 
detergents, chemicals, and textiles in the United States and elsewhere. Throughout the 
relevant time period, the defendant engaged in the sale of citric acid in the United States 
and elsewhere. 

(b) During periods of time during the relevant time period, the defendant, through several 
of its representatives, participated in a conspiracy among the major citric acid-producing 
firms. The primary terms of the conspiracy were to fix the price of citric acid sold in the 
United States and elsewhere and to allocate among the citric acid-producing firms the 
volume of sales of citric acid in the United States and elsewhere. In furtherance of the 
conspiracy, the defendant, through several of its representatives, engaged in conversations 
and attended meetings with representatives of the other major citric acid-producing firms. 
At one or more of these meetings and during one or more of these conversations, 
agreements were reached as to the prices the firms would charge for citric acid in the 
United States and elsewhere and the volume of citric acid each firm would sell in the 
United States and elsewhere. The purpose of the scheme was to restrict the output and 
raise the price of citric acid in the United States and elsewhere. 

(c) These conspiratorial meetings and conversations took place in the United States and 
elsewhere. During the relevant time period, citric acid sold by one or more of the 
conspirator firms, and equipment and supplies necessary to the production and 
distribution thereof, as well as payments therefor, traveled in interstate commerce. The 
business activities of the defendant and co-conspirators in connection with the production 
and sale of citric acid were within the flow of, and substantially affected, interstate trade 
and commerce.  

(d) Acts in furtherance of this conspiracy were carried out within the Northern District of 
Illinois, Eastern Division. 

SENTENCING GUIDELINES

7. Sentencing for the offenses to be charged will be conducted pursuant to the U.S.S.G. 
Manual in effect on the day of sentencing. The United States and the defendant agree that 
for the purposes of determining the U.S.S.G. sentence in this case the volume of affected 
commerce attributable to the defendant is in excess of $100 million both in the lysine 
market and in the citric acid market. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. s 1B1.8, self- incriminating 
information provided to the United States pursuant to this Plea Agreement will not be 
used to increase the volume of affected commerce attributable to the defendant or in 
determining the applicable guideline range. 

SENTENCING AGREEMENT

8. Pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C), Fed. R. Crim. P., the United States and the defendant 
agree that the appropriate disposition of the lysine count is, and agree jointly to 
recommend that the Court impose, a sentence requiring the defendant to pay a fine, 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. s 3571, to the United States in the amount of $70 million within 90 
days of sentencing and no term of probation. The fine amount is within the guideline 
range calculated from the defendant's volume of affected commerce in the lysine market. 
The defendant understands that the Court will order it to pay a $200.00 special 
assessment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. s 3013(a)(2)(B) and U.S.S.G. s 8E1.1 in addition to any 
fine imposed. In light of the restitution already paid or agreed to be paid by the defendant 
in case number 95-C-7679, MDL Number 1083, the United States agrees that it will not 
seek a restitution order with respect to this count of the Information. 

9. Pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C), Fed. R. Crim. P., the United States and the defendant 
agree that the appropriate disposition of the citric acid count is, and agree jointly to 
recommend that the Court impose, a sentence requiring the defendant to pay a fine, 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. s 3571, to the United States in the amount of $30 million within 90 
days of sentencing and no term of probation. The fine amount is within the guideline 
range calculated from the defendant's volume of affected commerce in the lysine market. 
The defendant understands that the Court will order it to pay a $200.00 special 
assessment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. s 3013(a)(2)(B) and U.S.S.G. s 8E1.1 in addition to any 
fine imposed. The United States will file a motion pursuant to U.S.S.G. s 8C4.1 
requesting that the Court depart from the sentence calculated pursuant to the U.S.S.G. and 
impose the agreed-upon sentence set out above because of the substantial assistance 
provided by the defendant in the investigation of other corporations and individuals in the 
citric acid industry. In light of the restitution already paid or agreed to be paid by the 
defendant in case number 95-C-2963, MDL Number 1092, the United States agrees that it 
will not seek a restitution order with respect to this count of the Information. 

10. The United States and the defendant believe that this Plea Agreement contains 
sufficient information concerning the defendant, the crimes charged in this case, and the 
defendant's role in the crimes to enable the meaningful exercise of sentencing authority 
by the Court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. s 3553. The United States will not object to the 
defendant's request that the Court accept the defendant's guilty plea and immediately 
impose sentence on the day the case is filed notwithstanding the provisions of Rule 
32(b)(1), Fed. R. Crim. P., U.S.S.G. s 6A1.1 and Local Crim. Rule 2.06(C), (D), and (F). 
The Court's denial of the request to impose sentence immediately based upon the record 
provided by the defendant and the United States will not void this Plea Agreement. 

11. The United States and the defendant understand that the Court retains complete 
discretion to accept or reject the agreed-upon appropriate dispositions provided for in 
paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Plea Agreement. 

(a) If the Court does not impose the aforesaid agreed-upon dispositions, the United States 
and the defendant agree that this Plea Agreement, except for Paragraph 11(b) below shall 
be rendered null and void; and 

(b) If the Court does not impose the agreed-upon dispositions the defendant will be free 
to withdraw its pleas of guilty (Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(4)), and, if the defendant does 
withdraw its pleas of guilty, this Plea Agreement, the guilty pleas, and any statements 
made in connection with or in furtherance of the pleas or this Plea Agreement, or in the 
course of discussions leading to the pleas or the Plea Agreement, shall not be admissible 
against the defendant in any criminal or civil proceeding (Fed.R. Crim.P. 11(e)(6)). 


DEFENDANT'S COOPERATION

12.  The defendant will cooperate with the United States in  the conduct of (i) the current 
federal investigations of alleged offenses committed in furtherance of, or in connection 
with, any attempted or completed antitrust conspiracy, combination, or scheme involving 
the sale or production of any product sold or produced by the defendant's BioProducts 
Division, Animal Health and Nutrition Division, Food Additives Division, or Sweetener 
Group; (ii) the investigation of the acquisition of technology which is the subject of 
pending investigations being conducted in the Central District of Illinois and the Southern

Proceeding").  Such cooperation shall consist of: 

(a)  the production to the United States of all documents, information, and other 
materials, not already produced to the United States and not subject to the attorney client 
privilege or work product doctrine, in the possession, custody, or control of the

testifying in trial and grand jury or other proceedings in the United States under oath in 
connection with any such Federal Proceeding.  Such interviews and testimony shall be

department or agency of the United States (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001), perjury (18 U.S.C. Sec. 
1621), and making false statements or declarations in grand jury or court proceedings (18 
U.S.C. Sec 1623). 


GOVERNMENT'S AGREEMENT

14.  The United States agrees:

(a)  not to bring criminal charges against any current director, officer, or employee of the 
defendant or of any of the defendant's subsidiaries or affiliates (other than Michael D. 
Andreas and Terrance S. Wilson) (i) for any act or offense committed prior to the date of 
this Plea Agreement and while such person was employed by the defendant or any of its 
subsidiaries or affiliates, which was undertaken in furtherance of, or in connection with, 
any attempted or completed antitrust conspiracy, combination, or scheme involving the 
sale or production of any product sold or produced by the defendant's BioProducts 
Division, Animal Health and Nutrition Division, Food Additives Division, or Sweetener 
Group; (ii) for any alleged misappropriation of technology committed prior to the date of 
this Plea Agreement which is the subject of pending investigations being conducted in the 
Central District of Illinois and the Southern District of Alabama; 

(b)  should the United States determine that any individual subject to Paragraph 14(a) of 
the Plea Agreement may have information relevant to any Federal Proceeding, the United 
States shall request such person's cooperation pursuant to the terms of this Plea 
Agreement by written request delivered to counsel for the individual (with a copy to the 
undersigned counsel for the defendant) or, if the individual is not known by the United 
States to be represented, to the undersigned counsel for the defendant; 

(c)  in the event that any person requested to provide cooperation pursuant to Paragraph 
14(b) fails to comply with such person's obligations under Paragraph 13 of this Plea 
Agreement, any agreement not to prosecute such person granted in this Plea Agreement 
shall be void. 

(d)  information provided to the United States by any person pursuant to the terms of 
Paragraph 14(b) of this Plea Agreement, or any information directly or indirectly derived 
from such information, may not be used against such person or ADM or any of its 
subsidiaries or affiliates in any criminal case, except a prosecution for perjury (18 U.S.C. 
Sec. 1621), making false statements or declarations in grand jury or court proceedings (18 
U.S.C. Sec. 1623), or obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1503); 

(e)  the immunity and non-prosecution terms of this Paragraph do not apply to any 
criminal violations of the federal tax law; and 

(f)  all documents provided pursuant to Paragraph 12(a) will be subject to the protective 
order already entered in connection with the investigation of this matter, and the United 
States will not disclose any confidential commercial or financial information or trade 
secrets contained in any documents, information, or material provided pursuant to this 
Plea Agreement unless the United States concludes in good faith that such disclosure is 
necessary in connection with the conduct of any Federal Proceeding or is required by law, 
and will provide notice to the defendant and an opportunity to be heard prior to the 
disclosure of any such information other than in connection with a grand jury 
investigation or trial or other judicial proceeding. 

15.  Upon the tender of the guilty pleas called for by this Plea Agreement and the 
imposition and payment of the agreed-upon sentences called for by this Plea Agreement, 
the United States agrees: 

(a)  not to bring further criminal charges against the defendant or any of the defendant's 
subsidiaries or affiliates for any act or offense committed prior to the date of this Plea 
Agreement which was undertaken in furtherance of, or in connection with, any attempted 
or completed antitrust conspiracy, combination, or scheme involving the sale or 
production of any product sold or produced by the defendant's BioProducts Division, 
Animal Health and Nutrition Division, Food Additives Division or Sweetener Group; 

(b) not to bring criminal charges against the defendant or of the defendant's subsidiaries 
or affiliates for any alleged offense, committed prior to the date of this Plea Agreement, 
which is or was the subject of any pending investigation of ADM, which are those being 
conducted in the Central District of Illinois and the Southern District of Alabama. ADM 
is not a subject of the investigation being conducted by the Criminal Division, Fraud 
Section. 

(c) there are no known investigations of ADM other than those identified in Paragraphs 
15(a) and 15(b) above; and 

(d) the non-prosecution terms of this Paragraph do not apply to any criminal violations of 
the federal tax law. 

16. The United States agrees not to bring any civil monetary cause of action, claim, 
penalty, or lawsuit that the United States has or may have against the defendant, any of 
the defendant's subsidiaries or affiliates, or any current director, officer or employee of 
the defendant or of any of the defendant's subsidiaries or affiliates under the False Claims 
Act, 31 U.S.C. Sec. 3729 et seq., the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C. Sec. 
1 et seq., or any other statute within the Civil Division's authority to release that creates a 
civil monetary cause of action for damages or penalties to the United States, and the 
common law for any of the matters set forth in Paragraphs 15(a) and 15(b) above. The 
United States and the defendant agree that, notwithstanding the release of civil monetary 
causes of action, penalties, and claims set forth in this Paragraph, this Plea Agreement 
does not release any entity or individual from any dispute or claim arising under Title 26 
of the United States Code or any administrative action by any federal agency to suspend, 
debar or determine the responsibility of the defendant. The United States also agrees not 
to bring any civil injunctive cause of action against the defendant, any of the defendant's 
subsidiaries or affiliates, or any current director, officer, or employee of the defendant or 
of any of the defendant's subsidiaries or affiliates under the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 
U.S.C. Sec. 1, et seq., based on any of the matters set forth in Paragraph 15(a). 

17. It is agreed that all costs (as defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation("FAR") 
Sec. 31.205-47) incurred by or on behalf of the defendant and its directors, officers, 
employees, and agents in connection with (i) the matters covered by this Plea Agreement; 
(ii) the Government's audit, if any, and investigation of the matters covered by this Plea 
Agreement; (iii) the defendant's investigation, defense, and corrective actions, if any, with 
respect to the matters specifically covered by this Plea Agreement; (iv) the negotiation of 
this Plea Agreement; and (v) any payment made to the United States pursuant to this Plea 
Agreement, shall be unallowable costs for government contract accounting purposes. 
Nothing in paragraph 16 or Paragraph 17 of this Plea Agreement is intended to settle any 
liability the defendant has or may have for delivery of any deficient or defective product 
or workmanship, or for breach of any expressed or implied warranty. 

18. The United States agrees that when any person travels to the United States pursuant to 
Paragraph 12(b) of this Plea Agreement, the United States shall take no action, based 
either upon any offense subject to this Plea Agreement or related to any actual or alleged 
violation of this Plea Agreement, to subject such person to arrest, service of process, or 
prevention from departing the United States. 

REPRESENTATION OF COUNSEL

19.  The defendant has been represented by counsel and is fully satisfied with its 
attorneys' legal representation. The defendant has thoroughly reviewed this Plea 
Agreement and has voluntarily and knowingly entered into this Plea Agreement. 

20.  The pleas of guilty are freely and voluntarily made and are not the result of force or 
threats or of promises or representations apart from those set forth in this Plea 
Agreement. There have been no promises or representations to the defendant as to 
whether the Court will accept or reject this Plea  Agreement. 

VIOLATION OF PLEA AGREEMENT

21.  The defendant agrees that should the United States determine in good faith, during 
the period of time that any Federal Proceeding is pending, that the defendant or any of its 
subsidiaries or affiliates has materially failed to provide cooperation (as described in 
Paragraph 12 of this Plea Agreement) or otherwise has materially violated any other 
provision of this Plea Agreement, the United States shall notify the defendant in writing, 
delivered to counsel for the defendant by overnight delivery or by facsimile transmission, 
of its intention to void any of its obligations under this Plea Agreement (except its 
obligations under this Paragraph). The United States' determination is subject to review 
by the Court concerning the materiality of any claimed violation of the Plea Agreement 

ENTIRETY OF AGREEMENT

22.  Prior to the entry of this Plea Agreement and as a pre-condition of the United States 
entering into the Plea Agreement, ADM made available to the United States, through one 
or more of its employees, information and cooperation in connection with the Federal 
Proceedings.  This Plea Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the United 
States and the defendant concerning the disposition of the criminal charges in this case.  
This Plea Agreement cannot be modified other than in writing a signed by the United 
States and the defendant. 

23.  The undersigned is authorized to enter this Plea Agreement of behalf of the defendant 
as evidenced by a Resolution of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of the

24.  The undersigned attorneys for the United States have been authorized by the 
Attorney General of the United States to enter this Agreement on behalf of the United

<P>Earlier this year, the White House was accused of improperly obtaining background 
files from the FBI on hundreds of former Republican administration officials. In a class 
action suit filed September 12, 1996 on behalf of some 700 former Republican officials, 
the plaintiffs charge the White House, the FBI, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and former 
White House employees Bernard Nussbaum, Craig Livingstone, and Anthony Marceca 
with improperly obtaining confidential FBI files in violation of the Privacy Act of 1974. 
The suit also alleges individual liability for invasion of privacy by the First Lady and the 
former White House staffers.</P>

9. Defendant Executive Office of the President ("The White House") is an agency of the

11. Defendant Bernard W. Nussbaum ("Nussbaum") was White House Counsel in 1993

CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS

14. This action is brought by Plaintiffs as a class action, on their own behalf and on 
behalf of all others similarly situated, under the provisions of Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(3) of 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for damages, including costs and attorneys' fees. 

15. The class so represented by Plaintiffs in this action, and of which Plaintiffs are 
themselves members, consists of former U. S. Government employees, whose 
confidential FBI files were improperly obtained from the FBI by The White House. 

16. The exact number of members of the class, as hereinabove identified and described, is 
not known, but upon information and belief it is estimated that there are more than 700 
members. The class is so numerous that joinder of individual members herein is 
impracticable. 

17. There are common questions of law and fact in the action that relate to and affect the 
rights of each member of the class, and the relief sought is common to the entire class. 
Namely, on information and belief, the contents of the FBI file of each member of the 
class were improperly disclosed by the FBI to Rodham Clinton, Nussbaum, Livingstone, 
Marceca and The White House, and improperly obtained by Rodham Clinton, Nussbaum, 
Livingstone, Marceca and The White House, in violation of the Privacy Act, 5 U. S.C. 
Sec. 552a, and the tort of invasion of privacy. 

18. The claims of Plaintiffs, who are representatives of the class herein, are typical of the 
claims of the class, in that the claims of all members of the class, including Plaintiffs, 
depend on a showing of the acts and omissions of Defendants giving rise to the right of 
Plaintiffs to the relief sought herein. Namely, the right of each Plaintiff to relief arises 
from the improper disclosure by the FBI to Rodham Clinton, Nussbaum, Livingstone, 
Marceca and The White House of information in Plaintiffs' FBI files, without Plaintiffs' 
consent; and the improper obtaining and maintaining of that information by Rodham 
Clinton, Nussbaum, Livingstone, Marceca and The White House and individuals 
employed therein. There is no conflict as between any individual named Plaintiff and 
other members of the class with respect to this action, or with respect to the claims for 
relief herein set forth. 

19. The named Plaintiffs are the representative parties for the class, and are able to, and 
will, fairly and adequately, protect the interests of the class. 

20. This action is properly maintained as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 
23(b)(3), inasmuch as the questions of law and fact common to the members of the class 
predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and a class action is 
superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the 
controversy. Upon information and belief, the actions taken by the FBI, in improperly 
disclosing information in Plaintiffs' files, and by Rodham Clinton, Nussbaum, 
Livingstone, Marceca and The White House and itS employees, in improperly obtaining 
and maintaining those files, were the same with respect to each Plaintiff; and separate 
trials to prove liability issues common to the class would be a waste of judicial resources. 
Furthermore, it is desirable to concentrate such litigation in the District of Columbia, 
where the actions which are the subject of this litigation took place, and where a majority 
of the class members are believed to reside. Moreover, the expenses of litigation would 
be likely to discourage the initiation of individual lawsuits concerning the actions at 
issue. Upon information and belief, there is as yet no other litigation involving the same 
controversy. 


FACTS

21. Plaintiffs were formerly political appointees and United States government employees 
under the Reagan and Bush Administrations. As members of the Reagan and Bush 
Administrations, Plaintiffs were required to have regular access to The White House. 
Plaintiffs left these positions prior to or at the beginning of the Clinton Administration, 
and have not needed regular access to The White House since that time. 

22. In order to obtain regular access to The White House, Plaintiffs were required to 
receive security clearances by Defendant FBI. Accordingly, Defendant FBI undertook 
extensive field investigations of Plaintiffs' backgrounds. 

23. The results of these investigations were maintained in files concerning each 
individual Plaintiff as part of a record-keeping system at Defendant FBI ("The FBI 
files"). 

24. The information concerning Plaintiffs contained in the FBI files was available only to 
a limited number of authorized individuals within Defendant FBI, and was not and should 
not have been available to any individual outside the FBI, without the prior written 
consent or knowledge of Plaintiffs or any lawful justification. 

25. On or about June, 1996, Plaintiffs learned that beginning in the spring of 1993, 
Defendants Nussbaum, Livingstone and Marceca, acting outside the scope of their 
employment, willfully and intentionally requested that Defendant FBI release Plaintiffs' 
confidential FBI files to Defendant The White House. The actual requests to Defendant 
FBI were made by Defendant Livingstone and/or Defendant Marceca, and, upon 
information and belief, approved in writing by Defendant Nussbaum. Upon information 
and belief, these actions were taken at the direction of Defendant Rodham Clinton. 

26. On information and belief, Defendants Rodham Clinton, Nussbaum, Livingstone and 
Marceca requested Plaintiffs' confidential FBI files for political purposes (e.g., to obtain 
potentially embarrassing and/or damaging information on former Bush and Reagan 
Administration personnel) and not for any proper or legal purpose of Defendant The 
White House. 

27. Pursuant to the requests of Defendants Rodham Clinton, Nussbaum, Livingstone and 
Marceca, Defendant FBI willfully and intentionally released Plaintiffs' confidential FBI 
files to Defendant The White House, without Plaintiffs' prior written consent or 
knowledge. 

28. As a proximate result of Defendant FBI's willful and intentional disclosure of private 
personal and employment information contained in Plaintiffs' FBI files, and Defendant 
The White House's willful, intentional and improper maintenance of these files, Plaintiffs 
have suffered serious and substantial harm and adverse effects, including but not limited 
to out-of-pocket expenses and loss of time necessarily incurred in investigating and 
responding to Defendants' unlawful conduct, emotional distress, mental anguish, loss of 
reputation, embarrassment, inconvenience, and unfairness.

41 . As the unlawful conduct of Defendants Rodham Clinton, Nussbaum, Livingstone and 
Marceca was, on information and belief, politically motivated (e.g., to obtain potentially 
embarrassing and/or damaging information on former Bush and Reagan Administration 
personnel) and lacked any proper or legal purpose, such unlawful conduct was not only 
intentional, willful, malicious and outrageous, but demonstrated reckless and/or willful 
disregard for Plaintiffs' privacy rights such that an award of punitive damages is 
warranted. 

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs demand a judgment against Defendants Rodham Clinton, 
Nussbaum, Livingstone and Marceca for damages in excess of $90,000,000.00, plus 
punitive damages, prejudgment interest, postjudgment interest, costs, attorneys fees and 
such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper. In addition, Plaintiffs 
respectfully request an injunction restraining Defendants from a continuing course of 
conduct such that Plaintiffs will be permanently and irreparably damaged by such 
conduct. 

Plaintiffs request trial by jury.


Respectfully submitted,

<P>Time Warner Cable of New York City is suing New York City to prevent it from 
putting Rupert Murdoch's Fox News Network on the Time Warner cable channels set 
aside for public access programming. Time Warner vice chairman and CNN founder Ted 
Turner was deposed in the case October 18, 1996. During the course of his testimony, he 
called Murdoch a "pretty slimy character" and, under questioning, elaborated on his 
comparison of the News Corp. chief to "the late Fuhrer" and "all dictators." [<I>Editors

EXAMINATION CONDUCTED 
 
BY MR. GOLDIN: 
 
Q. Mr. Turner, would you tell me briefly what your position is at Time Warner.  
 
A. At the moment I think my title is vice chairman. And with the responsibilities for the 
cable networks divisions, primarily, but with a few things that are related to it.  
 
Q. Can you tell me what those things are?  
 
A. New Line Cinema, Castle Rock Cinema and Turner Pictures.  
 
I think, to the best of my recollection, everything else is directly related to the cable 
networks.  
 
Q. When you say those are your responsibilities at the moment, have those 
responsibilities changed recently?  
 
A. Well, they have, yes, because we only merged with Time Warner, I think, last week. It 
has been many months that it was announced that I was going to have these 
responsibilities, but it didn't officially kick in.  
 
I was president and chairman of Turner Broadcasting until, I think it was last week when 
we closed the merger.  
 
Q. Did you have any responsibilities with respect to Time Warner prior to last week?  
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Did you have any involvement with Time Warner's cable programming decisions 
before last week?  
 
MR. JOFFE: When you say Time Warner cable's programming, you mean Time Warner 
"Cable's" programming decisions?  
 
MR. GOLDIN: Actually I said Time Warner's cable programming decisions.  
 
MR. JOFFE: The problem is "cable programming may mean the program arm --  
 
MR. GOLDIN: I understand. 
 
MR. JOFFE: -- or you may be talking about the cable operations. I guess --  
 
THE WITNESS: Which one are you talking about? Are you talking about both?  
 
BY MR. GOLDIN: 
 
Q. I was talking about Time Warner's cable programming decisions.  
 
MR. JOFFE: Prior to the merger, you are asking him?  
 
MR. GOLDIN: Before last week. 
 
THE WITNESS: What cable programming decisions? 

BY MR. GOLDIN:  
 
Q. If you weren't involved in any cable programming --  
 
A. I wasn't involved in any decisions. There were numerous discussions on various 
subjects that occurred during the past year. And they intensified somewhat, such 
discussions as cutbacks at Turner Broadcasting, reduced overhead discussions, and so 
forth.  
 
But nothing of any consequence was implemented until after the merger was actually 
completed, because there is always a chance that something could occur that the merger 
wouldn't go through.  
 
Q. When you say decisions such as cutbacks, can you explain precisely what you are 
talking about?  
 
A. We had several study groups of executives from Turner and Time Warner that met 
several times, particularly during the last 60 days, to set up a strategy for how we'd 
operate the company after the merger went through.  
 
And I did, on my own volition, I made a couple of suggestions vis-a-vis the programming 
on Time Warner Cable as far as the implementation of the Federal Communications 
compromise that said that Time Warner Cable would have to carry under certain 
agreements a competing news channel.  
 
As you will see later, basically my suggestions weren't followed at all. But I didn't have 
any direct authority to do anything. I just made an unsolicited suggestion or two.  
 
MR. JOFFE: I think the witness said Federal Communications Commission, but I am 
sure he meant Federal Trade Commission.  
 
THE WITNESS: Absolutely. I am sorry. 
 
BY MR. GOLDIN: 
 
Q. Okay. 
 
What was the period of time during which those meetings were taking place?  
 
A. The meetings I spoke of earlier? 
 
Q. Yes. 
 
A. I cannot remember when they started. But I think it was in the last couple months. It 
was as we got -- when we finally got the Federal Trade Commission okay. I can't 
remember when that was.  
 
The whole thing has been kind of like a nightmare.  
 
Q. Roughly speaking, these meetings have been since August?  
 
A. I told you, I have answered the question.  
 
Q. Okay. In addition to serving as vice chairman of Time Warner, do you have any 
ownership interest in Time Warner?  
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. What is that interest? 
 
A. It is approximately, to the best of my recollection, about a 9 percent economic interest.  
 
Q. Has that interest changed in the past several months?  
 
A. Well, it has because the merger didn't take place, I don't think, to the best of my 
recollection -- was it last week?  
 
MR. JOFFE: October 10, yes. 
 
THE WITNESS: I can't remember if that- was last week or the week before.  
 
But since October, I didn't have any stock in Time Warner until October 10th.  
 
So, that is the change that was Turner Broadcasting ceased to be on October 10th. My 
shares which were in Turner Broadcasting became Time Warner shares just last week. 

BY MR. GOLDIN:  
 
Q. Did Time Warner have an interest in Turner Broadcasting prior to last week?  
 
A. Yes, they did. 
 
Q. What was that interest? 
 
A. I think it was approximately, to the best of my recollection, about 18 percent of our 
common stock was held by them. And had been for a number of years.  
 
Q. Was there any other ownership interest in Turner besides that held by Time Warner?  
 
A. Yes. 100 percent ownership was owned by various people. I think most recently my 
ownership interest, and this includes not just me personally, but my foundation, my 
children's trusts, kind of represented, it was close to 24 percent.  
 
Q. Now you sit on the board of Time Warner; is that correct?  
 
A. As of October 10th. 
 
Q. Prior to that had you had a seat -- 
 
A. Actually, I don't know that is absolutely true. I think maybe I have to get elected to the 
board officially at the meeting in November. I am not positive.  
 
I know that the other director is not going to be officially a director. I don't know whether 
I am a director or not.  
 
Q. It is your expectation if you are not currently a director you will become one?  
 
A. That's right. 
 
Q. Had you previously sat on Time Warner's board?  
 
A. Never. 
 
Q. You said a moment ago as I understood your testimony, correct me if I am wrong, 
during the course of the meetings that you had just described, you made a 
recommendation with respect to carriage of the news channel; is that correct?  
 
A. Right. 
 
Q. What was that recommendation? 
 
A. The recommendation in general, and I spoke to Joe Collins, was that from the vantage 
point of where I stood with responsibility for CNN, that I thought that, I recommended 
that he go as slowly as possible. At least wait until the merger was consummated because 
things were happening so quickly on this.  
 
And I recommended he go as slowly as possible in adding other news channels to meet 
with the Federal Trade Commission's minimum requirements.  
 
And my personal recommendation was that when he saw, who was getting the most 
coverage on the other systems around the country between General Electric and News 
Corp., that he split the business between them.  
 
That was my recommendation. Of course, it wasn't followed at all.  
 
Q. Who is Joe Collins? 
 
A. Joe Collins is the head of the cable systems, the Time Warner Cable Systems. Time 
Warner Entertainment.  
 
I don't understand the structure exactly. Because some of the systems are owned by Time 
Warner by themselves. Some are owned in a joint venture that U.S. West has a minority 
interest in.  
 
Q. Was it your understanding that Mr. Collins would be the person who would be making 
the decision about what news channel to carry?  
 
A. He is the head man. I mean I don't know who made the decisions. But I would assume 
that he would be involved with them.  
 
He was the only person at the cable systems, to the best of my recollection, that I spoke to 
about it.  
 
I also spoke with Mr. Levin about it on several occasions. I don't remember exactly when. 
Because it was -- it is a very big deal.  
 
Q. Who is Mr. Levin? 
 
A. Mr. Levin is president and chairman of Time Warner.  
 
Q. When did you make your recommendation to Mr. Collins?  
 
A. I don't recall. 
 
Q. Can you tell me roughly? 
 
A. It was shortly before, it was just, I think within five, six, seven days before the 
announcement was made that they had decided to go with General Electric and Microsoft.  
 
Q. When did you discuss these questions with Mr. Levin?  
 
A. It was about the same time that I discussed them with Mr. Collins. Might have been a 
little bit, a little after. I don't remember exactly.  
 
Q. Where did you have your conversations with Mr. Levin?  
 
A. I don't recall. I think it was a topic that we discussed on two or three different 
occasions over a several week period of time.  
 
Q. Did that include a conversation or conversations at your ranch in Montana?  
 
A. I can't recall. He has been to Montana a couple, three times.  
 
We were in almost daily contact for several months. We have conversations on many, 
many different subjects.  
 
I can't recall when exactly I had conversations with him.  
 
Q. Would your conversations on this topic with Mr. Levin have been on or around 
August 3Oth of this year?  
 
A. It would be easy enough to find out when the announcement was made that Time 
Warner Cable had chosen, or had decided to go make a rather extensive agreement with 
General Electric and Microsoft's news service.  
 
But, as I understood it, this did not necessarily preclude them doing something with 
Murdoch at some point in the future.  
 
I clearly have no influence over what their decisions are. Even though I would like to 
have, I clearly don't have.  
 
Q. Why do you say you have no influence over their decisions?  
 
A. Because the recommendation that I made to them, unsolicited recommendation I made 
to them was absolutely rejected out of hand.  
 
Q. Given your current responsibilities at Time Warner, does it remain true today in your 
understanding that you have no influence over Time Warner's decisions concerning cable 
programming?  
 
A. Certainly not in New York. I just signed an affidavit to that effect.  
 
And that was the only suggestion that I have made to them personally that I can think of.  
 
I mean in past years we have done a lot of business with them, like we have with all cable 
systems with our networks like CNN and TNT and the Cartoon Network. I am constantly 
out beating the drums to try to get cable systems to carry our networks.  
 
I have never gone to the extent that Mr. Murdoch did on this. You know --  
 
MR. GARBUS: I came in a little late. Is that affidavit an exhibit? Is it relevant to this 
proceeding?  
 
Should it be marked? 
 
MR. JOFFE: It is not an exhibit. 
 
MR. GARBUS: I ask it be marked if Mr. Turner --  
 
MR. JOFFE: Mr. Garbus, you are interrupting. This document. Has nothing to do with --  
 
MR. GARBUS: If the witness refers to it, it should be marked.  
 
MR. JOFFE: Fine. You can ask. I am not marking it.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: Let me ask one thing. 
 
Had you completed your answer? 
 
THE WITNESS: Have I done what? 
 
BY MR. GOLDIN: 
 
Q. Have you completed your answer to that question?  
 
MR. JOFFE: Let me consult with the witness. Then you can read back the question and 
answer.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: Since I think we may be in the midst of the answer, I ask you either hold 
the consultation or explain why you see the need to consult.  
 
MR. JOFFE: I will be happy to hold it. 
 
(The record was read as requested.) 
 
THE WITNESS: That was kind of an afterthought.  
 
BY MR. GOLDIN: 
 
Q. You have completed your answer? 
 
A. Yes, absolutely. 
 
Q. Can you tell me what you meant by the reference to the extent Mr. Murdoch has gone 
to?  
 
A. Well, you know, he has just started a media war. In my opinion, what I know about 
cable -- I am chairman of the National Cable Television Association this year, I have 
been on the board for years -- cable got rapped many years ago for paying off politicians.  
 
It is something I have never done, even though we make minor contributions to 
campaigns, but it is a weapon that Mr. Murdoch uses all the time all over the world.  
 
I was just appalled that he bought the government of New York City.  
 
Q. What is the basis for your belief? 
 
A. His wife works for them. He made lots of contributions.  
 
His newspapers and television stations, as I read in The Daily News, strongly endorsed 
the Republican administration prior to the last election.  
 
Q. What contributions do you believe Mr. Murdoch has made?  
 
A. I read that he had contributed $100,000 to the Republican Party of New York.  
 
Q. Anything else? 
 
A. I know what he tried to do with Newt Gingrich to pay him $7 million for a book deal 
like he did the daughter of the head of China's government.  
 
Doing the same thing, as I understand it, in India, buying political favors for his company 
by making contributions in book deals, in any way he can, to shovel money to willing 
politicians.  
 
Q. Is it your belief that those acts of Mr. Murdoch's are improper?  
 
A. Yes. By my standards they are improper. You bet.  
 
Q. Is it your belief they are illegal? 
 
A. I don't know. I am not a lawyer. 
 
Q. But you believe they might be illegal?  
 
A. I don't know. 
 
Q. As a nonlawyer, do you have any view as to whether they might be illegal?  
 
A. I don't, as far as whether they are legal or not. But there are a lot of things that are 
wrong, whether they are legal or not. In my opinion.  
 
Q. Does your belief that Mr. Murdoch has done these things affect your view of Mr. 
Murdoch as a businessman?  
 
A. Yes, it does. 
 
Q. How so? 
 
A. I have no respect for him. I think he is a very dangerous person.  
 
Q. Dangerous in what respect? 
 
A. Dangerous to the extent that he uses the news media to advance his own personal 
position, mainly. He does so shamelessly.  
 
And he uses the power of the media to further his own personal wealth and power, rather 
than for the good of the communities which he is supposed to serve.  
 
Q. In what respects do you believe that Mr. Murdoch does those things?  
 
A. In what respect? I just said so. 
 
Q. In what respect does he use the media to advance his own personal interest?  
 
A. Well, he backs governments that are friendly to aggrandize his position.  
 
A perfect example: It has been very widely reported he was backing Maggie Thatcher in 
Britain, and as a result, being given virtual monopoly on satellite television there. A 
complete monopoly.  
 
Q. You believe he got that monopoly as a result of his backing the Thatcher government?  
 
A. It is pretty hard to figure which comes first, the chicken or the egg.  
 
Q. You mentioned before that you or your company had given minor contributions to 
campaigns.  
 
Were you referring to Turner, Time Warner or both?  
 
A. We have a, Turner Broadcasting had a PAC that usually contributed no more than I 
think $1,000 to any candidate.  
 
Then I make personal contributions, almost never more than $1,000. I can't recall ever 
personally contributing over $1,000. Which is the, I think the federal limit for giving to 
any one particular candidate.  
 
Q. Have you ever given a contribution to any political candidates whose views or actions 
you believed were inimical to the interests of Turner Broadcasting?  
 
A. Absolutely. 
 
Q. In what instances? 
 
A. Many, many instances. 
 
MR. JOFFE: Wait a second. I interrupt and instruct the witness.  
 
We have gone way far afield of any issue that was raised by the city or Bloomberg in its 
request for discovery.  
 
Now, I am not contesting that some of these issues were raised here at the deposition, but 
they are nowhere within the bounds of anything the judge said was permissible.  
 
Who Mr. Turner makes his contributions to is just beyond the scope of this deposition.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: Well, as you point out yourself, the issues were raised by Mr. Turner in 
his responses. And in his characterizations of Mr. Murdoch.  
 
THE WITNESS: Well, you asked me about it.  
 
MR. JOFFE: Wait a second, David, let me finish my statement. Then you can say 
whatever you want.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: I thought you were done. Sorry.  
 
MR. JOFFE: We are not seeking affirmatively to put in an affidavit from Mr. Turner. It is 
you who want this deposition for discovery.  
 
It seems to me you've got to seek relevant information in it, or as relevant, as close to 
relevant as you can get.  
 
Merely because Mr. Turner's answer may go off on some other area does not entitle you 
to go follow that area as far as your heart's content. It just isn't relevant to this case. It is 
an abuse.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: Have you finished your statement?  
 
MR. JOFFE: Yes. 
 
MR. GOLDIN: We have been informed that you are unilaterally limiting this deposition 
to 2:30 this afternoon. At that time the witness has to leave.  
 
I understand the witness' scheduling constraints. I don't believe that you have the 
authority on your own to advise us, in light of the judge's order there is only a certain 
amount of time during which we must depose this witness.  
 
Nonetheless, we will attempt to accommodate.  
 
I don't think that it is advantageous use of the time for us to have lengthy debates about 
the proper contours of the deposition.  
 
I certainly don't think it is a proper use of the time, and I certainly would not want to 
abuse Mr. Turner's courtesy in appearing here today by having the witness wait while we 
call the judge and debate the issues before her, though I think such a discussion at some 
point may become appropriate.  
 
I don't believe under the federal rules and under the local rules of this court that it is 
appropriate, regardless of your concerns about relevancy, to instruct the witness at this 
time.  
 
I do not believe that that is a proper basis for an instruction not to answer a question.  
 
MR. JOFFE: Then call the judge. 
 
MR. GOLDIN: I am not going to do that at this juncture.  
 
I will put you on notice now that if we are unable to complete this deposition within the-
time that you have set forth, and if there is any controversy about resuming it, we will at 
that time take up the issue, and that we reserve our rights with respect to any other 
remedy. Including an appropriate motion for sanctions.  
 
MR. GARBUS: I just want to make clear also, I intend to ask the witness about 30 
minutes of questions. I would ask that time be made available to me. I have a letter 
putting that request in writing.  
 
MR. JOFFE: I assume you will not instruct any of your witnesses not to answer, either.  
 
Proceed. 
 
MR. GOLDIN: I am not going to respond to that at this point. I will not respond to any 
further instructions.  
 
I don't think it is appropriate for us to have this debate. I think we should proceed with 
questions of Mr. Turner and his responses thereto.  
 
BY MR. GOLDIN: 
 
Q. Has Turner Broadcasting System through its PAC or otherwise made contributions to 
candidates whose positions or actions are inimical to its interest?  
 
MR. JOFFE: Never mind. I will instruct the witness not to answer.  
 
** COUNSEL DIRECTS WITNESS NOT TO ANSWER  
 
BY MR. GOLDIN: 
 
Q. Mr. Turner, you stated earlier that you had made a recommendation or series of 
recommendations to Mr. Levin about the subject of carrying a news channel.  
 
Can you tell me what your recommendation to Mr. Levin was?  
 
A. I told him basically the same thing that I mentioned to Mr. Collins. In my opinion -- 
this is the best of my recollection, in my opinion that we should go as slowly as possible. 
And at the end of the day, probably end up splitting the business. But that was it.  
 
Q. Had Mr. Collins solicited your advice or counsel on this question? Were you 
providing it unsolicited?  
 
A. I was providing it unsolicited. 
 
Q. How about Mr. Levin, had he asked you for your advice?  
 
A. I don't think so. I think it was unsolicited in this case, too, to the best of my 
recollection.  
 
Q. When you say it was your advice to split the business, did you mean that some 
systems would carry Fox and some would carry MSNBC or that some would carry both 
or some other kind of combination?  
 
A. I never got specific about it. 
 
Q. What was Mr. Levin's reaction to your recommendation? If any?  
 
A. There wasn't -- to the best of my recollection there was not a strong reaction one way 
or another. I think he basically said that he was leaving it up to the cable division to 
decide how it was going to be done.  
 
Q. That was Mr. Collins' division? 
 
A. That's right. But I am not absolutely certain about that.  
 
Q. If Mr. Levin had not asked for your advice, why were you providing it to him?  
 
A. Well, I am responsible for the profitability and the health of our cable programming 
assets.  
 
And you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure when you have Microsoft and 
General Electric on one side and News Corp. on the other coming at you, that that can 
have a major effect on your ratings and volume and profitability.  
 
Q. You're talking now about the vantage point of CNN?  
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. What was your expectation about the effect that those competitors might have on 
CNN?  
 
A. Well, to some degree, it is fear of the unknown. But not completely, because in our 
second year of existence we had a combination of ABC and Westinghouse on another 
news channel against us when we were just getting off the ground before we had achieved 
profitability by a number of years.  
 
It cost us about $150 million, by my estimate, in additional losses, it came very close to 
bankrupting the company.  
 
Q. When you say "we" at this point you are talking about CNN?  
 
A. Turner. 
 
Q. Which at that point was operating CNN?  
 
A. That was a division. 
 
Q. Roughly speaking, when was this second year?  
 
A. We started 1980, I think they started around 1982.  
 
Q. What was the station or what was the channel, what were the channels that ABC 
Westinghouse were throwing at you?  
 
A. They started a 24-hour news service called Satellite News Channel. It was a joint 
venture between the two of them similar to the joint venture that Microsoft and NBC, 
General Electric did.  
 
Q. So you had a concern that you might be facing a similar kind of threat from MSNBC 
and Fox?  
 
A. Well, it is absolutely. 
 
Q. That was why you raised the issue of carrying news channel with Mr. Levin?  
 
A. You know, business is competition. As long as you play within the rules of the game -
- I have always played within the rules of the game, as far-as I know, and to the best of 
my ability, and there are lots of rules because we are all over the world, you know -- you 
try and win.  
 
Q. At the time of your conversations with Mr. Levin, the rules of the game, as you 
understood them, included complying with the FTC order while at the same time 
affording CNN as much protection as possible?  
 
A. Absolutely. 
 
Q. It was your view that the recommendation you were making to Mr. Levin to go slow 
would afford CNN as much protection as could be obtained?  
 
A. Well, clearly they had signed the agreement with the government that they were going 
to carry an additional news channel. I mean, the thought never came up.  
 
I never read the exact document, but I was given to believe or somehow the belief 
reached me that Bloomberg was not even an alternative. They had to pick either News 
Corp. or NBC's news.  
 
That sounded to me extremely unfair because there are other news services out there. But  
 
Mr. Bloomberg is being one and the BBC, the British have a news service that is 
available by satellite here. It hasn't been picked up on by many people like Mr. 
Bloomberg's.  
 
I may be wrong about that. Maybe Mr. Bloomberg's news service was a viable service. 
We never even sat down and discussed it.  
 
I mean, Mr. Collins and his people made the decision clearly not paying any attention at 
all to my thought. Which is we should go slowly, review all our alternatives and not leap 
before we look.  
 
Q. Your recommendation, you say review all alternatives, would be to include 
alternatives apart from MSNBC and Fox?  
 
A. I didn't even know they were alternatives, that they were legal or viable. I don't even 
know to this day. But I was given to understand that it had to be one or the other, between 
the two I mentioned, General Electric and Microsoft and Newscorp's.  
 
I am not certain that that is the case at this point. One or the other. But it had to be -- they 
named them by name --  
 
MR. JOFFE: No. 
 
THE WITNESS: Why couldn't Mr. Bloomberg's service -  
 
MR. JOFFE: It doesn't fit the description.  
 
THE WITNESS: What do you mean? It is a 24-hour news service. So is the BBC.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: I have to log an objection. 
 
MR. JOFFE: You can go ahead with your question.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: We have a point where counsel and the witness are engaging in a 
dialogue.  
 
MR. GARBUS: I think saying a good word for Bloomberg is appropriate.  
 
THE WITNESS: I am not saying whether it is a good word or not. At least you were 
discriminated against.  
 
MR. GARBUS: There you go. 
 
MR. GOLDIN: Off the record. 
 
(Discussion off the record.) 
 
BY MR. GOLDIN: 
 
Q. Are you done with that response? 
 
MR. JOFFE: Let me make a short statement, on the record. Feel free to get a cup of 
coffee.  
 
The FTC decree required that one news service be put on and it described the 
characteristics of those --  
 
MR. GARBUS: What is the purpose of this lecture?  
 
MR. JOFFE: The purpose is to try to keep the record clear.  
 
MR. GARBUS: No. No. No. 
 
MR. JOFFE: Can you wait, Mr. Garbus -- 
 
MR. GARBUS: You don't clarify a record. 
 
MR. JOFFE: You can make that statement when I am done.  
 
MR. GARBUS: I can say it now. You don't make a record when your witness is being 
asked questions. I object to it.  
 
MR. JOFFE: Okay. Your objection is noted.  
 
MR. GARBUS: Mr. Turner is a very competent witness. A very bright man who achieved 
some things in his life.  
 
MR. JOFFE: Flattery will get you nowhere, Mr. Garbus.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: Are we done? 
 
MR. JOFFE: No. 
 
MR. GOLDIN: Mr. Joffe, let me say, I do think that Mr. Garbus is right to the extent if 
you need to clarify the record, it does not need to be done now in the midst of the 
examination.  
 
Why don't you wait until the end of the day. If you feel there is something to be added, 
put it on then.  
 
MR. JOFFE: I will accept your suggestion.  
 
THE WITNESS: Okay. 
 
BY MR. GOLDIN: 
 
Q. Mr. Turner, what was the basis for your understanding it had to be either MSNBC or 
Fox?  
 
A. I don't remember. 
 
Q. Did somebody tell you that? 
 
A. I don't remember. 
 
Q. Do you remember when you learned the choice was between those two?  
 
A. No. No. No. 
 
Q. Did you think that that was an appropriate limitation to make the choice only between 
those two?  
 
A. I don't. 
 
Q. Why not? 
 
A. Well, because what criteria, first of all, I don't even know if it was, but it just seems 
like the government -- I didn't think it was right and a lot of other people didn't either, to 
agree to that with the Federal Trade Commission.  
 
I never heard of anything like that ever happening before. And two of the five FTC 
commissioners thought it was outrageous, too, or thought it was wrong, and later on after 
the transaction was completed, spoke out against it.  
 
So it was a very controversial provision in the first place. If it favored two speakers over 
other speakers, and there are at least three other news channels out there of which Mr. 
Bloomberg's, the BBC is one, then there is one been kicking around for years called All 
News Channel that is owned I think by Mr. Hubbard and Viacom.  
 
That that would -- how they got, you know, favored over those other three news channels, 
I thought was outrageous.  
 
I never got around, never had the time to get into it and look at it. Because I clearly had 
no power to influence events at Time Warner Cable.  
 
That's it. 
 
Q. Okay. Just so it is clear, you now do have that power; is that correct?  
 
A. No, I don't. 
 
Q. You still can't influence events at Time Warner Cable?  
 
A. No, I can't. 
 
Q. You can only influence Time Warner's cable programming decisions; is that correct?  
 
A. The area that I am responsible for, and clearly even there, I have to report to Gerry 
Levin and perhaps -- I've never been to a board meeting, so right now I couldn't do 
anything, change any policies that are currently in place without getting approval for it. I 
am an employee.  
 
Q. Do you find that Mr. Levin often rejects your suggestions?  
 
A. He rejects them from time to time. 
 
Q. As an employee do you find it gives you any advantage to have a 9 percent ownership 
share in the corporation in getting your suggestions accepted?  
 
A. Well, you would think that it should have some weight, but Mr. Bronfman of 
Seagram's owns 15 percent and couldn't even get in the door.  
 
Q. Did you tell Mr. Levin what the thinking was behind your recommendation on how to 
proceed with the decision on carrying a news channel?  
 
A. Would you repeat that question. 
 
Q. Did you tell Mr. Levin why you were recommending a go-slow approach?  
 
A. I don't remember the details. He didn't seem to be that interested in what I thought, to 
tell you the truth, on this particular matter.  
 
Q. Was he interested in your thinking about other matters?  
 
A. To some degree. 
 
Q. During the time that you were discussing with him the issue of news channel carriage, 
what matters that you expressed a view on was he interested in?  
 
A. I told you earlier, the company is very complex and very large. Not just to mention the 
areas that I deal in.  
 
And we discussed a number of subjects, and a great deal of it, very little of it was 
decision-making. It was mostly just by way of informing me about the way things were 
going and me trying to do the same with him so that we had a better understanding of 
how the various areas that we were responsible for were working.  
 
Q. Was your recommendation of a go-slow approach to selecting a news channel casual, 
off the top of your head suggestion or something you had given some thought, reflection 
to?  
 
A. Well, I normally give some thought and reflection to everything I say. It might be 
brief.  
 
But I didn't really know -- had I had some real responsibility in the area, I would have 
spent more time studying the situation. But since I had -- basically I think this decision 
was made, to the best of my recollection, even before the merger, before the merger 
closed.  
 
And I never, even though, had any serious input what Time Warner did in any of its 
areas, they owned 18 percent of me. I didn't own 18 percent of them.  
 
Not only did they own 18 percent of me, they also had a veto as a side agreement.  
 
I have nothing like that. I am just a minority shareholder in this company.

(Pages, 40-49, have been designated Confidential and are bound separately. At this point 
the deposition of TED TURNER continues.)  
 
BY MR. GOLDIN: 
 
Q. You testified a moment ago about the decision to proceed with carrying MSNBC as 
the news channel.  
 
A. That I did what? 
 
Q. About the decision to carry MSNBC. 
 
A. What about it? 
 
Q. You testified about it. 
 
A. I am a little hard of hearing. 
 
Q. Sorry, I will speak up. 
 
A. You are doing well. 
 
Q. I will see if I can keep it up. 
 
Was that decision made at some point before it was announced?  
 
A. To the best of my recollection, yes. 
 
Q. When was the decision made? 
 
A. About four, five, six days before it was announced, to the best of my recollection. 
Several days.  
 
Q. How did you hear about the decision? 
 
A. I can't remember whether Mr. Levin mentioned it to me or whether Joe Collins called 
me. But I did speak to Joe Collins. I might have wanted to get it straight from him. I don't 
remember how I learned about it.  
 
But the main conversation was with Mr. Collins on the telephone, not face to face. It 
didn't last but a couple of minutes.  
 
He confirmed that they had made a deal with MSNBC and that they were going to 
announce it at some point in the future not too distant.  
 
I expressed my disappointment, but that was it.  
 
Q. Why did you tell Mr. Collins you were disappointed?  
 
A. Because I thought -- I wasn't privy to the conversations either with Mr. Murdoch, or 
with the people at MSNBC. I don't even know who we met with with them.  
 
I learned, most of this I learned about in reading about it.  
 
So, I don't know what the background thought processes were between why one was 
chosen over the other. I didn't have input into it. I wasn't asked. My suggestions weren't 
solicited.  
 
They were not paid attention to. 
 
Q. Well, did you ask Mr. Collins what the thought processes were?  
 
A. Not really, because the decision had been made.  
 
Q. Were you interested to know why it had been made?  
 
A. I guess I did ask him. He gave me a very brief explanation.  
 
Q. What did he say? 
 
A. To the best of my recollection he said that they needed retransmission consent on 
some news stations that NBC had just purchased. And they already had retransmission 
consent from Mr. Murdoch and didn't need to make a deal with him right now.  
 
He said they weren't precluded from making a deal with Murdoch at some point in the 
future, but for the time being they were going to go with MSNBC.  
 
And he also said that one reason for that is that NBC already had a channel for a news 
talk channel, I can't remember whether it was news talk, it had a different name, but they 
were just changing over from one, from the news talk format to more of a hard news 
reporting format.  
 
Most of the cable operators, I think, in fact I think all of them went along with that 
format, format change.  
 
NBC started with an advantage, because they already had a channel on that was sort of 
news related. They just converted it over to this other channel. Which gave them an 
advantage because they already were on a lot of systems.  
 
Q. Apart from this conversation with Mr. Collins, did you ever discuss with anybody else 
at Time Warner why MSNBC was selected?  
 
A. Not to my recollection. 
 
Q. Given your current responsibilities at Time Warner, is the decision about carrying 
another news channel, if that were to be now, within your area of responsibility?  
 
A. No. 
 
Q. It would still be Mr. Collins' responsibility?  
 
A. Mr. Collins and whoever, you know, whoever else is part of his brain trust, I guess.  
 
Q. To whom does Mr. Collins report? 
 
A. I think he reports, to the best of my knowledge, he reports to a board that has 
representatives from U.S. West on it.  
 
I don't even know who represents Time Warner there, whether it is Mr. Levin or 
somebody else.  
 
Q. Over what cable programming decisions do you have authority?  
 
A. I have authority for day-to-day operations of the current cable networks.  
 
Q. That includes CNN? 
 
A. That's right. 
 
Q. It includes Headline News? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Have you continued to make your recommendation that Time Warner consider, as you 
put it before, I think it was splitting the baby; that is, carrying Fox as well as MSNBC?  
 
A. Would you repeat that please. 
 
Q. Have you continued to recommend that Time Warner consider carrying Fox along 
with MSNBC?  
 
A. No. Because once the decision was made a couple weeks ago to go with MSNBC and 
I haven't -- I have just been aware of basically what has happened, the dispute with Mr. 
Murdoch and the lawsuits and so forth. They just come very quickly.  
 
Since they didn't pay any attention to me before, I don't know why they would now.  
 
Q. What is your recommendation now? 
 
MR. JOFFE: Wait a second. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't have a recommendation.  
 
MR. JOFFE: Fine. The question was obviously improper.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: Thanks, Mr. Joffe. 
 
BY MR. GOLDIN: 
 
Q. CNN and Headline News are all news programs; is that correct?  
 
A. We call them that. But there is -- on CNN there are talk shows and news of fashion 
and so forth.  
 
News can be broadly defined. There is all sort of different kinds of news, too.  
 
Q. I am not trying to put words in your mouth. I just want to have a term that is generally 
accepted.  
 
Is all news a fair characterization for those two channels?  
 
A. That is normally what they are referred to as.  
 
Q. I believe, again I don't want to mischaracterize, that you have described some other 
channels today as also being all news channels?  
 
A. Or at least in the generally accepted definition, broad definition.  
 
Q. That would include MSNBC, Fox News Channel, Bloomberg, and then I believe you 
had mentioned BBC and --  
 
A. BBC, right. And in my opinion if you go a little further afield, clearly The Weather 
Channel is news.  
 
And all three of the major network affiliates and even a lot of the independent stations 
like Mr. Murdoch's here in New York run a lot of news, you know.  
 
So C-Span is news about Congress. I mean -- you've got CNBC, which is news about 
business with a lot of other news. Then there is some others as well.  
 
E!, which is entertainment news. 
 
Q. Confining ourselves to whatever set of programs you feel comfortable calling all news 
programs, would you agree with the characterization in general those programs are 
informative?  
 
A. That's what news is certainly supposed to be.  
 
Q. Would you agree they are educational?  
 
A. Not necessarily. No. 
 
Q. Would you say that CNN in general is educational?  
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Would you describe any of the all news programs we just mentioned as being 
educational?  
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Would you agree that they can inform the voting electorate?  
 
A. Certainly they can. 
 
Q. Would you agree that they promote the exchange of ideas?  
 
A. Sometimes. 
 
Q. Would you agree that they inform viewers about the government?  
 
A. Sometimes. 
 
Q. Would you say that CNN in particular informs viewers about the government?  
 
A. Sometimes. 
 
Q. Would you say that CNN in particular can inform the electorate?  
 
A. Sometimes. 
 
Q. Are you familiar with the concept of a public access educational and governmental 
channel also known as a PEG?  
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Has CNN ever been carried on a PEG channel, to your knowledge?  
 
A. Not to my knowledge. 
 
Q. Has Headline News ever been carried on a PEG channel, to your knowledge?  
 
A. Not to my knowledge. 
 
Q. Has any Turner programming been carried on a PEG channel, to your knowledge?  
 
A. Not to my knowledge. 
 
Q. Can you explain to me how CNN generates revenues?  
 
A. From two separate sources -- well, from a number of sources, but its main revenue 
source is advertising and subscription fees.  
 
Q. What do you mean by subscription fees?  
 
A. We collect or try to collect a small amount, a few cents each month per subscriber 
from the cable operators or satellite distributors that distribute our programming.  
 
Q. In order to obtain subscription fees it is necessary that a service be carried on a 
commercial channel; is that correct? That is not on a PEG channel?  
 
A. Actually Headline News we don't charge anything for unless it is carried by itself. In 
fact, we give it away and reduce the fee for CNN for carrying Headline News.  
 
Q. Does Headline News carry advertising?  
 
A. Yes, it does. 
 
Q. So it generates revenues in that way?  
 
A. Some revenues, right. 
 
Q. Insofar as it generates revenues. 
 
Is it correct, though, that running a service on a PEG channel would not generate 
revenues?  
 
A. It would depend. If it had advertising in it, it could. A PEG channel is a channel --  
 
Q. What is your understanding as to why Time Warner Cable does not want to have New 
York City run the Fox News Channel on a New York City PEG channel?  
 
MR. JOFFE: Objection. You haven't asked the witness whether he has any understanding 
on this issue.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: Well, I would think that is subsumed in the same question.  
 
MR. JOFFE: He said he has no responsibility for this area. It seems to me --  
 
MR. GOLDIN: I think you made the point. 
 
I will rephrase the question. 
 
MR. JOFFE: It seems it lacks foundation.  
 
BY MR. GOLDIN: 
 
Q. Do you have any understanding as to why Time Warner does not want, Time Warner 
Cable of New York City, does not want to have New York City run the Fox News, carry 
the Fox News Channel on its PEG station?  
 
A. Well, from what I have read, and I have read quite a bit about it, it seems to me that 
the reason is quite clear; that it is improper and illegal.  
 
Q. What have you read? 
 
A. I have read the articles in all three New York newspapers. That has been my primary 
source of information.  
 
Q. Have you discussed the subject with anyone?  
 
A. I have heard peripherally some of the discussions that have taken place in various 
places. It has been a rather widely reported situation.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: Let's take a couple minutes.  
 
(Recess taken.) 
 
BY MR. GOLDIN: 
 
Q. Have you discussed the matter with anybody at Time Warner?  
 
A. I have heard some of the discussions. That was primarily at Time Warner.  
 
Q. What have you heard in those discussions?  
 
A. Nothing any different than what has been reported in the press.  
 
Q. What is your understanding as to why there is some impropriety or illegality in the 
idea of running Fox News on the PEG station?  
 
A. It is pretty damned obvious that there are dozens of programmers who have big bases 
of operations here in New York who have been trying to get on the Time Warner system 
for years. Including Mr. Bloomberg's operation.  
 
And the only difference is their wife of the mayor doesn't work for them. Maybe they 
didn't endorse the current administration at election time and hadn't made such large 
contributions.  
 
I mean, it is outrageous what's happened here, in my opinion. Without precedent. That I 
have ever seen.  
 
Q. It is your understanding the reason why the city wants to carry Fox News is because 
the mayor's wife is employed -  
 
A. What? 
 
Q. Is it your understanding the reason the city wants to carry Fox News is because of the 
employment of the mayor's wife and Mr. Murdoch's political contributions?  
 
A. And God knows what else Murdoch has done to get the mayor in his pocket.  
 
Q. What is your belief as to the other things Mr. Murdoch has done?  
 
A. I don't know. Murdoch is a pretty slimy character. He has done this lots of times 
before. I am just amazed -- I can understand him doing it in England, maybe Australia or 
China. But here having it happen in New York, it really surprises me.  
 
He tried to do it with Newt Gingrich too, you know. He got slapped in the face for it. He 
tried to buy him with a book contract, if you recall.  
 
Q. It is your understanding that Mr. Murdoch was trying to obtain favors from Mr. 
Gingrich?  
 
A. Absolutely. 
 
Q. What favors was he trying to obtain? 
 
A. Trying to get the Congress to approve his purchase of the television stations when you 
are supposed to be an American company and it is an Australian company that purchased 
them. It has been widely reported.  
 
And whatever else he has on his agenda. 
 
Q. Is it your understanding there is any impropriety or illegality in the city's carrying 
Bloomberg on its PEG stations?  
 
A. I don't know. It is clear to me that Bloomberg was just an afterthought, oh, we got 
another news channel here; well, we will just have to carry them along too, because 
otherwise it won't look right.  
 
Clearly at the beginning Mr. Bloomberg was totally out in the cold. It was all trying to 
help his buddy Murdoch.  
 
Q. Why is it your belief -- 
 
MR. GARBUS: Excuse me. You aren't saying --  
 
MR. JOFFE: Wait a second. You are very big on order. Wait until your turn.  
 
MR. GARBUS: I wanted to clarify the question.  
 
You weren't saying Bloomberg was the mayor's buddy?  
 
THE WITNESS: I can't hear, everybody is hollering.  
 
MR. JOFFE: Don't say a thing. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. No. No. 
 
MR. JOFFE: Mr. Garbus, you are very big on clarification, coming in proper order.  
 
THE WITNESS: Who wants to step outside? 
 
MR. GARBUS: We are clear, thanks, Ted. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, I am not trying to tie Mr. Bloomberg with Mr. Murdoch. As far as I 
know, Mr. Bloomberg is a pretty decent sort. He has been here for years, nobody tried to 
put him on. He ain't paying City Hall off. BY MR. GOLDIN:  
 
Q. What is the basis for your understanding that the city's proposed carriage of Fox News 
is illegal?  
 
A. I don't know whether it is illegal or not.  
 
MR. JOFFE: Mr. Goldin, this is really a waste of this witness' time.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: Thank you, Mr. Joffe. 
 
BY MR. GOLDIN: 
 
Q. What is the basis for your understanding that the city's carriage of Bloomberg is 
illegal?  
 
MR. JOFFE: I will instruct the witness not to respond with any privileged advice that he 
has been given.  
 
Q. Don't disclose any conversations you have had with counsel.  
 
MR. GARBUS: Why don't we leave Bloomberg out of this. Let me deal with Mr. Turner 
on Bloomberg.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: I would like an answer to the question.  
 
MR. GARBUS: I object to the city asking questions about Bloomberg. I am very 
comfortable in having my dialogue with Mr. Turner.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: The objection is noted. 
 
Any concerns the parties, defendant are acting collusively have been abated.  
 
MR. JOFFE: Unless this was done by arrangement.  
 
You can answer the question. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't even know what the question is. Would you repeat it.  
 
BY MR. GOLDIN: 
 
Q. What is the basis for your understanding that the city's proposal to carry Bloomberg is 
illegal?  
 
A. I thought we weren't going to talk about Bloomberg.  
 
MR. GARBUS: Why don't you leave it alone. Let me have the discussion with Mr. 
Turner. I represent Bloomberg here.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: It is on the record, Mr. Garbus. Thank you. BY MR. GOLDIN:  
 
Q. What is the basis for your understanding the city's proposal to carry Bloomberg is 
improper?  
 
A. It is clearly a commercial channel. It is not an educational PEG or local origination 
channel. It is a national service.  
 
From my knowledge, and it was discussed yesterday by the Cable Television Association 
executive committee, among a lot of other things, in our normal meeting, and it is not just 
my understanding but the people in the cable business, that this is, to my knowledge, 
without precedent.  
 
And is an absolute abuse of, or attempted abuse which will be defeated in the courts, as 
you will see, of trying to help out a political crony even at the expense of what is good for 
the community with these channels or what they are supposed to be used for.  
 
Q. Why do you believe it would be bad for the community if Fox News and Bloomberg 
ran on the city's PEG channels?  
 
MR. GARBUS: Again, I object. Fox and Bloomberg are two very very different things.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: Mr. Garbus, we don't need a speech.  
 
MR. GARBUS: The allegations as to Mr. Murdoch don't relate to Mr. Bloomberg. I 
object to tying them together.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: I didn't tie anybody together.  
 
MR. JOFFE: I have an entirely different objection, which I would like to get on the 
record.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: Are you going to have a speaking objection too or can you just object?  
 
MR. JOFFE: No, I will speak. 
 
MR. GOLDIN: What is the basis for a speaking objection?  
 
MR. JOFFE: Will you keep quiet so I can make my statement. I am not objecting, I am 
making a statement right now.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: What do you mean, you are-making a statement? Where under the rules 
of this court do you have an opportunity to make a statement?  
 
THE WITNESS: Let's act civilized. 
 
MR. JOFFE: Let's call the judge. She said you could have discovery on the issue why we 
made the decision not to carry Murdoch. And why we made the decision to carry 
MSNBC.  
 
He is not an affiant in this case. You don't have any business going into these issues. You 
are literally wasting his time. It is beyond the scope of the deposition.  
 
MR. GARBUS: Can I speak to the city for one second?  
 
MR. GOLDIN: Are you making an instruction?  
 
MR. JOFFE: No. 
 
MR. GOLDIN: You are not? 
 
MR. JOFFE: Absolutely not. I am just saying you are wasting his time.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: Can we have an answer to the question? There is a question pending.  
 
THE WITNESS: I am not going to answer it.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: Mr. Joffe, there is a question pending.  
 
MR. JOFFE: Fine. I am giving him legal advice.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: You can wait until the question is repeated.  
 
MR. JOFFE: I can do whatever 1 please. 
 
(The pending question was read.) 
 
THE WITNESS: I am not going to answer that question. That calls for -- I mean it is just 
goofy.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: We will take a break for a moment, on That note. (Recess Taken.)  
 
BY MR. GOLDIN: 
 
Q. Mr. Turner, are you aware of negotiations that Time Warner had been having with Fox 
in the spring or summer of this year for Fox's becoming the other news channel that 
would be carried by Time Warner?  
 
A. I was vaguely familiar with them. 
 
Q. What was the source of your familiarity?  
 
A. I don't remember. Various. 
 
Q. Did you talk to anybody at Time Warner about those negotiations?  
 
A. I am sure I must have. I didn't gain any -- I can't remember gaining any significant 
knowledge. I just knew there were negotiations going on with both companies.  
 
Not just Fox, but people at MSNBC. I don't even know who was meeting with whom. 
Mostly I picked it up by reading about it.  
 
Q. Did you talk to Mr. Levin about those negotiations?  
 
A. I am sure I did. I said I talked to him about it. But, you know, not much, didn't gain 
much from it.  
 
Q. Are you aware that those negotiations began before the FTC's preliminary approval of 
the Time Warner/Turner merger?  
 
A. I think I remember reading about that.  
 
Q. That was the only source of your knowledge about those negotiations?  
 
A. It was the main source. 
 
Q. Had you also heard about it personally?  
 
A. I don't remember. I said that I did discuss it with Mr. Levin among hundreds of other 
things.  
 
Q. Are you aware that the consummation of a deal with Fox News was a very high 
priority at Time Warner?  
 
A. High priority compared to what? 
 
Q. Have you ever heard it described by anybody at Time Warner as second only to 
obtaining FTC approval among Time Warner's priorities?  
 
A. I don't remember ever hearing that. 
 
Q. Have you ever heard it described by anybody at Time Warner as a high priority?  
 
A. No. Not to my recollection. 
 
Q. Are you aware that a deal between Time Warner and Fox was in fact reached?  
 
A. I never heard that. 
 
Q. Did you hear that a deal was roughed out or close to being reached?  
 
A. I heard that there was close to being an agreement.  
 
Q. Did you hear the terms of that agreement?  
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Are you aware that that agreement required a $100 million plus upfront payment from 
Fox?  
 
A. I was unaware of that. I didn't know what the amount was.  
 
Q. Were you aware it required 90 percent penetration -  
 
A. No. 
 
Q. -- or carriage on Time Warner - 
 
A. I was unfamiliar with what the specifics of the various proposals.  
 
Normally what happens in these things, we are involved in them quite often, particularly 
when there are two head-to-head competitors, the cable operator does a really bright 
brilliant job of playing one off against the other to see what kind of considerations can be 
gotten, how much money. It is very complicated.  
 
Usually they string you along until the last minute, and make the deal with whoever they 
think the best deal is. Whoever didn't get the deal gets left out in the cold. That is just the 
way the game is played.  
 
Just like when you are buying a car. You-play one dealer off against the other. Then you 
make your buy, the other guy is out in the cold. That is what happened to Rupert.  
 
Q. You never -- 
 
A. Tough. 
 
Q. You never obtained any documents reflecting the terms of the Fox deal?  
 
A. Never. Or the MSNBC deal. 
 
I don't know what it is to this day. 
 
Q. Are you interested to find out? 
 
A. At some point in time. I guess. But it is not -- it would be strictly from an esoteric 
standpoint.  
 
Q. We were talking before about all news formats. Would you characterize MSNBC as 
baying an all news format?  
 
A. That is what they say it is. 
 
Q. What do you say? 
 
A. Well, I mean even -- there is times during CNN's day that, for instance, I don't know 
whether Crossfire is an all news program.  
 
I mean it is -- kind of reminds me what is happening here today. I wouldn't call it news, 
necessarily.  
 
MR. JOFFE: Certainly not educational. 
 
Q. But we could probably get it on the air.  
 
A. Now that would be a proper use of the channel.  
 
Q.  Where were we? 
 
MSNBC. Would you characterize it as all news?  
 
A. I don't know. I haven't seen it but a few minutes.  
 
Q. Have you seen the Fox News Channel? 
 
A. Not at all. 
 
Q. Do you have any awareness of the MSNBC format other than the few minutes you 
have seen it?  
 
A. Just what I read about it. 
 
Q. Based on your reading do you have a view as to whether it is an all news channel?  
 
A. I don't know. I guess it comes as close to it as -- well, actually, it doesn't. They've got 
Don Imus in the morning, I don't consider that a news program.  
 
That is their highest rated program, too.  
 
Q. Do you have any awareness of the format of the Fox News Channel?  
 
A. Just what I read about it. 
 
Q. Based on that, do you consider it to be an all news channel? If you have a view.  
 
A. What difference does it make? 
 
Q. Just tell me the answer to the question, please.  
 
MR. JOFFE: The question is whether you have a view.  
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know, I haven't seen it. I read about it. It calls itself an all news 
channel.  
 
Mr. Murdoch had an Inside Edition, was that a news program? I don't know whether it 
was. Is tabloid news? I don't know. I don't have a personal opinion.  
 
BY MR. GOLDIN: 
 
Q. I am asking you if you have a view. If you don't have a view --  
 
A. I don't have a view. That is what I meant to say.  
 
Q. There you go. 
 
During the time you were making your recommendation, as you described before to Mr. 
Collins and to Mr. Levin about selecting a news channel, did you ever express a view that 
if you had to pick between MSNBC and Fox, you ought to go with one or the other?  
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Did you have such a view? 
 
A. No. I don't like either one of them. 
 
Q. Because of their impact on CNN? 
 
A. Well, they are both competitors, number one.  
 
I don't have a lot of respect for General Electric, either. They have been indicted 40 times 
for stealing from the government over the last 30 or 40 years. And admitted to it. And 
paid fines and stuff, stealing from the taxpayers on military contracts.  
 
If you recall, NBC News set that truck on fire, that Chevrolet truck on fire to get a better 
news story a few years ago, they fired the head of their news department.  
 
It is not as bad as GE. They are not scumbags like Murdoch.  
 
Q. If you had your druthers you would rather have --  
 
A. It would be like would you rather be defeated by the Nazis or Japanese in World War 
II. Neither one of them is going to give you much of a break. You die in one 
concentration camp as fast as another.  
 
So, I really didn't -- I really don't favor one over the other.  
 
Q. In that analogy, is one of them the Nazi and the other the Japanese, or are they 
interchangeable?  
 
A. They are the enemy. They plan to keep our employees' children from going to college. 
Take food off the table of the people I work with.  
 
Just like Democrats would do if they take over City Hall.  
 
Q. You do the same thing. 
 
A. We play hard and we play fair. 
 
Q. Vis-a-vis their employees. You are also in the business of keeping food off their 
tables; right?  
 
A. I would like to. 
 
Q. During the course of the Time Warner/Turner proceedings before the FTC, did you 
speak to the FTC?  
 
A. The FTC? 
 
Q. Federal Trade Commission. In connection with the approval of the merger.  
 
A. I was questioned like this for a day down there one time, I think.  
 
Q. Did you tell the FTC anything about Time Warner's negotiations with Fox?  
 
A. I don't remember. 
 
Q. You might have? 
 
A. I might not have. We talked, you know.  
 
Q. Did you tell them anything about negotiations with MSNBC?  
 
A.  I don't know. 
 
Q. Did you tell or did anybody else at Time Warner to your knowledge tell the FTC that 
Time Warner had limited ability to offer a second all news channel to viewers?  
 
A. Sorry? 
 
Q. Did you or anybody else at Time Warner tell the FTC that Time Warner had a limited 
ability to offer a second all news channel to viewers? - A. I don't remember.  
 
Q. So it is possible that that was said?  
 
A. Anything is possible. 
 
Q. Did you or anybody else at Time Warner hire anybody to contact or lobby the FTC in 
connection with obtaining FTC approval of the proposed merger?  
 
A. Sorry. Would you repeat the question.  
 
Q. Did you or anybody else at Time Warner hire anyone to lobby the FTC in connection 
with obtaining FTC approval?  
 
A. FTC? 
 
Q. FTC. Federal Trade Commission. 
 
A. There is an FCC. I am a little hard of hearing. I really don't know. I don't know. We 
had batteries of attorneys and lobbyists, I don't know whether they lobbied the FTC or 
not.  
 
Q. Did you consult any politicians or try to get any politicians help in persuading the FTC 
to give approval?  
 
A. Did I or a lobbyist? 
 
Q. Did anyone from Time Warner? 
 
A. I don't know. 
 
Q. We have been talking a moment ago about Japanese and Nazis, you have compared 
Rupert Murdoch to the late Fuhrer; is that right?  
 
A. Right. 
 
Q. Can you tell me what you meant by that comparison?  
 
A. Sure. The late Fuhrer, the first thing he did was -  
 
MR. GARBUS: That is not the best question I ever heard placed, but go ahead.  
 
THE WITNESS: The late Fuhrer, first thing he did, like all dictators, was take over the 
press and use it to further his agenda.  
 
Basically that is what Rupert Murdoch does with his media. It was reported in the 
editorial pages, not just me talking, it was a PBS Frontline program. Ken Auletta's article 
in the New Yorker last year.  
 
And editorials, I think The New York Times used the word shamelessly the way he 
promotes his own agenda by backing certain politicians and whatever else he does.  
 
He even went so far, I think it was probably a mistake, his cronies at the New York Post 
jumped the gun and took the listing out for CNN last week.  
 
His journalistic credentials are a joke. He is a disgrace to journalism. I am not the only 
one who said it. So did The Daily News on the editorial pages, words to that effect.  
 
So did The New York Times. 
 
Of course, they are his competitors, too.  
 
BY MR. GOLDIN: 
 
Q. Do you know whether that view is shared by anybody else at Time Warner?  
 
A. I don't know. 
 
Q. You never discussed the subject of your thoughts on Mr. Murdoch with anyone at 
Time Warner?  
 
A. I do my best to avoid it. 
 
Q. I am asking you -- 
 
A. I don't recall. I don't recall. Maybe I did.  
 
I have made my views pretty public. 
 
Q. I thought they might have come up in your conversations with people at Time Warner.  
 
A. I can't recall. 
 
Q. You haven't discussed with anybody at Time Warner your comparing Mr. Murdoch to 
the late Fuhrer?  
 
A. I don't remember. 
 
Q. Did you also say recently that editors or journalists who work for Mr. Murdoch are 
yellow journalists?  
 
A. I don't recall saying that. That would be -- I am sure not all of them would be. It 
doesn't seem like something I would have said.  
 
It is pretty hard with thousands of journalists to tar them all. Anyway. I answered the 
question.  
 
Q. Did you say at one point Time Warner is three times as big as News Corp., we are 
looking forward to squishing Rupert like a bug?  
 
A. I did. 
 
Q. What did you mean by that? 
 
A. I meant we were going to try and squish him. He is a big person to squish.  
 
Clearly, that was joking. But I would like to see him get what he deserves in the end.  
 
I do believe, like Martin Luther King said, there is an ultimate morality in the universe. 
No lie can live forever. In his famous speech.  
 
Q. What do you think Mr. Murdoch deserves in the end?  
 
MR. GARBUS: I don't think that is the best question to ask, either.  
 
MR. JOFFE: You really want an answer to these questions?  
 
MR. GOLDIN: Yes. 
 
MR. JOFFE: You are wasting the witness' time.  
 
THE WITNESS: That is all right. It is his time. Just so long as Mr. Bloomberg gets his 
half hour.  
 
MR. JOFFE: I hope they are not going to do this just to use up three hours of your time, 
because that is what they have the right to.  
 
THE WITNESS: I would like to see him selling newspapers on the corner where I started 
out. I would like to see him end up where I started. That is what I think he deserves.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: Give us a moment, if you would.  
 
(Recess taken.) 
 
BY MR. GOLDIN: 
 
Q. Did Mr. Levin -- 
 
A. Levin. 
 
Q. I stand corrected. 
 
-- Mr. Levin ever express to you any views concerning Mr. Murdoch?  
 
A. Not really -- not that I can recall. 
 
Q. Did Mr. Collins? 
 
A. Not that I can recall. 
 
Q. Did anybody else at Time Warner? 
 
A. You mean personal views like I just espoused?  
 
Q. Yes. 
 
A. No. Not that I know of. 
 
MR. GOLDIN: Let's go off the record for a moment.  
 
Thank you, Mr. Turner. 
 
THE WITNESS: You can call me Ted now. I enjoyed talking to y'all.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: It has been a pleasure. 
 
MR. JOFFE: I would like to know the subject you want to inquire on before we get a 
ruling. His political contributions?  
 
MR. GOLDIN: That was the only one. Was there another area where it came up?  
 
MR. JOFFE: As far as I recall. 
 
MR. GOLDIN: Those were the questions. 
 
EXAMINATION CONDUCTED 
 
BY MR. GARBUS: 
 
Q. You have given us your views of Murdoch. Can you give me -- you have been dealing 
with Bloomberg to some extent with respect to Headline News for a period of time.  
 
Have you known about Bloomberg for a while?  
 
A. I have known about him for quite a while. But I think that is not true. I have not 
personally been involved, to the best of my knowledge, with Mr. Bloomberg.  
 
I know that he is currently running the local edition and headline edition here in New 
York, because I have seen it myself.  
 
Q. Can you describe to me what that local edition is on the Headline News?  
 
A. I have seen on the satellite several times the Bloomberg News Service.  
 
Q. Can you give me your views both of the service and of Michael Bloomberg, to the 
extent you know anything about him?  
 
A. I have read articles about him. That is the only way. I have wanted to meet him. We 
have never had a chance to get together. Which I would like to correct at some point in 
time.  
 
Q. It is fair to say that you have some degree of respect for him?  
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. As you probably know -- 
 
A. Amazing entrepreneur. 
 
Q. As you probably know, there has never been an accusation he has ever been politically 
involved.  
 
He happened to be a Dinkins supporter rather than a Giuliani supporter.  
 
You knew that? 
 
A. I knew that. 
 
Q. With respect to the business, you know something about the business that he has built 
and what he does with it?  
 
A. Yes, I do. 
 
Q. You know something about the information that he presents on the CNN Headline 
News?  
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. You know that he takes that news and he localizes it and customizes it for various 
areas?  
 
A. That's right. I don't know how intimate that is. But I have seen his news here in New 
York. I have seen the national newscasts that runs on the satellite.  
 
Q. You know that the newscasts that come out on your Headline News in New York are 
different than Headline News that might be on CNN in California?  
 
A. That somebody else might be doing? 
 
Q. Or even that he might be doing. 
 
A. Is he doing it somewhere else? 
 
Q. In other words, he does local news here and local news elsewhere?  
 
A.  I didn't know that. 
 
MR. JOFFE: What is the question? 
 
MR. GARBUS: He did not know. 
 
THE WITNESS: Right. 
 
MR. GARBUS: So we are past it. 
 
BY MR. GARBUS: 
 
Q. You were talking before about what is appropriate for PEG channels in your judgment.  
 
You have been for many years chairman of the National Cable Television Association?  
 
A. No. No. This is the -- less than, about six months, so far. That is is about a nine month 
term.  
 
Like most associations, we have PEG president. Then each year we get a new chairman 
who is, basically it is an honorary position as much as anything.  
 
You do preside over the meetings of the board four times a year.  
 
Q. Do you have some sense of what should be shown on PEG channels?  
 
A. I think. Public access channels, right. Sure.  
 
Q. Tell me what kind of material that should include, local calendars?  
 
A. That's right. City Hall meetings. High school or courses in college courses.  
 
What do you call it where you learn how to be a plumber or something like that? Things 
that- are of benefit to the local community, usually community oriented programming.  
 
Q. Does that mean they shouldn't show any international news at all?  
 
A. I don't know. I haven't got an opinion on that. But there is lots of other sources for 
national and international news on the commercial channels.  
 
Q. So would the subject of, let's say, what is on C-Span, would that be on a local level 
appropriate for a PEG channel?  
 
A. If it was, you know, the local City Hall meetings, absolutely.  
 
That is what my understanding is. I have never been a cable operator. Quite frankly, I 
don't watch those channels very often. I don't hardly have time to see all the channels we 
have got.  
 
But that has always been my understanding. It is like a C-Span, a local C-Span.  
 
Q. A local C-Span has talk shows, they do some book shows, Book Chat?  
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And local C-Span, the C-Span has some international news also; is that right?  
 
A. Well C-Span normally, I mean its bread and butter, it is not news, its bread and butter 
is the live activities of the Congress.  
 
Q. You are not suggesting, I am just asking the question, that the entire 100 percent of the 
time would be local news with a mix, let's say, of 50 percent local news, 25 percent 
educational and 25 national news?  
 
That satisfies, as you understand it, the requirements of a PEG channel?  
 
A. I never thought that local news -- I haven't watched them enough to know.  
 
If it was local news provided by local commercial channel, I would think that would be 
inappropriate.  
 
Q. In other words, the question in your mind then as to whether it is appropriate or not is 
whether or not it is a commercial channel that provides it.  
 
A. How would you fund, there is no funding for City Hall to have a news operation.  
 
I don't know of any government body, other than the CIA or the USISA than has their 
own news organization.  
 
That is for propaganda purposes overseas.  
 
Q. So the probabilities are no municipality would have the funds to do its own news 
channel?  
 
MR. JOFFE: Mr. Garbus, first of all, that is not a question.  
 
Second of all, this is a waste of the witness' time. You are making an argument. You're 
not asking questions.  
 
MR. GARBUS, These are questions. I will push them.  
 
MR. JOFFE: What is the question? 
 
MR. GARBUS, I asked it. 
 
Can I have the question back. 
 
(The pending question was read.) 
 
THE WITNESS: Not that I am aware of. BY MR. GOLDIN:  
 
Q. So if you are going to have a news channel on PEG, it is either commercial or it 
doesn't exist?  
 
A. I don't know. I mean -- 
 
Q. Let's assume in this case that you have a commercial operation, it can be a news 
channel, it can be whatever else it is, and it pays to do a 24-hour news channel on PEG. Is 
that appropriate?  
 
A. That it rents a channel? 
 
Q. No. In other words, you have some organization, it could be C-Span which is a profit, 
commercial corporation.  
 
A. A what? 
 
Q. C-Span. 
 
A. I don't think it is. I think C-Span is nonprofit. To the best of my knowledge. I am not 
positive.  
 
Q. Let's assume a not for profit corporation.  
 
A. Not for profit. 
 
Q. Let's assume an not for profit corporation says to the City of New York, we will at no 
cost to you put on a 24-hour news channel and that news channel will be 50 percent local, 
25 percent national, and 25 percent how to do it, education.  
 
In your judgment, does that comply with PEG?  
 
A. I don't know. 
 
MR. JOFFE: Object. This is way beyond what the judge said is permissible.  
 
THE WITNESS: I already said I don't know.  
 
BY MR. GARBUS: 
 
Q. Does the mere fact, let's assume it is a commercial channel which says I will donate 
the time, I will permit --  
 
MR. JOFFE: Let's call the judge, Mr. Garbus.  
 
MR. GARBUS: Surely. 
 
May I finish the question? 
 
BY MR. GARBUS: 
 
Q. I will give the city 50 percent local news, 25 percent national news, and 25 percent 
how to do it; is that appropriate?  
 
A. I don't know. 
 
MR. JOFFE: Are you going to insist on this line of questions?  
 
MR. GARBUS: I think we have an answer. Mr. Turner says he doesn't know; is that 
right?  
 
THE WITNESS: I've never given it any thought. I do not know enough about, I never 
read what the arrangements are on these city channels and whether they can be -- I just 
don't have enough knowledge really to be able to answer that question honestly or 
intelligently.  
 
BY MR. GOLDIN: 
 
Q. You don't have a judgment? 
 
A. A judgment? 
 
Q. Yes. 
 
A. Not really. 
 
Q. Thank you. 
 
Now let me go through some of the things you said.  
 
PEG, public, educational, governmental, are to some extent three separate structures, 
calendars, that clearly do apply?  
 
A. I really don't know. I hardly have ever watched these channels. I really don't know, 
except that I know that they are not supposed to be handed out as political favors to 
commercial operations that are on the take from from private enterprise.  
 
Q. Putting Mr. Murdoch aside, or other people like Mr. Murdoch who you believe fit that 
bill, you have no reason to believe that Bloomberg fit that bill?  
 
A Absolutely not. 
 
Q. Did you know in this particular case the way the Bloomberg application comes in is 
Bloomberg reads about it in the newspapers, calls the city and says can I go on? Did you 
know that is how it works?  
 
A. I didn't know how it happened. I was really interested to find out.  
 
Q. Let me see if we can help you. 
 
After Bloomberg hears about what is going on, a smart businessman -  
 
A. How long has Bloomberg News been available 24 hours?  
 
Q. I don't know. 
 
A. Okay. It has been several years, though?  
 
Q. Yes. I will try to get you the answer.  
 
A. It is interesting the mayor didn't care about putting you on.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: When I got up he was asking the questions. It seems to have reversed.  
 
MR. GARBUS: That is all right, Mr. Turner asks good questions. BY MR. GARBUS:  
 
Q. On October 7 Bloomberg offers a letter to Mr. Giuliani offering a news service. He 
testifies before the Department of Information, Technology and Telecommunications.  
 
Did you know any of those facts? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. In fact, do you see any impropriety in that process?  
 
MR. JOFFE: Come on, this is not proper questioning. I really will call the judge.  
 
I want the last several questions read back.  
 
MR. GARBUS: I will go ahead into a different pattern.  
 
THE WITNESS: Objection sustained or whatever.  
 
This is like Perry Mason, for God's sake. Like the OJ trial.  
 
BY MR. GARBUS: 
 
Q. You said before that news is broadly defined.  
 
Can you tell me what comes under your definition of what is news?  
 
A. Oh, I already said in earlier testimony what my definition of news, I don't think it 
makes a whole lot of difference.  
 
Q. It certainly does. You have been in business a long time.  
 
A. I looked it up in Webster's Dictionary years ago. It said news is information previously 
unknown.  
 
Q. That includes? 
 
A. Everything. 
 
Q. Thank you very much. 
 
That includes education? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Why not? 
 
A. I don't think -- I see a difference between educational and news programming. News 
programming is there to inform you, as I understand it. And educational programming is 
there to educate you.  
 
They are somewhat related. But they are-separate.  
 
Q. Tell me how they are related. 
 
A. Well, normally it is pretty hard to educate someone without them learning new 
information. But educational information is very different in my opinion, or often 
different, mostly different from news information.  
 
You can have sex information, you can say that was news, too, or sex education. They are 
related but they are different.  
 
Q. You call CNN a news channel? 
 
A. That is what we call it. I don't call it an educational channel.  
 
Q. Is there any educational material on CNN?  
 
A. Very little. By the broadest of definitions just finding out which plane went down 
yesterday as educational or watching the O.J. Simpson trial. You are being educated 
about the O.J. Simpson trial.  
 
Education to me is like mathematics, or learning how to be a plumber, or history, or 
language, something like that. What you get in school, college or trade school or law 
school. That is education.  
 
Q. How about current events? 
 
A. Current events, it depends. If it was a symposium of professors talking about 
archaeology, and you are studying archaeology, that would be education.  
 
If it is just information, news information, then it wouldn't be. In my opinion.  
 
Q. Now, how about local calendar, that is educational, telling people what is going on in 
New York?  
 
A. No. Not in my opinion, it is not. It is informational.  
 
Q. How about people, C-Span, let's say learning about what goes on in Congress?  
 
A. I don't think C-Span is educational. 
 
Q. How about let's say watching a presidential debate?  
 
A. I don't consider that educational. 
 
Q. Did you know the city channel in New York used to carry the OTB results?  
 
A. Carry what? 
 
Q. The Off Track Betting results. 
 
A. Well, I certainly wouldn't think that was educational.  
 
Q. Do you know if anybody ever objected to it?  
 
A. I don't know. So few people watch those channels, it is kind of -- but they do serve a 
purpose because I think it is good to have, you know, City Halls hearings and things like 
that.  
 
Or I guess even probably a local calendar doesn't hurt. But I am not an expert on how 
these channels are used. I've hardly ever seen them.  
 
I am not a cable TV operator. I am a programmer.  
 
There was no real reason for me to really get into it.  
 
BY MR. GARBUS: 
 
Q. Do you know of any operations in the country other than Bloomberg's that has the 
ability or facility to customize news the way it does; in other words, to take a news 
broadcast and make it very local the way it does?  
 
A. Well, every local television station in America does that.  
 
Q. Now, if you had a local news station that went out under the PEG channel to develop 
local news, wouldn't that be with New York 1 in New York which is the New York 
station on cable?  
 
A. It might. 
 
Q. You don't find the fact it is competitive, merely competitive with a cable station, a 
reason to knock it off PEG?  
 
MR. JOFFE: Object. Can you read back the question.  
 
(The pending question was read.) 
 
THE WITNESS: I had never thought about it.  
 
Like I said, I am not intimately familiar with what happens with these channels. BY  
 
MR. GARBUS: 
 
Q. So you don't believe a factor in whether you should knock something off PEG is 
because it may or may not be competitive with a, let's say something else that goes out on 
the cable?  
 
A. I don't know. 
 
Q. For example, let's assume it were the BBC that was going to be on PEG, to some 
extent that might compete with CNN. But you don't think that by itself means the BBC 
should be knocked off?  
 
A. I never heard of any PEG channels anywhere running portions of a commercial 
channel.  
 
Q. Let's assume that the BBC, if this is possible, ran 24-hour news with no ads.  
 
A. It does. 
 
Q. With no ads. 
 
A. I don't know whether it runs ads or not.  
 
Q. With no ads. 
 
Let's say it did 50 percent local news, 25 percent national news. It was to some extent 
competitive with CNN?  
 
A. They don't do it. 
 
Q. Let's assume they do that. 
 
A. I don't want to speculate. It is clear, it is in the agreement between the city and the 
cable systems of what these, what the agreements are.  
 
I haven't read them. I don't see any reason for me to.  
 
MR. JOFFE: You are really wasting the witness' time. You are trying to get him to testify 
about something about which he is not an expert.  
 
You are really asking for legal conclusions. Facts are what you can ask this witness 
about.  
 
THE WITNESS: That is what you have the judge here to decide.  
 
MR. GARBUS: That is great. Mr. Joffe is the judge.  
 
MR. JOFFE: We can get the judge. 
 
THE WITNESS: He is not, but the judge that will read this testimony.  
 
MR. JOFFE: We will have the judge here in a second, Mr. Garbus.  
 
BY MR. GARBUS: 
 
Q. Since about 1995, this is a question you asked before, Bloomberg has been providing 
local edition segments for inclusion on Turner's Headline News. They give you, as I 
understand it, twenty 6 minute reports seven days a week.  
 
Have you ever seen any of them? 
 
A. Sorry. They are not 26 minutes. 
 
Q. Plus 20, separate six minute reports to CNN. They have been doing that since May of 
1995; are you aware of that?  
 
A. I only -- the only place I was aware they were doing it was here in New York. I am 
unaware they do it anyplace else. That is the first I heard of it.  
 
Q. Have you ever seen any of those? 
 
A. I have seen the ones in New York a few times.  
 
Q. The six minutes you have seen in New York are predominantly local news?  
 
MR. JOFFE: Is that a question? 
 
Q. Based on what you have seen. 
 
Are they predominantly local news or are they national news as well?  
 
A. A little of both. 
 
Q. Do you know the percentage of local news and national news?  
 
A. No. 
 
Q. If you took that six minute segments -- and it does some City Council hearings. Have 
you ever seen that?  
 
A. No. How can you do a City Council hearing in six minutes?  
 
Q. You can do a sound bite of it. 
 
A. Oh, okay. 
 
Q. So you know that -- 
 
A. I didn't know that. I don't remember. I just watched it a few times.  
 
Q. But you have seen, on the times you watched, you have seen local news, some city 
administration stuff?  
 
A. Lots of stuff. It has horoscopes, scores. So much going on, to me it is pretty confusing. 
Maybe there are people that can absorb all that at one time.  
 
Q. Do you have any reason to believe if that particular segment was projected and 
expanded over 24 hours without advertising, whether or not that would comply with the 
PEG requirements?  
 
A. I don't think it would. 
 
Q. Why not? 
 
A. Because it is a news channel. It would be a news channel run by, not by the city but by 
an independent commercial operation that had an axe to grind.  
 
In your case, even if there were no commercials on it, basically Bloomberg makes most 
of its money selling its computer stock service, or investment service.  
 
I have a son-in-law who is an investment banker, and it costs a fortune every month. Just 
by having your name on all the time everybody knows, you would be getting a lot of 
benefit out of it whether it was running commercials or not. Basically promoting your 
base business.  
 
Q. So the objection would be then to having the Bloomberg name on the channel would 
be -  
 
A. Would be a commercial operation designed to promote what you are doing, whether 
you are running somebody else ad's or not. You are constantly promoting Bloomberg.  
 
You say you promote your radio station here and your satellite service in every newscast 
as part of the editorial. As part of the editorial.  
 
Mr. Bloomberg is a brilliant promoter. 
 
Q. Do you know that Bloomberg has stuff on national public radio which is similar in a 
way to the CNN stuff?  
 
A. I did not know that. 
 
Q. Do you know that he has stuff on public television?  
 
A. I did not know that either. 
 
Q. Did you know that both on radio and public television these are public service 
broadcasts which always have the name Bloomberg, either Bloomberg Reporter or 
Bloomberg Funds, did you know that?  
 
A. I did not know that. 
 
Q. You know on PBS you will have let's say an hour of TV funded by Mobil or 
somebody?  
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. You will also see a Mobil logo? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Do you think that makes it less public interest merely because the logo is there?  
 
A. Maybe not, but it does make it commercial, though. Because they are receiving money 
to help pay for the program.  
 
They are also receiving commercial considerations in their name being mentioned.  
 
Q. Who is receiving money for the program?  
 
A. Public broadcasting or the station that makes the program in return for using their 
name. Mobil presents Masterpiece Theatre or whatever it is.  
 
Q. You are not saying Mobil gets any money out of that?  
 
A. But they are getting promotional time which is the same thing.  
 
Q. Other than promotional time? 
 
A. Well, promotional time is a form of advertising.  
 
Q. So what you're saying then on the PEG channels, one of the objections you have is the 
mere use of the name?  
 
A. I don't -- look, I don't run any PEG channels. I never read an agreement between any 
PEG channels. I just have a general understanding of what is supposed to run on them.  
 
As I understand it, from a layman's standpoint, it is supposed to be noncommercial and 
primarily educational programming and local government activities.  
 
Q. You don't know whether either the statutes or contracts between the parties ever say 
that?  
 
A. No. 
 
MR. JOFFE: Of course he doesn't. Why are you wasting this witness's time?  
 
THE WITNESS: I said that. 
 
BY MR. GARBUS: 
 
Q. Thank you, Mr. Turner. 
 
Does the carrying of, let's say tabloid journalism, which you have attributed to Murdoch, 
is that a factor in whether a news program or any program on PEG would be appropriate 
or inappropriate for PEG?  
 
MR. JOFFE: Would you read that back. 
 
(The pending question was read.) 
 
THE WITNESS: First of all, 
 
Mr. Murdoch is not the only person, by any manner or means, that is involved in tabloid 
journalism. Although he is famous for it.  
 
But there are other people that do it as well. I would personally -- tabloid, you have 
tabloid journalists in newspapers. Tabloid newspapers.  
 
There were three tabloid television programs that -- they are all commercial programs. 
One was Inside Edition which has failed in the ratings, then canceled.  
 
You still have Inside Edition and one other one I think that is still out there. I can't 
remember the name of it. I never watch them.  
 
I think those commercial tabloid journalism programs would probably be just as improper 
for PEG channels as Mr. Murdoch's news service or Mr. Bloomberg's news service.  
 
BY MR. GARBUS: 
 
Q. Did you know Time Warner offered to the city to do a news channel for them on 
PEG?  
 
A. I did not know that. 
 
Q. Never heard of that until now? 
 
A. No. Never heard of it. 
 
Q. Surprise you? 
 
A. Nothing surprises me. 
 
Q. Do you know why you weren't told that before you came here to testify?  
 
A. I don't know. There is a lot of things I haven't been told.  
 
How long ago was it? 
 
Q. We will get into it. 
 
A. It doesn't matter. 
 
Q. If Bloomberg had taken off, in your judgment as chairman of the National Cable 
Television Association, its logo, would that by itself permit it to be considered for the 
PEG channel?  
 
MR. JOFFE: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. I have no idea.  
 
MR. JOFFE: These are legal questions. You're wasting his time, Mr. Garbus. I will send 
the transcript to the judge so she can see how you are spending your half hour. BY MR. 
GARBUS:  
 
Q. Did you know that Bloomberg had offered to do 75 percent of the material on the 24-
hour news to be purely local in nature?  
 
A. No, I didn't know. 
 
Q. At the time that this suit was filed did you have any idea what Bloomberg had shown 
on television? On the PEG channel?  
 
A. No. I didn't -- was he ever on the PEG channel?  
 
Q. As you sit here today, you didn't know he was on the PEG channel?  
 
A. I don't know. 
 
Q. As you sit here today, you have never seen, your lawyers have never shown you and 
you have never seen what he had put on the PEG channel?  
 
A. No. I didn't even know he was on it. 
 
How would I have seen it when I didn't even know it was on?  
 
Q. You have no idea what he has offered to put on the PEG channel?  
 
A. No. 
 
Q. For the 24 hours? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. So your sole objection, as I understand then, is that irrespective of what he shows, he 
should be knocked off merely because he is commercial?  
 
A. I haven't objected at all. 
 
Q. You have no objection then to -- 
 
A. I don't personally. I haven't even given it a thought.  
 
Q. Thank you. 
 
You have given it a thought with respect to Mr. Murdoch?  
 
A. Absolutely. 
 
Q. But you're open minded on Mr. Bloomberg?  
 
A. I am open minded on everything. 
 
Q. I know that. 
 
MR. GARBUS: Excuse me, can I have a minute.  
 
(Recess taken.) 
 
BY MR. GARBUS: 
 
Q. Mr. Turner, the city was asking you questions about conversations with Collins and 
Levin.  
 
Did Bloomberg ever come up in those conversations?  
 
A. I don't remember. 
 
Q. Now, do you know if at any time while they were talking to MSNBC and Fox they 
ever made any attempt to speak to Bloomberg about whether Bloomberg should be -  
 
A. Not to my knowledge. 
 
Q. Do you know if Bloomberg ever went to them and tried to get them themselves?  
 
A. No. 
 
Q. You were talking about local news. Would you agree what is appropriate in Scarsdale 
and Iowa is different than Manhattan?  
 
A. What? 
 
Q. When you talk about definition of local news on a PEG channel, that would be 
appropriate, the kind of information -  
 
THE WITNESS: I didn't say it was appropriate.  
 
MR. JOFFE: He never said it was appropriate.  
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember saying local news is appropriate.  
 
BY MR. GARBUS: 
 
Q. Let's say local information, calendars or hearing, depending on the locale, namely 
whether  
 
it be Iowa or Scarsdale or New York, you might have different mixes that were 
appropriate; is that right?  
 
A. Conceivably. I haven't given it any thought.  
 
Q. And that a place, let's say, that is the agricultural capital, Nebraska, might be different?  
 
A. Have the corn news, where it might just be corny here.  
 
Q. And in New York, which is the financial capital, it might have financial information.  
 
A. All right. I don't know what financial information would be doing on a PEG channel.  
 
You have CNBC, Bloomberg, you have the radio. You have people that are already doing 
the financial news. But, I don't know.  
 
Q. But you don't take the position merely because something is financial it shouldn't be 
on a PEG channel?  
 
A. No. 
 
Q. You don't take the position that issues about the economy or business shouldn't be on a 
PEG channel?  
 
A. I don't know. 
 
MR. JOFFE: This is totally inappropriate.  
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know whether it is inappropriate or not.  
 
MR. JOFFE: The questions are inappropriate. I am not saying the news is inappropriate.  
 
THE WITNESS: You must be getting paid by the word.  
 
MR. JOFFE: The questions are not the kind of discovery the judge had in mind. Of that, I 
am confident. BY MR. GARBUS:  
 
Q. Do you know anything about the contract between CNN, Headline News and 
Bloomberg?  
 
A. No. 
 
Q. You don't -- 
 
A. Anything? 
 
Q. Yes. 
 
Do you know what Bloomberg was required to provide to Headline News?  
 
A. No, no, I don't. 
 
Q. I suppose you know nothing about the length of the agreement or potential termination 
of the agreement?  
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Those business decisions or those content decisions are left elsewhere than in your 
hands?  
 
A. Right. 
 
MR. GARBUS: Thank you. 
 
MR. JOFFE: David, I continue to think that these questions about political contributions 
by Mr. Turner are inappropriate.  
 
But since you haven't wasted your time to the point that we are up against the deadline, 
what I will do is this: I will let you ask the questions. But I will maintain it is 
inappropriate to do so.  
 
I don't want to bother the judge. I reserve to complain to the judge this is an abuse.  
 
I don't want to have him called back. So I will lift my instruction.  
 
I really would urge you to consider whether this is an appropriate series of questions.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: That's fine. With that in mind, if the reporter can locate those questions.  
 
EXAMINATION CONTINUED 
 
BY MR. GOLDIN: 
 
Q. Very briefly, Mr. Turner, you testified earlier, I believe, that Turner Broadcasting 
through a PAC had made contributions to political candidates.  
 
I asked if it ever made contributions to any political candidates whose positions or actions 
were inimical to the interest of Turner Broadcasting.  
 
A. You mean against? 
 
Q. Yes. 
 
A. I use the words, but I don't know what they mean.  
 
Yes, we do it all the time. 
 
Q. What candidates would those be? 
 
A. Well, perfect example would be -- first of all, we pretty well contribute, to the best of 
my knowledge, to the best of my recollection, almost 50/50 between Republicans and 
Democrats.  
 
I personally strongly believe in campaign reform, because we almost are always giving to 
incumbents. It helps perpetuate the system. It really doesn't matter whether they are with 
us or against us.  
 
We are just giving in the hopes, in the vain hope because they are on the committees in 
the Congress that are important to us.  
 
But, like Ed Markey, the democrat from Massachusetts who was majority leader -- not 
majority leader but he was the head of the telecommunications subcommittee when the 
Democrats were in.  
 
He was one of the ones that helped to really set back the cable industry. We kept giving 
to him anyway by leading the charge on the cable regulations a few years ago.  
 
We have continued to try and have a good relationship with him because you never know 
what will come up next.  
 
Basically PAC money, you give it because you think it is going to do you some good 
down the line. But with a thousand bucks being the limit, you can't buy a whole lot of 
influence for that, fortunately.  
 
MR. GOLDIN: I have nothing further. 
 
MR. JOFFE: I have only one question, I think.  
 
EXAMINATION CONDUCTED 
 
BY MR. JOFFE: 
 
Q. Mr. Turner, do you consider yourself an expert on what is or is not PEG 
programming?  
 
A. I definitely am not an expert. I know virtually nothing about it.  
 
MR. JOFFE: No further questions. 
 
MR. GARBUS: I will ask a few questions. 
 
EXAMINATION CONTINUED 
 
BY MR. GARBUS: 
 
Q. How long have you been in the cable business?  
 
A. I haven't ever been in the cable business.  
 
Q. How long have you been in the TV business?  
 
A. Since 1970. 
 
Q. How long have you been involved with CNN?  
 
A. Since 1980. 
 
Q. Have you ever been involved in any way with C-Span?  
 
A. No. 
 
Q. You mentioned before you were chairman of an organization for nine months.  
 
Tell me something about that organization.  
 
A. It is the national organization that is made up of most of the cable operators. That is, 
you know, just like association of lawyers, you know, everybody has got one.  
 
You get around, they talk about problems, initial problems, they have a lobbying 
organization. Usually they are headquartered in Washington.  
 
NRA, that is for the gun owners. 
 
Q. Have you been involved with that organization before?  
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. How long? 
 
A. Long time. I have been a member of it for years. On the board for the last six or seven 
years. On the executive committee for the last few years.  
 
I am the first programmer ever to be chairman of that organization. It is kind of a 
milestone.  
 
Q. What kind of issues does that organization deal with?  
 
A. Mainly they are concerned about regulation. Adverse regulation. That is the biggest 
thing.  
 
Q. Concerned about the relationship between the cable business and federal, city and state 
governments?  
 
A. Yes. Also the image of cable. They try and come up with campaigns every now and 
then. Service guarantees to try to correct industry-wide problems or perceptions of 
problems.  
 
Q. Have they ever dealt with PEG issues, to your knowledge?  
 
A. They deal with just about everything at some point or another. During my 
administration and my time that hasn't been a big issue to the best of my recollection.  
 
Q. Other than this particular organization, have you been involved in your lifetime with 
any other organizations dealing with cable business, media business, television business?  
 
A. I was a member years ago of the Independent Television Station Association. I was 
one of the founding members of that.  
 
Q. What does that do? 
 
A. They looked after independent television stations. Which had a different agenda from 
the broadcast affiliated stations.  
 
It has pretty well gone by the wayside now, because just about most television stations 
now have a network affiliation. That was before there was a Fox Network or Warner 
Bros. or UPN Networks.  
 
Q. How long were you part of that? 
 
A. Four or five years. I don't think I am still members of it because I haven't been to the 
meetings in years.  
 
Q. With respect to this National Cable organization that you mentioned --  
 
A. I am a member of Ducks Unlimited. 
 
They are trying to save the ducks, you know.  
 
Q. Have they ever discussed PEG channels?  
 
A.   No. 
 
Q. Okay. 
 
Now with respect to the National Cable, that is all the cable operators throughout the 
United States?  
 
A. Not all. There is a few renegades that won't pay their share of the dues. But it is the 
vast majority.  
 
Q. About 95 percent? 
 
A. More or less. 
 
Q. Who else besides you is a member of this?  
 
A. Oh, almost all the cable operators. 95 percent of the industry. Most of the 
programmers, too. Like ESPN and Discovery Channel.  
 
Q. Have you ever given any speeches on cable?  
 
A. Sure. 
 
Q. Where have you given those speeches? 
 
A. All over. Media in general. I make a lot of speeches.  
 
Q. You are considered an expert in this area?  
 
A. What area? 
 
MR. JOFFE: What area? 
 
MR. GARBUS: The area of cable. 
 
THE WITNESS: Not on PEG channels. I never made a speech on them. I don't think I 
ever even mentioned them.  
 
BY MR. GARBUS: 
 
Q. Had you heard of them before this lawsuit?  
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. When did you first hear of it? 
 
A. I don't know. 
 
Q. Five years ago? 
 
A. Before that. We have complained bitterly a lot of times, it takes up a lot of channel 
space that could be better utilized because, you know, some of them, depends on the city 
government. Some cities keep the potholes filled in the roads. Some do a better job than 
others of operating the PEG channels. It is up to the individual management.  
 
The word I have heard, they are kind of underutilized in a lot of instances. I guess that is 
basically what the city in New York said. They can give them away to two commercial 
voices and cut back and nobody could care less.  
 
Q. You have felt that the cable operator should be taking over those PEG operators -  
 
A. If they are being properly utilized and-providing a service to the people in the city.  
 
Cable is a lot of different things to a lot of different people --  
 
MR. JOFFE: But if they are not -this is not a proper question.  
 
This certainly does not arise out of my one question on cross.  
 
THE WITNESS: I can handle this. 
 
MR. JOFFE: You sure can. You are hitting him out of the park. I want you to get out of 
here.  
 
THE WITNESS: I am running a bit ahead, actually. BY MR. GARBUS:  
 
Q. To the extent, Mr. Turner - 
 
MR. JOFFE: So much for counsel influencing the witness.  
 
THE WITNESS: Come on, let the man ask the question.  
 
BY MR. GARBUS: 
 
Q. To the extent the PEG channels are underutilized, you feel the cable operators such as 
yourself should take them over?  
 
A. I am not a cable operator. 
 
I do not think so, because that is part of the franchise agreement. Those channels belong 
to the city government and just because they are not being utilized intelligently now, who 
knows, maybe the next administration will do a better job of operating them. If there is 
another administration.  
 
Q. You think people like Time Warner who own the cable channels should have some say 
in how those channels are being utilized?  
 
A. Clearly. Just like if you own a television station you ought to have a lot of say what 
goes on it.  
 
Cable is the same thing. There is a lot of competition to the cable. Satellite.  
 
Mr. Bloomberg is promoting it on cable every half hour.  
 
MR. JOFFE: I really am going to send this transcript to the judge. I am going to show her 
this.  
 
THE WITNESS: The judge doesn't care. You sit back. He is running out of steam.  
 
MR. JOFFE: You underestimate Mr. Garbus.  
 
THE WITNESS: No. He has done his business.  
 
MR. JOFFE: You consider it a challenge to get him to the point of exhaustion.  
 
THE WITNESS: He is just about finished. 
 
He is going to get a few tickets while they are still available. You better hurry.  
 
BY MR. GARBUS: 
 
Q. Just so we clear up the last question and answer.  
 
A. All right. 
 
Q. This is the last question and answer, I promise you, unless I get tickets. In which case I 
withdraw the last question.  
 
You believe that you and Time Warner 
 
have a right to say what should be on the PEG channels?  
 
A. No. Absolutely not. 
 
MR. GARBUS: Thank you. 
 
MR. JOFFE: Thank you all.

<P>Three days after a Florida trial court judge signed this order in
which she concluded that DuPont Co. had acted in bad faith, abused
the judicial process and "purposefully set upon a course of conduct
that has served as a complete denial of plaintiffs' right to have its day
in court," DuPont settled 20 Florida cases against it in which growers
claimed the company's fungicide Benlate caused crop damage. The
judge's August 5 order struck DuPont's answer and entered a default
judgment. As part of the settlement agreement, the parties' lawyers
asked the judge to vacate the August 5 written order and to seal it.
She agreed.

IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE ELEVENTH JUDICIAL
CIRCUIT IN AND FOR DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA GENERAL
JURISDICTION DIVISION

CASE NO. 92-20006 (CA 23)

DAVIS TREE FARMS, INC., a
Florida Corporation; DAVIS
TREE FARMS NORTH, INC., a
Florida Corporation;

Plaintiffs,

vs.

E.I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS & COMPANY,
INC., a Delaware Corporation;
HELENA CHEMICAL COMPANY, a Florida
corporation; MAXWELL FERTILIZER AND
FARM SUPPLIES, INC., a Florida
corporation; ASGROW FLORIDA
COMPANY, a Florida corporation;
and CRAWFORD & COMPANY, a Georgia corporation;

Defendants.

ORDER ON PLAINTIFFS' MOTION TO STRIKE DEFENDANT
DUPONT'S PLEADING

THIS CAUSE came before the Court on June 21, 1996 on Plaintiffs'
Motion to Strike Defendant DuPont's Pleadings and Enter Default
Judgment. The Court has considered the motion, the record, and the
arguments of counsel. It is hereby, ORDERED AND ADJUDGED as
follows;

1. The allegations that came before this Court on June 21, 1996, are
that DuPont conducted a test in Costa Rica with Benlate 50 DF and
ornamental plants in September, 1992. When the results of the test
were unfavorable to DuPont, DuPont scientist ordered the plants to
be destroyed, and then sought to conceal the nature of the test from
Plaintiffs in this and other Benlate litigation.

2. These allegations are of a particularly serious nature because if
true, they show that DuPont and its counsel have engaged in a
deliberate pattern of discovery abuse and fraud before this Court.

I. FINDINGS OF FACT

DuPont's Willful Refusal to Comply with Court Orders

3. Plaintiffs learned of possible tests in Costa Rica in early 1996 and
propounded interrogatories and requests for production designed to
elicit information about the event.

4. Defendant responded to the interrogatories by giving unintelligible
responses to production requests, agreeing to produce documents but
never producing them, and claiming that the requested documents
were privileged.

5. On April 23, 1996, this Court held a hearing on Plaintiff's request
to produce documents related to the Costa Rican tests. At the hearing,
the Court ordered DuPont to produce certain requested documents to
the Plaintiffs, and to produce all documents over which DuPont
claimed a privilege, for in camera inspection.

6. DuPont has repeatedly stated in depositions, filings, and in open
court that it has waived work product privilege "in limited areas" with
respect to the Monte Vista test site in Costa Rica. Examples of this
stated waiver are as follows:

Mr. McGregor: Your Honor, we basically waived work product, and
if we can get the issue of they claim this supposed field trial took
place at the Monte Vista site and that is all transpired under this
agreement with Welker that he showed to you and a confidentiality
agreement with Cefalo and involves Mr. Vargas with respect to the
Monte Vista site where this alleged field trial took place, then isn't
that the issue that we're dealing with so they can look at it?

(Transcript of April 23, 1996 hearing, at 36-37).

The Court: It is opinion as opposed to fact. Therefore, if you put in
memos facts such as we are going to conduct a field test, that is a
fact. Or we have conducted a field test, that is a fact versus and
opinion, is it not?

Mr. McGregor: That work product, I believe, has been waived with
respect to Monte Vista. (Transcript of June 21, 1996 hearing, at 20).

7. Despite acknowledging that DuPont waived work product
privilege with regard to Monte Vista, and despite this Court's April
23, 1996 order, DuPont failed to produce the requested documents.
Among the documents DuPont was required to produce, but did not,
were expense records of DuPont employees' trips to Costa Rica. In
addition to an agreement with the Plaintiffs re: Additional time to
comply with the order, DuPont filed two motions for extensions of
time to produce the documents. Over Plaintiff's objections, this court
granted DuPont's motion on May 31, 1996 and June 11, 1996.

8. On June 17, 1996, Plaintiffs filed a motion for an emergency
hearing because DuPont still had not produced documents which
plaintiffs needed to prepare for a deposition scheduled to take place
the next day, and because a hearing on Plaintiff's Motion to Strike
and Sanctions was scheduled for June 21, 1996. This Court had
already continued and reset the hearing to accommodate Defendant's
discovery production problems.

9. At the June 17, 1996 emergency hearing which was attended by
all counsel telephonically, this Court entered an order requiring
DuPont to produce all for the non-privileged documents requested by
Plaintiffs within 24 hours, or be subject to a fine of $10,000 for each
day DuPont delayed production. After 2 days, if DuPont had not
produced the documents, this Court stated that it would strike
DuPont's pleading without further hearing.

10. This Court issued such an order because it was apparent that
DuPont had intentionally delayed the production for documents for
which it had offered no legitimate claim of privilege.

11. Plaintiffs received some of the requested documents from
Defendant in the morning of June 18, 1996. At 4:30 that day,
Plaintiffs were notified that additional documents responsive to the
Court's order were available for Plaintiffs to pick up at Defense
counsel's office.

12. Plaintiffs received more documents on Wednesday, June 19th
and even as late as 3:15 p.m. on June 20, 1996.

13. This Court was clear in its order of June 17, 1996 concerning
production of documents. Additionally, when this court stated that
Defendant was to produce the documents, it was clear that the
documents were to be delivered to Plaintiffs, not simply made
available for Plaintiffs to pick up.

14. At the June 21, 1996 hearing on Plaintiffs' Motion to Strike
Defendant's Pleadings, Plaintiffs informed the Court that DuPont had
failed to fully comply with the June 17,1 996 order. Plaintiffs
presented a cover letter dated June 20, 1996, from DuPont producing
relevant discovery. This denotes a blatant disregard for the Court's
order to produce all documents within 24 hours.

15. Additionally, at the June 21, 1996 hearing, Plaintiffs provided
the Court with some of the documents DuPont had produced in
partial compliance with the order.

16. The documents provided by Defendant DuPont were such poor
copies that they were completely illegible. Plaintiffs' counsel
informed the court that when he contacted DuPont's counsel about
the legibility of the documents, DuPont's counsel informed him that
Plaintiffs' counsel could obtain better copies by going to Delaware
and requesting them at the Benlate document depository.

17. DuPont has produced these same documents in camera for this
court to examine. This court examined the quality of the copies
produced in camera and found them to be perfectly legible and of
good quality.

18. This production of illegible copies to the Plaintiffs further shows
a blatant disregard of the June 17, 1996 order as well as the spirit of
the discovery process.

19. DuPont's counsel offered no explanation or contradiction to
Plaintiffs' assertion of DuPont's failure to comply with the June 17,
1996 order.

20. Accordingly, this court finds that DuPont willfully failed to
comply with its April 23, 1996, and June 17, 1996 orders. DuPont
shall pay the fine of $20,000.


Testing at the Monte Vista Site

21. At the June 21, 1996 hearing, Plaintiffs presented the testimony
of Richard Cefalo, R.P. Welker, and Leon Vargas in support of their
allegations that DuPont had conducted a field test involving Benlate.

22. The testimony of the three witnesses corroborated one another's
account of the events which took place in Costa Rica in September,
1992.

23. DuPont offered the testimony of Dr. Timothy Obrigawitch and
Gerald Stephenson to rebut the testimony of Cefalo and Vargas. Dr.
Obrigawitch is a scientist for DuPont and has testified in many of
their Benlate trials. He was lead scientist for DuPont's Florida field
trials. Mr. Stephenson is a salesman for DuPont who has been
instrumental in investigating many growers' claims against Benlate.

24. These witnesses testified that they obtained the Monte Vista site
simply to root some cuttings to bring into the United States at a later
date, and did not conduct any tests. These witnesses denied many of
the facts Cefalo and Vargas asserted about the project.

25. DuPont's story concerning Monte Vista has changed several
times throughout this litigation.

26. Mr. Stephenson and Dr. Obrigawitch gave several versions as to
why they went to Costa Rica originally.

27. Neither Mr. Stephenson or Dr. Obrigawitch could specifically
remember which of them requested the specific set up of the Monte
Vista site. Neither of them could remember who specifically came up
with the idea to root the cuttings.

28. In addition, Mr. Stephenson testified that he had falsified
expense reports to DuPont. One meal he listed on his expense report,
one he stated he had eaten with Mr. Cefalo and Mr. Vargas, was
simply to recover money had had paid Mr. Cefalo for supplies while
in Costa Rica in September 1992.

29. This Court finds that such testimony indicates Mr. Stephenson's
unreliability as a truthful witness.

30. This court finds that the testimony of DuPont's witnesses Gerald
Stephenson and Timothy Obrigawitch is unreliable.

31. Every witness for both Plaintiff and Defendant testified as to the
presence of Leon Vargas at the Costa Rica site.

32. Mr. Vargas is a Costa Rican national with no interest in the
outcome of the litigation.

33. The testimony presented by the witnesses in this case conflicts.
This Court, having read the depositions of all witnesses filed in this
case, finds that the testimony of Leon Vargas is persuasive, and
represents the most accurate account of what occurred at the Monte
Vista site in Costa Rica in 1992.

34. While the Court does not believe that memory is perfect after a
span of four years, the documents Mr. Vargas produced at his
deposition indicate that he understood the events at Monte Vista to be
a research project involving Benlate, and that DuPont did not take
any steps to dissuade him of that belief.

35. Leon Vargas' testimony, in conjunction with Cefalo's testimony
and the documents produced in this case, indicate that DuPont
contracted with R.P. Welker Plants to do research on Benlate in
Costa Rica at the Monte Vista site.

36. These documents give further evidence that testifying was in fact
performed.

37. Leon Vargas' invoice to DuPont for payment of services stated
his activities as setting up an experiment in Monte Vista, and asked
for fees for consultation regarding the effects of Benlate in
ornamental plants.

38. The Welker Services Agreement specifically refers to a research
project: "WHEREAS, DUPONT is desirous of conducting
confidential research concerning the use and effects of its fungicide
Benlate 50 DF;..."

39. DuPont employee Erik Seay's travel and expense report states the
reason for travel to Costa Rica in September, 1992 was "Benlate field
test."

40. This Court is persuaded by evidence presented at the June 21,
1996 hearing that testing occurred at the Monte Vista site in Costa
Rica in the fall of 1992.

41. This Court finds that the documentary evidence taken in
conjunction with the testimony of the witnesses indicates that there
was a research project in Costa Rica involving different
concentrations of Benlate 50 DF.

42. This Court finds that DuPont conducted an experiment or test,
albeit not strictly adhering to scientific protocol, involving the effect
of Benlate 50 DF on plants in Costa Rica in September, 1992.

43. This Court finds that DuPont destroyed plants treated with
Benlate 50 DF when they turned black and began to die.

44. This Court finds that DuPont then sought to conceal information
about the Monte Vista Site from Plaintiffs.


Statements to the Court

45. DuPont's defense hinges on semantic tricks which flout the
Court's authority. DuPont's perception appears to be that if Plaintiffs
and the Court do not mention the correct "buzzwords," then DuPont
is free to deny any allegation it chooses.

46. At the June 21, 1996 hearing, DuPont supplied the Court with a
child's version of Webster's dictionary definitions of "test" and
"trial" to support its argument than it did not conduct a test or trial in
Costa Rica.

47. DuPont's actions demean this Court authority. By asking it to
adhere to dictionary definitions rather than examine the
overwhelming evidence that an experiment did in fact take place,
DuPont asks this Court to ignore the judicial process. This court does
not need a dictionary in this case to guide its ruling; the evidence
speaks for itself.

48. When questioned directly by the court on the nature of DuPont's
actions at Monte Vista, in order to maintain its untenable position,
Defense counsel addressed only those words Plaintiffs referred to in
their requests for production.

The Court: Let me see if I understand this. Are you saying to me that
because it wasn't rigorous, or because it wasn't a textbook field trial
that it didn't take place, or are you saying to me we can't use these
terms and, if they did something, it wasn't really a field trial even if
they used Benlate?

Mr. McGregor: What I'm saying to you, You Honor, is that in
response to the interrogatory that was asked, we said there were no
tests, no trials, no investigations, no analyses. Our answer was
truthful. Our answer was truthful in terms of as they've defined it as,
the very beginning of their motion, Costa Rican Benlate field trials,
field trials, which I will get to, You Honor, I promise you. Field
trials, the Florida field trials, the Hawaiian field trials have a
definition, and that definition isn't a test or trial, isn't too different
than the one we learned as kids, which says you go through a
process and you get some results. This was--

The Court: I don't think you've answered my question.

Mr. McGregor: I'll try again, You Honor.

The Court: My question is very simple, sir. If they went there and if
what Mr. Vargas says is true, they did buy the Benlate, they did
bring the Benlate and they did dip the plants in Benlate and they
didn't use any kind of a control and the plants died and they threw
then away, that would not be a test of any kind in your mind and you
would be confident that you could say that to a court of law without
lying?

Mr. McGregor: *That's correct, Your Honor, under the facts, under
the facts in this case, that is correct.* They were rooting cuttings in
Costa Rica. They were not doing any types of test of Benlate. The
were not doing any type of field trial of Benlate.

The Court: But did you hear what I said? Even if they dipped them in
solutions of Benlate; now did you hear me say that?

Mr. McGregor: I did hear you say that, Your Honor. I heard you say
that.

The Court: I want to make sure I understand you and you understood
me.

Mr. McGregor: Okay.

(Transcript of June 21, 1996 hearing, at 100-101) (emphasis added).

49. DuPont counsel's blatant defiance of this Court's authority in
refusing to depart from such semantical game playing is deliberately
evasive and totally inexcusable. The Third District Court of Appeal
has faced this situation as well, and has responded aptly:

"By contrast, the tortfeasor in the present case had coverage that was
lower than [the plaintiff's] limits. Although Hartford's argument
engages in the Alice-in-Wonderland practice of departing from the
usual meaning of words, it does not take a leap through the looking-
glass for this Court to conclude that the tortfeasor who injured
[plaintiff] was 'uninsured' to the extent those injuries exceeded the
policy limits. See Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass, (1872)
('When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean - neither
more nor less.')"

Hartford Insurance Co. v. Minagorri, 675 So. 2d 142, 143-44 (Fla.
3d DCA 1996).

50. Defendant's refusal to acknowledge that the work in Costa Rica
in September 1992 constituted an experiment, simply because
Plaintiffs did not use the right works in their requests, demonstrates
bad faith and contemptuous behavior on the part of DuPont and its
attorneys in discovery. DuPont is unilaterally deciding the evidence
by determining that words only mean what it chooses them to mean,
"neither more nor less." Hartford Insurance Co. v. Minagorri, 675
So. 2d at 144.

51. This court finds that DuPont engaged in willful and malicious
behavior with respect to discovery concerning the research project in
Costa Rica in September, 1992.

52 DuPont's argument, that the Motion to Strike simply hinged on
one response to one request for production out of roughly 500, again
demonstrates to this Court DuPont's utter disregard for the rules of
discovery and ethical conduct. If DuPont has misled this Court and
Plaintiffs and lied about the nature of their actions in Costa Rica, it is
irrelevant if it is one interrogatory or one hundred; the result is the
same.

53. This Court finds that DuPont intentionally withheld this crucial
information, and denied its existence in an effort to prevent the
disclosure to the Plaintiffs and this Court of its action in Costa Rica
concerning Benlate 50 DR.

Destruction of Evidence

54. The plants at Monte Vista were destroyed sometime after the test
was performed. Plaintiffs were unable to gather information on these
plants.

55. Plaintiffs argue that they have been irreparably prejudiced
because DuPont destroyed all evidenced from Monte Vista.

56. Dr. Timothy Obrigawitch ordered Mr. Cefalo to "dump" the
plants when Cefalo told him of their deteriorated condition.

57. Mr. Cefalo then told Leon Vargas to "dump the plants." Soon
after, Cefalo faxed Vargas, asking him to hold the plants and takes
pictures of them. Mr. Vargas did not save the plants.

58. DuPont argues that Mr. Cefalo's urgent fax requesting that
Vargas not dump the plants shows that DuPont did not have control
over the destruction of the evidence. Mr. McGregor: "... if they felt
that there was something wrong with those plants, Your Honor, they
wouldn't have dumped them. So who had control over that when
you talk about destroying evidence?" (Transcript of June 21, 1996
hearing at 115).

59. Again DuPont engages in the narrowest of semantic distinctions.
It submits to this Court that although it was a DuPont run project,
although Vargas was paid by DuPont, and although Dr. Obrigawitch
had ordered Cefalo and Vargas to "dump" the plants, because Cefalo
faxes an urgent message to Vargas asking him not to dump the
plants, DuPont did not have control over the evidence.

60. With such legal gymnastics, DuPont again demonstrates its
inability to be truthful to this Court, and seems to forget the entire
body of law on agency.

61. DuPont has made claims in defending other litigation and before
this Court that the results of the field tests exonerate Benlate 50 DF as
the cause of crop damage.

62. Plaintiffs will have no opportunity to rebut or question the results
of the Florida field trials by examining and utilizing the results from
Monte Vista.

63. It is clear that DuPont has destroyed the evidence from the
"Monte Vista research project." Plaintiffs will never have an
opportunity to examine the plants, the medium, or the protocol.

64. DuPont argues that since there is no trial date set in this case,
Plaintiff are not irreparably harmed. Again DuPont asks this Court to
ignore the magnitude of its actions. Simply because there is no trial
date set does not mean that DuPont can attempt to conceal such
evidence by destroying it and willfully disobeying the orders of this
Court.

65. This court finds that DuPont's destruction of evidence and
refusal to comply with discovery requests to prove same, irreparably
harmed the Plaintiffs in this matter, and demonstrates their complete
disregard for the canons of ethics and the rules of discovery.


Leon Vargas Work Product Claim

66. DuPont has repeatedly sought to prevent Plaintiffs from
obtaining information about its activities at Monte Vista.

67. In furtherance of this, it has delayed discovery, filing motions for
protective order to prevent Plaintiffs from taking Leon Vargas'
deposition, and then, a motion for return of Vargas work product and
seeking sanctions against Plaintiffs' counsel.

68. DuPont did not assert a privilege over the testimony of Leon
Vargas until after counsel had spoken with him before his deposition,
and discussed his possible testimony. DuPont did not assert that Mr.
Vargas was a non-testifying consultant until after counsel spoke to
him about his testimony.

69. Over Defendant's protests, the Special Master in this action,
allowed Mr. Vargas' deposition to proceed.

70. During his deposition, Mr. Vargas testified that DuPont's
counsel in another action has informed him that since he was a Costa
Rican national, he could not be subpoenaed to testify in Florida, and
didn't "really have to" give testimony.

71. At his deposition, Vargas clearly stated that he had not done any
consulting for DuPont after his confidentiality agreement was signed.
He also stated that he had never discussed trial strategies with
DuPont.

72. This Court sees Defendant's motion concerning Vargas work
product and its previous motion for protective order to be simply
more examples of Defendant's tactics to prevent a full and fair
exposure of the events at Monte Vista.


Chemdesign and Kirschner

73. DuPont has attempted to thwart discovery in other areas of this
litigation as demonstrated by its actions with respect to the
depositions of Chemdesign Corporation and Theodore Kirschner.
This Court has already sanctioned DuPont for its misconduct in this
respect. However, this simply further proves the wilful pattern and
practice DuPont has engaged in heretofore.


Ethical Considerations

74. Attorneys are bound by the Florida Rules of Professional
Conduct. They have a duty of candor to the judicial tribunal. See
comment to Rule 4-3.3, Florida Rules of Professional Conduct,
1996).

75. However, Rule 4-3.4 is particularly apt in describing DuPont's
counsel's conduct in these proceedings:

A lawyer shall not: (a) unlawfully obstruct another party's access to
evidence or otherwise unlawfully alter, destroy, or conceal a
document or other material that the lawyer knows or reasonably
should know is relevant to a pending or a reasonably foreseeable
proceeding; nor counsel or assist another person to do any such act.
(Rule 4-3.4, Florida Rules of Professional Conduct, 1996).

76. This Court finds that DuPont's counsel violated the letter of these
rules in their conduct before this tribunal.


II. Conclusions of Law

The reasonableness of a sanction depends in part upon the
willfulness or bad faith of the party. The accidental or negligent
destruction of evidence often justifies lesser sanctions directed
toward compensating the victims of evidence destruction. The
intentional destruction or alteration of evidence undermines the
integrity of the judicial process and, accordingly, may warrant
imposition of the most severe sanction of dismissal of a claim or
defense, the striking of pleadings, or entry of a default. Trammel v.
Bass, 672 So. 2d 78, 84 (Fla. 1st DCA 1996) (citations omitted).

77. "Thus, in the case of the intentional alteration of evidence, the
most severe sanctions are warranted as much for their deterrent effect
on others as for the chastisement of the wrongdoing litigant."
Trammel at 84 (citations omitted).

78. In this instance the court is in the unique position of sanctioning a
litigant which has been severely sanctioned in other courts,
seemingly to no avail. By striking DuPont's pleadings, this court
hopes that this will have a deterrent effect, not only on other litigants,
but on DuPont's actions in other cases in the future.

79. "A drastic sanction that denies the availability of the court's
processes is therefore appropriate to one 'who defiles the judicial
system by committing a fraud on the court.'" Trammel at 84 quoting
Aoudad v. Mobil Oil Corporation, 892 F. 2d 1115, 1118 (1st Cir.
1989).

80. Courts have also upheld the sanction of striking the pleadings
when litigants have "engaged in bad faith 'games playing' with the
court and opposing counsel in delaying and thwarting the orderly
process of discovery." HZJ, Inc. v. Wysocki, 511 So. 2d 1088,
1089 (Fla. 3d DCA 1987).

81. This Court finds that DuPont's conduct constitutes abusive
litigation practices and specifically finds that such practices were
done in bad faith.

82. This Court concludes that DuPont's conduct as set forth in the
Findings of Fact herein demonstrates that DuPont engaged in
intentional misconduct which abused the judicial process.

83. This Court determines that DuPont has engaged in a systematic
design to thwart discovery. This Court further finds that DuPont's
conduct in this regard is so atrocious that it shocks the conscience of
this Court. DuPont has destroyed evidence; it has delayed discovery;
mislabeled documents at its document depository to thwart discovery;
and it has produced totally illegible discovery. DuPont has
purposefully set upon a course of conduct that has served as a
complete denial of Plaintiffs' right to have its day in court. This
Court has no choice but to strike DuPont's pleadings and enter a
default judgment.

84. This Court hopes and believes that imposing this fine and
striking the pleadings will impress upon DuPont and its counsel the
importance of proceeding under the rules of civil procedure and
canons of ethics.

85. These sanctions are limited solely to those items outlined above,
and in no way reflect on DuPont or its counsel's further involvement
in this case and the discovery process.

DONE AND ORDERED in Miami, Dade County, Florida this 5th
day of August, 1996, nunc pro tunc as of June 21, 1996.

<P>A disappointed TV viewer sued Pepsico for failure to provide the
Harrier jet he thought he had won in the soft drink company's "Pepsi
Stuff" ad campaign. The TV commercials in the campaign featured
various apparel and leisure items that could be obtained in exchange
for Pepsi Points. Pepsi Points were obtained through purchasing
Pepsi products, or, if you read the fine print, could be purchased for
ten cents each. The close of one commercial showed a teenager
arriving at school in a Harrier Jet with a Pepsi logo on it and offered
the jet for 7,000,000 Pepsi Points. Leonard accumulated 15 actual
Pepsi Points and submitted them with a check for $700,008.50 to
purchase the balance of Pepsi Points he needed for the Harrier Jet
(and $10.00 for shipping and handling as per the contest rules). But,
he received no Harrier Jet. He resubmitted his Pepsi Stuff order
twice more. Still no jet. Leonard now has turned to the courts to
redress the damages he will continue to suffer until his jet is
delivered. His suits alleges specific performance, breach of contract,
fraud, deceptive and unfair trade practices, and, finally, misleading
advertising against the Purchase, N.Y. soft drink company. Pepsi
reportedly filed a suit in New York to block Leonard's suit on the
grounds that it is frivolous.

IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE ELEVENTH JUDICIAL
CIRCUIT, IN AND FOR DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA

GENERAL JURISDICTION DIVISION

CASE NO: 96-15647

JOHN D.R. LEONARD,
Plaintiff

vs.

PEPSICO, INC.,
Defendant


COMPLAINT

Plaintiff, JOHN D.R. LEONARD, sues Defendant, PEPSICO, INC.
and alleges as follows:

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1. This is an action for damages in excess of $15,000.00 exclusive
of interest, costs and attorney's fees.

2. Plaintiff, JOHN D.R. LEONARD ("LEONARD"), is a resident of
Seattle, Washington, and is otherwise sui juris.

3. Defendant, PEPSICO, INC. ("PEPSI"), is a North Carolina
corporation with its principal place of business in Purchase, New
York at Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, New York, 10577, and is
doing business in the state of Florida.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. PEPSI is a corporation primarily engaged in the business of
producing and distributing soft drinks world wide. To promote the
sale of its products here in the United States, PEPSI launched a
national advertising campaign utilizing various forms of media, the
most significant of which is the use of television commercials.

5. Specifically, this national advertising campaign, coined, "Pepsi
Stuff," consists of offering various merchandise, for sale, to the
general public in exchange for Pepsi Points. Pepsi Points are actually
a promotional item, much like phoney money, which entitle a
participant to receive prizes based upon the amount of points
assigned to a particular prize. Each prize offered in the Pepsi Stuff
campaign can be obtained by a participant simply by tendering his/her
Pepsi Points to PEPSI.

6. Pepsi Points can be acquired in two ways. One method is to
purchase specifically marked packages of PEPSI products from
vendors throughout the country who sell PEPSI products. The
second method is to purchase points directly from PEPSI, via an
order form, for 10 cents per point. There is no limit to the amount of
points one is allowed to purchase.

7. The most notable of the Pepsi Stuff television commercials feature
a new Harrier Jet, among as assortment of other prizes, which are
offered to the general public. As part of the television commercial,
PEPSI conspicuously displayed the amount of Pepsi Points needed
to obtain a particular prize. PEPSI offered the new Harrier Jet in the
television commercial for seven (7) million Pepsi Points.

8. LEONARD first noticed the Pepsi Stuff television commercials
offering the new Harrier Jet in Seattle, Washington, which
commercial was also broadcast in the state of Florida. This television
commercial actually depicts an individual flying to school in his new
Harrier Jet and then offers the jet as one of the Pepsi Stuff prizes.

9. LEONARD, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the
Pepsi Stuff promotional campaign, accepted PEPSI's offer of the
new Harrier Jet, by obtaining 15 original Pepsi Points and then
purchasing the remaining Pepsi Points at $.10 a point for 6,999,985
points, for the total sum of $699,998.50.

10. On March 28, 1996, LEONARD duly tendered the seven (7)
million Pepsi Points to PEPSI in exchange for the new Harrier Jet by
delivering to PEPSI (1) an original Pepsi Stuff order form, (2) 15
original Pepsi Points, and (3) a check in the amount of $700,008.50
(for the remaining 6,999,985 points, plus shipping and handling), all
in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Pepsi Stuff
promotion. A true and correct copy of those items are attached hereto
as Composite Exhibit "A."

11. Surprisingly, on May 7, 1996, PEPSI, by and through its
employees and/or agents, Young America Corporation, failed and
refused to process the items contained in Composite Exhibit "A"
tendered by LEONARD, and more importantly failed and refused to
provide the new Harrier Jet to LEONARD.

12. On May 14, 1996, LEONARD resubmitted  the original 15 Pepsi
Points, the original order form and check for $700,008.50
(Composite Exhibit "A"), to PEPSI's Agent, Young America, which
was refused a second time.

13. On May 24, 1996, LEONARD resubmitted the entire package
(Composite Exhibit "A") to Pepsi's New York headquarters. PEPSI
refused to process the order as well.

14. To date, despite LEONARD'S reliance on PEPSI'S nationally
televised offer of a new Harrier Jet, in exchange for seven (7) million
Pepsi Points, PEPSI has failed and refused to deliver this prize,
thereby breaching its own offer to the detriment of LEONARD.

15. All conditions precedent to this action have been performed,
excused or waived.

16. LEONARD has retained the undersigned law firm for the
purposes of maintaining this suit and is obligated to pay it a
reasonable fee.

COUNT I
[Specific Performances]

17. Plaintiff hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through
16 as if fully set forth herein.

18. PEPSI, by and through its national advertising campaign, known
as Pepsi Stuff, offered a new Harrier Jet for sale to the general public
under certain conditions precedent, namely the tender of seven (7)
million Pepsi Points, as more particularly described above.

19. On March 28, 1996, LEONARD, in accordance with the rules
and regulations of the Pepsi Stuff promotion, accepted the offer, met
all of the above conditions precedent (which included providing the
advertised consideration to PEPSI for the new Harrier Jet) and a
binding contract was formed.

20. LEONARD is ready, willing and able to take possession of the
new Harrier Jet, however, PEPSI has failed and refused to fulfill its
contractual obligations to LEONARD by not delivering the new
Harrier Jet in exchange for seven (7) million Pepsi Points tendered
by LEONARD. Accordingly, PEPSI has breached the contract
between the parties.

21. Since the subject matter of the contract, a new Harrier Jet, is of
such a special nature and peculiar value and is a specifically
identifiable and inherently unique item, LEONARD is without an
adequate remedy at law to redress his injuries if PEPSI is not
required to perform its obligations under the contract by delivering
the new Harrier Jet to LEONARD.

22. As a direct and proximate result of PEPSI's breach of contract,
LEONARD has and will continue to suffer damages, unless PEPSI
completes its performance of the contract as described above.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, LEONARD, prays that this Honorable
Court: (1) exercise its equitable powers over the subject matter of this
action requiring specific performance of the contract as between the
parties; (2) enter a judgment, order or decree directing or otherwise
requiring PEPSI to accept the tender of seven (7) million Pepsi
Points from LEONARD and deliver and/or otherwise transfer the
new Harrier Jet to LEONARD; and (3) fashion any and all
appropriate remedies the Court deems necessary and proper to carry
out performance of the contract by PEPSI to LEONARD.

COUNT II
[Breach of Contract (In the Alternative)]

23. Plaintiff hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through
16 as if fully set forth herein.

24. PEPSI, by and through its national advertising campaign, known
as Pepsi Stuff, offered a new Harrier Jet for sale to the general public
under certain conditions precedent, namely the tender of seven (7)
million Pepsi Points, as more particularly described above.

25. On March 28, 1996, LEONARD, in accordance with the rules
and regulations of the Pepsi Stuff promotion, accepted the offer, met
all of the above conditions precedent and a binding contract was
formed.

26. PEPSI has failed to fulfill its obligations to LEONARD and more
particularly set forth above and therefore, PEPSI has breached the
contract between the parties.

27. As direct and proximate result of PEPSI's breach of contract,
LEONARD has suffered damages.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff LEONARD, demands judgment against
Defendant, PEPSI, for damages, together with attorney's fees and
costs.

COUNT III
[Fraud]

28. Plaintiff hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through
16 as if fully set forth herein.

29. PEPSI, by and through its nationally advertised television
commercial featuring a new Harrier Jet, made knowingly false
statements and representations to LEONARD, concerning its offer of
the new Harrier Jet as one of the prizes which could be obtained in
the Pepsi Stuff promotional campaign.

30. Specifically, PEPSI misrepresented the fact that a new Harrier Jet
could be acquired by a member of the general public for seven (7)
million Pepsi Points, when in fact, PEPSI had absolutely no
intentions of fulfilling its promise to do so.

31. PEPSI knowingly made these false statements and
representations in its television commercial, which statements were
material misrepresentations of fact, with the intent to induce members
of the general public, such as LEONARD, into purchasing PEPSI
products and thereby increasing its profits. Accordingly, by virtue of
its running the Pepsi Stuff commercial nationwide, it was foreseeable
by PEPSI that the offer of a new Harrier Jet would either directly
increase the sale of its products for Pepsi Points or the purchase of
Pepsi Points itself.

32. LEONARD detrimentally relied on PEPSI's false statements of
material fact when on March 28, 1996, LEONARD duly tendered
seven (7) million Pepsi Points to PEPSI in exchange for the new
Harrier Jet by delivering to PEPSI (1) an original Pepsi Stuff order
form, (2) 15 original Pepsi Points, and (3) a check in the amount of
$700,008.50 (for the remaining 6,999,985 points, plus shipping and
handling), all in accordance with the rules and regulations of the
Pepsi Stuff promotion.

33. As a direct and proximate result of PEPSI's failure and refusal to
honor, accept and process  LEONARD's tender of the items set forth
in Composite Exhibit "A", to obtain seven (7) million Pepsi Points in
exchange for a new Harrier Jet, LEONARD has suffered damages.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, LEONARD, demands judgment against
Defendant, PEPSI, for damages and such other and further relief as
this Court deems just and proper and reserves the right to amend the
Complaint to seek punitive damages upon proper proffer pursuant to
Florida Statutes.

COUNT IV
[Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices]

34. Plaintiff hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through
16 as if fully set forth herein.

35. This action is brought against PEPSI pursuant to Florida's
Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, Sec. 501.201, Florida
Statutes, et. seq.

36. PEPSI, through its nationally advertised television commercials
as described above, offered a new Harrier Jet as one of the prizes that
could be obtained in the Pepsi Stuff promotional campaign, which
commercial was broadcast in the state of Florida.

37. PEPSI misrepresented and misled the general public, and
particularly LEONARD, in the television advertisement, by offering a
new Harrier Jet for seven (7) million Pepsi Points, when in fact,
PEPSI had absolutely no intention of fulfilling its promise to do so.

38. PEPSI's failure and refusal to provide LEONARD  with a new
Harrier Jet after LEONARD had accepted its offer by delivering to
PEPSI (1) an original Pepsi Stuff order form, (2) 15 original Pepsi
Points, and (3) a check in the amount of $700,008.50 (for the
remaining 6,999,985 points, plus shipping and handling), all in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the Pepsi Stuff
promotion, constitutes a willful violation  of Florida's Deceptive and
Unfair Trade Practices Act, Sec. 501.201 Florida Statutes, et. seq.
and as a direct and proximate result LEONARD has suffered
damages.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff LEONARD, demands judgment against
Defendant, PEPSI, for damages, including attorney's fees and costs
as provided by statute and for such other and further relief as this
Court deems just and proper.

COUNT V
[Misleading Advertising]

39. Plaintiff hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through
16 as if fully set forth herein.

40. This action is brought against PEPSI pursuant to Florida's
Fraudulent Practices Act, Sec. 817.41 Florida Statutes (1993).

41. PEPSI, through its nationally advertised television commercials
offering a new Harrier Jet, which a commercial was broadcast in the
state of Florida, made knowingly false, deceptive and misleading
representations to LEONARD, as a member of the general public,
concerning its offer of the new Harrier Jet as one of the prizes which
could be obtained in the Pepsi Stuff promotional campaign.

42. Specifically, PEPSI misrepresented a material fact that a new
Harrier Jet could be acquired for seven (7) million Pepsi Points,
when in fact, PEPSI had absolutely no intentions of fulfilling its
promise to do so.

43. PEPSI knowingly made these false, deceptive and misleading
statements in its television commercial, for the purpose of inducing
or causing members of the general public, and particularly
LEONARD, to purchase its products or Pepsi Points under false
pretenses.

44. Such practices constitute a willful violation of Sec. 817.41,
Florida Statutes (1993) and as a direct and proximate result,
LEONARD has suffered damages.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff LEONARD, demands judgment against
Defendant, PEPSI, for damages, including attorney's fees and costs
as provided by statute and for such other and further relief as this
Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

45. Plaintiff demands a trial by jury of all issues so triable as a matter
of right.

Respectfully submitted this 6th day of August, 1996.

excess of the minimum size required by Nasdaq or NASD rules; and 

(8) Refuse, or threaten to refuse to trade, (or agree with or encourage 
any other market maker to refuse to trade) with any market maker at 
defendant's published Nasdaq quotes in amounts up to the published 
quotation size because such market maker decreased its dealer spread, 
decreased the inside spread in any Nasdaq security, or refused to trade 
at its quoted prices in a quantity of shares greater than either (1) the 
minimum size required by Nasdaq or NASD rules or (2) the size 
displayed or otherwise communicated by that market maker. 

B. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section IV.A.(1) - (8), any 
defendant shall be entitled to: 

(1) Set unilaterally its own bid and ask in any Nasdaq security, the 
prices at which it is willing to buy or sell any Nasdaq security, and the 
quantity of shares of any Nasdaq security that it is willing to buy or 
sell; 

(2) Set unilaterally its own dealer spread, quote increment, or quantity 
of shares for its quotations (or set any relationship between or among 
its dealer spread, inside spread, or the size of any quote increment) in 
any Nasdaq security; 

(3) Communicate its own bid or ask, or the price at or the quantity of 
shares in which it is willing to buy or sell any Nasdaq security to any 
person, for the purpose of exploring the possibility of a purchase or 
sale of that security, and to negotiate for or agree to such purchase or 
sale; 

(4) Communicate its own bid or ask, or the price at or the quantity of 
shares in which it is willing to buy or sell any Nasdaq security, to any 
person for the purpose of retaining such person as an agent or 
subagent for defendant or for a customer of defendant (or for the 
purpose of seeking to be retained as an agent or subagent), and to 
negotiate for or agree to such purchase or sale; 

(5) Engage in any conduct or activity authorized or required by the 
federal securities laws, including but not limited to the rules, 
regulations, or interpretations of the SEC, the NASD, or any other 
self-regulatory organization, as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; 

(6) Engage in any underwriting (or any syndicate for the 
underwriting) of securities to the extent permitted by the federal 
securities laws; 

(7) Act as Qualified Block Positioners as defined in SEC Rule 3b-
8(c), promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended, to the extent permitted by the federal securities laws; 

(8) Except as provided in Sections IV.A.(5) - (8) of this stipulation 
and order, take any unilateral action or make any unilateral decision 
regarding the market makers with which it will trade and the terms on 
which it will trade; and 

(9) Engage in conduct protected under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. 
No finding of any violation of this stipulation and order may be made 
based solely on parallel conduct. 

C. In order to ensure compliance with the provisions of Section IV.A. 
of the stipulation and order, each defendant shall: 

(1) Initiate and maintain an antitrust compliance program, which shall 
include designating, within ninety (90) days of the effective date 
hereof, an Antitrust Compliance Officer, who shall be responsible for 
establishing and maintaining an antitrust compliance program designed 
to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with this stipulation 
and order and with the federal antitrust laws by the defendant in its 
market making activities in Nasdaq securities on its OTC desk. The 
Antitrust Compliance Officer shall personally or through his designee: 

(a) Distribute, within thirty (30) days from the effective date hereof or 
from the date of designation of the Antitrust Compliance Officer, 
whichever is later, a copy of this stipulation and order to:  (i) all 
members of the board of directors of the defendant (or if there is no 
board of directors, to such persons as have substantially equivalent 
responsibilities); and (ii) all employees and all officers of the 
defendant whose duties or responsibilities include market making in 
any Nasdaq security on Nasdaq; 

(b) Distribute within thirty (30) days of appointment or assignment a 
copy of this stipulation and order (i) to any person who becomes a 
member of the board of directors of the defendant (or if there is no 
board of directors, to such persons as have substantially equivalent 
responsibilities) and (ii) any employee or officer of the defendant 
whose duties or responsibilities include market making in any Nasdaq 
security on Nasdaq; 

(c) Brief semi-annually those persons designated in paragraphs (a)(ii) 
and (b)(ii) of this subsection on the meaning and requirements of the 
federal antitrust laws and this stipulation and order in connection with 
defendant's market making activities on its OTC desk in Nasdaq 
securities, and inform them that the Antitrust Compliance Officer or a 
designee of the Antitrust Compliance Officer is available to confer 
with them regarding compliance with such laws and with this 
stipulation and order; 

(d) Obtain from each person designated in paragraphs a(i) and b(i) of 
this subsection a one time certification that he or she: (i) has read and 
agrees to abide by the terms of this stipulation and order; and (ii) has 
been advised and understands that a violation of this stipulation and 
order by such person may result in his or her being found in civil or 
criminal contempt of court; 

(e) Obtain from each person designated in paragraphs (a)(ii) and (b)(ii) 
of this subsection an annual written certification that he or she:  (i) has 
read and agrees to abide by the terms of this stipulation and order; and 
(ii) has been advised and understands that a violation of this 
stipulation and order by such person may result in his or her being 
found in civil or criminal contempt of court; and 

(f) Maintain a record of persons to whom this stipulation and order 
has been distributed and from whom the certification required by 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of this subsection has been obtained. 

(2) Within forty-five (45) days of entry of this stipulation and order by 
the Court, each defendant is required to install a system or systems 
capable of monitoring and recording any conversation on the 
telephones on its OTC desk used by such defendant to make markets 
in Nasdaq securities. 

(3) The Antitrust Compliance Officer of each defendant shall devise a 
methodology for complying with paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 of this 
Section.  No tape recorded segment shall be shorter than fifteen (15) 
minutes.  Within thirty (30) days of entry of this stipulation and order 
by the Court, the methodology proposed to be employed shall be 
submitted to the Antitrust Division for review and approval. 

(4) The Antitrust Compliance Officer, with such trained staff as 
necessary, shall record (and listen to) not less than three and one-half 
percent (3.5%) of the total number of trader hours of such defendant; 
provided, however, that in no case shall the total number of hours 
required to be recorded (and listened to) exceed seventy (70) hours per 
week.  Persons whose conversations are subject to monitoring as 
provided by this paragraph (4) shall be told of the existence of the 
taping system but shall not be informed as to the times when their 
conversations will or might be monitored or recorded. 

(5) Upon discovery of a conversation which the Antitrust Compliance 
Officer of a defendant believes may violate this stipulation and order, 
the Antitrust Compliance Officer shall retain a tape of such 
conversation, and, shall within ten (10) business days, furnish such 
tape, and any explanation thereof to the Antitrust Division, in standard 
audio cassette format, or such other format as may be acceptable to the 
Antitrust Division. 

(6) Tapes made pursuant to this stipulation and order shall be retained 
by each defendant for at least thirty (30) days from the date of 
recording, and may be recycled thereafter.  Tapes made pursuant to 
this stipulation and order shall not be subject to civil process except 
for process issued by the Antitrust Division, the SEC, the NASD, or 
any other self-regulatory organization, as defined in Section 3(a)(26) 
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Such tapes shall 
not be admissible in evidence in civil proceedings, except in actions, 
proceedings, investigations, or examinations commenced by the 
Antitrust Division, the SEC, the NASD, or any other self-regulatory 
organization, as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934, as amended. 

(7) The Antitrust Division may visit, during regular business hours, 
any defendant's facilities unannounced, and may, while there, from a 
location not observable by traders, monitor conversations required to 
be monitored and recorded pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (4) of this 
Section in real time in order to ensure compliance with this stipulation 
and order. 

(8) Upon request of the Antitrust Division, a defendant shall 
immediately identify all tape recordings made pursuant to this 
stipulation and order that are in its possession or control, shall provide 
the Antitrust Division with the opportunity to listen to any tape 
recording made pursuant to this stipulation and order, and shall 
produce to the Antitrust Division such tapes as the Antitrust Division 
may request. 

(9) The Antitrust Division may receive complaints or referrals 
concerning asserted possible violations of the stipulation and order 
and may, based upon such complaints or referrals, or for the purpose 
of monitoring or enforcing compliance with the stipulation and order, 
require the Antitrust Compliance Officer (a) to use the system or 
systems required by Section IV.C.(2) of this stipulation and order to 
tape the conversations of a particular person or group of persons on its 
OTC desk for any period of time and (b) not to give notice of such 
recordation to such person(s).  Such requests to tape shall be subject 
to the time limitations set forth in paragraph (4) of this subsection. 

(10) Each Antitrust Compliance Officer shall (in addition to making 
reports of violations within ten (10) business days) report quarterly to 
the Antitrust Division concerning activities undertaken to ensure the 
defendant's compliance with the stipulation and order and, 
specifically, the requirements of paragraphs (2)-(9) of this Section.  
Such reports shall detail the precise times when conversations were 
monitored by the Antitrust Compliance Officer pursuant to the 
requirements of this stipulation and order and the name of each person 
employed by the defendant whose conversations were recorded during 
such times. 


V.

written request of the Attorney General or of the Assistant Attorney 
General in charge of the Antitrust Division, and on reasonable notice 
to any defendant at its principal office, be permitted: 

(1) Access during office hours of such defendant, which may have 
counsel present, to inspect and copy (or to require defendants to

customer records, in the possession or under the control of such 
defendant, and which relate to compliance with this stipulation and 
order; and 

(2) Subject to the reasonable convenience of such defendant and

General Counsel prior to divulging such material in any legal 
proceeding (other than a grand jury proceeding) to which that 
defendant is not a party. 

E. Defendants may claim (which claim plaintiff shall honor to the 
extent legally permissible) protection from public disclosure, under the 
Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552, or any other

Airlines, Inc. ("ValuJet"), 1800 Phoenix Blvd., Suite 126, Atlanta,
Georgia, 30349, and alleging as follows:

1.

Complainants are survivors of Terri Bell, Judy Medeiros and Robert
Medeiros, passengers killed in the crash of ValuJet Flight 592 on May

statements of government officials. Months before the crash of
ValuJet 592, the FAA expressed concern that ValuJet was not meeting
its duty to provide service with the highest possible degree of safety as
required by section 44702 of Public Law 103-272. ValuJet continues
to operate and maintain its aircraft in an unsafe manner. See FAA
Aircraft Maintenance Division (AFS-300) report dated February 14,
1996; FAA letter of February 29, 1996, to ValuJet President Lewis
Jordan; preliminary draft report, FAA's ValuJet "Special Emphasis
Program," dated May 6, 1996 (cited in Washington Post, June 11,
1996).

3.

The Complainants allege that ValuJet is the holder of an Air Carrier
Operating Certificate number VJ6A465W issued by the FAA and is
subject to the Federal Aviation Regulations ("FAR") promulgated by
the FAA.

4.

ValuJet violated and continues to violate FAR 121.105 by failing to
show that competent personnel and adequate facilities and equipment
(including spare parts, supplies, and materials) are available at such
points along the certificate holder's route as are necessary for the
proper servicing, maintenance, and preventive maintenance of
airplanes and auxiliary equipment. See FAA Aircraft Maintenance
Division (AFS-300) report, dated February 14, 1966; preliminary
draft report, FAA's ValuJet "Special Emphasis Program," dated May
6, 1996 (cited in Washington Post, June 11, 1996).

5.

ValuJet violated and continues to violate FAR 121.363(a)(1) and (2)
by failing to insure "the airworthiness of its aircraft," and "the
performance of maintenance . . . of its aircraft" in accordance with its
manual and the FAR's. See FAA Aircraft Maintenance Division
(AFS-300) report, dated February 14, 1996; FAA letter to ValuJet
President Lewis Jordan, dated February 29, 1996.

6.

ValuJet violated and continues to violate FAR 121.365 by failing to
have a maintenance "organization adequate to perform the
[maintenance] work."  See FAA Aircraft Maintenance Division (AFS-
300) report, dated February 14, 1996; FAA letter to ValuJet President
Lewis Jordan, dated February 29, 1996; preliminary draft report,
FAA's ValuJet "Special Emphasis Program," dated May 6, 1996
(cited in Washington Post, June 11, 1996).

7.

ValuJet violated and continues to violate FAR 121.367(a), (b) and (c)
by failing to have a sufficient maintenance inspection program to
insure maintenance is performed in accordance with the certificate
holder's manual, competent personnel and adequate facilities and
equipment are provided for the proper performance of maintenance
and each aircraft released to service is airworthy and has been properly
maintained for operation. See FAA Aircraft Maintenance Division
(AFS-300) report, dated February 14, 1996; preliminary draft report,
FAA's ValuJet "Special Emphasis Program," dated May 6, 1996
(cited in Washington Post, June 11, 1996).

8.

ValuJet violated and continues to violate FAR 121.371(a) by failing to
insure aircraft maintenance inspections are carried out by appropriately
certified, properly trained, qualified and authorized personnel. See
FAA letter to ValuJet President Lewis Jordan, dated February 29,
1996; preliminary draft report, FAA's ValuJet "Special Emphasis
Program," dated May 6, 1996 (cited in Washington Post, June 11,
1996).

9.

ValuJet violated FAR 121.373(a) by failing to "establish and maintain
a system for the continuing analysis and surveillance of the
performance and effectiveness of its [maintenance] inspection
program."  See FAA Aircraft Maintenance Division (AFS-300) report,
dated February 14, 1996.

10.

ValuJet violated 49 CFR Section 175.30, by accepting hazardous
material in the form of oxygen generators for transportation aboard an
aircraft that was not properly authorized, marked or identified. These
oxygen generators had been scrapped from other ValuJet aircraft
undergoing maintenance at SabreTech, Inc. in Miami, Florida. See
Statement of Richard D'Arcy, ValuJet maintenance employee, dated
May 19, 1996 (available on Internet); NTSB Preliminary Report
Aviation DCA96MA054.

11.

The Secretary of Transportation is charged with the responsibility of
"assigning and maintaining safety as the highest priority in air
commerce."  49 U.S.C. Section 40101(a)(1).

12.

ValuJet maintenance and operations are unsafe and this pattern of
unsafe operation and maintenance is ongoing. The Secretary of
Transportation and FAA Administrator have failed to enforce federal
statutes against ValuJet Airlines, Inc. and now appear to have placed
the promotion and development of ValuJet Airlines, Inc. above the
safety of the traveling public in direct contravention of the clear
mandate of 49 U.S.C. Section 40101 (a)(1).

13.

The Secretary of Transportation and FAA Administrator are also
charged by federal statute with the responsibility of "preventing
deterioration in established safety procedures, recognizing the clear
intent, encouragement, and dedication of Congress to further the
highest degree of safety in air transportation and air commence, and to
maintain the safety that has evolved in air transportation and air
commerce and has come to be expected by the traveling and shipping
public."  49 U.S.C. Section 40101(a)(3).

14.

The disproportionate allocation of government inspectors assigned to
ValuJet in an effort to keep it flying has unreasonably and arbitrarily
diverted essential safety inspection and enforcement resources away
from other areas of air transportation and has allowed a deterioration
of established safety procedures throughout the air transportation
system in direct contravention of the clear mandate of 49 U.S.C.
Section 40101 (a)(3).

15.

Oxygen generators scrapped from other ValuJet aircraft at SabreTech,
Inc. were improperly located into the forward cargo compartment
where the fire erupted on ValuJet 592. NTSB Preliminary Report
Aviation DCA96MA054. The FAA Aircraft Maintenance Division
report of February 14, 1996 recommended consideration of an
immediate re-certification of ValuJet based on known safety-related
issues. That report focused, in part, on ValuJet's inadequate General
Maintenance Manual which had conflicting provisions, violated
FAR's, and significantly did not address "parts scrapping
procedures."

16.

Prior to the crash of ValuJet Flight 592, the FAA was aware of
numerous continuing safety violations by ValuJet Airlines, Inc. In a
February 29, 1996 letter to ValuJet Airlines, the FAA expressed
concerns "that ValuJet is not meeting its duty to provide service with
the highest possible degree of safety."  The FAA has heretofore
concealed this important information from the traveling public. The
preliminary draft report, FAA's ValuJet "Special Emphasis Program,"
dated May 6, 1996 (cited in Washington Post, June 11, 1996)
demonstrates that ValuJet's safety violations are continuing.

17.

The arbitrary reduction in the number of flights by ValuJet following
the crash of Flight 592 and the initiation of additional special FAA
inspections, are admissions by ValuJet and the FAA that ValuJet is not
"fit, willing, and able to provide the transportation authorized by the
certificate," as required by 49 U.S.C. Section 41110(e)(1).

18.

While negotiations are ongoing to obtain adequate maintenance
support, ValuJet continues to operate aircraft maintained by the
admittedly unsatisfactory contract maintenance facilities. ValuJet has
publicly admitted that its maintenance practices are inadequate and is
attempting to reach agreements with qualified maintenance facilities to
maintain its aircraft. The preliminary draft report, FAA's ValuJet
"Special Emphasis Program," dated May 6, 1996 labeled ValuJet's
procedures for quality control of its maintenance facilities
"inadequate."  This is further admission by the FAA and ValuJet that
ValuJet is not "fit, willing, and able to provide the transportation
authorized by the certificate."  49 U.S.C. Section 41110(e)(1).

19.

The FAA has demonstrated a pattern of inaction and non-enforcement
regarding ValuJet's noncompliance with federal statutes and
regulations enacted to protect the safety of the public. ValuJet has
operated at the advisory or alert threshold during the majority of its
brief existence as evidenced by the results of the FAA NASIP
Inspection Program, with known safety related issues including the
absence of adequate policies and procedures for maintenance
personnel to follow. See FAA Aircraft Maintenance Division (AFS-
300) report, dated February 14, 1996.

20.

The FAA's authorization of continued ValuJet operations under Air
Carrier Operating Certificate VJ6A465W poses a significant threat of
irreparable harm by allowing unsafe air transportation and requiring
the unreasonable diversion of essential FAA safety inspection and
enforcement resources away from other critical areas of air
transportation.

21.

ValuJet, in spite of blatant violations of federal law that continue to
this day, and admissions that it cannot safely perform the
transportation authorized by its Air Carrier Operating Certificate,
continues to fly and carry passengers, creating an immediate threat to
aviation safety, endangering the lives and property of others. The
crash of flight 592 and the resultant loss of 110 lives could have been
prevented had the FAA followed the clear mandate of the law
demanding that ValuJet be grounded until it can operate safely.
Innocent passengers and unsuspecting crew members should not be
placed at continued risk on ValuJet aircraft.

WHEREFORE, Complainants demand the Administrator immediately
issue an Emergency Order of Revocation of ValuJet's Air Carrier
Operating Certificate number VJ6A465W pursuant to Special Federal
Aviation Regulation 72, Section 13.20 and require ValuJet to show
cause why its authority to operate an airline in air commerce should
not be permanently revoked until such time as ValuJet has
demonstrated that it is fit, willing, and able to safely maintain its
aircraft and provide transportation authorized by its certificate as
required by law.

Respectfully submitted,

Attorneys for Plaintiff

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY

DENNIS RODMAN,
Plaintiff,

v.

FANATIX APPAREL, INC., MICKEY GOLDSCHMIDT, JMJ
INTERNATIONAL, MHK PRODUCTS, INC., JAY ENIS and
JOHN DOES 10, Defendants.

Civil Action No.


FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
FALSE DESIGNATION OF ORIGIN and INVASION OF RIGHT
OF PUBLICITY

Plaintiff Dennis Rodman, by his attorneys Jules D. Zalon and Rutan
& Tucker, hereby respectfully alleges on knowledge as to plaintiff's
own acts and on information and belief as to all other matters, the
following for his complaint against the defendants:

A. Plaintiff Dennis Rodman is a citizen and resident of the state of
Texas.

B. Defendant Fanatix Apparel, Inc. is a New Jersey Corporation
whose principal place of business is at 729 Washburn Street,
Teaneck, New Jersey 07666.

C. Defendant Goldschmidt is the president of Fanatix and has caused
it to commit the acts herein complained of.

D. Defendant JMJ International is a business entity whose formal
organization is not known, but whose principal place of business is at
130 Gamewell Street, Hackensack, New Jersey.

E. Defendant MHK Products, inc. is a New Jersey Corporation
whose principal place of business is at 130 Gamewell Street,
Hackensack, New Jersey.

F. Defendant Jay Enis is a principal of both defendants JMJ
International, and MHK Products, Inc., and has caused each of them
to commit the acts herein complained of.

G. Defendants John Does 1-10 are partners of, or are otherwise
associated with, one or another of the named defendants in their
production, sale or distribution of unauthorized Dennis Rodman T-
shirts, and are either residents of or regularly do business in the State
of New Jersey.

H. The identities of the individuals described as John Does are not
presently known; the complaint will be amended to include their true
names when identified. The counts herein set forth arise out of their
actions within the State of New Jersey.

I. The separate counts set forth herein arise under the trademark laws
of the United States, Title 15 U.S.C. 1051, et seq. as well as the
common law of this state, and jurisdiction and venue are founded
upon Title 15 U.S.c. 1051 et seq. Title 28 U.S.C. 1331, 1338, 1391,
2201 and 2202. The matter in controversy exceeds, exclusive of
interest and costs, the sum of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) and is
between citizen of different states.


AS AND FOR A FIRST COUNT FOR VIOLATION OF 15 U.S.C.
1125(a)

Plaintiff Dennis Rodman is a well known, extremely successful and
hugely popular professional basketball player. Mr. Rodman's exploits
on the court are legendary: he has led the entire National Basketball
Association in rebounds for five years in a row, a record that no other
player has ever come close to matching; he was named the NBA
defensive Player of the Year; he has been an NBA All-Star, and a
member of the NBA All Defensive Team.

2. As a result of this popularity, plaintiff has regularly received
financially lucrative offers to license use of his name and likeness on a
wide variety of products. However, he has been careful to limit such
merchandising activities only to products of the highest quality and
pursuant to arrangements by which he maintains complete control over
the manner in which such name and likeness is used, such that he
maintains and fosters an image in keeping with the high regard in
which he is held throughout the sports world. Presently plaintiff has
authorized Today's Trendz and NIKE, Inc. to produce T-shirts
bearing plaintiff's name and likeness. Both these agreement are
carefully and constantly monitored for quality control purposes, and
require the licensees to submit all licensed articles to plaintiff for his
approval. The agreements also require the application of specific
trademark and copyright information on all such articles.

3. During the course of his remarkable career, plaintiff has at various
times arranged with different tattoo artists to apply tattoos to his
(plaintiff's) body. Each tattoo was carefully chosen by plaintiff;
several were in fact designed by the plaintiff. One of the tattoos is a
meticulously accurate likeness of plaintiff's young daughter, Alexis.

4. Plaintiff caused each of these tattoos to be produced, in part, for the
purpose of identifying and associating them with himself, solely.

5. The said tattoos are extremely recognizable and identifiable as being
"Dennis Rodman's tattoos." They are often referred to in published
articles and television and other media segments, always being
identified with the plaintiff alone. As an indication of this
identifiability of the tattoos with plaintiff, McDonalds and Carl's Jr.,
two nationwide food chains, recently filmed television commercials
featuring plaintiff's tattoos. Moreover, one of plaintiff's nicknames
throughout the sports world is "Tattoo Man."

6. As a result of plaintiff's great public visibility and the public's
association of plaintiff with these tattoos, the tattoos have attained and
now possess a secondary and distinctive trademark meaning to the
general public, particularly to sports fans.

7. The defendants were, until restrained by this Court, producing and
distributing a long-sleeved T-shirt bearing colorable replications of ten
of plaintiff's body tattoos, including the tattoo of plaintiff's daughter,
Alexis; each such tattoo is placed on the shirt in the same place as the
actual tattoo is found on plaintiff's body.

8. The accused shirts are extremely expensive to produce, and were
therefore, until restrained by this Court, being sold at premium prices
throughout the country. Nevertheless, they were being sold in large
numbers by major chain stores and supermarkets, particularly in the
Chicagoland area.

9. The only reason why these shirts could have commanded such
premium prices was their identification with plaintiff, being widely
described as "Dennis Rodman Tattoo T- Shirts." In fact, the shirts
would have had no commercial value but for their association with the
plaintiff.

10. In advertising and promotional materials issued by or authorized
by the defendants to sell their spurious shirt, the defendants have
regularly and prominently used the plaintiff's name, generally
referring to the shirt as their "Dennis Rodman Tattoo T-Shirt," and
have otherwise represented to the public and the trade that the shirt
was authorized by the plaintiff, which is clearly false.

11. Reproduced here is a copy of one such display, from the Omni
SuperStore in Bridgeview, Illinois:

[An actual photograph of such display is annexed to the original
complaint filed herein.]

12. These shirts are universally recognized as being associated with
plaintiff even absent accompanying use of his name on the shirt itself
by the defendants. This recognition is a direct and natural consequence
of the defendants' own identification of the shirt as the "Dennis
Rodman Tattoo T-Shirt," and their like representations to their sales
reps and their customers. In addition, the arrangement of these ten
replications of plaintiff's body tattoos on the defendants' infringing
shirt would be -- and are -- clearly recognized as identifying the
plaintiff. For example, newspaper articles, television segments and
Internet "pages" have regularly and prominently identified the shirt as
the "Dennis Rodman Tattoo T-Shirt."

13. Defendants' said merchandise is of the same general nature, type
and description as merchandise licensed by the plaintiff and
manufactured and distributed by plaintiff's various licensees, and
defendants' said shirts and plaintiff's authorized merchandise are so
related that the defendants' use is likely to cause confusion among
purchasers. The use of the said tattoos by each of the defendants is
without the permission or authority of plaintiff and said use by the
defendants is likely to cause confusion, to cause mistake and to
deceive.

14. The said infringing merchandise of the defendants being of
inferior quality, the sale thereof will be damaging to the reputation
which plaintiff has developed in connection with his licensing of
authentic merchandise.

15. The unauthorized sale of such bootleg merchandise is likely to
create confusion and/or misunderstanding by the purchasers as to the
source and sponsorship of such merchandise.

16. The defendants are selling their imitation merchandise without the
permission or agreement of the plaintiff and have not obtained any
license to manufacture, distribute or sell the same. On the contrary,
plaintiff has formally demanded that they desist from selling such
infringing shirts, but the defendants have ignored such demands and
refuse to cease such acts.

17. The defendants, and each of them, have been transacting and
continue to transact business in this state and elsewhere in interstate
commerce, and have been and continue to infringe plaintiff's right of
publicity in this state and elsewhere in interstate commerce, and
regularly have been and now do business and solicit business and
derive substantial revenue from goods sold, used and consumed in
this state and elsewhere in interstate commerce, including the accused
merchandise as aforesaid. The defendants, and each of them, expected
or should have reasonably expected their acts, including the
aforementioned acts and those set forth hereinbelow, to have
consequence in this state.

18. The defendants, and each of them, have and at all times relevant to
the acts set forth hereinabove had actual and constructive knowledge
of the rights of plaintiff but have proceeded in complete disregard
thereof.

19. Unless the defendants are restrained and enjoined from selling
their unauthorized merchandise, their conduct will deprive plaintiff of
a substantial portion of the income he expects to receive from the sale
of licensed personality merchandise.

20. The defendants' prominent identification of the shirt as the
"Dennis Rodman Tattoo T-shirt" as well as their appropriation and use
of these tattoos as aforesaid are each false descriptions and
representations that said goods are made, sponsored or approved by,
or are otherwise affiliated with the plaintiff. Said acts are in violation
of 15 U.S.C. 1125(a) in that defendants are using in connection with
goods false designations of origin and false or misleading descriptions
of fact, which are likely to cause confusion or to deceive as to
affiliation, connection or association, or as to sponsorship or
approval, and have caused such goods to enter into or affect interstate
commerce. Plaintiff believes that he is and is likely to be, damaged by
such false descriptions and representations by reason of the likelihood
that purchasers will be confused as to the true source, sponsorship or
affiliation of said goods.


AS AND FOR A SECOND COUNT FOR VIOLATION OF 15
U.S.C. 1125(a)

21. Plaintiff hereby realleges, as if fully set forth, the allegations of
Paragraphs 1 through 20 herein.

22. As a result of the widespread identification of the shirt by the
defendants, their agents and representatives (including sales reps) as
being the "Dennis Rodman Tattoo T-shirt," the defendants'
customers, mostly retail stores, have themselves prominently
identified and described the shirt in like manner, thus exploiting the
shirt's association and identity with the plaintiff in all their
promotional and sales activities.

23. It was reasonable -- in fact, it was virtually certain -- that these
(retail store) customers would themselves so identify the shirt as the
"Dennis Rodman Tattoo T-shirt."

24. At the time that they advertised, offered for sale and sold their
infringing shirt, the defendants and each of them must have expected
and, plaintiff avers, certainly did expect that their said customers
would so identify and describe the shirt.

25. The said identification of the shirt as aforesaid by the defendants'
customers, the retail stores, is a false description and representation
that said goods are made, sponsored or approved by, or are otherwise
affiliated with, the plaintiff. Said acts are in violation of 15 U.S.C.
1125(a) in that such retail stores are using in connection with goods
false designations of origin and false or misleading descriptions of
fact, which are likely to cause confusion or to deceive as to affiliation,
connection or association, or as to sponsorship or approval, and have
caused such goods to enter into or affect interstate commerce. The
defendants are liable for such false designations as contributory
infringers. Plaintiff believes that he is and is likely to be, damaged by
such false descriptions and representations by reason of the likelihood
that purchasers will be confused as to the true source, sponsorship or
affiliation of said goods.


AS AND FOR A THIRD COUNT FOR MISAPPROPRIATION OF
PLAINTIFFS' RIGHTS OF PUBLICITY

26. Plaintiff hereby realleges, as if fully set forth, the allegations of
Paragraphs 1 through 25 herein.

27. Due to the investment of substantial money, time and energy in
advertising, publicizing and promoting the accomplishments and
excellence of plaintiff, plaintiff has developed and now possesses a
separate right of publicity.

28. The said identification of the plaintiff in association with the
promotion, advertising and sale of the defendants' infringing shirt use
of such tattoos on the defendants' infringing shirts constitutes a willful
infringement of the plaintiff's separate right of publicity.


AS AND FOR A FOURTH COUNT FOR INTERFERENCE WITH
CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS

29. Plaintiffs hereby reallege, as if fully set forth, the allegations of
Paragraphs 1 through 28 herein.

30. The unauthorized and unlawful activities of the defendants as
described hereinabove will wrongfully impair the value of the
contracts referred to in Paragraph 2 herein.


AS AND FOR A FIFTH COUNT FOR UNFAIR COMPETITION

31. Plaintiffs hereby reallege, as if fully set forth, the allegations of
Paragraphs 1 through 31 herein.

32. The aforesaid acts of the defendants have been and will be
committed willfully and with full knowledge of the rights of plaintiff
and with the intention of deceiving and misleading the public and of
wrongfully misappropriating and trading upon the nationally
recognized value of the good will and reputation of the plaintiff and of
benefiting from and depriving plaintiff of the benefits arising from his
said reputation and goodwill inhering therein.

33. The defendants' said misappropriation and unfair competition will
interfere with the plaintiff's rights and ability to exploit the commercial
value of his name and likeness.

34. Defendants will receive substantial profits from their unauthorized
use and misappropriation of plaintiff's great reputation, and
defendants will become unjustly enriched thereby. The defendants'
aforementioned willful and unauthorized misappropriation of
plaintiff's reputation will cause substantial and irreparable damage,
injury and loss to the plaintiff and constitute unfair competition.


DAMAGE TO PLAINTIFF

35. By reason of the defendants' acts alleged herein, plaintiff has
suffered and will continue to suffer damage to his reputation and
goodwill, and has lost sales and profits he would have made but for
the defendants' acts.

36. Unless the defendants' acts of misappropriation and unfair
competition are immediately restrained and enjoined, the plaintiff will
suffer irreparable injury in that defendants' actions will:

(a) lessen and dilute the value of the
plaintiff's merchandising rights;

(b) interfere with his ability to exploit, market, and license such rights;

(c) create confusion in the marketplace as to the duly authorized source
of Dennis Rodman merchandise; and

(d) deprive plaintiff of his just revenues based upon his legal
exploitation of his name and likeness.

37. It will be impossible to ascertain the amount of compensation
which could afford plaintiff adequate relief for such threatened
continuing acts, and a multiplicity of judicial proceedings would be
required. Moreover, the remedies at law are not adequate in any event
to compensate plaintiff for injuries suffered and threatened.


PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, plaintiff prays:

1. That defendants, their agents, servants, employees, officers,
attorneys, successors and assigns and all persons acting under the
defendants or on their behalf, be enjoined pendente lite and
permanently from:

(a) manufacturing, distributing, selling, offering for sale, holding for
sale or advertising any T-shirt or other product bearing the name or
likeness of the plaintiff, or bearing any of plaintiff's body tattoos, or
any colorable variation thereof;

(b) representing that any article of merchandise manufactured,
distributed, sold, held for sale or advertised by them is sponsored or
authorized by the plaintiff;

(c) applying the plaintiff's name or likeness, of any of his body
tattoos, or any reproduction, counterfeit, copy or colorable imitation
thereof, to labels,-signs, prints, packages, wrappers, receptacles or
advertisements intended to be used or capable of being used, or used
in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution or
advertising of goods or services or in connection with which such use
is likely to cause confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive;

(d) using plaintiff's name, likeness or identity in association with the
sale, offering for sale, distribution or advertising of goods or services
in any manner;

(e) making, having made for them, selling, distributing or disposing
of in any manner any advertisements or promotional material including
ad mats, point of sale devises, catalogs, letters, posters or brochures
using the plaintiff's name or likenesses, or using any of plaintiff's
body tattoos;

(f) filling any order for merchandise associated with plaintiff;

<P>The FTC alleges Toys "R" Us has violated federal antitrust law by influencing manufacturers' sales to some competitors. Specifically, the FTC alleges that Toys "R" Us singled out warehouse discount clubs outlets, requiring manufacturers to exclude items carried by Toys "R" Us from sales to the warehouse clubs. FTC further alleges that Toys "R" Us negotiated agreements among competing manufacturers to block sales to the clubs and policed club inventories to be sure that the agreements were enforced.</P>

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
BEFORE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION

In the Matter of Toys "R" Us, Inc., a corporation

DOCKET NO. 9278

COMPLAINT

Pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and
by virtue of the authority vested in it by said Act, the Federal Trade
Commission, having reason to believe that Toys "R" Us, Inc., a
corporation (sometimes referred to as "TRU" or "respondent"), has
violated the provisions of said Act, and it appearing to the
Commission that a proceeding by it in respect thereof would be in the
public interest, hereby issues its complaint, stating its charges as
follows:

PARAGRAPH ONE:  Respondent Toys "R" Us, Inc. ("TRU") is a
corporation organized, existing, and doing business under and by
virtue of the laws of Delaware, with its principal office and place of
business at 461 From Road, Paramus, New Jersey  07652.

PARAGRAPH TWO:  TRU is the largest toy retailer in the United
States. It has approximately 600 stores located throughout the
United States and 300 stores in foreign countries, which sell toys,
infant supplies and equipment, juvenile sporting goods and related
items ("products"). In 1995 its total sales were approximately $9.4
billion.

PARAGRAPH THREE:  TRU's acts and practices, including the
acts and practices alleged herein, are in or affect commerce as
"commerce" is defined in the Federal Trade Commission Act.

PARAGRAPH FOUR:  TRU's importance as a provider of
distribution to manufacturers of toys and related products has given it
the ability to exercise market power over those manufacturers, and
TRU has exercised this power.

PARAGRAPH FIVE:  Warehouse clubs ("clubs") charge a
membership fee and retail a broad variety of products, including toys
and other products sold by TRU. The clubs operate on lower
margins than TRU or other national chain discounters. During the
late 1980's and early 1990's, club sales were growing at a much
faster rate than other retailers. During that period, the toy
manufacturers wanted to increase their sales to this relatively new
channel of distribution because of the growth potential of the clubs
and the manufacturers' desire to have additional outlets for their
merchandise. Before TRU engaged in the conduct described in
Paragraphs Seven through Nine below, the clubs generally were able
to buy popular individual toys from open stock (i.e., any toys sold
by the manufacturer without restriction) from most of the major
manufacturers, which they generally sold at lower prices than TRU
and other retailers. The clubs needed the option to buy the same toys
from the manufacturers that TRU and the other major retailers were
carrying in order to compete effectively.

PARAGRAPH SIX:  TRU has cultivated the image with the public
as a toy discounter that has everyday low prices. However, it does
not have the lowest retail prices among national toy retailers, and it
generally does not lead prices down. In the early 1990's the clubs'
low prices were putting competitive pressure on TRU. TRU feared
that consumers would draw unfavorable and embarrassing
comparisons between the clubs' prices and its prices, and that its
image for everyday low prices could be eroded.

PARAGRAPH SEVEN:  Beginning at least as early as 1989, TRU
used its power to gain agreements or understandings with various
suppliers relating to toy sales to the clubs. These agreements or
understandings included the following:

(a) The suppliers agreed not to sell to the clubs the same individual
toys that TRU carried;

(b) In the event a supplier wanted to sell to the clubs some toys
carried by TRU, TRU and the suppliers agreed upon toy products
that could be sold to the clubs. These generally were "club specials"
consisting of combination packs of two or more different items, or
other product that was differentiated from regular open stock items.
The items in the club specials could not be readily price- compared to
products sold by TRU, the club specials generally cost more to
produce, and the club specials raised the clubs' prices to consumers;
and

(c) The suppliers agreed to advise TRU in advance of the specific
products, including club specials, that the suppliers wanted to sell to
the clubs. If after reviewing the products TRU determined that they
did not pose a competitive conflict with the products sold by TRU,
the supplier could sell the product to the clubs.

PARAGRAPH EIGHT:  Some major manufacturers were reluctant to
give up their sales of individual toys to the clubs so long as their
competitors were selling them to the clubs. To secure the agreements
or understandings alleged in Paragraph Seven, TRU facilitated
understandings among competing manufacturers to achieve
substantial unity of action among them relating to their dealings with
the clubs.

PARAGRAPH NINE:  TRU sought, received, and negotiated
agreements or understandings with manufacturers with respect to the
toys they would not sell to the clubs. TRU policed the
manufacturers' sales and repeatedly brought any infractions to their
attention. When it deemed necessary, TRU enforced its policy by
taking product off its shelves or not buying product that
manufacturers had sold to the clubs.

PARAGRAPH TEN:  By 1994 and continuing to the present, most
of the major U.S. toy manufacturers had stopped selling popular
individual toys to the club channel of distribution that were carried by
TRU.

PARAGRAPH ELEVEN:  The purpose and effect of the agreements
and understandings described in Paragraphs Seven through Ten was
to restrain competition among toy retailers and among toy
manufacturers.

PARAGRAPH TWELVE:  By engaging in the acts or practices
described in Paragraphs Four through Eleven of this complaint, TRU
has unreasonably restrained competition in the following ways,
among others:

(a) Retail price competition has been restrained, and toy prices to
consumers are higher than they would have been absent TRU's
conduct;

(b) Competition among toy manufacturers, including competition
with respect to their distributional practices and their dealing with
TRU's competitors, has been restrained;

(c) The clubs' costs were increased, which impeded the growth of a
new method of toy distribution in its incipiency; and

(d) Information that would enable consumers to make informed price
comparisons has been suppressed.

PARAGRAPH THIRTEEN:  The acts or practices of TRU alleged
herein were and are to the prejudice and injury of the public. The
acts or practices constitute unfair methods of competition in or
affecting commerce in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade
Commission Act. These acts or practices are continuing and will
continue, or amy recur, in the absence of the relief requested.

agents and employees, acting within the course and scope of their
employment, inter alia, failed and refused, to warn the passengers of
Flight 592 of the known dangers and/or failed to protect those

<P>"In Context With Arthur Miller"<br> 
The Revised Breast Implant Settlement Program</P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER, Host: Hello. I'm Arthur Miller and welcome to a special edition of In Context. We are pleased to have with us United States District Judge Sam Pointer. Judge Pointer is presiding over the national litigation involving breast implants and currently over the revised breast implant settlement program. The judge, along with three other guests who are involved in this case, will explain the legal rights and options of women under the revised settlement agreement with some of the manufacturers. Those of you who are frequent In Context viewers may see something a little bit different tonight. This is designed as an informational program not only for the hundreds of thousands of women who are involved in the breast implant litigation, but for all of you out there. We hope to give you an insight into some of the most complex, interesting mass tort civil cases currently going on in the United States. </P>

<P>So without further delay, let me introduce the guests. First, the distinguished jurist I have just spoken of, the Honorable Sam Pointer. Judge Pointer is the chief judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. He is, as I just mentioned, presiding over the revised breast implant settlement program. Second, Judge Ann Cochran. Judge Cochran is currently the claims administrator for revised breast implant settlement program. Third, Linda Willett, an attorney with experience in pharmaceutical and medical device litigation. Linda represents some of the defendants in this case. And fourth, Leslie Bryan, a litigation attorney who has worked extensively on the federal multi-district litigation. Leslie represents many of the plaintiffs in this large, complex case. Welcome to all four of you. </P>

<P>Now, we had better tell our viewers something about this breast implant litigation. Judge, what's it all about? </P>

<P>Hon. SAM POINTER, JR., Chief Judge, U.S. District Court, Alabama, Presiding Over Revised Settlement Program: Well I think the unusual thing right now Arthur is that traditionally when courts have sent out notices to class members about settlements or rights, they've done so through advertisements, through written packages, and we're doing that. But that can be rather intimidating and daunting if you get a package in the mail that's pretty thick and you open it up and wonder what to do with it. In this particular litigation, we're trying to do some additional things. We'll have some regional meetings where people can come to explain and hopefully learn about their rights, and this program that we're trying to put on not to try to talk people into or out of a settlement or exactly how to exercise their options, but really more informational, what the things mean and we cannot answer all the questions. It's going to be --  we're going to have to do a summary and we may be wrong if we do, being something live and unrehearsed. We'll correct it on a hot line that we have. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Right. So the basic objective of this program is to inform, to explain to people, particularly the people who are caught up in this litigation, what's happening, what's happening. Now, why is this such an unusual case? </P>

<P>LESLIE BRYAN, Litigation Attorney, Represents Some Plaintiffs In Revised Settlement Program: Well the breast implant litigation is unusual because of the sheer volume of women that are involved. There are estimates that vary about how many women have breast implants, but conservatively, someplace between half a million and 800,000 women in the United States have implants. So that causes this to be of great interest to a number of people. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: This case supposedly, if I remember the media attention given to it about a year or two ago, was supposed to be settled. It was supposed to be settled under what was called a global settlement and now we're here on this show talking about what I referred to a couple of minutes ago as a revised settlement program. Ann what --  what's happened there? </P>

<P>ANN COCHRAN, Claims Administrator, Revised Settlement Program: The original global settlement that was announced in April of 1994 was, in large part, predicated upon whether or not the number of claims and the amount of moneys committed under that program would be either a fit or at least a close fit. The number of claims and the number of claims that, in a statistical sample that our office conducted for the judge, the number of claims that were likely to be approved under the original global settlement were going to be so great that the numbers, the dollar figures of benefits that were originally set out, would have to be reduced, perhaps down to under five percent of --  and that's not a five percent reduction, but a 95 percent plus reduction --  down to perhaps under five percent of the amounts originally set out and under the original global settlement, if any reduction of benefits were to occur, then all of the class members would have an opportunity to opt out again, to say no thank you and leave the settlement. In turn, if the manufacturers who had agreed to put up the money for that global settlement had decided that too many women had said no thank you, then they had the right, under the original plan, to walk away. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: I gather that, from the perspective of the manufacturers, it was necessary to re-look at the situation? </P>

<P>LINDA WILLETT, Litigation Attorney, Represents Some Defendants In Revised Settlement Program: Yes, and it was always anticipated under the original settlement, Arthur, that there would be an opportunity to do just that.</P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: So where are we now, judge? What's happening as we sit here and chat? </P>

<P>Hon. SAM POINTER, JR.: Well I concluded as a result of the sampling that there was no way that the benefits could go forward without, in effect, ending up with so many opt outs that the manufacturers would withdraw, that there would essentially be nothing except further delays, and it was as a result of that that the manufacturers and the plaintiffs went back, so to speak, to the bargaining table, to see if there was some way of making some adjustments that might at least reduce the amount of reduction, and as a result of that, although there was no agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendants, the defendants ended up coming back and saying we have something that we believe will at least be better for class members than the original deal with these problems with it, and it's sort of in that context now that we are --  I have approved that the manufacturers could put out, the particular manufacturers, a revised settlement program to be solid --  to be submitted to the various class --  almost 450,000 roughly. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: And the submission is what's going on right now. I gather there's been a major mailing. </P>

<P>ANN COCHRAN: Yes, we mailed last week almost half a million packets of information all around the world. Mostly here in the U.S., but probably a little over 60,000 of those numbers going to foreign countries. It's a packet with a lot of papers and a lot of information, which is one of the reasons that --  </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Frightening at first glance. </P>

<P>ANN COCHRAN: It's intimidating at the beginning. I think we have some hints and we'll be able to talk later in the program about specific places where people can go because I think we have found, and in the claims office in Houston, we've now had three days experience of talking on the phone with people who've actually received their packet and tried to go through it and I think we did have some --  perhaps some help tonight and some other places where people can get help, at least where the best place to start in your packet is. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: What's in the packet?</P>

<P>ANN COCHRAN: There is, first of all, and I only have a couple of these, there's a letter from the judge that's sort of an introduction page and another couple of fliers. Probably the most single important piece is this large booklet that is the official court notice. We also have a --  and for a lot of people, this is a good place to start, the manila piece of paper that's just a one page synopsis on the one side and something entitled ``Deciding What Forms To Use'' which, when you see the variety of color-coded forms, they're for different forms, they're each on a different color, and then we have a pink question and answer booklet that covers a lot of the same information that's in the notice in the others, but tries to rephrase it. Sometimes people can hear something when it's phrase one way instead of another. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: I read that this afternoon and it's a tremendous array of questions and answers that I would think would be exceedingly helpful. Now we don't do this in normal two party litigation, do we?</P>

<P>LESLIE BRYAN: No, we certainly do not. One of the reasons for all of the paper, and I would particularly emphasize the importance of Ann's --  the importance of the question and answer booklet, one of the reasons for all this paper is to help people learn on their own, both the lawyers the women themselves, learn what this program is about so that they can make decisions about whether to accept the program or not. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: And that's what we'll be turning to. After a short break we'll talk with our guests about the substance of this settlement program, the choices that individuals have and the types of economic considerations that attend each of the choices. Just a reminder, we will provide information throughout the program for each member of the class and we hope to answer some --  as Judge Pointer said, there's no way we can answer all of the questions. Get a pencil, paper and if you've already gotten that packet, get that packet out. Maybe it'll be helpful to follow our discussion with the packet. We'll be right back. </P>

<P>[Commercial break] </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: We're talking about the revised settlement program in the massive breast implant litigation, trying to provide some help to those who are in the class and some general information to people who just are interested in civil litigation, big cases. Judge, what's the primary question facing the members of the class when they receive these booklets? </P>

<P>Hon. SAM POINTER, JR.: Well basically they're going to have to decide do I want to get out of the class, do I want to, perhaps, proceed with my own litigation, number two, do I want to sort of stay in the class, perhaps be a part of the settlement, and, in this case, do I want to wait to decide. That's basically the third choice, it's what I'm recommending is most appropriate for most people. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: And by waiting you mean what? In comes the booklet. </P>

<P>Hon. SAM POINTER, JR.: That wait until they are informed as to their status in the litigation based upon any submissions they've filed. Until they are told by Ann's office, the claims office, have they submitted things, have they shown their manufacturer identification, which we'll get into, if they have already filed a claim what they would be entitled to if there are deficiencies. In effect, wait to decide until you are told where you stand in terms of possible rights. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Now is there any deadline? In comes the book, the member of the class reads the book. What does she have to do within what time? </P>

<P>Hon. SAM POINTER, JR.: Well she doesn't have to do anything at that point. There's no tie limit as such. However, certain things could be adversely affected if she does not act in a particular time. If she does not, if it's a person that has never registered at all with the claims office, then they really should fill out one of the election forms, which we'll get to, and send it in by April the 1st. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: But if you already registered in an earlier period in the case. </P>

<P>Hon. SAM POINTER, JR.: Then April 1st of this year is not a deadline at all. The next possible deadline would be December 16th of this year, and that's for certain people called current claimants, which I think we'll get into maybe a little bit later on where in order to preserve special rights and options that current claimants have, they need to fill out and provide something by December the 16th of this year. In general, however, this is a program that goes over a 15-year period of time and with the exception of a few items, and I --  maybe it's important to say this, Arthur. One of the things I hope we can do tonight is to try to get people to read the materials. It may be hard and it may be challenging and it's not something just for the late evening entertainment --  </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: But you did a fine job of talking about an amazingly complex settlement arrangement. If people will just take the time and the energy to read it, I think they will get more and more out of it as they go through it. </P>

<P>Hon. SAM POINTER, JR.: That and the Q&A, or the question and answer booklet. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Yes. Let me focus on what I think we all agree is the fundamental choice for the class member and that is should I opt out and go my own way or should I stay in and accept the program. Now, we've got a member of the plaintiffs' group, we've got a member of the defendants' group. Just outline for us, Leslie, some of the considerations you think the class members should take account of. </P>

<P>LESLIE BRYAN: Well, first of all, I am enthusiastic, as is my firm, about trying breast implant cases and we're looking forward to going to trial in a number of cases. Despite that, I think that there are things that some of the women and their lawyers need to look at very carefully in deciding whether to opt out a case or whether to accept this offer. Those things, in my mind, include things like relative statutes of limitations. Whatever the state statute is, you need to make sure you're all right. The state statute of repose --  a number of jurisdictions have a statute of repose that could bar the claim. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Now those are the legal principles -- </P>

<P>LESLIE BRYAN: Legal impediments. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Yes, that tell you when you must assert your claim by? </P>

<P>LESLIE BRYAN: That's right. But in addition to those kinds of legal considerations, there are a number of other considerations that I think women and lawyers need to think about very carefully. For example, going to trial in a tort case is not fun. It is hard work for the plaintiff. She's going to have to endure a deposition. She's going to have to endure her social history coming out. In all likelihood, if she's got any psychological records, they will end up being produced in the litigation. So there are considerations the plaintiffs need to weigh very carefully in making these decisions. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Now, what would you add to that list of considerations?</P>

<P>LINDA WILLETT: Well, Arthur, I think it's important to understand and know that opting out is just one of the options that women have under the settlement. We hope that all of the women will look at the other options before they make a decision to stay in or to opt out. If they do decide to opt out, I think the things that Leslie has said are, of course, very accurate, and there is the added problem of delay. There isn't any certainty that a case will get docketed for trial quickly. Therefore the woman doesn't really have resolution very quickly while she's waiting for a trial and the outcome of that trial may be very uncertain. There isn't any certainty by opting out, but looking at the global settlement and making the choices of the settlement brings some certainty. </P>

<P>Hon. SAM POINTER, JR.: Well I think there's an additional consideration, without trying to say well that one should be in or out of the settlement is we've already got about 20,000 cases in the court system, federal and state, of cases already that have been filed. If you're talking about new cases being filed that may raise that number from 20,000 to --  I don't know what the number would be --  </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Anywhere up to 450,000. </P>

<P>Hon. SAM POINTER, JR.: And you're talking about --  yeah, you're talking about cases that take to try --  probably the shortest of these cases has been about two and a half weeks. Some have lasted like five and six weeks to try. There's a lot of cost. It's probably a minimum right now of incremental cost to a plaintiff wanting to try this case of $200,000, to the defendant, probably an equal or a greater amount. Those costs may come down in the future as we try more and more. We've tried probably --  there's more than a dozen cases thus far in federal and state courts and, of course, some of them favor the plaintiffs and some favor the defendants. It's not that they all come out favorable one way or the other. </P>

<P>LESLIE BRYAN: Arthur, but the judge raises a good point with respect to the cost issue. I think that as the early cases go to trial, that is what the costs are going to look like. It's going to be someplace between $100,000, $200,000, maybe even more to bring a case to trial, because the defendants are going to insist on a large volume of treating doctor depositions, there's going to be huge costs involved. The plaintiffs are working hard to bring those costs down. There are trial packages available, we are making efforts to put expert depositions on videotapes that will be available. But nonetheless, I think plaintiffs who face early trial dates need to be aware that the costs are going to be fairly high. Also, Linda mentions the delay. I think it might be useful to the audience to understand about one of our clients. We have a client who filed her case in 1989, went to trial before a jury in Alabama in 1991 and got a verdict, a good verdict. The verdict was overturned on appeal in the 11th Circuit. The case was sent back for retrial. We tried the case again before Judge Pointer in January of 1995. Again we got a verdict. Judge Pointer reduced the damages in the case and the case is now awaiting retrial again. So this woman's been waiting since 1989, has tried her case twice and has seen no money. So people should not think that all cases are going to result in multi-million dollar verdicts. </P>

<P>ANN COCHRAN: I think that it's important to realize everybody at this table and all the people that we represent, that there's just not one answer that's right for every woman. It's a highly individual decision and how much weight to give any factor is going to depend entirely on that woman's situation. But I think there's a little danger in --  and I don't want anybody to be left with the impression that everyone who registered with the original global settlement has the choice between accepting a new settlement program --  </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: That was exactly my next question. </P>

<P>ANN COCHRAN: Because that's not true. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Who is eligible for this, Ann? Who's eligible? </P>

<P>LINDA WILLETT: Well there is some basic eligibility that you need to know about and there are some exceptions and in terms of eligibility, the three things that our viewers need to know is that a participant must be a U.S. citizen or a resident alien or had --  she must have had her breast implants implanted in the United States. She also must have had a breast implant that was manufactured by one of either Baxter or Bristol or 3M and implanted before June 1st, 1993. That's a lot of information. I've got more to give you here. Or she could have had a breast implant, one or more breast implants manufactured by McGhan and implanted after August of 1984. I think it's after August 2nd of 1984, if I'm not wrong, Ann. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Linda, you'd better identify the manufacturers whose products are covered by this settlement. </P>

<P>LINDA WILLETT: The manufacturers are Baxter, Bristol, 3M and to some extent breast implants manufactured by McGhan. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Now how does a woman prove the manufacturer? </P>

<P>ANN COCHRAN: Well if I could back up for a minute, because for a lot of women, the threshold question is can I find out who, what kind of implants you've had. We have, at the very back of the white notice part of the booklet there are about eight pages that list in alphabetical order name after name after name of every known name of implants ever made or distributed in the United States and a couple of foreign countries with a column to the right of that saying if you have this implant, then it's a Bristol, but if you have this implant, it's a Dow Corning, and if you have this implant --  so for a lot of women, finding out whether or not you have an implant that is covered by this program is going to be a task. We hope we've done enough work in Exhibit G at the back of the notice to at least make it a simple task for a vast majority. But you've got to know whose implants you have. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Right. Let's take a closer look at that, but after a short break. We'll come back with our guests and continue the discussion of the proposed revised breast implant settlement. Stay with us. </P>

<P>[Commercial break] </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Welcome back. Before we continue to talk with our guests, get your pens and paper ready because before we go to our next break, we'll be giving you some telephone numbers and an address which should be helpful to you. Just before the last break, we were talking about identification of the implant and that's, as I read the question and answer book and as I read some of the questions that came in over the information line in the last couple of days, the identification question can be critical judge. </P>

<P>Hon. SAM POINTER, JR.: Yeah, well initially, in the original settlement terms, identification was not a major problem. With the revised settlement program, it is essential that people identify the manufacturer, and indeed, that the manufacturer of at least one of their implants is from one of these settling manufacturers. There basically are two problems. One is the woman who does not know or needs to find out who it is that manufactured my product and perhaps some proof of what it is and the second is if I get information and it has a trade name on it, is that trade name the --  a name that was put out by one of these settling manufacturers and there's sort of --  there are two separate problems. The attorneys or the individual have the problems of going to doctors and hospitals to get the information on what is my implant and getting proof of it, and, to some degree, we then have the informational system that's contained in Schedule G to try to say if you've got this implant, then it goes with this manufacturer. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: And if it's not one of the listed implants, the individual isn't eligible and I gather that's because Dow Corning, one of the defendants, is not participating in this phase of the litigation. </P>

<P>Hon. SAM POINTER, JR.: Well, one of the things --  earlier we were talking about why the earlier settlement was not going forward -- was not only that there were a lot of claims that were being presented, but the company that was putting up about three-eighths of the amount of money is in bankruptcy and that has a little --  a slight impact on what you can do. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: It has a certain chilling affect. And as a plaintiffs' lawyer, if I might call you that, there's probably --  </P>

<P>LESLIE BRYAN: Delighted to be called that. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: This problem of manufacturer identification, is it surmountable, insurmountable?</P>

<P>LESLIE BRYAN: It's surmountable. It's sometimes not easy to get medical records from doctors or hospitals but this is an area where all women, whether they already have lawyers or whether they're unrepresented, will be able to have legal help. They can go to their own lawyers if they're already represented and the lawyers and their staffs should be able to help with getting the records. If they are unrepresented, later in the program we'll be giving a number for claims assistance counsel. But these are lawyers who will be equipped to help women not only get their medical records, but ascertain whether the proof that they get of their implant manufacturer is acceptable. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Let's talk now about the benefits that an eligible class member would get if she opted into the settlement. </P>

<P>LINDA WILLETT: Arthur, to some extent, the benefits are tied to registration for the original global settlement and there were three categories of registrants --  current claimants, other registrants and late registrants, and each of those categories is tied to a date of registration. Those dates and the information about those categories are in the notice and the question and answer booklet. I won't go through them now but I will tell you that, by and large, the largest group is other registrants and I can describe the benefits for other registrants. First of all, the other registrants would be entitled to a $3,000 payment to cover or partially cover the cost of explant surgery should the participant want to have her breast implants removed. Secondly, the other registrant would be entitled to a $1,000 up front payment against the amount of compensation she would receive, somewhere between $75,000 to $250,000 dependent on new disease criteria that, again, are described in the settlement information. And this is a 15-year program, and so at any point in time during that 15 years, the medical records could be upgraded and the registrant or the participant could receive additional compensation. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: So an individual who is currently not now ill but became ill down the time line might have the benefits adjusted?</P>

<P>LINDA WILLETT: Could have the benefits adjusted if she qualifies under that particular category, yes. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: And you're to administer all of this, Ann? </P>

<P>ANN COCHRAN: Yes. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: How is that going to be done, other than with great difficulty?</P>

<P>ANN COCHRAN: We already have in the claims office a very well trained staff, both under the original global and now under the terms of the revised program, including people who already have a great deal of expertise and knowledge about the symptoms and medical findings that you have to have to qualify for this long-term benefits program. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Let me ask you a couple of questions sort of based on --  again, questions that came in over the information line. Is there a rupture fund set up in this settlement, as there was in the original global? </P>

<P>LINDA WILLETT: No, this settlement does not contain a rupture fund. The original settlement did. But, there are payments that are available under certain circumstances for rupture and that's part of the current claimants' benefits that Ann would be describing. </P>

<P>Hon. SAM POINTER, JR.: Well yes, there's a separate classification, and Linda was talking about other registrants, there's a special classification called current claimants, those who had already filed and presented claims through the claims office back --  by September and October of last year and basically --  </P>

<P>ANN COCHRAN: That's the year before last now. Time is moving on. </P>

<P>Hon. SAM POINTER, JR.: Well yes. Now we're in '96. People that met that deadline of what we call current claimants, those people get additional protections or options that are not available just to the person who's never filed something and a part of those options involves special benefits if you have proof of a rupture of a Bristol, Baxter or 3M implant. </P>

<P>LESLIE BRYAN: Now it has to be a silicone gel implant, not a saline implant. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Not a saline?</P>

<P>LESLIE BRYAN: It has to be a silicone gel implant. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Now what's the status of health care providers, of insurance companies and the like? </P>

<P>LINDA WILLETT: Well Arthur, as you know, insurance companies or health care providers can normally request a participant to reimburse for any medical payments that have been made and the defendants in this particular --  or the participants --  the defendants in the settlement don't have any additional obligations to pay into the settlement. However, there are negotiations going on now between the attorneys for the participating companies and the attorneys for certain insurers and providers, I think perhaps over 1,000 judge? </P>

<P>Hon. SAM POINTER, JR.: I think it's over 1,000 that are involved in the negotiations. </P>

<P>LINDA WILLETT: And those negotiations are aimed toward perhaps if the participating companies would be willing to pay some additional moneys into the settlement, then the women wouldn't be required to do that reimbursement and, in effect, it means more money in their pockets. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Right. </P>

<P>Hon. SAM POINTER, JR.: This is one thing that we do not know where it stands yet, but we are hopeful that it's being worked out. It may be an additional reason to sort of wait and see if these possible medical charges would affect one's decision. </P>

<P>LESLIE BRYAN: I think that's actually fairly good advice because, for some women, if their health insurance carriers have asserted subrogation claims, those claims can be fairly high. So if the claims can be erased by this agreement between the manufacturers and the subrogation carriers, that may be of benefit to women. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Let me ask about another cost item that everybody thinks about and that's attorneys' fees. How will that be handled? </P>

<P>Hon. SAM POINTER, JR.: Well, under this revised settlement program, individual attorneys fees will have to be borne by the individual participant out of her share of whatever she gets. However, I have set certain limits on how much an attorney can charge, assuming that their agreement would otherwise allow for it, and that is that it can be no more than 10 percent of the first $10,000 charged and as to the next $40,000 that's recovered by a woman, no more than 22-1/2 percent and as to amounts above $50,000, no more than 30 percent. It's not saying that the court is authorizing it. It's simply saying if the attorney and the client have agreed on that amount or more, then the court is simply setting these limits, and I've also indicated that that --  there should be no such percentage charge on the explanation award of $3,000. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Well it sounds as if you've been trying to husband the fund for the women. </P>

<P>LESLIE BRYAN: Well this is an issue actually that the plaintiffs' lawyers worked closely with the judge on. As you know, this is not a true settlement agreement, but the plaintiffs' lawyers did have input from time to time and, in fact, went to the judge and urged no fees on explant money and that the judge should be specific about what the fees are. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Well it's time for another break. We'll continue our discussion in a couple of minutes, and just a reminder, here are some telephone numbers and an address to help answer any questions you may have. </P>

<P>[Commercial break] </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: We're talking about the revised breast implant settlement program. I want to ask about implants by two manufacturers. The first is Dow Corning. It is a major player in the breast implant field. It is in bankruptcy. What's the legal status? </P>

<P>Hon. SAM POINTER, JR.: Well first we ought to go back and say that the description we've already given about benefits, potential benefits, are essentially those that if one can prove that she has had at least one Baxter, Bristol or 3M implant, we've assumed that and there's some qualifications. If the person has also had a Dow Corning, one or more --  and there are many people who have had multiple implants --  then the basic benefits under the settlement are reduced by 50 percent as the documents reflect. If the --  at the same time, the person still has a potential claim against Dow Corning. It would have to be pursued through the bankruptcy court. We cannot say whether that claim is going to add money or what the result of that is going to be. If the person has had only a Dow Corning implant, and there are many people like that, then there's nothing under this settlement dealing with that person and her only claim is really going to be related to what can be obtained through the bankruptcy court. </P>

<P>LESLIE BRYAN: Well, Arthur, on that I'd like to say that there is an active tort claimants committee in the bankruptcy court appointed committee. There are eight plaintiffs' lawyers on that committee and one consumer advocate on that committee who are zealously protecting the rights of the women who have Dow Corning claims. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Well spoken, well spoken. Now, the bankruptcy, we also should note, is not before Judge Pointer. It is up in --  </P>

<P>Hon. SAM POINTER, JR.: Michigan. </P>

<P>LESLIE BRYAN: The Eastern District of Michigan. </P>

<P>Hon. SAM POINTER, JR.: It's in the Eastern District of Michigan. </P>

<P>LESLIE BRYAN: Before bankruptcy Judge Specter. [sp?] </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Yes, okay, now, the other manufacturer I wanted to talk about is McGhan. We've --  McGhan's name has come up. </P>

<P>Hon. SAM POINTER, JR.: We've described something about 3M and 3M implants and that being part of the settlement. That's really talking about McGhan 3M implants that were manufactured on or before August the 3rd, 1984. After that date, the McGhan implant business was sold, really, to a separate company. That creates a lot of additional complication in terms of the legalities and obligations and in turn, there is a special program relating to McGhan implants manufactured wholly after August the 2nd by McGhan, but the benefits are more limited. You have to look at the provisions of the agreement, of the notice, in terms of what's there. They simply are far more limited than the ones that would come if you've had Baxter, Bristol or 3M. Without going into the details, that's what the problem is. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Once again, we're driving our viewers to the booklet. Let me ask about children. How are children treated by this settlement?</P>

<P>LESLIE BRYAN: To the extent that a child has a derivative claim, one that is for loss of services of his or her mother, those claims are going to be covered by this revised settlement program. There are no additional benefits for those derivative claims, but they will be covered by this program. To the extent that children have standalone claims, their own claims as a result of injuries they have suffered directly from the breast implants, those claims are preserved and the booklet specifies time periods, either under the rules of the notice or under state law to bring those claims. </P>

<P>ANN COCHRAN: But those claims are preserved outside of this revised settlement program. </P>

<P>LESLIE BRYAN: That's right. </P>

<P>ANN COCHRAN: There are no provisions for those children filing any forms with the claims office or really having any dealings with the revised settlement program. </P>

<P>Hon. SAM POINTER, JR.: The claims office doesn't want to get those claims in, but if there are claims and lawsuits filed, then they're not precluded in any way. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: That's right. They're just outside this particular program. </P>

<P>ANN COCHRAN: Right. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: We've got to go to break. When we come back, we'll talk about the procedures that have to be followed for pursuing one's rights under this agreement. </P>

<P>[Commercial break] </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: What's the procedure, Ann, in terms of people receiving this booklet? What should they do or what should some of them do? </P>

<P>ANN COCHRAN: Well for sort of a longer-term relationship with the claims office, for those who either choose to wait to decide, [the] option that the judge is recommending, or who know that they want to participate and, most importantly, know what kind of implants they have and have actually looked those implants up on Exhibit G to make sure that the magic names Baxter, Bristol, 3M or McGhan are next to them, the blue form becomes the most important at that point. That's the form to send in your proof of --  the proof of that manufacturer or of that particular brand that gets you into the revised settlement program. That is, at least for the initial first six to nine months of this process, the ticket to getting what we call a notification of status letter and that letter is going to give as much information as the claims office has about that person's file. It'll say whether or not their proof has been found to be acceptable or, if not, you know, what the problems are with it. If any claims have been made to describe those problems. We're really trying to provide as much detailed, helpful information so that those who have waited to decide will really have a lot better informational basis upon which to make that decision. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: So this will be a process? </P>

<P>ANN COCHRAN: Yes. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: This will not be an overnight --  </P>

<P>ANN COCHRAN: Right. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: The inevitable question, of course, is when will the checks be written? </P>

<P>ANN COCHRAN: And everybody looks at me. I have to say that in Texas, we'd say that I'm snake bent on that. It seems that for the last year and a half, two years, every time a good faith time estimate has been made to the members of this particular settlement class, something has happened, unforseeable, that made our best faith predictions turn out to be wrong. Just two weeks ago, it was the blizzard of '96 that delayed mailing out our packages. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: So as the cliche goes, you're doing the best you can? </P>

<P>ANN COCHRAN: As soon as we can --  </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: As soon as you can, the check will be in the mail? </P>

<P>ANN COCHRAN: Yeah, but I can't --  I can't, you know, promise another date. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Let me focus now on someone who wants to or is thinking about opting out, of saying no, no thank you. What happens? </P>

<P>LESLIE BRYAN: Well a couple of things. First of all, I think that she needs to think long and hard about whether she's got a lawyer, because if she makes the decision to opt out quickly, the statutes of limitation will start running again very quickly for her. So she needs to be aware of that. But she also needs to be prepared for the inevitable wait for a trial date and she needs to be prepared for what she's going to go through in the process. Now these are good cases. These defendants made defective products, put them on the market and they're in women's bodies. Linda obviously disputes that. I know. That's why a plaintiffs' lawyer --  </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: That's the voice of the lawyer. </P>

<P>LESLIE BRYAN: That's my plaintiffs' lawyer bent. But the benefit --  </P>

<P>LINDA WILLETT: And I'm just as fervent. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: You deny. </P>

<P>LESLIE BRYAN: That's right, she denies. </P>

<P>LINDA WILLETT: Most assuredly. </P>

<P>LESLIE BRYAN: The benefit of the revised settlement program to women is they don't have to prove that their breast implants caused their problem. If they opt out of the settlement and they go to trial, they are going to have to prove whatever damages they're claiming at trial were caused by their breast implants. </P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: If a woman doesn't have a lawyer and wants to explore her rights, is there an organized bar, a place where she can [go] for some advice as to finding a lawyer? </P>

<P>LESLIE BRYAN: Well there are a couple of areas. First of all, there's the claims assistance counsel, and I don't know whether we've given the number yet, but we will, a group of lawyers who will be able to assist women, at least preliminarily, with some of the issues that the revised settlement program presents. To the extent that a woman wants to talk to a lawyer about litigation, the breast implant litigation group of ATLA is working hard to develop a network of lawyers that will be available.</P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Time for another break. When we return, we'll provide telephone numbers and an address one more time for you, so stay with us. </P>

<P>[Commercial break]</P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Welcome back. We hope you have your pen or pencil in hand, because we want to provide additional information about the settlement. If you have not received your notification booklet by February 1st or need any other information concerning the settlement program, please call the claims office at 1-800-600-8311 or 1-713-951-9106. Again, the numbers to call are 1-800-600-8311 or 1-713-951-9106. Or, you can write to the Claims Office, P.O. Box 56666, Houston, Texas 77256. And if you want to learn more about regional informational meetings, you can call 1-800-938-7357. And finally, the number to call for the claims assistance office is 1-513-651-9770. Judge, anything to add? </P>

<P>Hon. SAM POINTER, JR.: I think the main thing is that if people have their own attorneys, that's where they should go first. These are other options in the event they either do not have attorneys or are having difficulty getting information. Certainly go to their own attorneys first.</P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Good night to all four of you, judge, Linda, Ann, Leslie.</P>

<P>LESLIE BRYAN: Good night.</P>

<P>ARTHUR MILLER: Thanks so much for providing this information to our viewers and we hope the process goes as smoothly as the law will permit. Next week, another In Context. Join us. We'll be here. We hope you are, as well.</P>

<P>In this Jan. 2, 1996 complaint, the company that operates Victoria's Secret Catalogue is charged with discriminatory sales practices. Denise Katzman from New York claims that the lingerie company pads its discounts offered to men. At issue is a mailing that offered $25 off any purchase of $75 or more to men and $10 off the same purchase to women. She said that such pricing is considered racketeering under a federal RICO statute. </P>

(212) 316-0968 
 
United States District Court 
Southern District of New York 
 
PLAINTIFF 
DEMANDS TRIAL 
BY JURY 
 
Denise Katzman, for and on behalf of 
herself, and on behalf of all others 
in the class similarly situated, 
 
Plaintiff, 
 
v. 
 
Victoria's Secret Catalogue, division 
of The Limited Inc. 
Leslie H. Wexner, 
Edward G. Razek, 
Cynthia Fedus, 
Betsy Hendrickson, 
 
Defendants. 
 
PLAINTIFF COMPLAINING OF DEFENDANTS ALLEGES:  
 
1. Plaintiff is an adult female resident of the City, County and State 
of New York in this District.  
 
2. Upon information and belief: 
 
A. Victoria's Secret Catalogue is a division of The Limited Inc. 
which is a corporation organized and existing under Delaware law 
with principal office in Ohio doing business in this district.  
 
B. Leslie H. Wexner is the president and controlling executive in 
charge of Victoria's Secret Catalogue ("VSC") and The Limited Inc. 
("Limited") doing business in this district.  
 
C. Edward G. Razek is a vice president and director of marketing for 
VSC and Limited and makes decisions respecting how and where 
and to whom mailings by VSC occur and does business in this 
District,  
 
D. Cynthia Fedus is president of VSC and makes decisions 
respecting how and where and to whom mailings by VSC occur and 
does business in this District,  
 
E. Besty[sic] Hendrickson is director of merchandising of VSC and 
makes decisions respecting how and where and to whom mailings by 
VSC occur and does business in this District.  
 
3. This Court has jurisdiction of this action pursuant to the Racketeer 
influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ("RICO") 18 U.S. C. Sec. 
1961 et. seq. and under 18 U.S.C. Secs. 1341 and 1343 ("Mail Fraud 
Statute") and jurisdiction and 28 U.S. C. Sec. 1338.  Jurisdiction also 
exists in this Court in that this is an action between citizens of 
different states, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1332(a), and the amount in 
controversy is in excess of $50,000.00 exclusive of interest and 
costs.  
 
4. Venue lies in this district under 28 U.S. C. Sec. 1391(b) and 28 
U.S.C. 1391 (c) in that the claims arose in this District and 
defendants do business in this District as heretofore alleged.  
 
5. In December 1995 plaintiff received in the mail a catalogue (CAT-
1) from VSC entitled "WINTER 1996" which stated on the front 
cover "Take $10 Off" "Any Purchase of $75 Or More.  See Order 
Form For Details."  
 
6. On the back cover plaintiff's name appeared and the designation 
"OR CURRENT RESIDENT" together with a box headed SOURCE 
CODE: with the following: WS165726.  
 
7. Upon information and belief the aforesaid SOURCE CODE: 
designated plaintiff as a female in a certain income category with a 
defined disposable income potential and fitting a demographic 
pattern.  
 
8. Said order form in CAT-1 stated: "OFFER: Deduct $10 on any 
purchase of $75 or more.  This offer is valid for catalogue clients, 
this issue only."  
 
9. Upon information and belief the aforesaid catalogue was sent by 
VSC by mail to numerous females fitting into the demographic 
pattern and income category in the same class as plaintiff.  
 
10. Upon information and belief defendants and each of them and all 
of them targeted plaintiff and those in her class with a so-called "$10 
Off" Offer for purchases made from said catalogue of $75 Or More.  
 
11. Upon Information and belief defendants and each of them and all 
of them prepared another catalogue (CAT-2) in December 1995 
which was similar to CAT-1 but stated that the recipient of CAT-2 
could: "Take $25 Off" "Any Purchase of $75 Or More. See Order 
Form For Details."  
 
12. Said order form in CAT-2 stated: "OFFER: Deduct $25 on any 
purchase of $75 or more.  This offer is valid for catalogue clients, 
this issue only."  
 
13. Upon information and belief CAT-2 was mailed to and received 
by male adults whom defendants presumed would be interested in 
purchasing merchandise from CAT-2 and enticed to make a purchase 
of at least $75 and receive a $25 deduction therefrom.  
 
14. Upon information and belief the source code for CAT-2 mailed 
to an adult male recipient listed in the box under SOURCE CODE: 
the following "WS164405" meaning that the recipient of CAT-2 was 
an adult male with a higher income level than plaintiff fitting into a 
different demographic pattern than plaintiff and not in plaintiff's 
class.  
 
15. Based upon a comparison of the offers contained in CAT- 1 and 
in CAT-2, plaintiff and her class have been and are being deprived of 
equal opportunity to receive a larger price discount and deduction 
than the class to whom CAT-2 was mailed resulting in 
discrimination against plaintiff and her class by each and all of 
defendants.  
 
16. Upon information and belief defendants and each of them and all 
of them intentionally, knowingly and wantonly prepared and mailed 
CAT-1 to plaintiff and those in her class with total knowledge that 
the offer in CAT-1 discriminated against plaintiff and her class when 
compared with the offer in CAT-2 of a higher discount and 
deduction when the merchandise offered in both catalogues was the 
same.  
 
17. Defendants and each of them and all of them participated in the 
creation and production and selection of merchandise and discount 
and deduction levels in CAT-1 and CAT-2 and in the selection of 
those recipients of each catalogue to each intended person in each 
targeted class totally cognizant of the discrimination involved.  
 
18. This is not the first time defendants have mailed to various 
unsuspecting consumers and prospective customers catalogues which 
have different offers for the same merchandise preferring one class 
of consumers over another class over the same time period.  
 
19. Upon information and belief in 1994 and 1995 defendants and 
each of them and all of them prepared two versions of the same 
catalogue offering by mail the same merchandise to different classes 
of consumers and recipients at different prices for the same items.  
This insidious and discriminatory practice was the subject of a news 
story on the CBS television station covering the tristate New York- 
New Jersey-Connecticut area.  Defendants admitted the aforesaid 
nefarious improper practices and claimed such was a mistake due to 
a "test marketing" promotion which went astray and promised never 
to do it again.  
 
20. Based upon the current and assumed continued future mailings of 
CAT-1 and CAT-2 set forth herein previously, it is obvious that 
defendants and each of them and all of them have embarked upon 
and continue a campaign over the past years to deceive consumers 
and prospective customers and to arbitrarily divide them into 
stereotypical classes and discriminate against those class and 
members thereof.  
 
21. The acts and activities of defendants and each of them and all of 
them have impacted upon plaintiff and the class in which plaintiff is 
a member and will continue to impact upon plaintiff and members of 
her class and discriminate against them and damage them.  
 
22. Defendants and each of them and all of them have acted together 
and are continuing to act together and upon information and belief 
will continue to act together as part of a planned continuing pattern 
of activity and as part of a continuing enterprise done through a 
continuing pattern of illegal activity and in continuing violation of 
laws.  
 
23. Upon information and belief defendants and each of them and all 
of them have violated and will continue to violate as part of a 
devious continuing plan and pattern the rights of plaintiff and 
members of her class unless prevented by this court.  
 
24. Upon information and belief the acts and activities of all 
defendants have constituted a series of continuing illegal and 
predicate acts in violation of the RICO statute and such acts and 
activity shall be considered racketeering activity under the RICO 
statute, and that such activities and acts by and through defendants 
will continue into the future.  
 
25. Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of herself and all other 
members of her class (heretofore described) who have been solicited 
by mail by defendants and sent CAT-1 and deprived of an 
opportunity to receive a $25 deduction instead of a $10 deduction on 
a $75 purchase.  
 
26. The claims made by plaintiff herein are typical of the claims had 
by the members of the class to which plaintiff belongs and this action 
by plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the rights and interests 
of such class and its members.  
 
27. This is a class action brought by plaintiff as set forth above 
pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  
 
28. The class concerned is so numerous (upon information and belief 
many thousands of members exist) that joinder of all members is 
impractical and they are unknown to plaintiff at this time.    
 
29. Plaintiff will adequately protect and fairly protect the interest of 
all class members whom plaintiff represents.  
 
30. There are questions of law and fact common to the class and the 
rights and remedies possessed by the class and the claims set forth by 
plaintiff herein are typical of the claims that each member of the 
class could assert against each and all of defendants herein.  
 
31. Additionally as stated in Rule 23 (b) this class action is proper 
and feasible in that this action can dispose of the issues which affect 
plaintiff and members of her class and defendants rather than by the 
prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the class 
which might or would create a risk of inconsistent or varying 
adjudications with respect to some individual members of the class 
which would establish incompatible standards of conduct for any or 
all defendants opposing the class.  Further this class action is 
superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient 
adjudication of the controversy since questions of law and fact 
common to the members of the class predominate over any questions 
affecting only individual members of the class.  
 
32. Plaintiff and upon information and belief members of her class 
would have bought merchandise from CAT-1 had it not been for the 
discovery of the larger discount or deduction available to those who 
could buy the same merchandise from CAT-2.  
 
33. Defendants and each of them and all of them represented to 
plaintiff and members of her class that the discounts and deductions 
and prices set forth in CAT-1 were the best available when 
defendants knew that such representations were false and misleading 
and that plaintiff and members of her class would be induced to rely 
and rely thereon and suffer damages by overpaying when compared 
with the discounts and deductions available as set forth in CAT-2.  
 
34. Upon information and belief defendants and each of them and all 
of them mailed and caused the mailing of over one million CAT-1 
catalogues to members of plaintiff's class and over one million CAT-
2 catalogues to others.  
 
35. Upon information and belief over one hundred thousand member 
of plaintiff's class have bought and will buy merchandise from CAT-
1 and be deprived of $15 additional savings.  As a result thereof 
defendants VSC and Limited have improperly and fraudulently taken 
and mulcted over $1,500,000 from class members which must be 
disgorged.  
 
36. There is no conflict as between plaintiff and any other member of 
the class with respect to this action or with respect to the relief 
sought herein and plaintiff is willing and able to protect and 
vindicate the interests of the class herein and its members.  
 
WHEREFORE PLAINTIFF DEMANDS RELIEF AS FOLLOWS 
AGAINST DEFENDANTS AND EACH OF THEM AND ALL OF 
THEM AND THEIR AGENTS, EXECUTIVES AND 
EMPLOYEES:  
 
A. That they be enjoined permanently and forever from mailing and 
disseminating false and fraudulent and misleading catalogues;  
 
B. That they send forthwith to all persons who received CAT-1 a 
copy of CAT-2 and make it available to such persons the higher 
discount and deductions available previously only to CAT-2 
recipients;  
 
C. That they refund forthwith the sum of $15 to each and every 
person who bought from CAT-1 and received only the $10 discount 
and deduction on a $75 order, or give each such person the option 
and choice of taking a $15 credit to be used against future purchases 
of merchandise from future catalogues without any time and other 
restrictions and limitations and without the imposition of any cost 
and expenses for shipping and handling for new orders using said 
credit;  
 
D. That they be assessed and made to pay damages and punitive 
damages in sums to be determined by a jury at trial and that all sums 
so awarded by divided amongst and paid over in equal portions to all 
members of the class;  
 
E. That they account for and pay over in equal portions to all 
members of the class a sum equal to $15 multiplied by all those 
persons to whom CAT-1 was mailed;  
 
F. That they pay to plaintiff and plaintiff be awarded attorney's fees 
in accordance with prevailing law;  
 
G. That they be made to publicly apologize world-wide via 
newspapers, television, radio and the internet for the deceptions 
practiced at times and in such manner as determined by a jury at trial 
herein;  
 
AND that plaintiff and the class represented by plaintiff have such 
other and further and different relief at law and in equity and 
otherwise as may be just and proper in the premises plus (where 
appropriate) interest, costs and disbursements.

<P>The Chrysler Corporation says former chairman Lee Iacocca, while still on the company payroll, gave company secrets to Kirk Kerkorian. This lawsuit, filed December 4, 1995, was the latest salvo in the escalating tensions between the  car maker and its former chairman. The dispute began when Iacocca supported Kerkorian's unsuccessful attempt to take over Chrysler earlier this year.</P>

CHRYSLER CORPORATION'S COMPLAINT AGAINST LEE A. 
IACOCCA FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF 
FIDUCIARY DUTY, ACCOUNTING FOR Prof, AND 
DECLARATORY RELIEF 
 
JURY TRIAL DEMANDED 
 
     Chrysler Corporation ("Chrysler"), a Delaware corporation, for its 
complaint against defendant Lee A. Iacocca ("Iacocca"), alleges, with 
knowledge as to its own acts and upon information and belief as to 
the acts of others, as follows: 
 
    NATURE OF THE CASE 
 
   1. This action arises from the wrongful conduct of Iacocca, a former 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, director, and consultant of 
Chrysler. During his time at Chrysler, Iacocca obtained a vast amount 
of confidential business and financial information about Chrysler, 
including material, nonpublic information (the "confidential 
information"). Iacocca owed Chrysler a legal and contractual duty not 
to disclose that confidential information. Iacocca has breached and is 
continuing to breach those obligations. 
 
   2. Iacocca has breached his fiduciary duties owed to Chrysler by 
disclosing confidential information about Chrysler to Kirk Kerkorian 
("Kerkorian"), a notorious corporate raider whose wholly-owned 
Tracinda Corporation ("Tracinda") is a major Chrysler stockholder. 
These disclosures began while Iacocca was a highly paid consultant to 
Chrysler and a director of Chrysler, if not earlier, and continue today. 
The disclosures, for which Iacocca has received substantial past 
payments and the promise of millions of dollars of future 
compensation, have had the improper aim of providing Kerkorian 
with confidential information that was not available to other 
shareholders.     3. Iacocca has also breached the consulting 
agreement dated June 11, 1992 (the "Consulting Agreement"), in 
which Iacocca agreed to provide consultation services to Chrysler at 
the request of Chrysler's Board of Directors (the "Board") or the 
Chairman and CEO of Chrysler, in return for substantial 
compensation from Chrysler. The Consulting Agreement is attached 
as Exhibit A and incorporated by reference. In the Consulting 
Agreement, Iacocca agreed that he would: (a) act exclusively "in close 
association with the Chairman and CEO and under the general 
auspices of the Board" in all matters involving Chrysler; (b) not 
disclose any material, nonpublic information or other confidential 
information about Chrysler; (c) not associate with others in a manner 
that made him a member of a shareholding "group" having a reporting 
obligation under Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act 
("Exchange Act"); and (d) not conduct himself in any way that, in the 
good faith judgment of Chrysler's Board, would adversely affect or 
conflict with the interests of Chrysler. Iacocca satisfied none of these 
obligations. 
 
   4. Iacocca has unjustifiably made efforts to increase his ownership 
of Chrysler stock through exercise of certain stock options granted to 
him by Chrysler, despite his noncompliance with the express 
contractual preconditions to exercise of the options. Iacocca's option 
agreements made his entitlement to exercise stock options after his 
retirement subject to the conditions that he neither (a) take other 
employment or render services to others without the written consent 
of Chrysler nor (b) conduct himself in a manner adversely affecting 
Chrysler. Iacocca violated these preconditions through such actions as 
providing services to Kerkorian and Tracinda without prior 
authorization, assisting Kerkorian in developing and launching an 
unsolicited takeover bid for Chrysler, persisting in his support of 
Kerkorian's takeover effort even after Chrysler's Board had formally 
declared that the proposed takeover was not in the best interests of the 
company or its shareholders, and making public statements 
disparaging Chrysler and its products. In response to Iacocca's attempt 
to exercise certain options subject to these preconditions, Chrysler's 
Board properly declared that the options were not exercisable, for 
failure to comply with these preconditions. Iacocca nevertheless 
continues wrongly to assert that he is entitled to exercise these 
options. 
 
   5. As a result of Iacocca's wrongful acts, Chrysler has suffered and 
continues to suffer substantial economic and other losses, and 
Chrysler is entitled to: 
 
   a. compensatory and exemplary damages; 
 
   b. the return of compensation and perquisites that Chrysler 
conveyed to Iacocca through 1994, while he was in breach of the 
Consulting Agreement and/or Chrysler policies conceding 
confidential information; 
 
   c. preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against Iacocca's 
continuing use and disclosure of Chrysler's nonpublic information; 
 
   d. an accounting for all profits and other compensation that Iacocca 
has unjustly obtained from Kerkorian and Tracinda in return for 
wrongfully disclosing Chrysler's confidential information; and 
 
   e. a declaration that the Board was legally justified in refusing to 
permit Iacocca to exercise option rights to purchase Chrysler's stock. 
 
    JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
 
   6. This Court has jurisdiction over these claims under Art. VI,  13 of 
the Michigan Constitution and MSA  27A.601, 27A.605; MCL  
600.601, 600.605. 
 
   7.    Venue is proper in this judicial circuit under MSA 27A.1621, 
27A.1629; MCL  600.1621, 600.1629, because defendant Iacocca 
resides in Oakland County. 
 
    THE PARTIES 
 
   8. Plaintiff Chrysler is a corporation organized and existing under 
the laws of the State of Delaware, with executive offices at 800 
Chrysler Drive East, Auburn Hills, Oakland County, Michigan. Other 
executive offices are presently located at 12000 Chrysler Drive, 
Highland Park, Michigan. In 1996, all of Chrysler's executive offices 
will be located at the Oakland County address. Chrysler's 
headquarters have been located in Michigan since 1927, and it 
employs approximately 44,000 people in the State of Michigan. 
Chrysler and its consolidated subsidiaries operate in two principal 
industry segments: automotive operations and financial services. 
Chrysler's automotive operations include the research, design, 
manufacture, assembly and sale of cars, trucks, and related parts and 
accessories. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Chrysler Financial 
Corporation, Chrysler is engaged in wholesale and retail financing for 
Chrysler vehicles, and in property, casualty and other insurance 
businesses. 
 
   9. Defendant Iacocca has been a resident of Michigan since 1947, 
and is presently a resident of Bloomfield Hills, in Oakland County, 
Michigan. Beginning in November 1978, he was continuously 
employed by Chrysler in Michigan. From 1979 through 1992, Iacocca 
was Chrysler's Chairman and CEO. Iacocca was retained by Chrysler 
as a consultant throughout 1993 and 1994, and he remained a director 
until September 1993. 
 
 ALLEGATIONS COMMON TO ALL CLAIMS 
 
 Iacocca's Obligations To Chrysler 
 
   10. After joining Chrysler in November of 1978 as President and 
Chief Operating Officer, Iacocca became Chairman and CEO in 
September 1979. He held those positions for 13 years, until the end of 
1992. Iacocca was employed by Chrysler at the will of Chrysler's 
Board, which set his compensation. In Iacocca's career with Chrysler, 
his total compensation, exclusive of unexercised options, exceeded 
$90 million. 
 
   11. Iacocca had unfettered access to every aspect of Chrysler's 
operations and to all of its confidential information. He oversaw 
numerous major financial transactions; oversaw negotiations with 
unions, banks, suppliers, and regulators; and controlled the 
development of new vehicles and new product lines. Iacocca was 
privy to highly sensitive financial data, debt information, pricing 
strategies, investing and stock repurchasing strategies, marketing and 
manufacturing strategies, long-term financial and operating 
projections, and other kinds of confidential information associated 
with the management and business of Chrysler, including information 
about Chrysler's assessments, plans and strategies relating to 
Kerkorian and Tracinda. 
 
   12. While CEO of Chrysler, Iacocca presented himself to the public 
as the virtual personification of Chrysler. He pursued extensive 
activities to make his profile to the public even more prominent than 
that of other chief executive officers of major corporations. Iacocca's 
public positions respecting Chrysler consequently took on particularly 
strong public significance. His public pronouncements were widely 
quoted, and he sought to cultivate public association of him with 
Chrysler through his books, personal appearances, advertisements and 
other public statements. Today, he remains publicly associated with 
Chrysler and its products. 
 
   13. Chrysler expected and trusted Iacocca to be faithful to Chrysler 
and to represent exclusively its interests, rather than his own interests. 
As a Chrysler officer, director, employee, and consultant, Iacocca had 
fiduciary obligations to act in good faith and with undivided loyalty to 
Chrysler and its shareholders. In order to fulfill these duties, he was 
required to exercise his best efforts on behalf of Chrysler, to refrain 
from unauthorized disclosure of confidential information concerning 
Chrysler, to abide by Chrysler's policies, and to refrain from acting in 
a manner adverse to or inconsistent with Chrysler's interests. 
 
   14. Chrysler's official policies required Iacocca, like all its officers 
and employees, to: 
 
   a. release no confidential information without the review and 
concurrence of the Public Affairs Office; 
 
   b. refrain from disclosing nonpublic information that might 
materially affect the market price of Chrysler's securities; and 
 
   c. handle requests for information from shareholders with 
impartiality and on an equal basis. 
 
   15. Chrysler, at all relevant times, has had codes of ethics for 
employees. The codes, which were distributed throughout Chrysler 
under Iacocca's signature, make employees responsible for protecting 
Chrysler's property (including confidential information) from 
unauthorized use. The codes of ethics also prohibit disclosure of 
inside information, which the codes expressly characterize as 
proprietary to Chrysler. The codes of ethics clearly warn that 
violations can result in disciplinary action (including termination) or 
in legal proceedings. 
 
   16.   On June 11, 1992, in anticipation of his retirement as 
Chairman and CEO, Iacocca signed a Consulting Agreement that took 
effect upon his retirement on December 31, 1992. Under the 
agreement, Iacocca was to be paid $500,000 per year and to receive 
the perquisites available to Chrysler's most senior executives, 
including an office, staff support, accident insurance, reimbursement 
of expenses, and use of corporate aircraft and security services. In 
return for such compensation and perquisites, Iacocca was to provide 
consultation services to Chrysler at the request of the Board or the 
Chairman and CEO of Chrysler. 
 
   17. Iacocca expressly undertook in the Consulting Agreement: (a) to 
act exclusively "in close association with the Chairman and CEO and 
under the general auspices of the Board"; (b) to maintain, without 
future time limit, the confidentiality of material, nonpublic 
information concerning the business and affairs of Chrysler; (c) not to 
associate with any person or entity in a manner that subjected him or 
any "group" to a reporting obligation pursuant to Section 13(d) of the 
Exchange Act; (d) not to "render services" that were "detrimental or 
inimical to the interests of Chrysler"; and (e) not to conduct himself in 
any manner that "in the good faith judgment of the Company's Board, 
adversely affects or conflicts with the interests of Chrysler." 
 
   18. Iacocca continued to receive confidential information about 
Chrysler during the period of his consultancy, even after he resigned 
from the Board in September 1993, and continued to have virtually 
unlimited access to any information he wanted about the company. 
 
   19. After Iacocca's Consulting Agreement terminated at the end of 
1994 he continued to have a duty not to use or disclose confidential 
information obtained as a director, officer, employee or consultant to 
Chrysler. 
 
   20. Iacocca was also granted stock option rights. The options are 
subject to the terms and conditions of Chrysler's Stock option Plan, 
which was initially approved by the Board and shareholders in 1972 
(the "Stock Option Plan"), and its successor, the Stock Compensation 
Plan, which was initially approved by the Board and shareholders in 
1991 (the "1991 Stock Compensation Plan"). Copies of the Stock 
Option Plan and the 1991 Stock Compensation Plan are attached as 
Exhibits B and C, respectively, and incorporated by reference. Section 
8 of the Stock Option Plan provides that any exercise of option rights 
after the termination of Iacocca's employment is subject to two 
conditions precedent, which are applicable to each option holder: (a) 
that he takes no other employment and renders no services to others 
without Chrysler's written consent and (b) that he does not conduct 
himself in a manner "adversely affecting" Chrysler. Section 5(b)(vii) 
of the 1991 Stock Compensation Plan imposes the same two 
conditions precedent on the exercise of options by all participants of 
that plan. 
 
   21. At all times since November of 1978, Iacocca knew or should 
have known that Chrysler relied upon his character and integrity in 
fulfilling his obligations. Chrysler relied upon such statements as the 
following, written by Iacocca in 1988: 
 
  "More than on any law, we have to rely on the character and ethics 
of the people. " The History Of Iacocca's Relationship With 
Kerkorian And Tracinda 
 
   22. Iacocca first met Kerkorian in 1989 at the Gulfstream Park 
racetrack in Hollywood, Florida. 
 
   23. At around the same time, Iacocca considered attempting a 
management-led buyout of Chrysler and contacted Kerkorian to 
discuss whether Kerkorian would be interested in participating in a 
buyout. 
 
   24. Iacocca made that overture without consulting the Board and 
without considering whether the approach to Kerkorian was in the 
best interest of Chrysler's 
 
     Defendant Iacocca's statements in 1988 are quotations from Lee 
Iacocca, Talking Straight (Bantam Books 1988). shareholders, as 
opposed to his own personal interests. Kerkorian was known at the 
time to be a corporate raider with a record of initiating widely 
criticized investments in companies and engaging in transactions that 
resulted in greater wealth to Kerkorian at enormous cost and harm to 
the companies, and their other shareholders, debt holders, and 
employees. Iacocca was fully aware that such ramifications resulted 
from the type of strategies Kerkorian was known for employing. 
Iacocca had written in 1988: 
 
      "All I know is what I see--and what I don't.... I see billions of 
dollars tied up in new corporate deal Jo keep the raiders at bay while 
research and development goes begging . . . I also see a huge share of 
America's best management talent wasted on takeover games when it 
should be devoted to strengthening the industrial base of the country. 
 
   "But I don't see the raiders creating jobs. I don't see them boosting 
productivity. And worst of all I don't see them doing a single thing to 
help  America compete in the world. " Although Iacocca abandoned 
the buyout strategy as unworkable, his overture to Kerkorian 
apparently spawned Kerkorian's interest in Chrysler, because shortly 
thereafter, in October of 1990, Kerkorian began acquiring Chrysler 
stock through Western High Income Advisors, a Kerkorian shell 
corporation. By the end of November 1990, Kerkorian had acquired 
almost 5% of Chrysler's outstanding common stock. At that point, 
Kerkorian met with Iacocca to discuss his plans for Chrysler. Iacocca 
reported to Chrysler's senior management and Board that Kerkorian 
had professed great admiration for Iacocca, had told Iacocca that he 
planned to acquire more of Chrysler's stock, and had requested 
Iacocca's advice as to how he should proceed. 25. By December 12, 
1990, Kerkorian had acquired over 9% of Chrysler's outstanding 
common stock. The Board had legitimate concerns about this 
acquisition, in light of Kerkorian's reputation, his failure to adhere to 
initial promises about not acquiring further stock, and his secretive 
and aggressive initial acquisition of Chrysler's shares. In December of 
1990, Chrysler's Board entrusted Iacocca with representing Chrysler 
in its dealings with Kerkorian, unaware of any facts that would 
indicate Iacocca was unworthy of such trust. 
 
   26. Iacocca, who has admitted that Kerkorian is motivated only by 
"the love of the game, " repeatedly conferred with him regarding 
Kerkorian's investment in Chrysler. On more than one occasion, they 
discussed the buyout strategy that Iacocca and Kerkorian first had 
talked about in 1989. Kerkorian also sought to have Iacocca disclose 
confidential information, such as how long Iacocca intended to 
remain at Chrysler and whether Chrysler was considering mergers 
with other corporations. Kerkorian made clear to Iacocca that he 
sought such information for purposes related to his investment 
strategy. Although Chrysler's Board had directed Iacocca to treat 
Kerkorian as hostile and adverse to Chrysler, and although Iacocca 
understood that he was expected not to support Kerkorian's 
acquisition efforts without prior Board approval, Iacocca engaged 
Kerkorian in at least three one-on-one conversations between January 
and October of 1991 about a possible Iacocca-led and Kerkorian-
sponsored buyout of Chrysler. Iacocca's And Kerkorian's Efforts To 
Delay Or Alter Iacocca's Retirement 
 
   27. In September of 1991, Chrysler's Board, after carefully 
weighing the interests of Chrysler and its shareholders, asked Iacocca 
to retire as of December 31, 1992. Iacocca did not accept this decision 
gracefully and resisted the Board's determination to relieve him of the 
trappings of office. Later that month he met with Kerkorian and, 
without Board authorization, again discussed a possible buyout of 
Chrysler. Since that time, Iacocca has not hidden his disdain for the 
Board's decision and for certain members of the Board who played a 
role in compelling his retirement. In defiance of the Board's 
directives, Iacocca has sought in various ways to restore to himself 
the greatest possible measures of the power he held as Chrysler's 
Chairman and CEO. 28. During the summer of 1992, Iacocca raised 
the subject of his upcoming retirement with Kerkorian while staying 
on Kerkorian's private yacht during the Olympic Games in Barcelona, 
Spain. By the end of their Barcelona meeting, Iacocca and Kerkorian 
had decided to work together to pressure Chrysler to increase 
Iacocca's influence after he retired. Soon afterwards, on August 6, 
1992, Kerkorian wrote to Chrysler's Board proclaiming that his 
interest in Chrysler was tied to Iacocca's continuing role as CEO. It 
was reported that, in making this statement, "Mr. Kerkorian may be 
acting at the direct or implied request of Mr. Iacocca." In contrast to 
his personal resistance to the Board's directive that he retire, Iacocca 
had written as follows about CEOs who will not relinquish their 
power: "[A] CEO has to know when it's time to step down. A strong 
leader in good health never wants to leave. He operates with blinders 
on about this issue and when you mention retirement to him he gets 
the shakes. ... your attitude becomes that you're in good health and the 
company can't do without you then you've overstayed your welcome. 
" Kerkorian indicated to Chrysler that he had expected Iacocca to 
remain Chairman through 1994 and raised the possible need for a 
Kerkorian representative -- obviously Iacocca -- on Chrysler's Board. 
Kerkorian withdrew this demand only after receiving assurances that 
Iacocca would continue as a Director and as Chairman of the Board's 
Executive Committee following his retirement. 
 
   29. In clear violation of Iacocca's ongoing fiduciary duty and the 
Consulting Agreement, Iacocca disclosed confidential information 
regarding Chrysler to Kerkorian at least as early as the period of 
Iacocca's consultancy. These communications did not take place at the 
direction or under the supervision of Chrysler's Chairman and CEO, 
and were not under the auspices of the Board, as the Consulting 
Agreement required. Iacocca had numerous discussions with 
Kerkorian without ever obtaining prior authorization and without 
notifying Chrysler either before or after the fact. Iacocca used the 
resources available as a result of his consulting position -- including 
continued access to confidential information, office space, staff 
support, telephones, and expense accounts -- to discuss, develop, and 
further his plans with Kerkorian and Tracinda. 
 
   30. In August of 1994, Iacocca and Kerkorian met to discuss a joint 
strategy respecting Chrysler with Robert Day (head of the Trust 
Company of the West) and Gary Wilson (currently co-chairman of 
Northwest Airlines Corporation and an experienced leveraged buyout 
specialist) at Day's vacation home in Massachusetts. Among other 
things, they discussed possible methods of increasing the short-term 
market price of Chrysler shares. They also discussed the possibility of 
a buyout of Chrysler that would gamer them substantial profits and 
restore Iacocca to a position of leadership and power. Throughout 
these discussions and the planning described above, which occurred 
during the period of Iacocca's Consulting Agreement with Chrysler, 
Iacocca provided confidential information to the participants, and 
otherwise assisted them in considering how to achieve a leveraged 
buyout of Chrysler. Iacocca participated in this meeting and provided 
this information without prior authorization from Chrysler. He did not 
report the meeting to Chrysler at any time. His participation in the 
meeting was contrary to his fiduciary duties to Chrysler and to his 
obligations under the Consulting Agreement. 
 
   31. In connection with the Massachusetts meeting, Iacocca used his 
position within Chrysler to obtain a list of Chrysler's largest 
shareholders, without disclosing the true reasons why he wanted that 
list. After receiving the list, Iacocca provided that information to 
Kerkorian, Day and Wilson. 
 
   32. In the months following the Massachusetts meeting, Wilson and 
one of his associates worked to develop a financial model for a 
proposed leveraged buyout of Chrysler. With Kerkorian's 
encouragement, Iacocca provided extensive confidential information 
to assist in the development of that model, once again without 
disclosing to anyone at Chrysler that he was participating in such 
discussions. 
 
   33.   On November 14, 1994, after extensive consultation with 
Iacocca, Kerkorian filed under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act for 
clearance to increase his holdings of Chrysler's stock to 15%. On the 
same day, Kerkorian also wrote a letter to Chrysler's Board, 
demanding that Chrysler: (a) repeal or loosen the protective measures 
in its shareholders' rights plan, (b) issue a two-for-one stock split, (c) 
buy back a significant portion of its outstanding common stock, and 
(d) increase the dividends on its stock. These demands echoed 
positions that Iacocca had asserted in a May 1994 letter addressed to 
the Board, but also provided to Kerkorian. Kerkorian threatened to 
initiate appropriate action, including possible litigation, if his 
demands were not met by December 15, 1994. In an interview dated 
April 14, 1995, Iacocca admitted that his work with Kerkorian leading 
to Tracinda's April 1995 purported offer to take over Chrysler grew 
out of this November 14 request: "[t]his all started [in November of 
1994] when [Kerkorian] tried to get the dividend up.... [Kerkorian] 
looked at me and said, 'Are you happy?' No? Then it centers on: Do 
you [Chrysler] need $7.5 billion in cash." Despite the close 
cooperation, information exchanges and joint strategic efforts of 
Iacocca and Kerkorian that were taking place during the period, 
Kerkorian's Hart-Scott-Rodino filing and his three Schedule 13D 
filings in late 1994 did not disclose that Iacocca was acting in concert 
with Kerkorian. Iacocca also failed to file a Schedule 13D at this time 
revealing his relationship to Kerkorian and their joint plans. 
 
   34. In mid-December of 1994, during a discussion with Chrysler's 
current Chairman and CEO, Robert Eaton, Kerkorian urged Chrysler 
management to consider a buyout of Chrysler. Eaton rejected the 
suggestion. Iacocca did not cease his activities after learning that 
Chrysler's CEO had indicated that Chrysler was not interested in a 
buyout. Instead, Iacocca continued to provide confidential 
information to Kerkorian and others, and to work on achieving the 
result he knew Chrysler did not consider to be in its shareholders' best 
interest -- without disclosing his activities to Chrysler or its Board. 
The Attempted Takeover Of Chrysler 
 
   35. In March of 1995, Wilson sought and obtained another meeting 
with Chrysler's senior management, indicating that he had been 
participating in discussions with Iacocca and that, at Iacocca's 
recommendation, he had a different proposal to discuss. The proposal, 
which contained and was purported to be based on financial analyses 
that Iacocca had significantly assisted in developing, was for a buyout 
in which Iacocca would provide substantial guidance. Chrysler 
representatives al: the meeting expressed no interest in pursuing this 
proposal. On April 10, 1995, Kerkorian's representatives met with 
Chrysler's management to try to persuade them to join a leveraged 
buyout based on the model hat Wilson had developed in consultation 
with Iacocca. Again, Chrysler's management disclaimed any interest. 
36. On April 12, 1995, Kerkorian sent an unsolicited letter to Eaton 
purporting to make an offer to buy all outstanding Chrysler shares for 
$55, based on a model that Wilson had developed in consultation with 
Iacocca, and publicly announced his intention to buy the company. 
Iacocca provided his services and his knowledge in the development 
of this unsolicited purported offer without seeking or obtaining from 
Chrysler any authorization to provide such services or information. 
37. In initiating the purported offer, Kerkorian sought to sway public 
support and overcome his negative image as a raider who enriches 
himself at the expense of companies, their shareholders, and other 
stakeholders by asserting that Iacocca, by virtue of his knowledge of 
Chrysler, legitimized the offer. In presenting Iacocca in this way, 
Tracinda made clear that it viewed the information Iacocca had 
conveyed as not publicly known, highly detailed and of a nature and 
scope that gave Tracinda an informational advantage over other 
Chrysler shareholders. Tracinda executive Alex Yemenidjian, 
referring to Iacocca, stated: 
 
 "[I]n an advisory capacity, given the extensive knowledge that Lee 
has in the car business, he could certainly be a very good advisor to 
us, and obviously we don't know as much about the car business as 
Lee does. In fact, very few people in the world know as much about 
the car business as he does, and I think that the fact that he is prepared 
to risk his own money in [the] transaction gives us a lot of comfort, 
because he knows exactly every nook and cranny of this company.... 
Lee Iacocca is a perfect example of an investor who is not only 
prepared to put a substantial amount of his net worth on the line but 
also because of his knowledge of the business to us we consider that a 
strategic investor." (emphasis added) 
 
    Iacocca similarly encouraged the press to understand that he was 
working closely with Kerkorian and Tracinda, and that his 
comprehensive and unique knowledge about Chrysler made 
Tracinda's proposed buyout more viable. 38. In the days after 
Tracinda announced its purported offer, Iacocca issued public 
statements that were critical of Chrysler and its products. These 
remarks, like other public criticisms Iacocca had volunteered during 
the period of his Consulting Agreement, were harmful to Chrysler and 
its shareholders. The remarks were made without prior authorization 
by or consultation with Chrysler and were made for the purpose of 
disparaging and destabilizing the company. 
 
    39.   Iacocca has admitted that Tracinda's April 12, 1995 purported 
offer was made to alert investors to the company's value in hopes that 
other buyers would bid even more." As Iacocca observed in 1988: 
 
    "In observing these raiders I've noticed a curious phenomenon. 
When they're on the attack they shout their holier-than-thou pitch 
about making companies more efficient liquefying capital and 
defending the helpless stockholder. But a funny thing happens to 
these dedicated missionaries once you cross their palms with a little 
dough -- they go away. ... [you might as well put anyone who appeals 
to you into play. ' That's the new jargon down on Wall Street. Another 
term for it is unadulterated greed. " Indeed, Yemenidjian admitted 
that "[t]here is a number at which we would be sellers rather than 
buyers." This approach was consistent with Kerkorian's 25-year track 
record of converting partial or controlling interests in major 
corporations into multi-million dollar personal profits without regard 
to the interests of those corporations or their other shareholders. 
 
    40. Recognizing the threat of severe damage to Chrysler posed by 
the purported takeover offer, all of the credit rating agencies 
immediately voiced concerns about Chrysler's ability to service its 
debt and to survive the next downtown in the automobile market. 
Standard & Poor's Corporation placed Chrysler on "credit watch with 
negative implications." Moody's Investors Service put Chrysler debt 
on "watch." Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Company placed the debt of 
both Chrysler and Chrysler Financial Corporation on "review of! 
possible downgrade." Such actions by the ratings agencies prompted 
an increase in the interest rates on Chrysler's current debt. 
Renegotiation of an advantageous new revolving credit facility by 
Chrysler Financial Corporation was interrupted in mid- stream when 
lenders insisted on new covenants to protect against the prospect of a 
financially weakened Chrysler. 
 
   41. The reaction to the purported April 1995 offer from financial 
analysts, Chrysler's lenders, suppliers, and dealers, the United Auto 
Workers and others was uniformly negative. The proposal was 
announced without any financing in place, and Iacocca and Kerkorian 
were unable to line up financing and equity investors to support the 
buyout. After initially responding that Chrysler was not for sale on 
April 12, Chrysler's Board definitively rejected the purported offer on 
April 26. Despite the declarations of the Board respecting its view 
that the proposed transaction was adverse to Chrysler and its 
shareholders, Iacocca continued his relationship with Kerkorian, 
continued giving information to Kerkorian and continued to 
participate in a takeover of Chrysler. Kerkorian's purported offer 
remained open, with Iacocca's participation, until Kerkorian withdrew 
it on May 31, 1995. Iacocca continued to work to further Kerkorian's 
adverse purposes even after the purported offer was withdrawn. 
 
    42. Iacocca's conduct affected Chrysler adversely in numerous 
ways, including that Chrysler's management was required to expend 
valuable time and resources to address and defend against Tracinda's 
purported buyout proposal (which was neither adequate nor in the 
best interests of Chrysler's shareholders), that Chrysler was required 
to incur additional costs in securing loans and placing debt as a result 
of the purported offer, that Chrysler must defend numerous class 
action lawsuits filed in the wake of the purported offer, and that 
Chrysler's dealers were harmed in their ability to sell the company's 
products by Iacocca's disparaging remarks. 43. Throughout the period 
of his developing relationship with Kerkorian and in the course of 
divulging Chrysler's confidential information, Iacocca knew or should 
have known that his participation in their self-serving plans violated 
his duties to Chrysler and was not in Chrysler's or its shareholders' 
best interests. Iacocca's writings from 1988 acknowledge that the 
interests of Chrysler and its shareholders would not be served, as 
follows: 
 
  These raiders were really interested in saving American business 
from is incompetent management where were they back in 1980 when 
Chrysler was flat on its back. One thing I never had to worry about in 
those days was a raider coming around because Chrysler wasn't worth 
looting. ... You see the typical takeover target isn't a company in 
trouble. It's a company with a solid asset base low debt consistent 
profits and a few bucks in the bank to help it get through the next 
business downturn. ... When I went to school we called that good 
management."' Iacocca's Compensation From Tracinda 
 
 44.   A Tracinda Schedule 13D filing in April of 1995 revealed for 
the first time the extent of Iacocca's relationship with Kerkorian and 
that Iacocca would be highly compensated by Kerkorian for his role. 
In a June 1995 Schedule 13D Amendment, Iacocca and Kerkorian 
disclosed that Iacocca and Tracinda had formalized Iacocca's 
compensation arrangements. Iacocca's package included a 
"Consulting Agreement" that provided and continues to provide 
Iacocca with $41,666.67 per month for his consulting services related 
exclusively to Kerkorian's interest in Chrysler, plus a "Value Sharing 
Agreement," pursuant to which he is to receive 4% of the amount by 
which the market value of 32 million of Tracinda's Chrysler shares 
exceeds $47 per share when they are sold or, if they are not sold, at 
the end of four years. To protect Iacocca from the economic risk of 
the breaches of his contractual and fiduciary duties owed to Chrysler, 
the Value Sharing Agreement also provided that Tracinda would 
indemnify Iacocca against the consequences of such wrongdoing. 
These exorbitant payments and extensive indemnification provisions 
reflect compensation for Iacocca's willingness to make Chrysler's 
confidential information available to Kerkorian and Tracinda. 
 
   45. The Value Sharing Agreement memorializes that Iacocca 
essentially sold to Kerkorian and Tracinda the right to control 
Iacocca's actions with respect to Chrysler and the performance of 
Iacocca's obligations to Chrysler. Iacocca's compensation from 
Tracinda can be completely terminated if Iacocca contacts Chrysler or 
takes any action with respect to Chrysler that is not specifically 
directed by Tracinda, with very limited exceptions. Iacocca's 
Attempts To Exercise His Stock Options. And Continuing 
Involvement With Kerkorian And Tracinda 
 
   46. Immediately following his entry into the Consulting and Value 
Sharing Agreements with Kerkorian, Iacocca informed Chrysler on 
June 28, 1995, of his intention to exercise options for 112,500 shares 
of Chrysler stock, pursuant to the stock option agreements Chrysler 
and Iacocca entered into while Iacocca was a Chrysler employee. 
Chrysler responded by providing to Iacocca the opportunity to explain 
why his prior actions did not violate the conditions precedent to his 
exercise of those options. In his reply, Iacocca did not deny that his 
activities constituted rendering services to Kerkorian and were 
unauthorized; nor did he offer to sever his ties with Kerkorian. 
Instead, he challenged Chrysler's right to enforce the provisions of the 
Stock Option Plan. After considering all relevant information, 
Chrysler's Stock Option Committee (which is comprised of three 
independent directors) and the full Board unanimously determined 
that Iacocca's attempt to exercise his options should be rejected 
because of his noncompliance with the conditions precedent to the 
options' exercise. Chrysler's Stock Option Plan vests the Board with 
"full power and authority to interpret and construe" the Plan, and 
provides that the Board's actions undertaken in good faith are "final 
and conclusive." Iacocca has persisted in contending that he is entitled 
to exercise the options, despite the fact that his own writings support 
the Board's decision and acknowledge that the purported take over of 
Chrysler was contrary to Chrysler's best interests. In 1988, Iacocca 
wrote: 
 
    "My other unwavering rule is that I won't do an unfriendly merger. 
That's a mind-set of mine. Maybe somebody who succeeds me will 
attempt a hostile merger but I just can't. To me it goes against human 
nature not just my nature. It's an aberration to come in and tell people 
that you're going to take them over whether they like it or not. That's 
being the schoolyard bully.... Things had gone entirely too far in Wall 
Street's version of Monopoly. ... Were [corporate raiders] really Robin 
Hood and his Merry Men as they claimed? Or were they Genghis Han 
and the Mongol hordes?" 
 
    47.   On September 5, 1995, Tracinda announced that it had 
appointed Jerome B. York as Tracinda's Vice Chairman and, like 
Iacocca, as a director of Kerkorian's GM Grand, Inc. When Iacocca 
was Chairman and CEO of Chrysler, York had been Chrysler's Chief 
Financial Officer. Since York's hiring, he and Iacocca have continued 
to speak regularly to each other -- at least "twice a week" according to 
public statements by York -- and to Kerkorian's other advisors about 
Chrysler's business and about Kerkorian's investment in Chrysler. 
 
  48.   On October 25, 1995, Iacocca and the other members of the 
Kerkorian group" filed a Schedule 13D amendment, indicating that 
Tracinda has requested that Chrysler undertake certain actions dealing 
with control of Chrysler, including the following: 
 
   a. Board membership for York and two other persons mutually 
agreeable to Chrysler and Tracinda; 
 
   b. Requiring shareholder approval of issuances of significant 
amounts of Chrysler's blank check preferred stock and other block 
placements of voting stock; and 
 
   c. Raising the threshold under the company's poison pill rights plan 
from 15% to 20%. 
 
   49.   On November 3, 1995, Iacocca and Tracinda entered into an 
agreement designed to support Iacocca in litigation over his assertion 
of entitlement to exercise the options, and to provide Iacocca with 
protection against economic loss resulting because the options are not 
exercisable, as a consequence of Iacocca's dealings with Tracinda. 
The agreement provides that Tracinda will reimburse Iacocca for up 
to $2 million in potential legal fees in an action against Chrysler over 
his stock options. Moreover, Iacocca and his attorneys (who must be 
reasonably acceptable to Tracinda) are required to "coordinate and 
consult with Tracinda and its legal counsel in connection" with the 
action. In the event there is not an entirely favorable outcome of the 
action, Tracinda will pay to Iacocca the difference between $42 
million and what he has received, including previous payments under 
the Value Sharing Agreement. In the event Iacocca does not receive a 
value of at least $42 million (through a favorable outcome of the 
action plus values based on his stock options), Tracinda will also 
make payments to Iacocca under the Value Sharing Agreement 
Tracinda told the press it was "standing behind a good friend" as the 
purported rationale for underwriting Iacocca's conduct. The result of 
the agreement is essentially that Iacocca's economic risk as to any 
interest in Chrysler stock options is substantially diminished, to the 
extent the risk is actually being taken by Tracinda and Kerkorian. 
 
   50.   On November 21, 1995, Tracinda filed with the SEC 
preliminary proxy materials in which Tracinda advocates proposals 
related to control of the company, including placing York on the 
Chrysler Board, increasing the size of the Board, formation of a 
committee to review cash retention policies, restrictions on issuance 
of Chrysler's "blank check" preferred stock and block placements of 
common stock, and changes to the company's poison pill rights plan. 
 
   51. Iacocca continues as of the date of this Complaint to provide 
services to Kerkorian and Tracinda without Chrysler's approval. 
 
   FIRST CLAIM 
 
    (Breach Of Contract) 
 
   52. Chrysler repeats and realleges each and every allegation 
contained in paragraphs 1 through 51 of this Complaint as if fully set 
forth herein. 
 
   53.   Iacocca's June 11, 1992, Consulting Agreement with Chrysler 
imposed the following obligations, among others, upon Iacocca: 
 
  "Confidentiality. You agree to maintain the confidentiality of any 
material, nonpublic information concerning the business and affairs of 
the Company which is disclosed to you or to which you otherwise 
become privy in connection with the performance of the services and 
duties contemplated hereby. You further agree that you will not 
publish, either as author or co-author, without the prior written 
approval of the Company, any confidential information concerning 
the business and affairs of the Company which may be shared with or 
developed by you in the performance of your services hereunder." 
 
  "Noncomplete. During the term of this agreement, you agree that 
you will not accept employment which is, or render services which 
are, detrimental or inimical to the interests of Chrysler, nor will you 
conduct yourself or affiliate or otherwise associate with any person, 
firm or entity in a manner which subjects you or any 'group' to a 
reporting obligation pursuant to section 13(d) of the [Exchange Act] . 
Board, adversely affects or conflicts with the interests of Chrysler. " 
 
    The Consulting Agreement also provided that Iacocca's activities 
relating to Chrysler were to be pursued exclusively "in close 
association with the Chairman and CEO and under the general 
auspices of the Board." 
 
   54. Implied in this agreement is a covenant of good faith and fair 
dealing. 
 
   55. Despite Chrysler's due performance of its obligations and all 
conditions to Iacocca's performance, Iacocca materially breached the 
express and implied provisions of the Consulting Agreement by: 
 
   a. disclosing, without Chrysler's consent or knowledge, Chrysler's 
confidential information (including material information) to outside 
parties, including Kerkorian and Tracinda; 
 
   b. making disparaging statements about Chrysler and its products, 
in a manner contrary to the interests of Chrysler and its shareholders; 
 
   c. conducting himself in a manner adverse to and in conflict with 
Chrysler's interests; 
 
   d. associating with others whose interests were adverse to and in 
conflict with Chrysler's; consulting with, and performing services for, 
Kerkorian and Tracinda in connection with their investments and 
joining with them in a group that he should have reported under 
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act; 
 
    f. performing these actions independently of, and without 
disclosure to, Chrysler's CEO or the Board; and 
 
   g. otherwise acting in ways that were inimical to Chrysler's 
interests. 
 
   56. As a result of his breaches of contract, Iacocca has proximately 
caused actual and consequential damages to Chrysler. The damages to 
which Chrysler is entitled include, but are not limited to, the return of 
all compensation paid to Iacocca by Chrysler during the period of 
such wrongdoing, all costs incurred by Chrysler in addressing and 
defending against the purported buyout proposal put forward by 
Iacocca and Kerkorian, all additional costs incurred by Chrysler in 
securing loans and placing debt as a result of the purported buyout 
offer, and other damages to be determined. Additionally, with respect 
to Iacocca's continuing use and disclosure of Chrysler's nonpublic 
information, Chrysler has been irreparably injured, has no adequate 
remedy at law, and is entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive 
relief against Iacocca. 
 
   SECOND CLAIM 
 
 (Breach Of Fiduciary Duty) 
 
   57. Chrysler repeats and realleges each and every allegation 
contained in paragraphs I through 51 of this Complaint as if fully set 
forth herein. 
 
   58. Since November of 1978, Iacocca has had extensive knowledge 
of Chrysler and Chrysler's confidential information. Indeed, Iacocca 
has said he knows more about the inner workings of Chrysler than 
virtually anyone else. As an employee and former employee, Iacocca 
has had (and continues to have) fiduciary duties to Chrysler and its 
shareholders to act in good faith and with undivided loyalty for 
Chrysler's benefit, which duties were particularly substantial due to 
Iacocca's public prominence as the virtual personification of Chrysler. 
 
    59. Chrysler reposed in Iacocca its trust and confidence during the 
more than 13 years when Iacocca was Chairman and CEO of 
Chrysler, during the nine months after his retirement when he 
continued as a director of Chrysler, during the two years of his 
consultancy, and during the period following his consultancy when he 
continued to possess confidential information. Iacocca recognized and 
voluntarily invited Chrysler's trust and confidence, and undertook to 
act on behalf of Chrysler. Iacocca has a continuing duty not to 
disclose or utilize the confidential information concerning Chrysler 
that has come into his possession . 
 
   60. It has at all times been Chrysler's policy to maintain the secrecy 
of its confidential information and to prohibit disclosure of such 
information. It has also been Chrysler's established policy to maintain 
the confidentiality of information "when its release would be 
detrimental to the competitive, financial or other business interests of 
the Corporation." Chrysler's policy calls for the review and 
concurrence of Chrysler's Public Affairs Office before any such 
confidential information is disclosed outside Chrysler. 
 
   61. Even while holding himself out as Chrysler's faithful fiduciary, 
Iacocca, for his own benefit and for the benefit of Kerkorian and 
Tracinda, misused the confidential information that Chrysler entrusted 
to him by communicating it to Kerkorian. 
 
   62. Iacocca has breached his fiduciary duty to Chrysler and to its 
other shareholders, including his duties of good faith and undivided 
loyalty. Additionally, during the course of his employment by and 
consultancy with Chrysler, Iacocca learned confidential information 
constituting Chrysler trade secrets. Such information included, but is 
not limited to, financial and economic policies and procedures; 
methods of operating, planning and forecasting; future products and 
business plans; corporate strategy and methods of strategic planning, 
economic forecasting analyses; assessments, plans and strategies 
relating to Kerkorian and Tracinda; and other aspects of Chrysler's 
business and operations that would be highly valuable if learned by 
third parties. Iacocca used Chrysler's trade secrets for his own benefit 
by disclosing them to Kerkorian and Tracinda in return for lucrative 
compensation. Iacocca made all of the foregoing disclosures without 
Chrysler's consent, in violation of his fiduciary duties to Chrysler, and 
in contravention of established Chrysler policies designed to protect 
such information from disclosure. 
 
   63. Iacocca's actions have injured Chrysler, including the injury 
resulting from the deprivation of the exclusive use of its confidential 
information, and Chrysler should be awarded the resulting damages. 
Chrysler should also be awarded the profits realized by Iacocca 
through his unlawful breaches of fiduciary duty, because Iacocca's 
actions have resulted in his unjust enrichment at Chrysler's expense. 
 
   64. In committing the foregoing acts, Iacocca has acted willfully, 
wantonly, maliciously, and outrageously to injure Chrysler, and 
especially Chrysler's reputation and good will. Chrysler cannot be 
made whole by an award of compensatory damages and the profits 
realized by Iacocca, and is therefore entitled to exemplary damages. 
 
   65. With respect to Iacocca's ongoing and prospective breaches of 
fiduciary duty, Chrysler has been irreparably injured, has no adequate 
remedy at law, and is entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive 
relief against Iacocca's continuing use and disclosure of Chrysler's 
nonpublic information. 
 
   THIRD CLAIM 
 
  (Accounting For Profits) 
 
   66. Chrysler repeats and realleges each and every allegation 
contained in paragraphs 1 through 51 of this Complaint as if fully set 
forth herein. 
 
   67. As compensation for Iacocca's breaches of fiduciary duty, he has 
obtained and entered into extremely lucrative agreements with 
Kerkorian and Tracinda. The amounts already paid or in the future to 
be paid to Iacocca pursuant to those agreements reflect compensation 
for Iacocca's unauthorized disclosure of Chrysler's confidential 
information 
 
   68. Chrysler is entitled to an accounting by Iacocca of his profits 
under those agreements and under any other agreements for his unjust 
enrichment resulting from his disclosure of information rightfully 
belonging to Chrysler and not to him. 
 
   69. Chrysler has no adequate remedy at law. 
 
    FOURTH CLAIM 
 
    (Declaratory Relief On Stock Option Rights) 
 
   70. Chrysler repeats and realleges each and every allegation of 
paragraphs 1 through 51 as if fully set forth herein. 
 
   71. As the former CEO and Chairman of Chrysler, Iacocca had 
acquired options to purchase a total of approximately 1.55 million 
shares of Chrysler common stock. These options expire on various 
dates. 
 
   72. The option rights are governed by the terms of Chrysler's Stock 
Option Plan and its 1991 Stock Compensation Plan, to which Iacocca 
agreed, for good and valuable consideration. In particular, the right to 
exercise options after the option holder's termination of employment 
is subject to the satisfaction of express contractual preconditions. 
 
   73. Section 8 of the Stock Option Plan provides: 
 
 "[T]he exercise of any option after termination of employment shall 
be subject to satisfaction of the conditions precedent that the Option 
Holder neither, (a) takes other employment or renders services to 
others without the written consent of the Corporation, nor (b) 
conducts himself in a manner adversely affecting the Corporation." 
 
    74.   Section 5(b)(vii) of the 1991 Stock Compensation Plan 
provides: 
 
 "[T]he exercise of any Stock Option after termination of employment 
shall be subject to satisfaction of the conditions precedent that the 
Optionee neither, (x) takes other employment or renders services to 
others without the written consent of the Company, nor (y) conducts 
himself in a manner adversely affecting the Company." 
 
   75. Iacocca and Chrysler have entered into separate written option 
agreements with respect to each grant of stock option rights. An 
example of such an option agreement, virtually identical to all others, 
is attached as Exhibit D and incorporated by reference. The option 
agreements all incorporate the conditions precedent set forth above 
and provide that any waiver by Chrysler of a provision of the option 
agreement shall not operate as or be construed to be a subsequent 
waiver of the same provision or a waiver of any other provision. 
 
    76. Chrysler has performed, and/or has been excused from 
performing, all of its obligations under its Stock Option Plan and its 
1991 Stock Compensation Plan with respect to Iacocca. 
 
    77. Iacocca failed to obtain Chrysler's written consent to the 
rendition of services to Kerkorian and Tracinda (within the meaning 
of Section 8 and Section 5(b)(vii) of the plans), including among 
other services: 
 
  a. services provided in planning and implementing Tracinda's April 
1995 unsolicited purported offer to take over Chrysler; 
 
   b. services provided pursuant to Iacocca's May 9, 1995 consulting 
agreement with Tracinda, which expressly requires the consent of 
Tracinda with respect to certain of Iacocca's actions concerning 
Chrysler; and 
 
   c. services in the form of supplying Chrysler's confidential 
information to Kerkorian and Tracinda, and otherwise supporting 
Tracinda's efforts. 
 
   78.    Iacocca has conducted himself in a manner "adversely 
affecting" Chrysler (within the meaning of Section 8 and Section 
5(b)(vii) of the plans) by, among other things: 
 
   a. forming a group within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the 
Exchange Act with Kerkorian and Tracinda; 
 
   b. assisting in development and implementation of Tracinda's April 
1995 unsolicited purported offer to take over Chrysler; 
 
   c. continuing to participate in the April 1995 purported offer after 
announcements by the Chrysler board that it had determined the 
purported offer was not in the best interests of Chrysler or its 
shareholders; 
 
   d. continuing to participate with Kerkorian, York, and others in 
activities adverse to Chrysler, for the purpose of profiting from their 
joint efforts to increase the short- term value of Chrysler stock 
holdings and without regard to the long-term interests of Chrysler; 
and 
 
   e. publicly disparaging Chrysler and its products. 
 
   79.    Chrysler's Stock Option Committee and Board acted in good 
faith, and within their contractually provided powers in rejecting 
Iacocca's request to exercise options, based on his noncompliance 
with the contractual preconditions to their exercise. Iacocca 
nevertheless has continued to insist that the options are exercisable, 
and has arranged to have Tracinda provide substantial financial 
support to his efforts to restore his options through litigation. 
 
   80. Because there is an immediate, actual and substantial 
controversy between Chrysler and Iacocca, Chrysler seeks a 
declaratory judgment, pursuant to Michigan Court Rules 2.111 and 
2.605, that the Board was legally justified in refusing to permit 
Iacocca to exercise option rights to purchase Chrysler's stock. 
 
   IRREPARABLE INJURY 
 
   81. Iacocca continues to breach his fiduciary duties and continues to 
disclose and utilize confidential information of Chrysler. 
 
   82. Chrysler and its shareholders will suffer irreparable injury if 
these breaches of fiduciary duty continue, if defendant continues to 
disclose confidential information, if defendant is not required to undo 
the injuries caused by his violations, and if defendant is allowed to 
benefit from his violations. 
 
   83. Iacocca and his "group" may undertake further attempts to 
obtain control of Chrysler, as well as proxy fights, and Chrysler has 
been, and will continue to be, deprived of the exclusive use of its 
material, nonpublic information. 
 
   84. Chrysler and its shareholders will continue to be injured by 
disclosure of Chrysler's highly valuable, proprietary and/or material, 
nonpublic information to Kerkorian and Tracinda. 
 
   85. Uncertainty in the marketplace created by Iacocca's conduct, 
along with speculation about Chrysler's future and its survival as a 
going concern caused by Iacocca's conduct, have damaged and 
continue to damage Chrysler in a manner that is unquantifiable.    86. 
Chrysler has no adequate remedy at law. 
 
  PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
 
   WHEREFORE, Chrysler demands judgment against Iacocca and 
respectfully requests that Chrysler be granted the following relief. 
 
   a. For Iacocca's breach of contract and breaches of fiduciary duty 
compensatory damages, including, but not limited to, the return of all 
compensation paid to Iacocca by Chrysler during the period of such 
wrongdoing, all costs incurred by Chrysler in addressing and 
defending against the purported buyout proposal put forward by 
Iacocca and Kerkorian, all additional costs incurred by Chrysler in 
securing loans and placing debt as a result of the purported buyout 
offer, and other damages to be determined. 
 
   b. For Iacocca's breaches of fiduciary duty: exemplary damages in 
an amount to be determined, and an accounting for all profits and 
other compensation that Iacocca has unjustly obtained from Kerkorian 
and Tracinda in return for wrongfully disclosing Chrysler's 
confidential information. 
 
   c. For Iacocca's breach of contract in continuing to use and disclose 
confidential information and breaches of fiduciary duty preliminary 
and permanent injunctive relief against Iacocca's continuing use and 
disclosure of Chrysler's nonpublic information 
 
   d. For Iacocca's noncompliance with the conditions precedent to the 
exercise of his stock options: a declaration that the Board was legally 
justified in refusing to permit Iacocca to exercise option rights to 
purchase Chrysler's stock. 
 
   e. For all claims: Chrysler's attorneys' fees and costs in this action. 
 
   f. Such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

FACTS

4.   Frito-Lay is one of the world's leading manufacturers and 
marketers of snack food products. 

5.   Procter & Gamble is a manufacturer and marketer of various 
consumer products, including its Pringles potato crisp products. 

6.   Procter & Gamble has engaged in a series of commercial 
advertisements that expressly and/or implicitly compare its Pringles 
potato crisp products to Frito-Lay's potato crisp products and potato 
chips.  The advertisements falsely, deceptively, and misleadingly 
convey the message to consumers that the Procter & Gamble 
products are healthier or more nutritionally beneficial than the Frito-
Lay products. 

A.  PROCTER & GAMBLE'S COMMERCIAL COMPARING 
PRINGLES RIGHT TO BAKED LAY'S POTATO CRISPS 

7. None of Procter & Gamble's Pringles products qualify as "low 
fat".  Recently, Frito-Lay developed and introduced a revolutionary 
new baked potato crisp product ("Baked Lay's") with 85% less fat 
than regular potato chips (1.5 grams per one ounce serving vs. 10 
grams per one ounce serving) which it sells in a distinctive yellow 
and green package.  Frito-Lay's new baked potato crisps meet the 
definition of "low fat" as set forth in the Nutrition Labeling and 
Education Act of 1990 ("NLEA"), which definition has been adopted 
by the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") in its Enforcement Policy 
Statement on Food Advertising of May, 1994.  (A copy of Frito-
Lay's Baked Lay's potato crisp packaging is shown in Exhibit A.  A 
copy of the FTC Enforcement Policy Statement on Food Advertising 
is attached Exhibit B). 

8.   The FTC, charged with the responsibility of ferreting out false 
and deceptive advertising claims by companies seeking to attract 
consumer purchases through false or deceptive claims, has 
recognized that nutritional information is a material basis upon 
which consumers make purchasing decisions and has formally 
committed to following the Food and Drug Administration's 
("FDA's") guidance in evaluating nutrition- related claims made in 
advertising: 

"The Commission recognizes the importance of consistent treatment 
of nutrient content and health claims in food advertising and labeling 
and seeks to harmonize its advertising enforcement program with 
FDA's food labeling regulations to the fullest extent possible under 
the statutory authority of the FTC Act."  59 Fed. Reg. 28388. 

9.   On or about October 16, 1995, Frito-Lay learned that Procter & 
Gamble had begun airing a television commercial which compares 
Procter & Gamble's Pringles Right product with Frito-Lay's new low 
fat baked potato crisps and misrepresents the nature and qualities of 
both Procter & Gamble's product and of Frito-Lay's new product by: 

(a)  showing a simulation of a Frito-Lay's Baked Lay's package 
together with a sign that falsely proclaims "95 MG MORE 
SODIUM" when in fact, Frito-Lay's new baked potato crisps have 
only an immaterial 15 milligrams more sodium per serving than 
Procter and Gamble's product since June 1995; 

(b)  suggesting that Frito-Lay's new baked potato crisps are 
materially higher in sodium than Procter & Gamble's product, when 
in fact the difference in sodium levels is not nutritionally significant; 

(c)  showing Pringles Right as having "1/3 less fat" in a manner that 
suggests a comparison to Frito-Lay's new baked potato crisps, when 
in fact Pringles Right has over four times as much fat per serving 
than Frito-Lay's new baked potato crisps (7 vs. 1.5 grams per 
serving); 

(d)  showing Pringles Right as having "1/3 less fat" but altering the 
trade dress of Frito-Lay's new baked potato crisps to obscure the fact 
that the Frito-Lay product has qualified as a "low fat" product under 
NLEA requirements (Pringles Right has not); 

(e)  presenting a misleading, deceptive, and distorted health and 
nutrition comparison between the two products, by comparing 
relative sodium levels -- where the differences are insignificant -- but 
omitting information on relative fat levels -- where the differences 
are significant; and 

(f)  stating "so grab a stack of these, not the ones that are a' broken", 
and showing excessive crumbled and powdery bits of potato crisps 
poured from a simulation of Frito-Lay's package. 

10.  Depicted below are two scenes from Procter & Gamble's 
comparative commercial which falsely represent that Frito-Lays's 
new baked product has:  (l) 95 milligrams more sodium than Procter 
& Gamble's Pringles Right potato crisps, and (2) excessive breakage: 

11.  Sodium content of a food is a material basis upon which 
consumers make purchasing decisions.  The FDA mandates that 
sodium content be disclosed and has affirmed the importance of 
accurate sodium information and the importance of this information 
to the public health:  

"The Surgeon General's report asserts the need for moderation in 
sodium consumption, not only because there is a benefit to persons 
whose blood pressures do rise with sodium intake, but also because 
there is no biological marker for individual sodium sensitivity." 58 
Fed. Reg. 2094. 

12.  Procter & Gamble's comparative commercial expressly 
misrepresents the sodium content of Frito-Lay's new baked potato 
crisp product, is in derogation of the standards set by the NLEA and 
the FTC Enforcement Policy Statement on Food Advertising, and is 
likely to deceive members of the public into believing that Procter & 
Gamble's Pringles Right product is more  nutritionally beneficial or 
healthier than it is. 

13.  Procter & Gamble's comparative commercial is likely to deceive 
members of the public into believing that Procter & Gamble's 
Pringles Right product is more nutritionally beneficial than Frito-
Lay's new low fat baked potato crisps in that it suggests that Pringles 
Right has 95 milligrams less sodium and 1/3 less fat than Frito-Lay's 
new baked potato crisps, when neither fact is true. 

14.  Procter and Gamble's comparative commercial is deceptive and 
misleading even if it accurately portrays, which it does not, the 
relative sodium levels of the products because a 95  milligram 
difference in sodium content is insignificant in any dietary sense. 

15.  Procter & Gamble's comparative commercial contravenes the 
FTC Enforcement Policy Statement on Food Advertising which 
specifically requires that:  

"When the context of an ad a8 a whole conveys to consumers the net 
impression that the food makes only positive contributions to a diet, 
or does not contain any nutrients at levels that raise the risk of diet-
related disease, the failure to disclose the presence of risk-increasing 
nutrients is likely to be deceptive." 

The decision to address one material nutrient difference, the amount 
of sodium, while ignoring a major nutrient difference, the amount of 
fat, is a manipulation of information to consumers that creates a false 
impression as to the absolute and relative health and nutritional 
benefits of Procter & Gamble's Pringles Right product and of Frito-
Lay's new low fat baked potato crisps.  As a result, Procter & 
Gamble's comparative commercial is likely to deceive members of 
the public into believing that Procter & Gamble's Pringles Right 
product is more nutritionally beneficial than it is or than Frito-Lay's 
new low fat baked potato crisps, or that Procter & Gamble's Pringles 
Right product is healthier than it is or than Frito-Lay's new low fat 
baked potato crisps. 

16.  Comparative claims must be based on real differences between 
products, using the rules that the FDA and FTC have fashioned.  
Procter & Gamble's fast-paced ads which obscure and misrepresent 
material nutritional information may boost product sales but only at 
the expense of consumers receiving reliable information from which 
they can make informed purchasing decisions.  The Pringles Right 
ads are cleverly crafted in a manner that leaves consumers with the 
incorrect impression that the Procter & Gamble product is healthier 
overall, and specifically with regard to fat, as compared to Frito-
Lay's new low fat baked potato crisps. 

17.  The visual and audio elements of the Procter & Gamble ad 
create an overwhelming net impression for the viewer that the 
Pringles Right product is superior to Frito-Lay's product in all 
respects highlighted in the ad. In cleverly conveying this message the 
nuances that might render the ad properly qualified are lost upon the 
consumer. The continual disparagement of the Frito-Lay product 
featured in the ad leaves the viewer with the idea that the "1/3 LESS 
FAT" claim, like all the other bases of comparison, are between the 
competitive brands, when, in fact, they are not. 

18.  The Procter & Gamble ad reflects Procter & Gamble's intention 
to play it both ways with the consumer. The ad purports to be upfront 
about the sodium information (which in fact is false) and yet omits 
the material fact that Frito-Lay's new baked product is in fact far 
lower in fat than the Pringles Right product.  The FDA mandates that 
the quantitative amounts of a nutrient subject to a comparative claim 
be included.  See 21 CFR 101.113 (I).  The FTC Policy Statement 
similarly points to the importance of this information.  See 59 Fed. 
Reg. 28390. Moreover, the FTC places great emphasis on the need to 
disclose information about other nutrients in the product where the 
absence of such information would render the ad deceptive:  

".... disclosure of material information that is necessary to prevent 
deception may be required under Section 5 of the FTC Act.  For 
example, it is misleading to fail to disclose qualifying information 
necessary to prevent an affirmative statement from creating a 
misleading impression." 

"In the context of advertising that makes affirmative nutrient content 
claims, the Commission's analysis of deception by omission will be 
based on a consideration of whether a nutrient content claim gives 
rise to a misleading impression about the absent disclosure of other 
nutrition information." 59 Fed. Reg. 28392. 

Affirmative disclosure of fat is critical to avoid the Procter & 
Gamble ad from conveying the misleading impression that it is 
overall healthier, when in fact the opposite is true. 

19.  By omitting material information that would have a significant 
effect on the purchasing habits of consumers who may buy either of 
the two products compared, Procter & Gamble has relied on the 
careful development of a false commercial impression and not the 
sound nutritional attributes of its snack to attract customer purchases. 
Failure to grant Frito-Lay the relief requested would do no more than 
reward Procter & Gamble for creative product positioning and 
penalize Frito-Lay's willingness to invest the time and resources to 
develop what is objectively a nutritionally superior product. 

20.  The deceptive claims conveyed by Procter & Gamble's 
comparative commercial is but the latest example of a pattern of 
conduct by Procter & Gamble to rely on misleading comparative 
product representations that falsely portray the nutritional attributes 
of the products at issue. 


B.   PROCTOR & GAMBLE'S CAMPAIGN OF COMMERCIALS 
COMPARING PRINGLES TO FRITO-LAY'S POTATO CHIPS 

21.  For many years Frito-Lay has marketed its Ruffles potato chips 
in a distinctive red, white and blue package and its Lays potato chips 
in a distinctive red, white and yellow package. Nationally, Frito-
Lay's Ruffles potato chips are the leading ridged potato chips on the 
market and its Lays potato chips are the leading flat potato chips on 
the market. 

22.  In recent years, Procter & Gamble has pursued a course of 
conduct in which it has aired and continues to air a television 
campaign comparing its Pringles product with Frito- Lay's potato 
chips.  Procter & Gamble's comparative commercials disclose that a 
comparison is being made with "a national leading chip."  Several of 
the comparative commercials depict a man holding a potato chip bag 
with a simulation of Frito-Lay's trade dress, wiping grease on his 
shirt, and saying "Not this bagged chip's greasy mess." One such 
scene from a Pringles comparative commercial is depicted below: 
[Picture not available] 

In fact, Frito-Lay's potato chips do not contain more fat than Procter 
& Gamble's Pringles product and Frito-Lay's products are indeed the 
same or less in fat content.  Apart from the wiping scene above, 
Procter & Gamble also uses other visual gimmickry to misrepresent 
the qualities of the parties' products, including the use of napkins 
with oil spots meant to show that Frito-Lay's products are relatively 
unhealthy compared to the Pringles product, and using fit and 
youthful~ looking models to associate the Pringles product with 
those who follow a healthy regimen. 

23.  Recently, Frito-Lay caused a consumer survey to be conducted 
by independent researchers of Procter & Gamble's comparative 
commercial showing a man wiping grease on his shirt. This study 
demonstrates that a significant percentage of relevant consumers 
erroneously "understand the Pringles commercial as stating or 
implying that Pringles contain less fat, grease or oil" than Ruffles or 
other potato chips.  The study also shows that a significant 
percentage of respondents erroneously believe that Pringles products 
have a healthful nature and qualities.  In addition, the study shows 
that a significant percentage of respondents incorrectly believe that 
the Pringles product is "healthier" than Ruffles or other potato chips.  
The percentages of deception from this study are set forth below for 
each misrepresentation:  

PERCENT DECEIVED -- MISREPRESENTATION

53% -- Pringles has low or no grease content or less grease content 
than Ruffles or other potato chips. 

44% -- Pringles is healthy or good for you or is healthier and better 
for you than Ruffles or other potato chips. 


24.  Procter & Gamble's comparative commercial misrepresents its 
Pringles product (a) as containing less grease, fat or oil than Ruffles 
or other potato chips and (b) as being healthier than Ruffles or other 
potato chips. 

25.  The FDA and the FTC have both cautioned companies that the 
mere reference to an oil or other components of a food associated 
with fat can constitute implied claims as to the level of fat in a 
product.  The FDA has stated:  

"The agency advises that there are long established relationships 
between ingredients and nutrients that are covered under the 
definition of implied nutrient content claims .... "FDA has issued 
warning letters regarding foods that contain tropical oils (which 
contain significant levels of saturated fat) when they bear statements, 
like "100 percent vegetable oil," that imply that these ingredients 
have low levels of saturated fats."  58 Fed. Reg. 2372. 

The FTC has stated: 

"FTC food cases and consent agreements also demonstrate the 
principle that statements regarding ingredients may have nutrient 
content implications.  For example, advertising may implicitly 
characterize the amount of a nutrient in a product through 
representations regarding the ingredients with which the product is 
made.  An ad may imply that a food is free of ingredients that are 
essentially the same from the consumer's perspective." 

"Consistent with its statutory authority and its commitment to 
harmonization, the Commission will look closely at advertisements 
that Day implicitly characterize the level of a nutrient.  The 
Commission will give great weight to any FDA determinations 
concerning ingredient statements in analyzing the net impression 
conveyed by the ad."  59 Fed. Reg. 28392. 

Here, Procter & Gamble has violated these FTC and FDA cautionary 
regulations by referring in a misleading manner to the level of 
grease, fat or oil in the parties' products. 

26.  Procter & Gamble's comparative commercials misrepresent the 
nature and qualities of Frito-Lay's potato chips by depicting what 
appears to be Ruffles or Lays smeared onto a shirt and staining the 
shirt, creating an unhealthy or unsavory image of Ruffles and Lays. 

27.  Procter & Gamble's comparative commercials misrepresent the 
qualities of the products of the parties in derogation of the standards 
set forth in the NLEA and the FTC Enforcement Policy Statement on 
Food Advertising, and is likely to deceive members of the public 
into believing that Pringles has less fat and is healthier or more 
nutritional than it is or than Frito-Lay's potato chips. 

28.  In August 1995 representatives of Frito-Lay met with 
representatives of Procter & Gamble at Procter & Gamble's place of 
business and provided them with copies of Frito-Lay's survey results 
in an attempt to have Procter & Gamble cure the misrepresentations 
of its comparative advertising campaign without resorting to legal 
action.  On October 5, 1995, Procter & Gamble informed Frito-Lay 
in writing that it would not discontinue its objectionable comparative 
advertising with Frito- Lay's potato chips. Procter & Gamble stated it 
would consider the issues raised by Frito-Lay "in future executions 
on regular Pringles" but, as set forth in paragraphs 6-18 of this 
complaint, Procter & Gamble persists in its deceptive advertising.  A 
copy of Procter & Gamble's letter is attached as Exhibit C. 

COUNT I:  FALSE ADVERTISING

29.  Frito-Lay re-alleges paragraphs 1 through 26. 

30.  Procter & Gamble's false and misleading representations are 
likely to mislead and deceive members of the general public into 
mistakenly believing that Procter & Gamble's Pringles products and 
Frito-Lay's new low fat baked potato crisps and Ruffles and Lays 
potato chips have nutritional, health and dietary qualities or 
characteristics different from those which they in fact possess and to 
cause consumers based on those mistaken beliefs to purchase Procter 
& Gamble's Pringles product rather than Frito-Lay' 8 products. 

31.  Upon information and belief, Procter & Gamble had knowledge 
of the falsity and misleading nature of its comparative commercials, 
and wilfully caused the comparative commercials to be aired in order 
to exploit the false and misleading nature of the commercials and to 
give Procter & Gamble' 6 Pringles product a salability and 
profitability which it would not otherwise have. 

32.  Procter & Gamble's false and misleading comparative 
commercials constitute unfair competition with Frito- Lay and are 
contrary to the standards set by the NLEA and the FTC Enforcement 
Policy Statement on Food Advertising for the protection of the 
public interest in violation of 15 U.S.C. Section 1125(a). 

33.  Procter & Gamble's false and misleading comparative 
commercials constitute common law unfair competition under the 
laws of various states, including the State of Texas. 

34.  Procter & Gamble's false and misleading comparative 
commercials result in the unjust enrichment of Procter & Gamble. 

35.  Procter & Gamble's acts greatly and irreparably damage Frito-
Lay and the public and will continue to damage Frito-Lay and the 
public unless restrained by this Court, wherefore, Frito-Lay is 
without an adequate remedy at law. 

COUNT II.  DILUTION

36.  Frito-Lay re-alleges paragraphs 1 through 26, 28-29, 32, and 33. 

37.  Procter & Gamble's false and misleading comparative 
commercials are likely to injure the business reputation of Frito-Lay 
in violation of the anti-dilution laws of the various states, including 
the State of Texas, which prohibits acts "likely to injure a business 
reputation," Tex. Bus. and Comm. Code Section 16.29. 

COUNT III.  TRADE LIBEL

38.  Frito-Lay re-alleges paragraphs 1 through 26, 28-29, 32, and 33. 

39.  Procter & Gamble's false and misleading comparative 
commercials are likely to injure Frito-Lay in violation of the trade 
libel laws of the various states, including the State of Texas, which 
prohibits "a defamation expressed in written or other graphic form 
that...tends to injure a...person's reputation and thereby expose the 
person to... financial injury... " Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code, 
Section 73.001. 

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays that:

1.   Defendant, its officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys 
and all others in active concert or participation with defendant be 
enjoined and restrained during the pendency of this action, and 
permanently thereafter, from using in commerce or causing to be

(1)   falsely state or imply that:

(a)  Frito-Lay's new low fat baked potato crisps contain more sodium 
than they do; 

(b)  The absolute or comparative levels of sodium in Frito-Lay's new 
low fat baked potato crisps or potato chips and Procter & Gamble's 
Pringles products have any significance to consumers; 

(c)  Frito-Lay's potato products have excessive breakage or using the 
representation shown in paragraph 9; 

(d)  Frito-Lay's potato products are comparatively unhealthy or 
unsavory or are nutritionally deficient; 

(e)  Procter & Gamble's Pringles product contains less fat, grease or 
oil than Frito-Lay's potato crisps or potato chips; 

(f)  Procter & Gamble's Pringles product is healthier than Frito-Lay's 
potato crisps or potato chips; or 

(g)  Procter & Gamble's Pringles product has a healthful nature and 
qualities; or 

(2)  are likely to insure the business reputation of Frito-Lay. 

2.   Defendant, and all others holding by, through or under defendant, 
be required: 

(a)  to account for and pay over to plaintiff all profits derived by 
defendant from its false and misleading comparative commercials, in 
accordance with 15 U.S.C. Section 1117 and the laws of the various 
states; 

(b)  to pay to plaintiff treble the amount of all damages incurred by 
plaintiff by reason of defendant's false and misleading comparative 
commercials, including all expenditures required to correct the false, 
misleading and disparaging descriptions and representations alleged 
herein, in accordance with 15 U.S.C. Section 1117 and the laws of 
the various states; 

(c)  to pay to plaintiff damages necessary to allow plaintiff to place 
corrective advertising and take other affirmative action, 
commensurate in scope with defendant's false and misleading 
advertising, to inform and educate the general public or the false and 
misleading nature of defendant's comparative commercials, and to 
allow plaintiff to continue said affirmative action until no applicable 
portion Or the general public any longer wrongly believes 
defendant's false and misleading representations; 

(d)  to pay to plaintiff the costs of this action, together with 
reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, in accordance with 15 
U.S.C. Section 1117 and the laws of the various states; 

(e)  to pay to plaintiff punitive damages, in accordance with Tex. 
Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ch. 41; and 

(f)  to file with the Court and serve on plaintiff an affidavit setting 
forth in detail the manner and form in which defendant has complied 
with the terms of the injunction, in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 
Section 1116. 

3.   Plaintiff have such other and further relief as this Court deems 
just and equitable.

<P>The world of motion pictures is "a never-never land of illusion," according to this class action complaint brought against the major studios, referring not to the movie magic that has made Hollywood famous but to the bookkeeping techniques that may be unique to Hollywood studios.</P>
<P>The suit was filed by the heirs of Jim Garrison, the late New Orleans District Attorney, who wrote "On the Trail of the Assassins," the book that inspired Oliver Stone's film, "JFK."</P>
<P>According to the Garrison estate, the film has earned over $150 million for Warner Bros., the studio that distributed the film, but has still not shown a "net profit" in which the Garrison estate is entitled to share.</P>
<P>This complaint goes into the history of Hollywood's allegedly "creative" bookkeeping practices, from the days of the nickelodeon through the "Golden Age" and the modern era where major stars have the clout to share in the gross revenue of a film, avoiding the studio's allegedly problematic definition of "net profit."</P>
<P>The parent company of Warner Bros., Time Warner Inc., is a part owner of Court TV.</P>

   The above-named plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all 
others similarly situated, allege as follows: 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
   1.  The world of motion pictures is a never-never land of 
illusion. In the making of a movie, millions of still pictures are 
strung and spliced together to artfully imitate life, but when each 
part is disassembled and seen separately each only reflects 
static, one dimensional and unreal world.  This  creating  of 
illusions has extended throughout all the facets of the motion 
picture industry since the days Thomas Alva Edison created and 
marketed the shuttered lantern projector nearly 90 years ago. Of 
all the illusions practiced daily in the motion picture world, 
nothing is more unreal than the promises of "net profits"  for 
movieland's profit participants, a scam that has endured nearly 
half century, enriching the few at the expense of all the 
multitudes of talent responsible for actually creating the motion 
pictures. 
   2.  "Net profits" as defined in Hollywood contracts is an 
esoteric bookkeeping device that could not be practiced in any 
other multi-billion dollar industry. The practice, which delays 
payment of profit sharing often  forever,  has earned the derisive 
title "Hollywood accounting."   It could only be practiced in 
company town like Hollywood, where a few major studios control 
90 
percent of the movie world revenues, and that enormous economic 
leverage can be and is used to force the signing and compliance 
with contract terms no one would sign in any other business or 
under any other circumstances. 
   3.  From its inception, the moviemaking business has been an 
uneasy mix of creative talent -- the writers, directors, producers 
and actors whose ideas and skills create the magic on the screen -- 
and the business side -- the financiers, marketers and distributors 
who sell the finished movie to the ticket-buying public. There has 
never been an equitable accommodation of all creative talents' 
rights to the profits. 
   4.  "Hollywood accounting" has resulted in a talent caste 
system  where  the  so-called  stars  with  big,  well-established 
reputations,  most often actors or actresses and an occasional 
producer  and  director  --  writers  almost  never  --  are  given 
contracts that provide participation in the gross income of 
motion picture. For creative talent that is less well-established, 
participation in the "net profits" is used to persuade the creative 
talent to accept smaller upfront fees with the promise of more 
later,  for their creative work.  Yet even the most successful 
motion pictures  seldom,  if  ever,  produce  any net  profit  for 
creative talent. This law suit then is about the rights of all the 
moviemaking world's  creative  talent  ("Talent")  to  participate 
equitably and in a timely manner in the often huge cash flow that 
motion pictures generate. 
   5.  This is a class action on behalf of Talent and is brought 
under the laws of the State of California because of the movie 
studios' adoption of unconscionable contract terms as part of their 
standard form contracts, and their refusal to deal with Talent that 
will not submit to these one-sided terms. This is the result of an 
illegal  conspiracy  among  the  major  studios  that  suppresses 
competition, fixes prices, and violates the laws of the State of 
California. 
 
II. THE PARTIES 
        A.  PLAINTIFFS 
   6.  Jim Garrison was the author of the book On The Trail of 
the Assassin. Mr. Garrison is deceased, and is represented in 
this action by his estate. During his lifetime, Mr. Garrison was 
resident and former District Attorney of New Orleans, 
Louisiana, where his estate is administered by his heirs, 
plaintiffs Jim R. Garrison, Virginia J. Garrison, Lyon H. 
Garrison, Elizabeth Z. Garrison, and Eberhard D. Garrison. 
   7.  The members of the plaintiff class have all either 
written a book, story or script upon which a motion picture was 
based, or acted in, directed or produced a motion picture, and, 
in compensation for those activities, each of the plaintiffs have 
entered into standard net profit contracts with one or more of 
the defendants. The representative plaintiffs and Mr. Garrison 
have engaged in the following transactions with defendants: 
        Jim Garrison, during his lifetime, entered into a 
standard net profit contract dated "As Of January 20, 1989" with 
Oliver Stone, giving Mr. Stone an option to purchase the motion 
picture, television and allied rights to Mr. Garrison's best- 
selling book "On The Trail Of The Assassins."   A true and 
correct copy of that agreement with the standard net profits 
clause, is attached hereto as Exhibit "B". Oliver Stone assigned 
his rights in that contract to defendant WARNER BROS and they 
accepted said contract. This book was an account of Mr. 
Garrison's prosecution of an alleged conspiracy in the 
assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Warner Brothers made 
this book into a movie entitled "JFK," which has grossed over 
$150 million to date, and is continuing to earn profits. In 
spite of the movie's huge financial success, Mr. Garrison and/or 
his estate have received no payment at all from WARNER BROS. 
pursuant to the "net profits" clause of the contract as attached. 
He and now his estate are similar to all the other class members 
set out hereinafter.

    C.  DOE DEFENDANTS 
   23. The true names and capacities, whether individual, 
corporate, associate or otherwise of the defendants Doe 1 through 
Doe 10, inclusive are unknown to plaintiff who therefore sues 
said defendants by such fictitious names pursuant to Code of 
Civil Procedure  474; plaintiff further alleges that each of 
said fictitious defendants is in some manner responsible for the 
acts- and occurrences hereinafter set forth. Plaintiff will amend 
this Complaint to show their true names and capacities when same 
are ascertained, as well as the manner in which each fictitious 
defendant is responsible. 
 
    D.  UNNAMED CO-CONSPIRATORS 
   24. Various other co-conspirators, persons, firms and 
corporations, who are not named as defendants in this Complaint, 
conspired with the named defendants to violate the laws of 
California as alleged in this Complaint, and made statements and 
performed acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. 
 
    E.  ACTS OF ALL 
   25. At all times relevant to this Complaint, each of the 
defendants was an agent, employee, joint venturer, co-conspirator 
and/or partner of each of the remaining defendants, and was at 
all times acting within the course and scope of such agency, 
employment, and/or partnership. Each defendant has ratified, 
approved, and authorized the acts of each of the remaining 
defendants with full knowledge of those acts. 
 
III. DEFINITIONS 
   26. For purposes of this Complaint, the following terms 
shall have the following defined meanings: 
   27. "Talent" shall mean directors, producers, actors, and 
authors of books, stories and scripts and all other creative 
personnel whose efforts are necessary to produce motion pictures 
throughout the world. The word Talent as used in the motion 
picture industry is well known and commonly understood, and the 
words have the same meaning here. 
   28. "Standard net profits contracts" shall mean the 
standard form contracts with riders attached which are drafted 
and utilized by defendants to entice various Talent to render 
their services in the making of motion pictures and which purport 
to entitle Talent to a share of the net profits of a motion 
picture to which the Talent contributes. Representative examples 
of standard net profits contracts used by the defendants are 
attached hereto as Exhibits C 1-8. 
 
IV CLASS ALLEGATIONS 
 
   29. Plaintiffs bring this action both on behalf of 
themselves and as a class action on behalf of all Talent (except 
the defendants and their respective affiliates and co- 
conspirators) who have entered into standard net profit contracts 
with one or more of the defendants or their affiliates during the 
period January 1, 1988 to the present. They are easily 
ascertainable and are within the knowledge of each defendant 
named herein. 
   30. All members of the class were injured in their business 
or property by reason of the defendants' unlawful conduct as set 
forth in the Complaint. 
   31. The defendants entered into standard net profit 
contracts with numerous Talent purporting to entitle the Talent 
to share in the "net profits" of motion pictures with which the 
Talent were connected, making the members of the class so 
numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. Since the 
class members may be identified from records regularly maintained 
by the defendants and their employees and agents, the number and 
identity of class members can be easily ascertained through the 
defendants' own records. 
   32. Plaintiffs' claims are typical of the claims of each 
class member. They, like all other class members, sustained 
damages arising from defendants' violation of the California 
Laws. Plaintiffs and the members of the class were similarly or 
identically harmed by the same systematic and pervasive pattern 
of anticompetitive conduct engaged in by the defendants. 
   33. Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent and 
protect the interests of the members of the class, and have 
retained counsel who are both competent and experienced in 
antitrust and class litigation. There are no material conflicts 
between the claims of the representative plaintiffs and the 
members of the class that would make class certification 
inappropriate. Counsel for the class will vigorously assert the 
claims of all class members. 
   34. In this case, a class action is superior to all other 
methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of this 
controversy, since joinder of all class members is impracticable. 
Furthermore, as the damages suffered by individual members of 
the 
class may be relatively small, the expense and burden of 
individual actions makes it impossible for the class members to 
individually redress the wrongs they have suffered. There will 
be no difficulty in managing this case as a class action. 
   35. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all 
members of the class and predominate over any questions affecting 
solely individual members of the class. Among the questions of 
law and fact common to the class are: 
        (a) Whether the defendants entered into a conspiracy, 
contract or combination to fix, lower, maintain or stabilize the 
prices they paid to Talent for their participation in the making 
of motion pictures, in violation of State law. 
        (b)  Whether the defendants entered into a conspiracy, 
contract or combination to refuse to deal with Talent who would 
not accept the defendants' standardized contract terms and prices 
relating to their share of a motion picture's "net profits" for 
their participation in the making of motion pictures, in 
violation of State law. 
        (c)  Whether the plaintiffs and the other members of 
the class were injured in their business or property by reason of 
the defendants' unlawful conduct. 
        (d)  The appropriate class-wide measure of damages. 
 
  V. BACKGROUND OF THE INDUSTRY 
  A.  HISTORY OF THE INDUSTRY 
   36. In the late 1890s, the motion picture first developed 
from the union of still photography with the persistence-of- 
vision toy, which made drawn figures appear to move. The early 
films were mostly of still figures and had very little public 
appeal. 
   37. On June 19, 1905, the United States public watched The 
Great Train Robbery, a short silent film, in a theater that was 
solely devoted to motion pictures. Prior to then, movies had 
always been shown along with some sort of live entertainment. By 
1908 an estimated 10 million Americans were paying their nickels 
and dimes to see such films. 
   38. Motion pictures were so popular that thousands of 
motion picture theaters called nickelodeons sprang up throughout 
the country. This new industry was very profitable for the 
founders of the movie picture industry. Young entrepreneurs such 
as William Fox and Marcus Loewe saw their theaters, which 
initially cost about $1,600 each, grow into enterprises worth 
fortunes within a few years. Soon the demand arose for Talent to 
make the movies to fill the demand of the consuming public. 
    B.  ECONOMIC LEVERAGE OVER TALENT 
   39. The motion picture industry has a long history of 
abusing Talent, and in particular of using economic power to deny 
Talent the rights and earnings to which they are entitled. 
   40. The early movie studios, for example, as well as their 
current successors, made every effort to insure that the salaries 
of the Talent were kept as low as possible. The movie studios 
began a course of conduct designed to stop Talent from reaping 
the rewards from a competitive movie system by exerting 
monopoly 
power. 
   41. In the beginning, the names of the actors and actresses 
in films were kept anonymous so as to keep them from acquiring 
their own place in a competitive market. As the public's demand 
for motion pictures increased, however, so did the public's 
preference for certain actors and actresses. In order to combat 
fear that public recognition would result in a demand by the 
players for higher salaries, producers went to great lengths to 
keep the identity of the actors anonymous by various different 
means, including demanding the use of pseudonyms. It was not 
until fan magazines began running stories about the identity of 
the movie stars that the producers began promoting the names of 
their actors. 
   42. Hollywood then embraced the star concept and between 
1910 and 1948, movies companies established the star system as a 
potent business strategy to provide increasing returns on 
production investments. In 1918, America's two favorite stars, 
Charlie Chaplin and Mary Pickford, both signed contracts for over 
$1 million. However, most Talent did not have as much power as 
Mr. Chaplin and Miss Pickford and earned substantially less. 
   43. By the 1930s and 1940s, even the major movie stars 
suffered dramatic reductions in independence and incomes. Due to 
the advent of talking movies, which destroyed the careers of many 
silent stars who could not make the transition to sound, and the 
economic depression of the 1930s, movies studios exercised 
tremendous control over the actors. An increasing concentration 
of monopoly power in the hands of the major movie companies left 
the movie stars at the mercy of studio bosses. While in the 
1920s, stars had often received a percentage of net movie profits 
and substantial artistic control, Talent in the 1930s 
and 1940s were forced into seven year exclusive contracts which 
took away net profits and forced the Talent into limited maximum 
salaries. Talent who objected to an assigned movie role risked 
being suspended without pay for rejecting a role. 
   44. This star system allowed movie studios to greatly 
profit from their movie stars by lending them out to other 
studios for huge profits. For example, MGM lent out Clark Gable 
for the making of Gone With the Wind and contributed money 
towards production costs in exchange for the distribution rights 
and a sliding scale percentage of the gross profits starting at 
50%. Gable, one of the biggest stars of the era did not want to 
do the movie, but his contract did not give him the right to turn 
down parts. Gable received his standard salary per week for 
playing the part although MGM gave him a small bonus in an act 
of 
generosity. By 1967, MGM had earned $75 million in rentals for 
the movie. This practice highlights the transition of Talent 
from artist to commodity in the eyes of the movie studios. 
   45. The first profit participation contract on behalf of 
Talent was negotiated with Metro Goldwyn Mayer in 1934 on 
behalf 
of the Marx Brothers for two movies: "A Day At The Races" and 
"A 
Night At The Opera."  That contract was a simple straightforward 
one that netted the brothers 15 percent of all the money the 
studio received for those movies. 
   46. Between 1947 and 1953 admissions to movie theaters 
dropped dramatically. Talent, including many movie stars, 
suddenly became expendable, and were released from studio 
contracts to reduce overhead. While some popular stars used this 
freedom to their economic advantage, the less popular Talent 
found their incomes and marketability declining rapidly. 
   47. For some Talent, the results were tragic. In the 
1950s, for example, Talent who refused to cooperate with the 
witch hunts of the House Un-American Activities Committee 
found 
themselves blacklisted from the movie industry. However, the 
studios were not above crediting others for the work that was 
done by blacklisted artists and reaping the rewards of the 
blacklisted Talent, further proof of their tremendous economic 
power. 
   48. The modern-era of net profit participation in contracts 
began in 1950 when Jimmy Stewart's agent, Lew Wasserman, was 
able 
to negotiate such a provision with Universal for the movie 
"Harvey."  Although such contracts had been executed in the early 
history of film, this contract was the first one negotiated in 
the post-war years when the studios were no longer the great 
forces they had been in the past and the star system was 
beginning to fall apart. 
   49. Over the years, the movie industry has refined its use 
of creative accounting in dealing with Talent. For example, 
during the 1950s the major studios would put together large 
numbers of films and sell them as a package in foreign countries. 
The package might include one or two big hits, but most of the 
films would be grade B or lower. The hits would play all over 
the foreign country, while the other movies would not even be 
shown. But when it came time to divide up the profits, each of 
the films in the package would get an equal portion. The result 
was that the net profits participants in the "hits" got little or 
nothing because their profits were artificially allocated to the 
unsuccessful films. The participants in the unsuccessful films 
typically also got nothing. The studios, on the other hand, got 
the same amount of total return -- they just put the money in 
different columns on their books, offsetting profits, wherever 
earned, against losses, wherever earned, to make everything come 
out as close as possible to "zero" 
   50. In the 1970s, the Securities & Exchange Commission and 
the Internal Revenue Service investigated alleged tax 
improprieties of PARAMOUNT and its then parent corporation, 
Gulf 
Western. There were serious questions of the accuracy of the 
conglomerate's financial reports and other financial 
improprieties such as expenses assigned to making movies. One 
company auditor alleged that Gulf & Western altered profit 
statements to withhold revenues that should have been reported. 
In 1981, Gulf & Western signed a consent decree with the 
government to refrain from such practices in the future. 
 
    C.  HOLLYWOOD ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES 
   51. Under the net profit definition used by most of the 
moviemaking studios, payment of  profit participation is delayed 
by a process of adding fees and costs associated with 
distribution, production, prints, promotion, advertising and 
whatever other overhead expenses they wish. Some studio 
executives admit that they do everything possible to delay 
payment of net profits, if any survive the interminable 
deductions. 
   52. "It is to our benefit to delay paying on profits for as 
long as possible. We earn interest on the float and the money 
allows us to finance other ventures," according to a studio 
executive (referred to as a bean counter) quoted in the June 5, 
1995 issue of Variety, the entertainment world's leading trade 
publication. 
   53. Attached or included in the standard contracts are 
certain riders that break out the charges and expenses that the 
studios deduct from gross revenues. Though the amounts of the 
charges allocated in the net profit contract riders may vary from 
contract to contract, there are nine categories that are 
universally included: 
    (a)  Distribut~ion Fees -- this is a set fee that is 
used by the studios as being necessary to 
underwrite the costs of maintaining distribution 
offices and facilities. These are flat rates that 
range from 30 to 40 percent of a movie's gross 
receipts (30 percent for domestic distribution, 35 
percent for the United Kingdom and 40 percent for 
foreign distribution). 
    (b)  Distribution Costs -- in addition to the fees that 
are levied, the actual costs of distribution are 
also allocated against the income side. 
    (c)  Advertising  -- this is the cost of advertising 
and promotion of the film. This can include all 
sorts of expense; for example, if a convention is 
attended by a studio's promotion executives 
assigned to the picture, those costs can be 
allocated to the film's expenses under this 
category. An arbitrary overhead fee, usually a 
flat 10 percent is added in this category. 
    (d)  Prints -- this is the cost of printing copies of 
the movie, sometimes thousands of copies are 
printed, and distributed free to friends of the 
studio and others on the favored lists. 
    (e)  Production Costs -- these are billed as direct 
expenses whether there are any out-of-pocket costs 
or not; these can and do usually include use of 
studio facilities, cameras, vehicles or other 
equipment based on a rate card set up for each 
piece of equipment in the studio inventory. Money 
paid to Talent receiving gross receipts 
participation, which can be in the millions of 
dollars, is also counted as a production cost. 
Over and above all of this, an overhead charge of 
15 percent is also added to the production costs 
which results in double billing for most 
equipment. 
    (f)  Over-Budget Penalty -- for each dollar the film 
exceeds its budget, an additional $1 ($2 total) is 
charged as a cost of the film as defined in the 
Talent net profit contract regardless of whether 
or not Talent has any direct responsibility for 
the overage and sometimes whether or not there was 
an over-budget allocation. 
    (g)  Taxes -- these are allocated as offsets against 
income, whether the studio actually pays the taxes 
or not. As an example, Japan charges a tax of 10 
percent for any income taken from Japan to the 
U.S., but when U.S. taxes are paid, this is a 
credit against federal taxes. 
    (h)  Political Lobbying Expenses -- allocated as 
expenses against Talent's profit participants are 
dues paid to trade organizations such as the 
Motion Picture Association of America, which works 
as the studios' lobbying group. 
    (i)  Interest --  this is charged from the day 
production starts and is levied against all 
budgeted production and promotion costs generally 
at the rate of 125 percent of the prime rate. 
Accordingly, over and above charges of every 
conceivable type - an additional interest is 
tacked on. 
        54. The most glaring example of the continuing conspiracy 
among the defendants is the handling of video revenue from a 
movie, a source of income that often surpasses 50 percent of the 
total income. The first studio to license a movie's video rights 
and then to negotiate a net profit contract for the video income 
was 20th Century Fox. In that contract, Fox artificially 
allocated only 20 percent of the video income as revenues to be 
reported to profit participants, thus preventing Talent from 
participating in 80 percent of the income received from the 
film's video contracts. That 20 percent share has become the 
agreed upon standard for all of the other studios as well from 
that day forward, and only the star category actors, a few 
directors and seldom if ever a producer or writer are able to 
negotiate a higher percentage. 
       55. At least one court has already ruled that standard net 
profit contracts are contracts of adhesion; that the studios 
refuse to negotiate in good faith over the definition of net 
profits, and that the existing definition was unconscionable 
because it subtracted numerous costs that were inflated or 
unjustified . 
 
        D . COERCIVE EFFECTS ON TALENT 
       56 . The net profit riders attached to Talent's service 
contracts, which display a startling similarity from studio to 
studio, usually differ only in exactly the amount of overhead 
costs that may be added to a film's expenses before those profits 
can be calculated. This iS done through the use of the standard 
form contract. The studios simply refuse to deal with most 
creative talent who will not accept these form contracts, which 
are offered on a "take it or leave it" basis. 
       57. One of the most recent examples of the effect of the 
studio practices upon Talent involved the motion picture "Forrest 
Gump," which had enjoyed the fourth highest gross income in the 
history of the industry. Winston Groom, author of the book was 
adapted to the screen, was told that despite a worldwide gross of 
$660 million as of December of 1994, there had been no net 
profit. The movie's producer, Steve Tisch, and the movie's 
screenwriter Eric Roth, likewise had been coerced into 
signing contracts with smaller upfront fees with promises of net 
profit participation; neither had been paid any share of the 
profits from the picture. This was despite the fact that 
"Forrest Gump" had been chiefly responsible for its studio, 
Paramount Pictures, increasing the studio's 1994 box office gross 
income by 60 percent over the previous year, and boosting it from 
sixth to third place in market share of the movie business. 
   58. Even when Talent has a famous name like syndicated 
columnist Art Buchwald, the court system has been the only 
recourse. It took Buchwald seven years of litigation to obtain 
share of profits from "Coming to America," a movie based on 
an idea and treatment Buchwald had submitted to moviemakers a 
decade earlier. A settlement finally came for Buchwald. 
   59. In a coincidental demonstration of the practice's 
pervasiveness, on Sept. 12, 1995, the day a settlement with 
Buchwald was announced, another writer made public a Complaint 
that Paramount had not been paid him any share of profits from 
"Indecent Proposal," the movie starring Robert Redford and Demi 
Moore that had grossed $250 million worldwide. Jack Englehard, 
whose book was adapted for the movie, said Paramount had told 
him 
that "Indecent Proposal" still showed a deficit of $37.5 million 
despite grossing a quarter of a billion dollars. 
      60. The net profit issue is not limited to one studio; it 
is an industry-wide system used with little variation from studio 
to studio. Warner Bros. Inc., the studio that held the largest 
movie market share four out of the five years of 1989 through 
1993, was accused of failing to pay any net profits to two 
executive producers who worked for 10 years and helped create the 
hugely popular "Batman" movie that starred Jack Nicholson and 
Michael Keaton. Benjamin Melniker and Michael Udslan, the 
complaining producers, were told by Warner Bros. that despite a 
worldwide gross of $411 million that there had been no net 
profits . 
      E. PRIOR VIOLATIONS OF ANTITRUST LAW - 
COMMON 
         DESIGN PLAN AND SCHEME 
       61. The motion picture industry has a long history of 
violating the antitrust laws with a similar course and conduct to 
the acts alleged in the present case. In the 1920s, for example, 
ten producers and distributors of motion pictures who controlled 
6 0 percent of the motion picture market agreed among themselves 
that they would only contract with motion picture exhibitors 
according to the terms of a standard form contract where most of 
the provisions are favorable to the studios. The United states 
Government took legal action against the studios, and a court 
ordered the studios to cease such activities. The matter was 
appealed to the United states Supreme Court, which in the 
landmark case of Paramount Famous Lasky Corp. v. United States 
282 U.S. 30 ( 1930 ) ruled that the studios were engaged in a 
conspiracy that violated the antitrust laws of the United states. 
       62. In spite of the warning from both the Justice 
Department and the Supreme Court, the motion picture industry 
continued to violate the antitrust laws. In the 1940s, for 
example, various producers and distributors of motion pictures 
entered into a wide variety of conspiracies in restraint of 
competition, including a conspiracy to fix minimum prices the 
public had to pay for admission to movie theaters, and a 
conspiracy to include the same minimum admission price 
requirements in all of their standard form contracts with movie 
theaters. The producers and distributors also used standard 
distribution contracts that discriminated in numerous ways 
against small independent theaters in favor of large theaters 
affiliated with the studios and with large groups of theaters. 
Once again the United states Government had to take legal action, 
and once again the United states Supreme court in United states 
v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., et al. 334 U.S. 131 ( 1948) declared 
most of the challenged acts and practices illegal under the 
antitrust laws. The Supreme court noted that the defendants had 
  "marked proclivity for unlawful conduct" and ordered them to 
bear the burden of showing that certain future actions came 
within the law. In spite of these stern warnings from the 
highest court in the land, the movie industry continues to act in 
violation of the laws by continuing a common design, plan and 
scheme to take advantage of the plaintiffs. 
        F. FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT 
       63. Throughout the period set forth in this Complaint, the 
defendants have fraudulently concealed their unlawful contract, 
combination and conspiracy from the plaintiffs and the members of 
the class. 
       64. In order to fraudulently conceal their contract, 
combination and conspiracy from the plaintiffs and the members of 
the class, defendants engaged, among other things, in the 
following affirmative conduct throughout the period relevant of 
this Complaint: 
     (a) defendants secretly discussed and agreed among 
themselves, among other things, on the terms of their respective 
contracts with Talent, and therefore on the prices to be paid to 
Talent for their ideas and labor, and on their concerted refusal 
to deal with Talent who would not submit to these unfair terms. 
     (b) defendants used communications which they believed 
to be safe from detection and avoided communication which they 
believed to be subject to detection. 
     (c) defendants used different wording in drafting 
their standard net profit contracts, while adhering to the same 
substantive terms that the defendants had secretly agreed upon, 
in order to conceal their unlawful agreements. 
     ( d ) In recent months, studio legal departments have 
reacted to court decisions on Talent contracts by attempting to 
place a new face on the old, discredited system. Studio lawyers 
have been replacing the term "net profit" with some euphemisms ' 
like "net proceeds" or other terms designed to hide the fact that 
the unconscionable practice continues. 
       65. Because of the active and fraudulent concealment of the 
conspiracy and the illegal acts in furtherance of that conspiracy 
that are outlined above, plaintiffs did not know and could not 
have discovered the antitrust violations alleged in this 
Complaint until shortly before they initiated this litigation. 
Therefore, the running of any statute of limitations has been 
suspended with respect to the claims alleged in this Complaint. 
       G. MARKET POWER 
      66. The movie industry is highly concentrated, with only a 
few major American studios accounting for over 90% of dollar 
volume of the revenue from the motion pictures made in the United 
states. The major studios are all located in the same area of 
Southern California, in and around Los Angeles. Defendants have 
been able to exercise their market power in dealings with Talent. 
      H. THE STANDARD FORM CONTRACTS 
       67. Beginning at least as early as January 1, 1988, the 
exact date being unknown to the plaintiffs, and continuing to the 
present, pursuant to a conspiracy among themselves and their co- 
conspirators, the defendants have developed and used standard 
form contracts for purchasing intellectual property and labor 
from Talent. 
       68. Virtually all of these standard form contracts contain 
provisions for the Talent to receive a percentage of the "net 
profits" of the motion pictures to which they contribute . 
Although the contracts use different wording in defining "net 
profits," the substantive provisions of the contracts, and the 
substantive definitions of "net profits" contained in each of 
them, are virtually identical. Among other things, these 
standard net profit contracts contain nearly identical provisions 
concerning the deduction of numerous different types of "costs" 
from a motion picture's profits before the Talent can receive any 
distributions under the contract. The use of nearly identical 
net profit definitions by all of the major studios in their form 
contracts is the result of an illegal agreement among the 
defendants to use this definition. Attached hereto as Exhibit B 
is a chart summarizing the net profit definitions of the standard 
net profit contracts used by each of the defendants. 
       69. In many instances, the "costs" that are deducted to 
determine "net profits" are grossly inflated and bear no relation 
to reality. AS a result, no matter how successful the motion 
picture, there are almost never any "net profits" to be shared 
with Talent as promised by the contracts. Thus, the true purpose 
of the defendants' conspiracy is to reduce the price they must 
pay for the Talent they need to make motion pictures. 
       70. A small handful of extremely well-known Talent with 
extremely strong bargaining power can negotiate gross profits 
clauses to replace the net profits clauses of their contracts 
with the studios. For the vast majority of Talent, however, the 
contracts are offered on a take it or leave it basis, and are not 
subject to negotiation. This is the result of an agreement among 
the defendants and their co-conspirators to refuse to deal with 
Talent, except for a small number of extremely well-known Talent, 
who will not accept the standard net profit contract. 
       71. From the beginning of the conspiracy to the present, 
the defendants have continued to discuss and agree upon a 
common 
and grossly unfair definition of "net profits," or some 
euphemistic word with the same meaning, to include that common 
definition in all of their standard net profit contracts, and to 
collectively refuse to deal with any Talent ( except a handful of 
very famous Talent) who will not submit to the oppressive "net 
profits" clause of the studios ' form contracts . AS a result of 
defendants' ongoing conspiracy, the price paid to Talent for 
their ideas and services has been kept artificially low, and the 
Talent has been deprived of their rightful share of the profits 
of the motion pictures that they made possible. 
 
VI. EFFECTS AND RESULTING INJURY TO PLAINTIFFS 
AND THE CLASS 
       72. The defendants' illegal combination and conspiracy had 
the following effects, among others: 
     (a) Monies paid to plaintiffs and other members of the 
class for their ideas, labor, and intellectual property were 
fixed, lowered and maintained at artificial and non-competitive 
levels . 
     (b) Talent was deprived of free and open competition 
for their ideas, labor, and intellectual property. 
     (c)  Competition for Talent among the defendants and 
their co-conspirators was restrained. 
   73. During the period covered by this Complaint, plaintiffs 
and other members of the class sold millions of dollars worth of 
ideas, labor, and intellectual property to the defendants. By 
reason of the actions described in this Complaint, plaintiffs and 
the class members received less for their ideas, labor, and 
intellectual property than they would have been paid in the 
absence of the illegal combination and conspiracy and, as a 
result, have been injured in their business and property and have 
suffered damages in an amount presently undetermined. 
 
      FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 
          (Price Fixing) 
(Business & Professions Code Section 16720 et seq.) 
   74. All foregoing paragraphs of this Complaint are 
incorporated herein by reference. 
   75. As set forth above, defendants conspired to fix, 
depress, maintain and stabilize prices paid to Talent for their 
ideas, labor, and intellectual property to be used in the making 
of motion pictures in the United States, in violation of 
Business & Professions Code Section 16720 et seq. (the 
Cartwright Act). 
   76. Plaintiffs and the class have been injured in their 
business or property by the defendants' antitrust violations as 
alleged in this Complaint. 
       77 . Plaintiffs and the other members of the class are 
entitled to recover three times the amount of their actual 
pursuant to Business & Professions Code  16750(a). 
damages. 
       78. Plaintiffs and the class are entitled to recover 
reasonable attorneys+ fees and litigation, pursuant to Business 
Professions Code  16750(a). 
       79. Plaintiffs and the class are entitled to recover 
pre judgment interest on their actual damages from the date of 
service of this Complaint until the date of entry of judgment in 
this case, pursuant to Business & Professions Code Sections 
16750(a) and 16761. 
       WHEREFORE plaintiffs and the other members of the class 
pray 
for relief as set forth below. 
 
         SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 
    (Boycott/Concerted Refusal to Deal) 
  (Business & Professions Code Section 16720 et seq. ) 
       80. All foregoing paragraphs of this Complaint are 
incorporated herein by reference . 
       81 . As set forth above, defendants conspired and agreed 
among themselves to refuse to deal with any Talent, except for a 
small number of very famous Talent, who would not submit to the 
standardized net profits contract terms that the defendants 
jointly agreed to impose on Talent, in violation of Business & 
Professions Code Section 16720 et seq. (the Cartwright Act). 
       82. One purpose of this boycott and concerted refusal to 
deal except on particular agreed terms was to facilitate and 
enforce the defendants ' unlawful agreement to fix, depress, 
maintain and stabilize prices paid to Talent for their ideas, 
labor, and intellectual property to be used in the making of 
motion pictures in the United states, and to force adherence to 
the terms agreed upon among the defendants and their co- 
conspirators . 
       83. Plaintiffs and the class have been injured in their 
business or property by the defendants' antitrust violations as 
alleged in this Complaint. 
       84. Plaintiffs and the other members of the class are 
entitled to recover three times the amount of their actual 
damages, pursuant to Business & Professions Code  16750 ( a ) . 
       85 . Plaintiffs and the class are entitled to recover 
reasonable attorneys' fees and litigation costs upon entry of 
judgment against any of the defendants, pursuant to Business 
Professions Code  16750(a). 
       86. Plaintiffs and the class are entitled to recover 
pre judgment interest on their actual damages from the date of 
service of this Complaint until the date of entry of judgment in 
this case, pursuant to Business & Professions Code  16750(a) 
and 16761. 
       WHEREFORE plaintiffs and the other members of the class 
pray 
for relief as set forth below. 
 
   THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 
 ( For Breach of Contract ) 
 
       87. All foregoing paragraphs of this Complaint are 
incorporated herein by reference. 
       88. By executing the standardized net profit contracts as 
hereinbefore described and of which representative Agreements are 
attached hereto as Exhibits Cl to 8, plaintiffs and defendants 
entered into valid and enforceable written contracts. These 
contracts are standardized throughout the industry and the 
substantive provisions of the contracts, and the substantive 
definitions of "net profits" contained in each of them, are 
virtually identical. 
       89. In each of the contracts, defendants agreed to pay 
plaintiffs a share of the "net profits" of the motion pictures 
with which the plaintiffs were connected. 
       90 . Plaintiffs have performed fully each and all of the 
conditions, covenants and obligations imposed upon them under 
the 
terms of the Agreements, except to the extent excused therefrom. 
       91. By reason of the conduct described above, defendants 
have materially breached the Agreements in numerous respects. 
Such conduct includes, but is not limited to, failing to pay the 
net profits of the movie to plaintiffs, but instead in a manner 
common to all plaintiffs improperly inflating expenses and/or 
improperly deducting items as expenses. 
92 . AS a direct and proximate result of defendants ' 
material breaches of the Agreements, plaintiffs have suffered 
monetary damages in an amount that is known by defendants who 
have concealed said amount from plaintiffs, but which amount 
exceeds the jurisdictional limits of this Court. 
       WHEREFORE plaintiffs and the other members of the class 
pray 
for relief as set forth below. 
 
        FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
  (For Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith 
             and Fair Dealing) 
       93. All foregoing paragraphs of this Complaint are 
incorporated herein by reference. 
       94. By executing the Agreements alleged herein, plaintiffs 
and defendants entered into written contracts. Plaintiffs thus 
reposed trust and confidence in defendants to, among other 
things, deal with them fairly and in good faith, and not to 
wrongly deprive them of their contractual compensation, including 
but not limited to, the right to share in the profits of the 
movies. Defendants knew of and accepted such trust and 
confidence at the time they entered into the Agreements . 
       95. Plaintiffs have performed fully each and all of the 
conditions, covenants and obligations imposed upon them under 
the 
terms of the Agreements, except to the extent excused therefrom. 
       96. By virtue of the wrongful acts of defendants, and each 
of them, in failing to pay net profit proceeds to plaintiffs, 
defendants breached their duties of good faith and fair dealing. 
      97 . As a proximate result of defendants' actions, 
plaintiffs have suffered monetary damage in an amount within the 
jurisdiction of this Court, together with interest thereon. 
       98. At all times herein alleged, defendants acted 
willfully, wantonly, with oppression, fraud and/or malice, and 
with a conscious disregard of the rights of others, such that 
plaintiffs request that the trier of fact, in the exercise of its 
sound discretion, should award plaintiffs additional damages for 
the sake of example and in a sufficient amount to punish said 
defendants for their conduct, in an amount reasonably related to 
plaintiffs' actual damages and defendants' wealth and 
sufficiently large to be an example to others and to deter these 
defendants and others from engaging in similar conduct in the 
future. 
 
   FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
   (Unjust enrichment) 
       99. All foregoing paragraphs of this Complaint are 
incorporated herein by reference. 
       100. As a result of the wrongful acts of defendants in 
failing to pay plaintiffs net profits proceeds, defendants have 
been unjustly enriched at the expense of plaintiffs by keeping 
monies which should have been paid over to plaintiffs. 
       101 . If defendants are allowed to keep these monies, they 
will unjustly benefit from their actions and the plaintiffs will 
unjustly suffer a loss. 
       102. By virtue of defendants' wrongful acts, and their 
resulting wrongful gain of the funds to which plaintiffs are 
entitled, defendants hold these funds as a constructive trustee 
for the benefit of plaintiffs. 
       WHEREFORE plaintiffs and the other members of the class 
pray 
for relief as set forth below. 
 
   SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
   (Imposition of constructive trust 
        and for an accounting) 
       103. All foregoing paragraphs of this Complaint are 
incorporated herein by reference. 
       104. Based upon the contracts entered into between 
plaintiffs and defendants, plaintiffs have an interest in funds 
which, as alleged herein, should have been paid over to them. 
The specific amount of these funds is unknown to plaintiffs and 
cannot be ascertained without a full and complete accounting, the 
means of which are within the knowledge of the defendants. 
Plaintiffs are informed and believe and on that basis allege that 
the amounts owed exceed the minimal jurisdictional limits of this 
Court . 
       105 . Through the breach of their duties to plaintiffs and 
the wrongful acts which they committed as alleged herein, 
defendants have wrongfully appropriated and failed to pay to 
plaintiffs the funds to which plaintiffs are entitled. 
Plaintiffs have been damaged by their failure to receive the 
monies. 
       106. By virtue of defendants' wrongful acts, and their 
resulting wrongful gain of the funds to which the plaintiffs are 
entitled, defendants hold these funds as a constructive trustee 
for the benefit of plaintiffs. 
       WHEREFORE plaintiffs and the other members of the class 
pray for relief as set forth below. 
      SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
      (For Declaratory Relief) 
       107. All foregoing paragraphs of this Complaint are 
incorporated herein by reference. 
       108. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between 
plaintiffs and defendants in that plaintiffs contend and 
defendants deny that: 
     (a) The Agreements entered into by plaintiffs are 
standardized contracts drafted by defendants, a 
party with superior bargaining strength, and 
imposed by defendants on plaintiffs who lacked 
effective bargaining power and who were given the 
opportunity only to accept or reject the contract, 
and the Agreements therefore constitute an 
unenforceable contract of adhesion. 
   (b) That certain provisions of the Agreements as more 
fully set forth herein were harsh, oppressive and 
unduly one-sided, and thus unconscionable at the 
time the Agreements were entered into and should 
not be enforced . 
   (c) The unconscionable provisions of the Agreements 
taken both in isolation and combined, include, but 
are not limited to, the following: 
   (1) charging a fixed percent overhead on 
operational allowances; 
   (2) charging a fixed percent advertising overhead 
not in proportion to actual costs; 
   (3) charging a fixed rate overhead not in 
proportion to actual costs; 
   (4) charging interest on negative cost balance 
without credit for distribution fees; 
   (5) charging interest on overhead; and 
   (6) charging an interest rate not in proportion 
to the actual cost of finance . 
     (d) The unconscionable provisions of the Agreements, 
should be declared illegal and given no legal 
effect by the Court . 
      WHEREFORE plaintiffs and the other members of the class 
pray 
for relief as set forth below. 
    EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
   (For Violation of Business & Professions Code Section 17200 
     et seq. ) 
       109. All foregoing paragraphs of this Complaint are 
incorporated herein by reference. 
       110. The wrongful conduct of defendants, and each of them, 
constitutes a violation of Business & Professions Code  17200 et 
seq., which prohibits unfair business practices , including 
unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business practices. This conduct 
includes, but is not limited to, unlawfully compelling Talent 
that lack bargaining power to enter into adhesive agreements 
containing standardized net profit definitions which are 
unconscionable in whole or in part. 
       111. Defendants' primary business involves the production 
and distribution of theatrical motion pictures, and the 
Agreements related to and occurred in the course of defendants ' 
business . 
       112. As a direct and proximate result of .defendants' unfair 
competition, defendants have acquired and continue to acquire 
labor, ideas, and intellectual property from plaintiffs. 
       113. Pursuant to California Business & Professions Code 
17204, plaintiffs are entitled to restitution and/or other relief 
necessary to restore to plaintiffs any money or property, which 
were acquired by means of the unfair and unlawful conduct alleged 
herein . 
       WHEREFORE plaintiffs and the other members of the class 
pray 
for relief as set forth below. 
    NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
    (For Injunctive Relief ) 
       114. All foregoing paragraphs of this Complaint are 
incorporated herein by reference. 
       115. Beginning in or around January, 1988 and continuing to 
the present time, as described herein above, Defendants have 
unlawfully and wrongfully engaged in a conspiracy to cheat Talent 
out of their rightful share of the profits of the motion pictures 
that they made possible by forcing them to enter into 
unconscionable contracts and refusing to deal with Talent who 
refused to agree to such contracts. 
       116. The Defendants' continuing wrongful conduct against 
Plaintiffs, unless and until enjoined and restrained by order of 
this Court, will cause great and irreparable harm to the 
Plaintiffs in that they will continue to be forced to accept 
unconscionable terms or will be unable to obtain employment in 
the motion picture industry. 
       117. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law for the 
in juries that are threatened in that pecuniary compensation would 
not afford adequate relief and/or it would be extremely 
difficult to ascertain the amount of compensation that would 
afford adequate relief. 
       WHEREFORE plaintiffs and the other members of the class 
pray 
for relief as set forth below. 
       PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
       Plaintiffs and the class pray for relief as follows: 
       (a) That the unlawful combinations and conspiracies 
alleged in this Complaint be adjudged and decreed to be in 
unreasonable restraint of trade and commerce and in violation of 
Business & Professions Code Section 16720 et seq. 
       (b) That the defendants, and each of them, be enjoined 
from continuing the conspiracies, and all acts in furtherance of 
those conspiracies, as alleged in this Complaint, including but 
not limited to, the use of the standard net profit contracts and 
definitions and the refusal to deal with Talent who will not 
submit to those terms. 
       (c) That the plaintiffs and the class be awarded 
compensatory and general damages according to proof. 
       (d) That the plaintiffs and the class be awarded three 
times their actual damages. 
       (e) That the plaintiffs and the class be awarded 
pre judgment interest at the maximum legal rate. 
       (f) That the plaintiffs and the class be awarded their 
costs of this suit. 
       (g) That the plaintiffs and the class be awarded 
reasonable attorneys fees . 
       (h) That punitive damage be awarded according to 
proof. 
       (i) For a declaration that the terms of the Agreements 
set forth above are unconscionable as according to proof. 
       (j) For an order that defendants should hold the funds 
to which plaintiffs are entitled in trust for plaintiffs. 
      (k) For an accounting on each of the standard form 
contracts according to proof. 
      (l) That the plaintiffs and the class be awarded such 
other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

<P>In this Oct. 13, 1995 proposed settlement, women involved in a class action suit against makers of silicone breast implants were offered substantially than they had received under a previous settlement. More than 430,000 women who claimed to have suffered illnesses relating to their implants applied for relief under the 1993 settlement. Dow Corning, the primary defendant in the suit, declared bankruptcy in May 1995, due to the class settlement and numerous individual suits against it. The awards previously ranged from $100,000 to $2 million. The new settlement grants awards of $10,000 to $250,000. </P>

      3. Late Registrants: all other eligible participants 
(i.e., all other non-foreign class members with a Bristol, 
Baxter, 3M or Post-'84 McGhan implant) who are not Current 
Claimants under B1 or Other Registrants under B2 above but 
who register with the Claims Office. As under the global 
settlement, it is anticipated that at some point the court 
will establish a final deadline for persons to register with 
the Claims Office. 
 
C. Opt-out Rights of Eligible Participants 
 
      1. Subject to the limitation in C2 below, any eligible 
participant may reject the settlement offer by filing an 
opt-out election that is received by the Claims Office not 
later than 45 days after date of Notification of status of 
the participant's registration and claim as provided in I2. 
Statutes of limitations and repose will remain suspended for 
6 months after the Claims Office receives the opt-out 
election. 
 
      2. Late Registrants will not have the opt-out right 
described in C1 above unless they register with the Claims 
Office by 4/1/96 
 
      3. Current Claimants and Other Registrants may 
expedite receipt of the Advance Payments provided in D1 and 
E3 below by waiving the opt-out right provided in C1 above. 
 
      4. Certain ongoing opt-out rights are provided in 
D2b(2) and E2c below. 
 
D. Benefits for Current Claimants[fn 4]: 
 
      1. Advance Payment. A non-refundable advance payment 
of $5,000 will be paid as soon as the Claims Office 
determines that a person has not opted out within the time 
permitted under C1 (or under C3 has waived the remaining 
time to opt out), is a Current Claimant, and has sufficient 
manufacturer identification information. Payment will be 
made without regard to the status of any appeals relating to 
this settlement and without regard to the existence of any 
deficiencies in the claim. The $5,000 payment will be 
credited against other amounts payable to the claimant under 
the settlement or awarded in a judgment recovered against 
settling defendants in later litigation,[fn 5] but otherwise 
is not refundable unless the Claims Office determines the 
claim to have been fraudulently presented. 
 
      2. Compensation. Benefits (less the Advance Payment 
under D1 above and subject to reduction under F1 below if 
the claimant also has Dow, post-'84 McGhan, or Mentor 
implants) to be paid to a Current Claimant, at the 
claimant's election, under either Option One or Option Two. 
 
      a. Option One--Fixed Benefits for Current Claimants: A 
fixed amount (not increased or decreased by later changes in 
claimant's condition) based on disease definitions and 
severity/disability categories in the original Disease 
Schedule (Exhibit D to global settlement). Upon satisfying 
these criteria (and with satisfactory evidence respecting, 
implant manufacturer identification), a claimant electing 
this option will be paid according to the following schedule 
based on the severity/disability level and on whether by 
12/16/96 there is appropriate documentation of rupture of a 
Bristol, Baxter, or 3M implant. Claims will be processed by 
the Claims Office in accordance with all relevant provisions 
of the original global settlement. 
 
Option One--Fixed Benefits (Current Claimants Only) 
 
Disability Level - A 
Base Amount - $50,000 
Supplement if rupture - + $50,000 = $100,000 
 
 
Disability Level - B 
Base Amount - $20,000 
Supplement if rupture - + $30,000 = $50,000 
 
 
Disability Level - C or D 
Base Amount - $10,000 
Supplement if rupture - + $15,000 = $25,000 
 
 
     (1) On electing to proceed under Option One, Current 
Claimants will, upon satisfying the criteria and approval by 
the Claims Office, be paid the specified amount (less the 
advance payment) upon full release of all claims against all 
settling defendants (and other released parties). The 
obligation of settling defendants to pay both the base 
amount and the increased amount for ruptures is not affected 
by the number or amounts of claims or by the number of 
opt-outs. Payments will be made as soon as the claim is 
approved and upon execution of a standard-form release, 
without regard to the pendency of any appeals. A Current 
Claimant initially qualifying only for the base amount will 
be paid the rupture supplement (maximum one per claimant) on 
proof by 12/16/96 of rupture. 
 
     (2) Payments of $25,000 or less will be paid in a 
single lump sum; payments of more than $25,000 will be paid 
in two equal annual installments. 
 
     (3)  "Rupture" of a Baxter, Bristol, or 3M 
implant--which, if documented by 12/16/96, affects benefit 
levels for Current Claimants under Option One--refers to the 
failure of the elastomer envelope(s) surrounding a 
silicone-gel implant to contain the gel (resulting in 
contact of the gel with the body), not solely as a result of 
"gel bleed", but due to a tear or other opening in the 
envelope(s) after implantation and prior to the explantation 
procedure. To qualify for a rupture supplement, the Claimant 
must have undergone an explantation operation at which the 
rupture was confirmed and must submit a contemporaneous 
operative and/or pathology report (and related statements) 
documenting the rupture in accordance with the protocol in 
Exhibit F. For explantations after 1/1/96, the claimant 
shall use her best efforts to cause the removed implant to 
be preserved and, if requested by the Claims Office, to 
provide the removed implant to the Claims Office or to an 
examiner designated by the Claims Office to resolve or 
report on the issue of rupture. 
 
      b. Option Two: As an altemative to Option One, Current 
Claimants may choose Option Two for long-term benefits under 
E2 below. Benefits under Option Two depend on satisfying 
during the 15 year period of the program the more restricted 
disease and severity criteria specified in Exhibit E (rather 
than the disease and severity/disability categories 
specified in the Disease Schedule attached as Exhibit D to 
the original global settlement notice). Upon satisfying 
these criteria and approval by the Claims Office, the 
claimant will be paid in accordance with the schedule shown 
in E2 below, depending on the new disease/severity criteria. 
 
     (1) The obligation of defendants to pay approved SS/SLE 
benefits under Option Two to a Current Claimant whose claim 
for SS/SLE under the global settlement would have been 
either approved or treated as having only minor deficiencies 
(and to pay approved GCTS/PM/DM benefits under Option Two to 
a Current Claimant with any claim that under the global 
settlement would have been approved or treated as having 
only minor deficiencies) is not affected by the number or 
amounts of claims, by the number of opt- outs, or by the 
maximum cumulative obligations of settling defendants under 
E2c below; and, upon execution of mutually satisfactory 
releases with individual claimants, the settling defendants 
will pay these amounts without regard to the pendency of any 
appeals relating to this settlement. 
 
     (2) Current Claimants who elect and qualify for 
compensation under Option Two will be treated as also 
eligible, during the 15 years of the program, for additional 
compensation in the same manner as for Other Registrants and 
subject to the provisions of E2c. That is, if a Current 
Claimant who receives a payment under Option Two later 
develops during the 15 years of the program a condition that 
would entitle her to a larger amount, she would at that time 
be entitled to the difference between the new compensation 
amount and any amount previously paid. If at that time she 
does not receive this increase because of the maximum 
cumulative obligations of the defendants under E2c below, 
she would have the same opt-out right as stated in E2c. 
 
     (3) Current Claimants electing Option Two may, at any 
time during the 15 year period of the program before being 
awarded benefits under Option Two, elect to return to Option 
One but with a 25 % reduction in the amount they would 
otherwise receive under Option One. 
 
3.  Post-'84 McGhan implants. Current Claimants with only 
Post-'84 McGhan implants (or only Post-'84 McGhan implants 
plus implants from Bioplasty, Cox Uphoff/CUI or Mentor) 
shall be eligible for Option One benefits as set forth in 
D2a above, excluding rupture supplements. Payments to such 
claimants are not payable until 30 days after the Court's 
Final Order with respect to this Revised Settlement Program 
becomes final. Thereafter, payments will be made to 
claimants with approved claims upon execution of a standard 
form release. 
 
E. General Benefits for Participants 
 
      1. Explantation expenses. Although not recommending 
explantation absent some specific medical reason to do so, 
the settling defendants will pay $3,000 to Current Claimants 
and Other Registrants who, after 411194 and within the 15 
years of the program, have a Bristol, Baxter, or 3M implant 
removed (without the surgery also involving reimplantation 
of a silicone-gel implant). 
 
      a. The obligation of settling defendants to make this 
payment is not affected by the number or amounts of claims 
or by the number of opt-outs, or by the amount of money paid 
as benefits under E2 below. This $3,000 payment is not 
subject to refund (unless the participant later elects to 
opt-out under C1), but would be credited against any 
judgment against settling defendants in subsequent 
litigation by the participant.[fn 6] 
 
      b. Payment of these expenses does not reduce the 
amount of a participant's benefits under E2 (or the amount 
of benefits for Current Claimants under Option One). 
 
      c. Explantation expenses are not payable to "Late 
Registrants". 
 
      d. Although intended only as means to defray medical 
costs of explantation, the amount will not be reduced as a 
result of the person actually incurring less than $3,000 in 
expenses, whether as a result of a smaller charge for the 
explantation procedure or as a result of insurance or 
governmental health programs. 
 
      e. In addition, as an optional alternative to the 
$3,000 assistance offer, the settling defendants in the 
future may provide a list of surgeons willing to perform 
explantations, if the claimant so chooses, without any 
charge personally to the claimant. 
 
      2. Compensation. On proof of satisfying, during the 
15-year period of the program, the revised disease and 
severity criteria specified in Exhibit E, eligible 
participants will be paid (subject to reduction under F1 
below if the participant also has Dow, Post-'84 McGhan, or 
Mentor implants) compensation under the following 
schedule,[fn 7] depending on the new disease/severity 
criteria. 
 
 
Option Two -- Long-Term Benefits 
 
Disease -- Severity Level: SS/SLE--A 
Amount: $250,000 
 
Disease -- Severity Level: SS/SLE--B 
Amount: $200,000 
 
Disease -- Severity Level: SS/SLE--C 
Amount: $150,000 
 
Disease -- Severity Level: GCTS/PM/DM--A 
Amount: $110,000 
 
Disease -- Severity Level: GCTS--B 
Amount: $75,000 
 
 
      a. Benefits are to be paid in annual installments (as 
needed) of $100,000. These benefits are in addition to any 
payment related to explantation under E1 above. 
 
      b. If during the 15 years of the program the person 
develops a condition that would entitle her to a larger 
amount than she has previously received, she would at that 
time be entitled to the difference between the new 
compensation amount and any amount previously paid. 
 
      c. The maximum obligation of the defendants to make 
payments under this program (E2) is $755,000,000 (less 
amounts paid for explantation expenses of Other Registrants 
under E1 above[fn 8]), with obligated payments as follows: 
 
 --  Bristol's cumulative obligation under E2 ($400,000,000) 
increases in the amount of $27,600,000 per year for the 
first 10 years and $24,000,000 per year for the next 5 years 
(less amounts paid by it for explantation expenses of Other 
Registrants under E1) 
 
--  Baxter's cumulative obligation under E2 ($193,000,000) 
increases in the amount of $13,300,000 per year for the 
first 10 years and $12,000,000 per year for the next 5 years 
(less amounts paid by it for explantation expenses of Other 
Registrants under E1) 
 
--  3M's cumulative obligation under E2 for 3M implants 
($132,000,000) increases in the amount of $9,100,000 per 
year for the first 10 years and $8,200,000 per year for the 
next 5 years (less amounts paid by it for explantation 
expenses of Other Registrants under E1) 
 
--  3M's cumulative obligation under E2 for Post-'84 McGhan 
implants ($12,000,000) increases in the amount of $800,000 
per year for 15 years (less the amount, if any, that its 
payments under D3 for Post-'84 McGhan implants exceed 
$76,800,000) 
 
--  McGhan's cumulative obligation under E2 for Post-'84 
McGhan implants ($6,000,000) increases in the amount of 
$400,000 per year for 15 years (less the amount, if any that 
its payments under D3 for Post-'84 McGhan implants exceed 
$38,400,000) 
 
--  Union Carbide's cumulative obligation under E2 for 
Post-'84 McGhan implants ($12,000,000) increases in the 
amount of $800,000 per year for 15 years (less the amount, 
if any, that its payments under D3 for Post-'84 McGhan 
implants exceed $76,800,000) 
 
If these cumulative limitations in any year result in any 
participant not being paid the full amount (or installment) 
shown in the schedule, then such person would at that time 
have the option either (1) to accept a reduced amount based 
on the defendant's obligated payment (with a carry forward 
of the unpaid portion for potential payment in future years 
if within the defendant's obligated payments) or (2) to opt 
out from the settlement, with the rights to pursue 
litigation against the settling defendants for compensatory 
damages (but not punitive or statutory multiple damages). 
Participants electing to opt out (a) must first return any 
amounts previously paid under the program (other than for 
explantation expenses or, for Current Claimants, as an 
Advance Payment) and (b) shall be given the opportunity, if 
they so elect, to participate in non- binding mediation, in 
accordance with procedures to be established by the court, 
in an effort to resolve their claims. 
 
      d. Benefits to Late Registrants under this program 
will, as under the terms of the global settlement, be paid 
only if, when, and to the extent the defendant's cumulative 
payment obligations under this program exceed the payments 
to other participants claiming under this program; and such 
Late Registrants will have no right to opt out because of 
failure to receive the full amount shown in the schedule. 
 
      3. Advance Payment. A non-refundable advance payment 
of $1,000 will be paid as soon as the Claims Office 
determines that a person has not opted out within the time 
permitted under C1 (or under C3 has waived the remaining 
time to opt out). is an Other Registrant, and has sufficient 
manufacturer identification information of having had a 
Bristol. Baxter, or 3M implant. Payment will be made without 
regard to the status of any appeals relating to this 
settlement and without regard to the existence of any 
deficiencies in the claim. The $1,000 payment will be 
credited against other amounts payable to the claimant under 
the settlement or awarded in a judgment recovered against 
settling defendants in later litigation,[fn 9] but otherwise 
is not refundable unless the Claims Office determines the 
claim to have been fraudulently presented. 
 
F. Multiple Implants 
 
      1. Amounts payable are, in general, not diminished by 
a person's having one or more implants manufactured by other 
companies in addition to implants from the settling 
defendants. However-- 
 
      a. If a participant has received one or more Dow 
implants in addition to one or more Bristol, Baxter, or 3M 
implants, the benefits provided under Option One and Option 
Two (but not the amount of the Advance Payment or the amount 
for explantation expenses) will be reduced by 50%. For 
example, if a Current Claimant qualifying under Option Two 
for a payment of $200,000 had one or more Bristol implants, 
one or more Dow implants, a Mentor implant, a McGhan implant 
manufactured after 813184, and an implant whose manufacturer 
could not be identified, her compensation would be reduced 
to $100,000. 
 
      b. If a participant does not have a Dow implant, but 
has one or more Post-'84 McGhan or Mentor implants in 
addition to one or more Bristol, Baxter, or 3M implants, the 
benefits provided under Option Two (but not the amount of 
the Advance Payment or the amount for explantation expenses) 
will be reduced by 25 % . 
 
      c. Persons who have received one or more Post-'84 
McGhan implants and one or more Dow implants but who have 
not received any Bristol, Baxter, or 3M implant are not 
eligible to participate under this Revised Settlement 
Program. 
 
      d. Participation in this program does not release 
claims a participant may have against entities and persons 
that are not the settling defendants or Released Parties 
under Exhibit B1. Participants are, however, cautioned that 
bankruptcy rules provide a stay at the present time against 
institution or pursuit of claims against Dow Corning, and, 
to preserve claims against Dow Corning, participants may 
need to file appropriate claims in the bankruptcy court. 
 
      2. The obligations of the settling defendants to make 
payments under this program are several, not joint, and are 
limited to the approved claims involving implants from that 
defendant or with respect to which that defendant is 
agreeing to make payments. 
 
      a. If a person has implants from more than one of 
Bristol, Baxter, or 3M, their obligations are divided simply 
on the basis of the number of such defendants whose implants 
the claimant had.[fn 10] For example, if a person had one or 
more Bristol implants, one or more Baxter implants, a 
Post-'84 McGhan implant, and a Mentor implant, and (after 
the 25% reduction for Post-'84 McGhan and Mentor implants) 
was entitled to a $150,000 payment, then Bristol would be 
responsible for payment of $75,000 and Baxter for payment of 
$75,000. 
 
      b. The obligations of McGhan, 3M, and Union Carbide 
with respect to payments to persons who have only Post-'84 
McGhan implants (or only Post-'84 McGhan implants and 
implants from only Bioplasty, Cox Uphoff/CUI, or Mentor) are 
also several. 3M and Union Carbide shall each be obligated 
to make 40% of each such payment, and McGhan shall be 
obligated to make 20% of each such payment. 
 
G. Attorney Fees and Administrative Expenses 
 
      1. Fees and expenses of attorneys representing an 
individual participant in the program are to be paid by the 
participant (or from benefits payable to her under this 
program) in accordance with the arrangements made between 
the participant and the attorney, but the court is reserving 
the power to set some appropriate standards and limitations 
on those arrangements (such as precluding the inclusion of 
explantation reimbursement from the calculation of a 
recovery-based contingent fee). Amounts payable to 
participants will not be subject to any reduction for fees 
and expenses of attorneys for representing the plaintiff 
class or for other "common benefit" services. 
 
      2. Pursuant to Order No. 13, 6% of the amounts paid to 
participants under this program will be paid by defendants 
as a surcharge (in addition to benefits paid to 
participants) into the previously established fund as a 
means for compensating and reimbursing counsel providing 
"common benefit" services. Under terms of that order, 
participants would receive on a pro-rata basis an increase 
in individual benefits should the court determine that the 
amount of the fund exceeds the reasonable fees and expenses 
chargeable against it. 
 
      3. Amounts previously paid by defendants under the 
global settlement to support operations of the Claims Office 
and for other administrative purposes will remain under the 
court's jurisdiction for those purposes. Settling defendants 
will pay such additional sums for operations of the Claims 
Office during the 15-year period of the program as 
determined by the court (in consultation with the settling 
defendants) to be necessary for that purpose. Allocation 
among settling defendants of the amounts paid for Claims 
Office and administrative expenses shall be based upon the 
number of claimants applying for benefits allocable to each 
of the settling defendants, and shall be adjusted on an 
on-going basis as necessary by the Court. 
 
      H. Documentation. Current Claimants, Other 
Registrants, and Late Registrants may, throughout the 15 
year period of the program, submit documentation respecting 
manufacturer identification, medical conditions and 
disability, and other matters affecting eligibility or 
entitlement to benefits in accordance with governing 
procedures. The Claims Office may, however, establish 
regulations relating to the submission of medical 
documentation and setting reasonable periods at which to 
conduct evaluations or re-evaluations of a person's 
eligibility and benefits based on supplemental submissions 
and for submission of supplemental documentation after 
notice of deficiencies. Initial documentation showing 
manufacturer identification must be presented to the Claims 
Office no later than 12/16/96 by participants claiming 
status as Current Claimants, as must documentation of a 
claim for rupture supplement under Option One. 
 
      I. Claims Office Procedures. The Claims Office will 
continue to process and evaluate all domestic registrations 
and claims submitted to it as expeditiously as possible, but 
will give priority of consideration to claims in which the 
claimant has indicated having a Bristol, Baxter, or 3M 
implant. 
 
      1. Protocols governing the required identification of 
manufacturers of claimants' implants are included in the 
attached Exhibit F. In order to be processed as a Current 
Claimant, a form to be provided by the Claims Office 
regarding proof of manufacturer identification must be 
received by the Claims Office by 12/16/96; earlier 
presentation of the form will expedite processing of Current 
Claims. The manufacturer defendants agree to provide 
reasonable assistance (including access to their records) to 
claimants who have difficulties in identifying the 
manufacturer of their implants from their own medical 
records. At their request, defendants shall be afforded 
access to documentation and other supporting evidence 
submitted by a claimant to identify manufacturers of her 
implants (but redacted to preserve the confidentiality of 
the claimant's identity), and shall bring to the Claim 
Administrator's attention any submissions not covered by 
existing protocols. In such instances, defendants and 
Settlement Class Counsel shall have the opportunity to 
submit to the Claims Administrator written suggestions for 
amendments or additions to the existing protocols to address 
the questions raised by the claimants' offers of proof. Any 
amendments or additions to the promulgated protocols will be 
published on the Claims Office computer bulletin board and 
be made available on request to any class member or 
attorney. 
 
      2. Processing of Claims: As claims are processed and 
evaluated, the Claims Office will send each participant a 
Notification of Status indicating whether her proof of 
manufacturer identification is satisfactory; whether she is 
classified as a Current Claimant, Other Registrant, or Late 
Registrant; whether any documentation submitted in support 
of a rupture supplement under Option One is satisfactory; 
whether she is entitled to any Option One payment (and, if 
so, the amount of such payment); whether there are any 
deficiencies in the submission; and whether there is a 
deadline for submitting supplemental documentation relating 
to deficiencies. If there are deficiencies in any of the 
materials that are subject to correction, the Notification 
will so advise. This Notification, which triggers the 
opt-out period under C1, will be sent to the last address 
provided to the Claims Office, with a copy to the person's 
attorney if one has been indicated. 
 
      3. The Claims Office will continue to implement 
procedures designed to detect and prevent payment of 
fraudulent claims. It should be recognized, however, that 
these procedures cannot be fully implemented preceding 
Advance Payments under D1 and E3 above in view of the goal 
to make such payments as soon as possible. 
 
      4. Under its plenary responsibilities to assure an 
acceptable level of reliability and quality control of 
claims, the Claims Office may require, without expense to 
the claimant, an examination or review by a physician or 
laboratory selected by the Claims Office. 
 
      J. Funding. Each settling defendant will pay into the 
fund established by the court such amounts as, from time to 
time during the 15 year period of the program, are estimated 
by the court with the assistance of the Claims Office to be 
needed (after considering undistributed funds previously 
contributed to the fund by that defendant) to pay benefits 
(or installments) for which that settling defendant will 
become obligated to pay during the next 3 months. The fund 
will maintain appropriate records defining amounts 
contributed and disbursed with respect to each settling 
defendant and with respect to the Current Claimant and Other 
Registrant programs. The obligations of the defendants to 
contribute to funding of Option Two under E2 (except as 
specified in D2b(1)) are limited to annual cumulative 
amounts indicated in E2c above. As an initial reserve, 
Bristol, Baxter, and 3M will each pay into the fund by 
January 15, 1996, at least $125,000,000. 
 
      K. Miscellaneous. 
 
1. Establishment of the settlement program and payments 
under the program do not constitute any admission by 
defendants of fault, liability, or damages, and will not be 
admissible in evidence in the event a participant at some 
point opts out and proceeds with litigation against the 
defendants (except that any judgment obtained by participant 
will be reduced by any payment under this settlement). 
 
     2. All of the Released Parties identified by the 
settling defendants in Exhibit B1 are released to the same 
extent as are the settling defendants. 
 
     3. Subject to appropriate conditions to protect 
claimant confidentiality, insurers for settling defendants 
will be afforded access to appropriate records of the Claims 
Office as may be necessary for defendants to receive 
benefits under such insurance policies.[fn 11] 
 
     4. Subrogation-type claims by insurers or governmental 
agencies based on payment of medical expenses of 
participants will, to the extent enforceable under 
applicable laws, be the responsibility of eligible 
participants; settling defendants will have no additional 
responsibilities to such insurers and agencies and will be 
protected by participants against such claims. 
 
     5. Where this program establishes deadlines for filing 
elections, supporting materials, etc. with the Claims 
Office, the materials must be actually received at the 
Claims Office by 5pm, central time, on that date. Fax 
transmissions will not be acceptable. 
 
     6. The various elections under this program may be made 
either by the participant or by the participant's previously 
designated attorney. In the event of a conflict between 
elections made by a participant and the participant's 
attorney, the participant's election controls. 
 
     7. The court shall appoint an independent public 
accounting firm to (a) conduct an annual financial audit of 
the Claims Office in accordance with Generally Accepted 
Auditing Standards and (b) conduct an audit or audits of the 
processing of claims by any outside claims evaluators. 
Reports will be made available to the parties subject to 
appropriate conditions to protect claimant confidentiality. 
 
     8. Settling defendants and Released Parties 
will--subject to the provisions of this program--be fully, 
completely, and forever released from all claims of 
non-foreign class members who have at least one breast 
implant manufactured by one of the settling defendants or 
their predecessors or subsidiaries, including derivative 
claims of their spouses, children, parents, and others; and 
such class members, including those with derivative claims 
(but excluding the claims of children for their own injury), 
will be permanently enjoined from asserting, instituting, or 
prosecuting any breast implant-related claim against a 
settling defendant or released party. 
 
     9. This program will continue to be subject to the 
court's previous orders concerning contribution and 
indemnification claims against the settling defendants and 
Released Parties. 
 
     10. This settlement program resolves--subject to its 
terms--all breast-implant related claims (including 
derivative claims of spouses, parents, children, and others) 
against the settling defendants (and their respective 
Released Parties) by non-foreign class members who have at 
least one breast implant manufactured by one of the settling 
defendants or their predecessors or subsidiaries unless such 
class members (a) opted out of the settlement class under 
the global settlement during the 1994 opt-out period (and do 
not withdraw their exclusion under A2), (b) opt out of this 
settlement program under C1 above, or (c) exercise an 
additional opt-out right as provided in sections D2b(2) and 
E2c above. All claims for compensation must be made by the 
end of the fifteenth year of the program (12/15/2010). Any 
claim by such a class member not made during that period 
would be forever barred. 
 
     11. Unless otherwise provided, the terms used herein 
are as defined in the Breast Implant Litigation Settlement 
Notice, the Breast Implant Litigation Settlement Agreement, 
and the Court's Final Order and Judgment dated September 1, 
1994, together with any prior orders incorporated therein by 
reference. Benefits under this program are in lieu of all 
other benefits that participants and their attorneys might 
have had under the global settlement. 
 
     12. The obligations of Bristol, Baxter, and 3M to fund 
Option Two benefits for both Current Claimants and Other 
Registrants will be suspended if the provisions of A, B, C,

EXHIBIT E--Revised Disease and Severity Definitions 
 
I. General 
 
      A. A claimant must file with the Claims Office all 
medical records establishing the required findings or 
laboratory abnormalities. Qualifying findings must have 
occurred within a single 24-month period within the five 
years immediately preceding the submission of the claim. 
(Findings supplemented in response to a deficiency letter 
sent by the Claims Office do not have to fall within the 
24-month period outlined above.) 
 
      B. If exclusions are noted for a required finding, the 
physician making the finding or ordering the test must 
affirmatively state that those listed exclusions are not 
present. The physician recording a GCTS finding or making a 
disease diagnosis must also affirmatively state that the 
qualifying symptoms did not exist before the date of first 
implantation. (This statement can be based upon patient 
history so long as consistent with medical records in the 
physician's possession.) Failure to make these affirmative 
statements will result in a deficiency letter. All 
underlying office charts, radiology/pathology reports, and 
test results must be supplied to the Claims Office. 
 
     II. Scleroderma (SS): A claim for scleroderma must 
include a diagnosis of systemic sclerosis/scleroderma made 
by a board-certified rheumatologist based upon personal 
examination of the patient. [Exclusion: localized 
scleroderma] Supporting medical documentation must 
affirmatively reveal that the major or at least two of the 
minor criteria listed below are present: 
 
      A. Major criterion: Proximal scleroderma - symmetric 
thickening, tightening, and induration of the skin of the 
fingers and the skin proximal to the metacarpophalangeal or 
metatarsophalangeal joints. The changes may affect the 
entire extremity, face, neck, and trunk (thorax and 
abdomen). Description of this criterion is adequate if the 
board-certified rheumatologist records that physical 
examination of the patient revealed scleroderma skin 
thickening, and adequately describes the parts of the body 
where that thickened skin was found. 
 
      B. Minor Criteria: 
 
      1. Sclerodactyly: Above-indicated skin changes limited 
to the fingers. 
 
      2. Digital pitting scars or loss of substance from the 
finger pad: Depressed areas at tips of fingers or loss of 
digital pad tissue as a result of ischemia. 
 
      3. Bibasilar pulmonary fibrosis: Bilateral reticular 
pattern of linear of lineonodular densities most pronounced 
in basilar portions of the lungs on standard chest 
roentgenogram; may assume appearance of diffuse mottling or 
"honeycomb lung." These changes should not be attributable 
to primary lung disease. 
 
Compensation Levels: 
 
      A. Death resulting from SS, or severe chronic renal 
involvement manifested by a glomerular filtration rate of 
less than 50% of the age- and gender-adjusted norm, as 
measured by an adequate 24-hour urine specimen collection. 
 
      B. Clinically significant cardio-pulmonary 
manifestations of scleroderma[fn 1*] or proximal scleroderma 
on the trunk (thorax and abdomen). 
 
      C. A diagnosis of scleroderma in accordance with the 
above criteria that does not involve the findings in A or B 
above. 
 
III. SLE (Lupus): A claim for SLE must include a diagnosis 
of SLE (lupus) made by a board-certified rheumatologist 
based upon personal examination of the patient. [Exclusion: 
mild lupus (SLE not requiring regular medical attention 
including doctor visits and regular prescription 
medications)] Supporting medical documentation must 
affirmatively reveal that at least four of the following 11 
criteria are present:

EXHIBIT F--Protocols for Manufacturer 
 
Identification and Proof of Rupture 
 
I. General 
 
The following protocols shall govern the methods of proving 
(1) the identity of a particular settling defendant as the 
manufacturer of a claimant's implant[fn 1**] and (2) the 
fact that a claimant experienced a rupture in one of the 
settling defendant's implants. 
 
II. Manufacturer Identification 
 
A. Acceptable Proof 
 
The following methods of proof, absent fraud, shall be 
clearly acceptable for purposes of establishing that a 
claimant's implant (s) were (was) manufactured by one of the 
settling defendants: 
 
      1. contemporaneous hospital or surgeon operative 
records specifying that the claimant was implanted with a 
settling defendant's implant (s); 
 
      2. certified copy of claimant's medical records 
containing the implant package label; or 
 
      3. where proof specified under 1 and 2 above is 
unavailable: (a) an affirmative statement from the medical 
doctor who performed the implantation or from a responsible 
person at the treating facility, attesting that the claimant 
was implanted with a settling defendant's implants and 
providing the basis for that conclusion (which cannot rest 
upon unacceptable proof (see IIB below)); and (b) a 
statement from the claimant describing the steps taken to 
secure proof under methods 1 and 2 above and the reasons for 
the unavailability of such proof. 
 
B. Unacceptable Proof 
 
Statements from medical personnel describing their typical 
or general practices concerning implant usage during a given 
time period, or a statement from the claimant (or a 
claimant's relative or friend) that seeks to identify the 
manufacturer based upon recollection, shall be unacceptable 
as proof of manufacturer identity. 
 
C. Additional Methods of Proof to be Accepted 
 
The settling defendants anticipate that there may be other 
methods of acceptable proof of manufacturer identity in 
addition to those set forth under IIA above. Accordingly, 
counsel for the settling defendants shall consult with the 
Claims Administrator and Settlement Class Counsel to 
consider additional acceptable methods of proof to be 
incorporated into this protocol. Any such methods shall 
require the consent of the affected settling defendant(s). 
 
 
III. Proof of Rupture 
 
A. Acceptable Proof 
 
The following methods of proof, absent fraud, shall be 
clearly acceptable for purposes of establishing that a 
claimant experienced a rupture in one of the settling 
defendant's imPlants. 
 
      1. With respect to ruptures documented by explant 
operations that occurred on or before 1/1/92, a 
contemporaneous operative or pathology report documenting 
the rupture. 
 
      2. With respect to ruptures documented by explant 
operations that occurred after 1/1/92, a contemporaneous 
operative report and, if available, a contemporaneous 
pathology report, together with a statement as to whether 
the ruptured implant (s) has (have) been preserved and, if 
so, the name and address of the custodian. 
 
      3. In addition to the reports described in IIIA2 
above, for explantations after 1/1/96 the claimant shall use 
her best efforts to cause the removed implant to be 
preserved and the explanting surgeon or other appropriate 
professional approved by the Claims Office shall provide a 
statement affirming that, in his or her opinion, the rupture 
did not occur during the explantation procedure (or 
thereafter). The statement must describe the results of the 
inspection and provide a factual basis for the opinion 
(e.g., in light of silicone granuloma formation on the 
exterior of the biologic capsule, or findings concerning the 
nature of the destruction of the elastomer envelope). 
 
B. Unacceptable Proof 
 
Non-contemporaneous statements from medical personnel 
recalling that a claimant's implant was ruptured upon 
explantation, or a similar statement from the claimant (or a 
claimant's relative or friend), shall be unacceptable as 
proof of a ruptured implant. 
 
C. Additional Methods of Proof to be Accepted. 
 
The settling defendants anticipate that there may be other 
methods of acceptable proof of rupture in addition to those 
set forth in IIIA above. Accordingly, counsel for the 
settling defendants shall consult with the Claims 
Administrator and Settlement Class Counsel to consider 
additional acceptable proposed methods to be incorporated 
into this protocol. Any such proposed methods shall require 
the consent of the settling defendants. 
 
 
=============================== 
 
Endnotes 
 
        1. For purposes of this Revised Settlement Program, 
3M implants are defined as 3M/McGhan implants implanted (or 
manufactured in whole or in part) before 8/3/84. 
 
        2. For purposes of this Revised Settlement Program, 
Post-'8 1 McGhan implants are defined as silicone gel 
implants manufactured at or by McGhan wholly after 813/81 
McGhan. 3M, and Union Carbide have agreed to provide certain 
benefits under this Revised Settlement Program to 
participants who have or had only Post-'8 I McGhan implants 
or who have or had only such implants and implants 
manufactured by Bioplasty, Cox Uphoff/CUI or Mentor. 
 
        3. Each settling defendant must provide to the 
Claims Office, by December 15, 1995, a list identifying all 
such persons. 
 
       4. Current Claimants with only Post-'84 McGhan 
implants (or only Post-'84 McGhan implants plus implants 
from Bioplasty, Cox Uphoff/CUI or Mentor) will receive only 
the benefits set forth in D3 below. 
 
       5. Under certain conditions claimants may have later 
rights to opt out and pursue litigation against settling 
defendants (See D2b(2)) To exercise such an opt-out right, 
the claimant would first have to return any amounts 
previously paid (other than the Advance Payment and 
explantation payments). 
 
       6. Under certain conditions the participant may have 
the later right to opt out and pursue litigation against 
settling defendants. (See E2c below ) 
 
       7. Other Registrants with only Post-'84 McGhan 
implants (or only Post-'84 McGhan implants plus implants 
from Bioplasty, Cox Uphoff/CUI, or Mentor) will be eligible 
for Option Two benefits as follows: SS/SLE-A,B, or C 
--$50,000; GCTS/PM/DM-A -- $20,000; and GCTS-B -- $10,000. 
 
       8. In the event the settling defendants provide a 
list of surgeons to perform explantation without charge to 
claimants (under E1e above), the settling defendants shall 
be entitled to a $3,000 credit per operation 
 
       9. Under certain conditions claimants may have later 
rights to opt out and pursue litigation against settling 
defendants. (See E2c). To exercise such an opt-out right, 
the claimant would first have to return any amounts 
previously paid (other than the Advance Payment and 
explantation payments). 
 
       10. Enhancement payments for rupture, however, remain 
the sole responsibility of the settling defendant(s) whose 
implant(s) ruptured. 
 
        11. The court finds that the amounts to be paid 
under this revised settlement program by each settling 
defendant will, from the defendant's standpoint, represent a 
reasonable settlement of compensatory bodily injury claims 
from breast implants. 
 
        1*. As manifested by interstitial fibrosis (based 
upon physical examination findings and abnormalities seen on 
chest x-ray or chest CT) or pulmonary hypertension (based 
upon physical examination fundings and 2-D Echo doppler or 
angiography with hemodynamic measurements showing 
pulmonary 
artery pressures of greater than 25 TORR). 
 
        1**. The methods of proof set forth in Part II below 
apply only to the identification of settling defendant 
manufacturers. Each claimant also must provide a complete 
implant history. If a claimant is unable to identify another 
manufacturer, she must describe the reasonable steps she 
took to so identify and state why she was unable to do so.

Plaintiff LEONARD D. JACOBY alleges as follows:  
 
 
PARTIES 
 
1.   Plaintiff LEONARD D. JACOBY ("Jacoby") is a natural 
person domiciled and residing in the State of California, Los 
Angeles County.  
 
2.   Plaintiff is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, 
that defendant GAIL J. KOFF ("Koff") is a natural person 
domiciled and residing in the State of New York.  
 
3.   Plaintiff is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, 
that defendant STEPHEN Z. MEYERS ("Meyers") is a natural 
person domiciled and residing in the State of New York.  
 
COMMON FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
 
4.   On or about January 1, 1984, Jacoby, Meyers and Koff 
(collectively, "Partners") entered into the Amended and Restated 
General Partnership Agreement of Jacoby & Meyers Law Offices 
("Partnership Agreement"), which created the present form of the 
Jacoby and Meyers Law Offices, a California general partnership 
("Partnership").  
 
5.   Section 1.6 of the Partnership Agreement vests full 
management of the Partnership in the Management Committee, 
permanently composed of Jacoby, Meyers and Koff, each with 
one vote for each unit of participation allocated to the particular 
partner.  
 
6.   Section 8.1 of the Partnership Agreement provides that 
Jacoby and Meyers each hold 40 units of participation and Koff 
holds 20 units of participation.  
 
7.   The Partnership Agreement provides generally for 
management decisions by the Management Committee on a 
majority basis.  Specific decisions enumerated in the Partnership 
Agreement, however, require unanimous approval of the 
Management Committee, defined by Section 1.9 of the 
Partnership Agreement as the unanimous approval of Jacoby, 
Meyers and Koff.  
 
8.   Unanimous approval of the Management Committee is 
required in order to:  (a) change the principal office of the 
Partnership from Los Angeles, California [Section 2.4, 
Partnership Agreement]; (b) modify the procedures by which the 
Management Committee may act and bind the Partnership 
[Section 5.1, Partnership Agreement]; (c) withdraw capital from 
the Partnership [Section 7.2, Partnership Agreement]; and (d) 
distribute to partners cash available for distribution (a defined 
term in the Partnership Agreement), pay salaries to partners 
and/or permit partners to take draws from the Partnership 
[Section 8.2, Partnership Agreement].  
 
9.   Section 10.1 of the Partnership Agreement requires that the 
Partnership books and records, together with all of the documents 
and papers pertaining to the business of the Partnership, be kept 
at the principal place of business of the Partnership in Los 
Angeles, California.  
 
10.  In the late 1970s to early 1980s, the Partners planned on 
growing their business to form a national law firm, with offices 
across the country.  To help accomplish that goal, Jacoby, 
Meyers and Koff formed a separate closely held corporation, 
Jamko Service Corporation ("Jamko"), to provide all ancillary 
services to the Partnership, including such support as non-
professional personnel, business management and acquisition 
and leasing of offices.  
 
11.  Jamko is a Delaware corporation, with the only voting shares 
in the company being the common stock.  A total of 800,000 
shares of common stock of Jamko have been issued, with Jacoby 
and Meyers each holding 320,000 shares and Koff holding 
160,000 shares.  
 
12.  The general practice of the Partnership, until recently, was to 
pay Jamko for services on a marked-up basis. Jamko would use 
those payments to pay its obligations.  Funds remaining with 
Jamko would be used to compensate Jacoby, Meyers and Koff in 
proportion to their common stock ownership of Jamko. The 
compensation from Jamko was agreed to constitute the remainder 
of the Partners' compensation from the Partnership.  
 
13.  The law firm grew from one office in California in 1972 to 
approximately 150 local field offices in six states by the mid-
1980s.  Offices were located in California, Arizona, 
Pennsylvania, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York.  The 
Arizona and California offices were generally supervised directly 
by Jacoby and the Northeastern offices were generally supervised 
directly by Koff. Oversight and national responsibilities were 
shared by the Partners.  The field offices operated as linked 
neighborhood law offices, specializing in providing quality 
personal legal services to middle-class individuals.  In addition to 
the local field offices, the Partnership opened certain specialized 
"units" containing centralized groups of attorneys with particular 
practice skills, including personal injury units. The personal 
injury units, along with other specialized units, provided 
expertise not available in the neighborhood field offices of the 
Partnership.  The neighborhood field offices routinely utilized 
the services of the specialized units for cases meriting such 
attention.  
 
14.  The rapid expansion in the number of field offices and the 
expensive creation of personal injury units unfortunately 
coincided with the general decline in economic conditions 
throughout the country.  In response to these economic forces 
and other financial setbacks, the Partnership was forced to retreat 
from its expansion plans and to consolidate its offices.  By the 
middle of 1994 the firm had closed most of its field offices and 
specialty units, including all of those located in California except 
for the personal injury units.  At the present time, the firm 
operates eight personal injury units located in San Francisco, 
Sacramento, Tucson, Philadelphia, Long Island, New York City 
and New Jersey.  It also has approximately twelve field offices 
located in the Northeast.  
 
15.  During the course of downsizing the Partnership, Jacoby 
presented to his partners several alternative organizational 
structures designed for the sharing of duties and responsibilities 
among all of the Partners.  These suggestions were given short 
shrift by Koff and Meyers but they promised Jacoby he would be 
treated fairly and there would be no change in his total 
compensation, no matter what kind of final business structure 
evolved.  
 
16.  Rather than creating a system for dividing the day-to-day 
operating tasks for shared management of the firm and Jamko, 
Meyers and Koff undertook a deliberate course of action to 
isolate Jacoby from the operation of the Partnership and Jamko. 
They stopped paying rent on the principal office of the firm in 
Los Angeles.  They refused to give pertinent financial 
information about the Partnership to Jacoby.  They stopped 
paying Jacoby certain benefits traditionally provided to each of 
the Partners, while at the same time continuing to pay their own 
benefits. Jacoby had to argue with and harangue Meyers and 
Koff in order to receive any payment from the Partnership.  
Jacoby is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that 
Meyers and Koff have in the past and continue to take 
Partnership resources for their own individual purposes rather 
then legitimate Partnership expenses. Moreover, Meyers and 
Koff have refused to reimburse Jacoby for expenses incurred on 
behalf of the Partnership as part of the winding up of certain 
Partnership operations in the Western states, including 
California.  
 
17.  Meyers and Koff also forced Jacoby out of the shared control 
of the Partnership and Jamko and refused to pay him in the same 
manner they paid themselves.  
 
18.  It became evident to Jacoby that his partners were not going 
to treat him fairly.  Notwithstanding this reality, Jacoby was 
willing to come to some sort of understanding with Meyers and 
Koff respecting his continuing but lessened involvement within 
the firm.  With that objective in mind, Jacoby began negotiating 
with Meyers and Koff respecting his gradual withdrawal from as 
active an involvement in the management of the firm and Jamko, 
while still retaining an interest in the Partnership and Jamko for 
the mutual benefit of all concerned.  
 
19.  The negotiations between Jacoby on the one hand and 
Meyers and Koff on the other hand culminated in a written 
memorandum of terms, dated March 29, 1994 ("March 
Agreement"). The final provisions of the March Agreement were 
developed after the negotiation of terms contained in a proposal 
by Meyers dated February 25, 1994 ("February Proposal").  The 
terms and conditions of the March Agreement were accepted 
orally by Meyers and Koff prior to March 29, 1994.  
 
20.  Notwithstanding their acceptance of the terms of the March 
Agreement, Meyers and Koff failed to pay Jacoby the amounts 
required by that agreement and to otherwise fulfill their 
obligations under the March Agreement.  
 
21.  Jacoby is informed and believes and on that basis alleges 
that recently Meyers and Koff have essentially gutted Jamko, to 
the point where Jamko has no employees and virtually no duties.  
Nonetheless, Meyers and Koff continue to pay themselves 
substantial additional draw, salary and benefits through Jamko, 
under the guise of "consulting fees", by transferring to Jamko 
monies belonging to the Partnership, solely for the purpose of 
paying themselves additional draws, salaries and benefits.  
 
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 
 
(Breach of Partnership Agreement) 
 
22.  Jacoby repeats, realleges and incorporates by this reference 
as though fully set forth each and every allegation in paragraphs 
1 through 21 of this Complaint.  
 
23.  Jacoby has duly performed all obligations, conditions and 
promises to be performed by him pursuant to the Partnership 
Agreement.  
 
24.  Meyers and Koff have breached and continue to breach the 
Partnership Agreement by, without limitation:  
 
(i)  refusing to maintain a principal office of the Partnership in 
Los Angeles as required;  
 
(ii)  refusing to keep Partnership books and records or copies 
thereof, together with all of the documents and papers pertaining 
to the business of the Partnership, at the principal place of 
business of the Partnership in Los Angeles, California; and  
 
(iii)  failing to conduct the business of the Partnership Pursuant 
to the Partnership Agreement.  
 
25.  As a direct and proximate result of Meyers' and Koff's 
breach of the Partnership Agreement, Jacoby has been prohibited 
from rightful access to Partnership books and records, denied full 
disclosure from his Partners and prevented from participating in 
the management of and shared decision making within the firm.  
Jacoby has thereby been injured in an amount which Jacoby has 
not yet ascertained, but in an amount in excess of the 
jurisdictional limits of this Court and estimated to be at least 
$2,000,000.00.  When the monetary damages are fully 
ascertained, Jacoby will seek leave to amend this Complaint 
accordingly.  
 
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 
 
(Breach of Partnership Fiduciary Duty) 
 
26.  Jacoby repeats, realleges and incorporates by this reference 
as though fully set forth each and every allegation in paragraphs 
1 through 25 of this Complaint.  
 
27.  Meyers and Koff have breached and continue to breach their 
fiduciary duty to Jacoby of utmost good faith, fairness and 
loyalty due partners by, without limitation:  
 
(a)  paying themselves and not Jacoby; 
 
(b)  undertaking a course of action to force Jacoby out of the 
partnership and Jamko;  
 
(c)  prohibited Jacoby from rightful access to Partnership and 
Jamko books and records;  
 
(d)  denying Jacoby full disclosure of Partnership and Jamko 
activities and information;  
 
(e)  preventing Jacoby from participating in the management of 
the Partnership and Jamko;  
 
(f)  failing to permit Jacoby to engage in shared decision making;  
 
(g)  denying Jacoby benefits rightfully due him, including 
insurance and other benefits;  
 
(h)  failing to pay Jacoby's expenses; and  
 
(i)  failing to make rent payments on the Partnership's principal 
place of business in Los Angeles, forcing Jacoby to relocate the 
office and to pay rent out of his own personal resources.  
 
28.  As a direct and proximate result of Meyers' and Koff's 
breach of their fiduciary duties to Jacoby, he is being deprived of 
his right to participate in the Partnership and has been injured in 
an amount which Jacoby has not yet ascertained, but in an 
amount in excess of the jurisdictional limits of this Court and 
estimated to be at least $2,000,000.00.  When the monetary 
damages are fully ascertained, Jacoby will seek leave to amend 
this Complaint accordingly.  
 
29.  In committing the acts alleged above, Meyers and Koff acted 
knowingly, willfully and with the intent to injure, and/or with 
reckless disregard of the resulting injuries to, Jacoby.  By 
engaging in such conduct, Meyers and Koff have been guilty of 
oppression, fraud or malice, and Jacoby, in addition to the actual 
damages, may recover damages from Meyers and Koff for the 
sake of example and by way of punishing them.  
 
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 
 
(Breach of the March Agreement) 
 
30.  Jacoby repeats, realleges and incorporates by this reference 
as though fully set forth each and every allegation in paragraphs 
1 through 29 of this Complaint.  
 
31.  Jacoby has duly performed all obligations, conditions and 
promises to be performed by him pursuant to the March 
Agreement.  
 
32.  Meyers and Koff have breached and continue to breach the 
March Agreement by failing to pay the monies due Jacoby, 
failing to pay required benefits and insurance and failing to 
provide the information and financial reports and according 
Jacoby his proper management authority under the March 
Agreement.  
 
33.  As a direct and proximate result of Meyers' and Koff's 
breach of the March Agreement, Jacoby has been injured in an 
amount which Jacoby has not yet ascertained, but in an amount 
in excess of the jurisdictional limits of this Court and estimated 
to be at least $2,000,000.00.  When the monetary damages are 
fully ascertained, Jacoby will seek leave to amend this Complaint 
accordingly.  
 
FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
 
(Anticipatory Breach and Repudiation of the March Agreement)  
 
34.  Jacoby repeats, realleges and incorporates by this reference 
as though fully set forth each and every allegation in Paragraphs 
1 through 33 of this Complaint.  
 
35.  Jacoby has demanded that defendants voluntarily comply 
with their obligation to pay money and engage in other conduct 
consistent with the March Agreement. The defendants have, 
however, not agreed to do so and have stated in words and 
actions that they do not intend to perform under the March 
Agreement.  In so doing, Meyers and Koff anticipatorily 
breached and/or repudiated the March Agreement.  
 
36.  As a direct and proximate result of Meyers' and Koff's 
anticipatory breach and/or repudiation of the March Agreement, 
Jacoby has been injured in an amount which Jacoby has not yet 
ascertained, but in an amount in excess of the jurisdictional limits 
of this Court and estimated to be at least $2,000,000.00.  When 
the monetary damages are fully ascertained, Jacoby will seek 
leave to amend this Complaint accordingly.  
 
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
 
(Specific Performance of the March Agreement)  
 
37.  Jacoby repeats, realleges and incorporates by this reference 
as though fully set forth each and every allegation in paragraphs 
1 through 36 of this Complaint.  
 
38.  Jacoby has no adequate remedy at law to enforce his rights, 
and he will suffer great and irreparable injury if Meyers and Koff 
are permitted to dissipate the property of the Partnership.  
 
SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
 
(Breach of Fiduciary Duty to Minority Shareholder)  
 
39.  Jacoby repeats, realleges and incorporates by this reference 
as though fully set forth each and every allegation in paragraphs 
1 through 38 of this Complaint.  
 
40.  By ending Jacoby's employment in Jamko and denying him 
access to information concerning the operations of Jamko, 
Meyers and Koff have used their collective power as majority 
shareholders to oust Jacoby from the corporation.  They have 
abruptly removed a minority shareholder from positions of 
employment and management in a devastatingly effective 
squeeze-out technique.  
 
41.  As the only other and majority shareholders, Meyers and 
Koff owe a fiduciary duty to Jacoby as a minority shareholder. 
Their conduct has impacted negatively on Jacoby and has not 
been in good faith.  Indeed, under the circumstances described 
herein their conduct has been inherently unfair.  
 
42.  There is no business justification for terminating Jacoby's 
employment with Jamko and failing to pay Jacoby his 
proportionate share of the revenues of Jamko in the same 
amounts as Meyers has received.  Indeed, Jacoby has in good 
faith proposed number of alternatives to Meyers and Koff for 
how the responsibilities of the firm and of Jamko could be 
divided among the three Partners.  These proposals have not, 
however, been received in good faith by Meyers and Koff or for 
that matter been considered at all. Meyers and Koff are 
attempting to use Jamko to exert economic coercion against 
Jacoby to force him to accept their wrongdoing relating to the 
Partnership for their own personal benefit and not for the benefit 
of the corporation.  
 
43.  As a direct and proximate result of Meyers' and Koff's 
freezing Jacoby out of Jamko, he has been injured in an amount 
which Jacoby has not yet ascertained, but in an amount in excess 
of the jurisdictional limits of this Court and estimated to be at 
least $2,000,000.00.  When the monetary damages are fully 
ascertained, Jacoby will seek leave to amend this Complaint 
accordingly.  
 
44.  In committing the acts alleged above, Meyers and Koff acted 
knowingly, willfully and with the intent to injure, and/or with 
reckless disregard of the resulting injuries to, Jacoby.  By 
engaging in such conduct, Meyers and Koff have been guilty of 
oppression, fraud or malice, and Jacoby, in addition to the actual 
damages, may recover damages from Meyers and Koff for the 
sake of example and by way of Punishing them.  
 
SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
 
(Fraud Re Compensation) 
 
45.  Jacoby repeats, realleges and incorporates by this reference 
as though fully set forth each and every allegation in paragraphs 
1 through 44 of this Complaint.  
 
46.  Jacoby is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, 
that Jamko is no longer a functioning entity. It has no employees 
and conducts virtually no business.  The purposes for which 
Jamko were established, i.e. to assist the Partners in growing the 
law practice into a national firm, have been abrogated by the 
closing of most of the neighborhood field offices, the financial 
decline of the business and the abandonment of plans for the firm 
to become a national concern.  
 
47.  Notwithstanding the cessation of business by Jamko, Meyers 
and Koff continue to pay themselves thousands of dollars in so-
called "consulting fees".  There is no honest business reason for 
Jamko to be paying any consultants for any kind of service, let 
alone the tens of thousands of dollars being paid to Meyers and 
Koff.  
 
48.  In reality, the monies being paid to Meyers and Koff by 
themselves to themselves as officers of Jamko constitute nothing 
more than disguised partnership salary, compensation and/or 
draws.  They know that a unanimous decision of the 
Management Committee would be required in order to increase 
their compensation being paid directly from the Partnership.  
They also know that under the circumstances, Jacoby is not 
likely to agree to pay Meyers and Koff without fair compensation 
being paid to himself. In an effort to conceal the true nature of 
these payments and to avoid being subject to the proper 
constraints of the Partnership Agreement, Meyers and Koff are 
fraudulently paying themselves Partnership compensation 
through Jamko in an effort to cheat Jacoby.  
 
49.  As a direct and proximate result of Meyers' and Koff's 
conduct alleged above, Jacoby has been injured in an amount 
which Jacoby has not yet ascertained, but in an amount in excess 
of the jurisdictional limits of this Court and estimated to be at 
least $2,000,000.00.  When the monetary damages are fully 
ascertained, Jacoby will seek leave to amend this Complaint 
accordingly.  
 
50.  In committing the acts alleged above, Meyers and Koff acted 
knowingly, willfully and with the intent to injure, and/or with 
reckless disregard of the resulting injuries to, Jacoby.  By 
engaging in such conduct, Meyers and Koff have been guilty of 
oppression, fraud or malice, and Jacoby, in addition to the actual 
damages, may recover damages from Meyers and Koff for the 
sake of example and by way of punishing them.  
 
EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
 
(Fraud Re March Agreement 
 
51.  Jacoby repeats, realleges and incorporates by this reference 
as though fully set forth each and every allegation in paragraphs 
1 through 50 of this Complaint.  
 
52.  Jacoby is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, 
that at the time Meyers and Koff entered into the March 
Agreement they did not intend to perform under that agreement. 
Defendants concealed their true intentions from Jacoby and 
falsely represented to him that they intended to carry out their 
obligations under the March Agreement.  Jacoby had no way of 
determining defendants' concealment or that their representations 
were false.  
 
53.  In reliance upon Meyers' and Koff's misrepresentations and 
because of their deceit, Jacoby hastened the closure of the 
California offices of the Partnership.  Instead of the planned 
phasing out of those offices over a two-year period, during which 
time Jacoby would have been in charge of those operations, the 
offices were closed shortly after the March Agreement.  
 
54.  As a direct and proximate result of Meyers' and Koff's 
concealment and misrepresentations alleged above, Jacoby has 
been injured in an amount which Jacoby has not yet ascertained, 
but in an amount in excess of the jurisdictional limits of this 
Court and estimated to be at least $2,000,000.00. When the 
monetary damages are fully ascertained, Jacoby will seek leave 
to amend this Complaint accordingly.  
 
55.  In committing the acts alleged above, Meyers and Koff acted 
knowingly, willfully and with the intent to injure, and/or with 
reckless disregard of the resulting injuries to, Jacoby.  By 
engaging in such conduct, Meyers and Koff have been guilty of 
oppression, fraud or malice, and Jacoby, in addition to the actual 
damages, may recover damages from Meyers and Koff for the 
sake of example and by way of punishing them.  
 
NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
 
(Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress)  
 
56.  Jacoby repeats, realleges and incorporates by this reference 
as though fully set forth each and every allegation in Paragraphs 
1 through 55 of this Complaint.  
 
57.  The conduct of the defendants described above constitutes 
outrageous behavior.  Their conduct was intentional and 
malicious and done for the purpose of causing Jacoby to suffer 
humiliation, mental anguish, and emotional and physical distress.  
 
58.  As a direct and proximate result of the wrongful conduct of 
Meyers and Koff, Jacoby has suffered humiliation, mental 
anguish, and emotional and physical distress.  Jacoby has 
suffered severe emotional distress with accompanying physical 
and bodily injury, which require the care of a physician.  Jacoby 
has been injured in mind and body as described above in an 
amount which he have not yet ascertained.  When the same are 
ascertained, Jacoby will seek leave to amend this Complaint 
accordingly.  
 
59.  As a further proximate result of the wrongful conduct of 
defendants, Jacoby was required to and did employ physicians 
and other health care professionals to examine, treat, and care for 
him and has incurred medical expenses in an amount which he 
has not yet ascertained.  When the same are ascertained, Jacoby 
will seek leave to amend this Complaint accordingly.  
 
60.  By reason of the wrongful conduct of Meyers and Koff, 
Jacoby was prevented from attending to his usual occupation or 
profession and thereby lost earnings in an amount which he has 
not yet ascertained.  When the same are ascertained, Jacoby will 
seek leave to amend this Complaint accordingly.  
 
61.  The actions of defendants, and each of them, as alleged 
above were done with a willful and conscious disregard of 
Jacoby's rights and with the intent to vex, injure and annoy 
Jacoby, so as to constitute oppression, fraud, and malice under 
California Civil Code Section 3294, entitling Jacoby to punitive 
damages in an amount appropriate to punish and to make an 
example of defendants and each of them  
 
TENTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
 
(Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress)  
 
62.  Jacoby repeats, realleges and incorporates by this reference 
as though fully set forth each and every allegation in paragraphs 
1 through 61 of this Complaint.  
 
63.  The conduct of the defendants described above constitutes 
outrageous behavior.  Defendants failed to exercise reasonable 
care and skill in the performance of their obligations to Jacoby, 
thereby causing Jacoby to suffer humiliation, mental anguish, 
and emotional and physical distress.  
 
64.  As a direct and proximate result of the wrongful conduct of 
Meyers and Koff, Jacoby has suffered humiliation, mental 
anguish, and emotional and physical distress.  Jacoby has 
suffered severe emotional distress with accompanying physical 
and bodily injury, including without limitation headaches and 
stomach problems, which require the care of a physician.  Jacoby 
has been injured in mind and body as described above in an 
amount which he have not yet ascertained.  When the same are 
ascertained, Jacoby will seek leave to amend this Complaint 
accordingly.  
 
65.  As a further proximate result of the wrongful conduct of 
defendants, Jacoby was required to and did employ physicians 
and other health care professionals to examine, treat, and care for 
him and has incurred medical expenses in an amount which he 
has not yet ascertained.  When the same are ascertained, Jacoby 
will seek leave to amend this Complaint accordingly.  
 
66.  By reason of the wrongful conduct of Meyers and Koff, 
Jacoby was prevented from attending to his usual occupation or 
profession and thereby lost earnings in an amount which he has 
not yet ascertained.  When the same are ascertained, Jacoby will 
seek leave to amend this Complaint accordingly.  
 
ELEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
 
(Injunctive Relief) 
 
67.  Jacoby repeats, realleges and incorporates by this reference 
as though fully set forth each and every allegation in paragraphs 
1 through 66 of this Complaint.  
 
68.  Jacoby is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, 
that Meyers and Koff have wrongfully and unlawfully taken and 
are taking Partnership property for their own personal use and 
enjoyment.  Defendants also continue to engage in conduct to 
freeze Jacoby out of the business, infringing on Jacoby's right to 
participate in the management and operations of the Partnership 
and Jamko.  
 
69.  Jacoby has demanded that Meyers and Koff cease and desist 
in depriving Jacoby of his property and rights. Defendants, and 
each of them, have refused and still refuse to refrain from their 
past and threatened conduct.  
 
70.  Meyers' and Koff's threatened and continuing wrongful 
conduct, unless and until enjoined and restrained by order of this 
court, will cause great and irreparable injury to Jacoby in that the 
property of the Partnership will be dissipated and business 
decisions made by plaintiffs and the consequences therefrom will 
be unalterable.  
 
71.  Jacoby has no adequate remedy at law for the injuries 
currently being suffered and that are threatened. It is impossible 
for Jacoby to determine the precise amount of damages he will 
suffer if defendants conduct is not restrained.  
 
72.  As a direct and proximate result of Meyers' and Koff's 
freezing Jacoby out of the Partnership and Jamko, he has been 
injured in an amount which Jacoby has not yet ascertained, but in 
an amount in excess of the jurisdictional limits of this Court and 
estimated to be at least $2,000,000.00.  When the monetary 
damages are fully ascertained, Jacoby will seek leave to amend 
this Complaint accordingly.  Jacoby will be further damaged in 
like manner so long as defendants' conduct continues.  
 
TWELFTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
 
(Declaratory Relief) 
 
73.  Jacoby repeats, realleges and incorporates by this reference 
as though fully set forth each and every allegation in paragraphs 
1 through 72 of this Complaint.  
 
74.  The Partnership Agreement was not for any definite term or 
for any particular undertaking. Accordingly, the Partnership is a 
partnership terminable at will.  
 
75.  Jacoby announced his intention to dissolve the Partnership 
and gave notice of dissolution on October 12, 1995, as an 
exercise of his authority to dissolve the Partnership by his 
express will.  
 
76.  An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between 
Jacoby and defendants regarding their respective rights and 
duties relating to the Partnership.  
 
77.  Jacoby contends that the conduct of defendants has in the 
immediate past, and will in the future, affect prejudicially the 
carrying on of the Partnership.  
 
78.  Jacoby contends that the conduct of defendants constitutes 
the willful or persistent breach of the Partnership Agreement.  
 
79.  Jacoby contends that the conduct of defendants is such that it 
is no longer practicable to carry on the business of the 
Partnership.  
 
80.  Jacoby contends that the conduct of defendants has been 
such that it is equitable for this court to order a dissolution of the 
Partnership.  
 
81.  Jacoby contends that his announcement and notice of 
dissolution on October 12, 1995 was a valid rightful exercise of 
his authority to dissolve the Partnership by his express will.  
 
82.  Jacoby contends that he is entitled to a decree of dissolution 
of the Partnership pursuant to California Corporations Code 
Sections 15032(1)(c), (d), (e) and/or (f).  
 
83.  Jacoby is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, 
that defendants dispute the above contentions.  
 
84.  Jacoby desires a judicial determination of his rights and 
duties and a declaration as to the effectiveness and rightfulness of 
the notice of dissolution given to defendants. Jacoby desires a 
judicial determination as to whether the actions of the defendants 
have been such that Jacoby is entitled to a judicial decree of 
dissolution of the Partnership.  
 
85.  Absent the requested judicial declaration, Jacoby will suffer 
irreparable harm of a continuing nature, in that he will not know 
his rights and duties.  Jacoby will be harmed in that defendants 
will refuse to pay to Jacoby his respective interests in the assets 
of the Partnership and other items due Jacoby.  The defendants 
will continue to assert both to Jacoby and to third parties, that 
Jacoby remains liable to such third parties for certain debts 
incurred after the date of dissolution of the Partnership. Other 
irreparable harm will be suffered by Jacoby as result of the 
uncertainty regarding the parties' status as partners.  
 
86.  Jacoby has no adequate remedy at law.  
 
THIRTEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
 
(Judicial Winding Up of Partnership) 
 
87.  Jacoby repeats, realleges and incorporates by this reference 
as though fully set forth each and every allegation in paragraphs 
1 through 86 of this Complaint.  
 
88.  By virtue of the dissolution of the Partnership on October 
12, 1995, that entity must now be wound up pursuant to the 
provisions of California Corporations Code Section 15029, et 
seq.  
 
89.  As of October 12, 1995, the Partnership had substantial 
assets and liabilities.  The assets of the Partnership include 
certain equipment, accounts receivable and other miscellaneous 
assets.  
 
90.  Defendants are currently in the possession of the Partnership 
books, assets and accounts.  Defendants have already denied 
Jacoby access to said partnership assets and records and Jacoby 
believes that defendants will continue to do so despite his 
requests.  
 
91.  Prior to October 12, 1995, the parties were actively engaged 
in the practice of law and in the provision of legal services to a 
substantial number of clients.  As of this time, and for a period 
into the future, the parties must continue to meet their legal, 
professional and ethical obligations to those clients and provide 
them legal services.  Defendants have in their possession the files 
and papers of these clients.  
 
92.  In order to properly protect the interests of Jacoby, Meyers 
and Koff, as well as the interests of each client of the Partnership, 
it is necessary to have an orderly winding up of the business of 
the Partnership.  
 
93.  Absent the intervention of the court to order, direct and 
control the winding up business of the Partnership, Jacoby will 
suffer irreparable harm in that assets may be dissipated, liabilities 
could increase and clients may not be properly served.  
 
94.  Jacoby has no adequate remedy at law. Pursuant to 
California Corporations Code Section 15037, Jacoby seeks such 
orders of this court as are necessary and appropriate to obtain a 
court supervised winding up of the Partnership.  
 
FOURTEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
 
(For An Accounting) 
 
95.  Jacoby repeats, realleges and incorporates by this reference 
as though fully set forth each and every allegation in paragraphs 
1 through 94 of this Complaint.  
 
96.  By virtue of the dissolution of the Partnership it is necessary 
to obtain from defendants an accounting of the affairs of the 
Partnership.  Such an accounting is authorized pursuant to 
California Corporations Code Section 15043.  
 
FIFTEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
 
(Appointment of a Receiver) 
 
97.  Jacoby repeats, realleges and incorporates by this reference 
as though fully set forth each and every allegation in paragraphs 
1 through 96 of this Complaint.  
 
98.  Unless a receiver is appointed to take possession of and 
manage the Partnership assets and its proceeds, the assets, the 
business, and the proceeds thereof are in danger of being wasted 
and dissipated by the defendants.  Jacoby has no adequate 
remedy at law to prevent this result and, unless a receiver is 
appointed, will suffer great and irreparable harm.  
 
99.  A receiver should be appointed by the court to hold the 
Partnership property and wind up Partnership affairs, in order to 
carry into effect the judgments and orders of this court, and to 
insure Jacoby against the dissipation, destruction and loss of his 
interests in the Partnership assets.  
 
WHEREFORE, Jacoby prays for judgment against defendants 
and each of them, as follows:  
 
A.   On the First, Third, Fifth and Tenth Causes of Action:  
 
1.  For compensatory and consequential damages, according to

NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE, 
 
Plaintiff, 
 
vs. 
 
LOS ANGELES RAIDERS, a 
California Limited Partnership, 
 
Defendant 
 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
 
CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA 
 
AUG 31, 1995 
 
 
COMPLAINT FOR 
DECLARATORY AND 
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 
 
1. This action addresses two disputes between defendant 
Los Angeles Raiders (the "Club" or the "Raiders") Plaintiff 
National Football League (the "League" or "NFL") that 
arise out of and/or relate to the NFL Constitution and 
Bylaws and resolutions, policies, and procedures 
promulgated thereunder.  The subject matters of the 
disputes -- (1) determining the location of club playing sites 
and (2) allocating between the home club and other 
member clubs of the League the "gross receipts" associated 
with regular season games -- have been committed by 
contract to collective resolution pursuant to procedures 
prescribed by the NFL Constitution and Bylaws.  The 
Raiders maintain that they have no obligation to recognize 
or to comply with those collective determinations, in the 
former case asserting that the procedures at issue violate the 
federal antitrust laws.  
 
THE PARTIES 
 
2.   The National Football League is a joint enterprise 
composed of thirty (30) member clubs, including the 
Raiders, engaged in the production and marketing of 
professional football entertainment.  The NFL is a not- 
for-profit organization with its principal offices located in 
New York City, New York.  
 
3.   Defendant Los Angeles Raiders, Ltd. is a California 
limited partnership that very recently moved its home 
territory from Los Angeles, California to Oakland, 
California. The Raiders are, and since 1970 have been, a 
member club of the NFL, and they continue to conduct 
business in the Los Angeles area with offices at 332 Center 
Street, El Segundo, California.  
 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
 
4.   This action is brought pursuant to 15 U.S.C. Section 1.  
This Court has federal question jurisdiction over Count I of 
this Complaint under 28 U.S.C.  1331 and  1337.  The 
declaratory relief prayed for is authorized by 28 U.S.C. 
Sections 2201 et seq.  The Court has supplemental 
jurisdiction over Count II pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1367.  
 
5.   Venue is proper in this District because defendants 
resides and is licensed to do business in this District. 
Plaintiff's claims also arise in this District.  28 U.S.C. 
Sections 1391(b) and (c).  
 
THE NFL'S JOINT BUSINESS ENTERPRISE 
 
6.   The NFL is composed of 30 teams that jointly produce 
and market a sports entertainment product.  In producing 
and marketing their joint product, the member clubs operate 
as co-producers and co-sellers in a form of joint or partner-
~ ship enterprise.  
 
7.   Decisions about the locations at which member clubs 
operate and play their home games are an essential element 
of the conduct of the NFL as a cooperative venture. for 
purposes of fostering fan and media interest, and thereby 
increasing the attractiveness of their joint entertainment 
product, the NFL's members have divided themselves into 
conferences and divisions.  These subdivisions create 
additional separate "title" races. Public interest is further 
fostered by various inter-city rivalries.  Thus, divisional 
placement and alignment are of concern to all League 
members, and a relocation by one club without the consent 
of its co-venturers jeopardizes the benefits that all clubs 
receive from this carefully developed arrangement.  
 
8.   As further described below, Count I of this Complaint 
addresses the member clubs' agreement, and the policies 
and procedures promulgated thereunder, by which they 
determine collectively the locations of their member clubs. 
The Raiders, who have moved their home territory and 
home playing location to Oakland, have repeatedly asserted 
that these agreements are invalid under the federal antitrust 
laws and have threatened to bring an antitrust action for 
damages and/or injunctive relief based upon the League's 
reliance on these rules, policies, and procedures.  
 
9.   Another crucial aspect of the NFL joint venture is a set 
of revenue sharing arrangements that cause the NFL to be 
the most economically integrated league in all of 
professional sports.  Over 90 percent of club revenues are 
derived from sources shared with every other club. For 
example, the television rights of all NFL teams are jointly 
sold by the League under terms requiring the broadcasters 
to televise each regular season game.  The resulting 
television revenues are divided equally among all clubs.  
The clubs also share equally post-season revenues, as well 
as revenues from licensing and filming operations.  
 
10.  Gate receipts from each of the games jointly presented 
by the League's teams are also shared.  In the regular 
season, after limited deductions relating to operating costs, 
the home team retains 60% of the revenues; the balance is 
directly  shared with the visiting team and/or contributed to 
a revenue sharing pool.  Sharing of gate receipts provides 
balanced rewards and incentives for both home and visiting 
teams in the joint presentation of individual games and of 
the League season.  In this way, each club benefits from 
other clubs having full stadiums and generating large gate 
receipts As further explained below, Count II of this 
Complaint addresses the member clubs' agreement 
collectively to determine the allocation of such receipts and 
the Raiders' failure to comply with that agreement.  
 
11.  These sharing measures have the effect of more evenly 
distributing revenues among better situated clubs operating 
in larger markets and less well-off clubs operating in 
smaller markets, and are essential components of the 
structure that permits the NFL to operate with 30 teams in a 
variety of disparate economic conditions throughout the 
United States. Since joining the NFL in 1970, the Raiders 
have not only acknowledged, abided by, and at citated in 
these revenue sharing procedures, but that Club also has 
greatly benefited from such procedures  
 
12.  These sharing measures are, in turn, the foundation for 
other fundamental League agreements to which all member 
clubs are parties and from which all member clubs, 
including the Raiders, derive benefits.  For example, in 
1993, the NFL entered into a collective bargaining 
agreement that requires each club to pay its player-
employees a guaranteed Minimum Team Salary.  That 
obligation was premised upon continued adherence to the 
basic principles of revenue sharing described above.  
 
13.  Because of these relationships, each NFL member club 
has a direct economic interest in the successful business 
operation of each of the other member clubs in the League. 
Rather than acting as traditional horizontal competitors, the 
members clubs of the NFL are cooperative partners in a 
joint business venture.  No NFL club has an interest in 
forcing another team out of business, or in seeing it 
seriously weakened financially.  While the clubs are 
vigorous competitors on the playing field, they act as 
partners in conducting their business operations.  
 
THE MEMBER CLUBS' CONTRACTUAL 
OBLIGATIONS TO ADHERE TO LEAGUE RULES, 
RESOLUTIONS AND POLICIES  
 
14.  All of the NFL member clubs "subscribe to agree to be 
bound by the Constitution, bylaws, rules and Regulations of 
the League and any amendments or modifications thereof."  
NFL Constitution and Bylaws, Section 3.3(A)(6) Attached 
as Exhibit A.  This provision specifically, and the 
Constitution and bylaws generally, impose a contractual 
relationship among the member clubs of the NFL, 
including the Raiders. Accordingly, the right of each NFL 
member club to regulate its own affairs is expressly subject 
to its contractual obligations under the NFL Constitution 
and Bylaws and related NFL policies.  
 
15. Under the NFL Constitution and Bylaws, the basic 
business decisions of  the NFL  are made  primarily by the 
NFL Executive Committee,  which is composed of one 
representative from each member club.  The overwhelming 
majority of NFL business decisions, including decisions as 
to where  each member club will  play its  home games, 
require the agreement of three-fourths -- or 23 -- of the 
NFL member clubs.  
 
16.  Each member club of the League, including the 
Raiders, has "agree[d] to be bound by the following 
obligations of membership in the League:  
 
(b)  They, and each of them, shall be bound by and will 
observe all decisions, rulings and action of the Executive 
Committee or the member clubs of the League in every 
matter within the jurisdiction of such Committee or such 
member clubs, as the case may be.  
 
(g)  They, and each of them, agree to be bound of the terms 
and provisions of the Constitution and by-laws of the 
League as now or hereafter in effect  
 
NFL Constitution and Bylaws, Section 3.11((b) and (g)  
 
COUNT  1 - FEDERAL ANTITRUST CLAIM 
 
17. Plaintiff incorporates herein by reference Paragraphs 1-
l5 of this Complaint.  
 
18. Pursuant to Section  3.4  of the  NFL's Constitution and 
Bylaws, the receipt of an NFL franchise constitutes a 
commitment to the other members to operate in a 
designated home location, which is  defined (in Section 4.1)  
as  "the city in which such club is located and for which it 
holds a franchise and plays its home games, and includes 
the surrounding territory to the  extent of 75 miles in every 
direction from the exterior corporate limits of such  city." 
For the 1994 playing season, the Raiders designated 
franchise location was the Los Angeles metropolitan area 
and its designated playing site was Los Angeles.  
 
19.  Section 4.2(c) of the Constitution and Bylaws prohibits 
any club from playing regular season games "within the 
home territory of any other club unless a home club is a 
participant."  Section 4.3 of the Constitution and Bylaws 
provides that a member club may play its home games 
outside of its designated home territory, but only with the 
approval of three-fourths of the member clubs of the 
League.  The provision states (with emphasis added):  
 
The League shall have exclusive control of the exhibition 
of football games by member clubs within the home 
territory of each member.  No member club shall have the 
right to transfer its franchise or playing site to a different 
city either within or outside its home territory without prior 
approval by the member clubs of the League.  
 
20.  Based on various compelling considerations, the NFL 
in 1980 declined to acquiesce  to a franchise move by the 
Raiders from Oakland to Los Angeles.  The NFL and its 
member clubs were sued for violating the antitrust laws, 
and in February 1984 a panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of 
Appeals, by a two-to-one vote, upheld the verdict of a Los 
Angeles jury that Section 4.3, as applied to the Raiders' 
proposed move, was in violation of Section 1 of the 
Sherman Act.  Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Comm'n v. 
National Football League, 726 F.2d (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 
469 U.S. 990 (1984)  ("Raiders"). In reaching this 
determination, the Raiders decision depended heavily on 
the particular circumstances surrounding the Raiders' move.  
In future cases, the court declared, League restrictions on 
team movement would withstand antitrust scrutiny if they 
were more narrowly tailored to serve the NFL's needs; if 
they were "shaped by considerations of objective factors," 
such as population, economic projections, facilities, 
regional balance, and fan loyalty; and if they provided 
some sort of "procedural mechanism" to ensure 
consideration or all of the above factors, including an 
opportunity for the team proposing to move to present its 
case.  
 
21.  In response to the concerns identified by the Ninth 
Circuit Court of Appeals in Raiders, the NFL revised its 
procedures and prescribed objective criteria to govern 
proposed franchise relocation decisions.  The NFL 
procedures and criteria now reflect every one of the factors 
that the Raiders court indicated would enable the relocation 
process to "withstand antitrust scrutiny" and conform 
precisely to the Ninth Circuit's decision. See  procedures 
for Proposed Franchise Relocations (attached as Exhibit 3).  
 
22.  In March 1994, without complying with or recognizing 
these rules and procedures in any respect, the Raiders 
demanded that the NFL effectively transfer its home 
playing site to Oakland, California, by scheduling the 
Raiders' 1994 season home games in Oakland.  The NFL 
informed the President of the General Partner of the Club, 
Al Davis, that without a vote of the NFL member clubs 
approving a permanent or temporary change in the Club's 
designated playing site to Oakland, the Raiders' home 
games for the 1995 season would have to be scheduled and 
played in the Los Angeles area.  The NFL thereafter 
prepared a schedule that required the Raiders to play their 
1994 home games in Los Angeles rather than in Oakland.  
 
23.  Since the spring of 1994, Mr. Davis has repeatedly 
asserted, to League officials and in League meetings, that 
the Raiders are entitled to relocate their home territory 
based upon the club's own unilateral decision and that the 
League's reliance upon its franchise relocation rules as a 
justification for refusing to schedule the Raiders' 1994 
home games in Oakland violated the antitrust laws and 
caused serious financial injury to the Raiders. For example, 
at the League's Annual Meeting in March 1995, Mr. Davis 
asserted that the Raiders had been the victim in 1994 of an 
"NFL conspiracy" that violated the antitrust laws.  
 
24. Based on information available to the NFL, unless the 
requested relief is granted, the defendant will bring an 
antitrust damages action against the NFL for the League's 
refusal to schedule the Club's 1994 home games in 
Oakland, California.  In that event, the Club will maintain 
that it was not required to submit a request for the proposed 
change in its designated 1994 playing site because the Club 
is entitled to relocate its home territory based upon its own 
unilateral decision and because the NFL's rules and 
procedures pertaining to franchise relocation violate the 
federal anti- trust laws.  On that basis, it will assert that the 
League's refusal to permit the move in 1994 caused the club 
antitrust injury.  
 
25. Without a determination by this Court of the legality of 
the League's rules and procedures regarding franchise 
relocation, including specifically the requirement that any 
request for a change in the designated playing sites be 
submitted to the League for evaluation and approval, the 
NFL cannot enforce its agreements and procedures require 
defendant or other clubs to adhere to those commitments to 
which it has subscribed without undue risk of protracted 
anti- trust litigation and exposure to treble damage liability.  
 
26.  By reason of the foregoing, this Court should exercise 
its jurisdiction to resolve the present controversy between 
the parties by ruling that the determination of franchise 
location is committed by agreement to the collective 
determination or the league members, and that the NFL's 
rules and procedures regarding relocation of franchises are 
consistent with, and do not violate, the federal antitrust 
laws.  
 
COUNT II - CLAIM FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT 
 
(AGREEMENT TO ABIDE BY COLLECTIVE 
DETERMINATION AND ALLOCATION OF GROSS 
RECEIPTS)  
 
27. Paragraphs 1-16 of this Complaint are hereby 
incorporated by reference.  
 
28. By this Count, plaintiffs seek to enforce the Raiders' 
contractual obligation to comply with their membership 
covenants, arising from the NFL Constitution and Bylaws 
and subsequent action of the Executive Committee, by 
which the Club committed to internal League decision-
making processes the definition of gross receipts and the 
principle of allocating gross receipts between home and 
visiting clubs.  This Count involves the same parties as 
Count I and arises out of the same contract at issue in 
Count I, the NFL Constitution and Bylaws. and related 
League rules and regulations.  
 
29.  Under Section 19.1(A) of the NFL's Constitution and 
Bylaws, each NFL franchise participating in a regular 
season game as the home club is obligated to guarantee the 
visiting club certain levels of revenue with the visiting club 
being entitled to receive 40% of the gross receipts after a 
number of specified deductions, none of which is relevant 
here. The amount of this commitment is sometimes referred 
to as the "visiting team share."  
 
30.  Section l9.1(A)(3) defines "Gross Receipts" to include 
"all receipts derived from the sale of tickets, including taxes 
and special charges but excluding ticket handling changes."  
The scope off this definition was confirmed and clarified by 
agreement among the clubs in 1987 when, pursuant to the 
NFL Constitution and Bylaws, they adopted 1987 
Resolution FC-7, which provides:  
 
Any income in excess of the stated ticket price from the 
sale, leasing, or licensing of seats of admission to any 
game, including club seats or other premium pricing but 
excluding box suites, is to be included in the gross receipts 
of the same as defined in Article XIX, Section 9.1 of the 
Constitution and Bylaws.  
 
31. The scope of the definition of "gross receipts" was 
further clarified by agreement among the clubs in May 
1995 when, pursuant to the NFL Constitution and Bylaws, 
they adopted 1995  Resolution G-5,  which prescribed that 
certain categories of gross receipts would be shared by 
payments to a revenue sharing pool, to be divided annually 
among "low-revenue" member clubs in accordance with 
procedures for determining eligibility and payment 
amounts outlined in such resolution, rather than by 
payments directly to visiting clubs.  That resolution, which 
the Raiders supported, required that the following 
categories of gross receipts be paid to the revenue sharing 
pool:  
 
moneys received, directly or indirectly, by any party, 
including any member (a) in excess of the stated ticket 
price for any "club" or "premium" seat (other than seats in 
luxury suites) attributable to the sale, lease, or licensing for 
use of such seat, or (D) from any party's sale or issuance of 
any "permanent seat licenses" or other similar instruments 
that give purchasers the right to acquire tickets to NFL  
 
32.  From time to time, in accordance with the Constitution 
and Bylaws and upon the application of a member club, the 
NFL members have voted to exclude temporarily from a 
club's sharing obligation particular categories of gross 
receipts, usually to enable that club to fund construction of 
a new stadium or stadium improvements specifically 
described to the League.  No such waiver has been sought 
by the Raiders or approved in connection with the gross 
receipts at issue here.  
 
33.  The Raiders have informed the League of their 
intention not to share gross receipts from their regular 
season home games as required by the NFL Constitution 
and Bylaws. Raiders' refusal to share focuses on all, or a 
portion, of the following categories of gross receipts: (1) 
Revenues received from season ticket purchasers to the 
right to acquire season tickets to Raiders home games (the 
PSL revenues), including annual "loge maintenance" 
charges levied against PSL purchasers,  (2) club seat 
premium revenues, and (3) revenues, characterized as 
"location" fees, received from season ticket holders who do 
not purchase PSLs.  The sharable portion of such sums 
should be paid, in total or in substantial part, into the 
League's revenue sharing pool for later distribution; 
accordingly the NFL, as agent for all clubs having a 
potential interest in a share of such gross receipts, is 
entitled to enforce these obligations.  
 
34.  The Raiders have asserted that they are relieved of their 
obligation fully to share these categories of gross receipts 
because they have assigned to their stadium landlord the 
right to receive some or all of the associated revenues. This 
is an issue that, pursuant to their membership covenants 
and obligations, the Raiders have committed to resolution 
by internal League governance procedures.  
 
35.  On information and belief, apparently recognizing that 
their failure fully to share gross receipts would violate the 
club's contractual commitments, the Raiders recently 
entered into an agreement that induced certain third parties 
financially to support the Raiders in litigation of this issue 
and to indemnify the Raiders for some portion of any court 
determined Raiders' liability to share gross receipts.  
 
36.  The Raiders' failure to observe their contractual 
commitments to abide by internal League governance 
procedures and their declared intention to refuse fully to 
share gross receipts in accordance with their contractual 
commitments both constitute a breach of contract, an 
anticipatory breach of contract, and a continuing breach of 
contract.  
 
37.  As a result, the NFL, on behalf of the 29 other clubs of 
the League, is entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief 
(1) confirming that the extent of the Raiders' obligation to 
share gross receipts, and the interpretation of the term 
"gross receipts" for purposes of defining the scope of such 
sharing obligation, are matters committed to resolution by 
internal League governance processes and collective 
decision by the thirty member clubs and (2) requiring the 
Raiders to comply with that contractual commitment.  
 
WHEREFORE, plaintiff prays for judgment:  
 
(A)  On the first count, declaring (1) that the determination 
of franchisee locations is committed by contract to internal 
League governance procedures; (2) that the NFL did not 
violate the Sherman Act by relying by its rules and 
procedures regarding franchise relocation to reject 
defendant's demand unilaterally to relocate its franchise for 
the 1994 NFL season; and (3) that such rules and 
procedures are consistent with and comply fully with the 
Federal antitrust laws;  
 
(B)  On the second count,  (1) confirming that the Raiders 
and the other NFL member clubs have committed to 
internal League governance procedures and collective 
determination the definition of gross receipts and the 
allocation of gross receipts between home and visiting 
clubs and (2) requiring the Raiders to comply with that 
contractual commitment; and  
 
(C) Awarding such other relief as the Court may deem 
appropriate in the circumstances.

42. The willful and voluntary actions of Defendants Ley and Overmoyer
as set forth above were within the course and scope of their
employment with Defendant Wendy's Inc. 

43. The injuries and damages sustained by Plaintiffs as set forth
above were the direct and proximate result of the intentional actions
of Defendants Ley and Overmoyer, acting as the agents, servants,
and/or employees of Defendant Wendy's Inc. 

44. As set forth above, the conduct of Defendants Ley and Overmoyer,
as set forth above was outrageous, extreme, and in disregard of the
interests of Plaintiffs so as to entitle them to an award of punitive
damages. 

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Metzger, Cagle, Fox, Farr, Stine, Jarrett and
Hart each respectfully request judgment in her favor and against
Defendant Wendy's Inc. in an amount in excess of $10,000, together
with interest, costs and punitive damages. 


Respectfully submitted,

DATE:     May 15, 1995



FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE



DOW CORNING VOLUNTARILY FILES FOR CHAPTER 11



Midland, MI, May 15, 1995--Dow Corning corporation today

announced that it has voluntarily filed for protection under

Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code with the

United States Bankruptcy Court in Bay City, Michigan.



In announcing today's Chapter 11 filing, Dow Corning's

management emphasized that its underlying business remains

strong and that is customers will not be directly affected by

this action. "Dow Corning will continue to supply products to

our customers, and compensate our suppliers and employees as

we have in the past," explained Richard A. Hazleton,

Dow Corning chairman and chief executive officer. "We decided

to take this action while we are in a position of financial

strength, with the cash to continue operating our business

without disruption.



"We now believe this is our only reasonable choice for

four principal reasons. First, attorneys with lawsuits

outside of the global settlement have not reduced their

exorbitant demands, threatening our long-term business and,

therefore, our ability to fund the global settlement. Despite

the scientific evidence showing no link between implants and

disease, we were faced with preparing for nearly 200 cases in

the next 6 months. This represented a potentially enormous

financial and management drain which threatened our business.

Our Chapter 11 filing immediately stops all lawsuits against

the company," Hazleton explained.



Second, when we file our financial reorganization plan,

we hope to preserve our participation in a local settlement,

to which we have agreed to contribute $ 2 billion. Even so, we

are concerned about the settlement, since many are calling for

hundreds of millions or even billions of more dollars and are

predicting thousands of additional lawsuits. We are

continuing discussions with global settlement attorneys to

reach a satisfactory agreement. But, we have consistently

said that we cannot both fund the global settlement and afford

large numbers of lawsuits outside of the settlement,"  Hazleton

said.



"Third, several recent credit rating downgrades have

confirmed the financial community's long-term concerns about

the lack of a certain and predictable financial resolution to

this controversy. This understandable concern is in spite of

the underlying strength of our business, which the ratings

agencies understand. The Chapter 11 process will provide

closure by resolving all breast implant financial claims,"

Hazleton explained.



"Finally, some of our insurance carriers have not

accepted their responsibility to commit to pay their share of

the more than $1.5 billion which we believe they will owe us.

As of March 31, 1995, we had received less than $100 million.

We believe we will eventually be reimbursed, but we are not

satisfied with our progress," Hazleton said.



"This was a difficult decision," explained Hazleton. "We

carefully considered what effect this would have on our

customers, employees, suppliers, and communities,  well as

women who have our implants. In our judgment, the current and

evolving circumstances surrounding the breast implant

controversy reached the point that we had to take this action

now to preserve both the fundamental strength of our business

operations and our ability to fairly compensate all women with

breast implant claims.



"We are disappointed that our efforts to resolve this

controversy without resorting to a Chapter 11 filing were not

successful. We negotiated a $4.25 billion global settlement,

including $2 billion finding from Dow Corning over 30 years.

We argued or case in court with a good deal of success. We

also committed more than $30 million in additional research to

address the remaining questions women have about their

implants, and we funded an implant removal reimbursement

program for women who wanted to have their implants removed

but lacked the financial means to do so," Hazleton aid.



"Research has not shown a link between breast implants

and the diseases alleged in lawsuits. Research from

prestigious institutions like Harvard University, Mayo Clinic,

Johns Hopkins, the University of Michigan and others has

consistently found that women with implants are no more likely

to contract disease than women without implants. In fact,

recently, both the French and British governments have

reviewed the available research and concluded that women with

implants face no greater risk of developing autoimmune disease

than the general population, Hazleton stated.



"Our focus now will be to maintain our strong business

momentum by continuing to meet our customers' needs. We also

intend to work closely with our key creditors and the creditor

committees once they are appointed to complete our financial

restructuring and emerge from Chapter 11 as soon as possible,

although the entire process will probably take two years or

more. We have started this process by filing motions today

with the court that will minimize any disruption to our normal

day-to-day operations," Hazleton explained.



"We at Dow Corning deeply appreciate he outstanding

support we have received from our customers, employees,

suppliers, business and financial partners, and communities

throughout this controversy. We intend to demonstrate that

their confidence in us has been well placed by supplying

quality products and growing our business throughout and

following this Chapter 11 proceeding," Hazleton concluded.



Dow Corning Corp., a global leader in silicon-based

materials, is a Michigan corporation with shares equally owned

by The Dow Chemical Co. and Corning Inc. More than half of

Dow Cornings sales are outside the U.S.

<P>Latin Americans of Japanese descent is suing the federal government, seeking 
damages allegedly stemming from the policy of deportation and internment of persons of 
Japanese descent residing in the U.S. during World War II. The Civil Liberties Act of 
1988 included an apology and payments of $20,000 each to Japanese Americans interred 
during the war in such camps as Manzanar. This suit filed August 27, 1996 says the act's 
exclusion from compensation of persons who were not U.S. citizens or permanent 
residents at the time of their internment is unconstitutional.</P>

CIV. NO. 9659 8655L (Ex) 
 
CIVIL RIGHTS COMPLAINT FOR 
DECLARATORY INJUNCTIVE 
AND MONETARY RELIEF: CLASS 
ACTION 
 
DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL 
 
 
I. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
1. This is an action seeking relief for over 2,000 persons of Japanese descent whom the 
United States Government, during World War II, forcibly brought from Latin America. 
Despite the fact that there was never any credible evidence that they were a threat to their 
own countries or to the United States, they were unlawfully stripped of their citizenship 
papers, imprisoned in the United States, on the ground that they were illegal immigrants. 
The unstated purpose of this illegal program was to use them for prisoner exchange with 
Japan.  
 
2. The Civil Liberties Act of 1988 (50 U.S.C. app. Sec. 1989, as amended) ("CLA") was 
enacted in part, to remedy the injustices committed against persons of Japanese descent 
wrongfully relocated and interned by the United States government during World War II 
("Latin American Japanese"). Section 1989b-7(2)(A) of the CLA ("Eligibility Provision") 
excludes from eligibility persons who, at the time of their relocation or internment, were 
not citizens or permanent resident aliens of the United States of America. The United 
States of America ("U.S.A."), Reno, and Greene ("named defendants") have 
unconstitutionally, and in violation of international law, applied that exclusionary 
provision so as to deny Latin-American Japanese the benefits of the CLA.  
 
3. The CLA provides protection against future violations of, as well as restitution for past 
violations of, due process rights. Consequently, the Eligibility Provision of the CLA 
prejudices the due process rights of the Latin-American Japanese.  
 
4. Because the Eligibility Provision, as applied, denies redress to the Latin-American 
Japanese, they have suffered and continue to suffer mental anguish and humiliation, as 
well as deprivation of the monetary restitution provided for under the CLA. A declaration 
that the Eligibility Provision as applied to the Latin-American Japanese, violates the U.S. 
Constitution and international law, and an injunction that they be eligible for redress 
under the CLA, is necessary to restore full Fifth Amendment rights to the Latin-American 
Japanese.  
 
5. Furthermore, the mass arrests, deportations, and imprisonments, without hearings, of 
the Latin American Japanese, violated international law.  
 
6. Irrespective of whether or not plaintiffs are entitled to relief under the CLA, or under 
international law, they are entitled to relief directly under the U.S. Constitution.  
 
 
II. 
 
JURISDICTION 
 
7. This Court has jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1331 and 
1361 and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2201 et seq. The claims in this 
action arise under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  
 
8. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1391(e).  
 
 
III. 
 
PARTIES 
 
 
Plaintiffs 
 
9. Carmen Mochizuki, 64 years of age, is a United States citizen, and a resident of the 
County of Los Angeles. Ms. Mochizuki was a citizen of Peru, was raised there and living 
there with her family, when, in 1943, in a scheme initiated, orchestrated, and financed by 
the U.S.A., Ms. Mochizuki was, without any due process or legal justification, 
transported without her consent or intention, to the United States. There, she was 
imprisoned in an Immigration and Naturalization Service detention camp in Crystal City, 
Texas.  
 
10. Without any due process or legal justification, Ms. Mochizuki remained imprisoned 
until December, 1945.  
 
11. Ms. Mochizuki applied for redress under the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, and received 
a letter of denial citing the provisions of the statute to the effect that she was ineligible 
because she was not a United States citizen or permanent resident alien at the time of her 
imprisonment.  
 
12. Alice Nishimoto, 63 years of age, is a United States citizen, and a resident of the 
County of Los Angeles. Ms. Nishimoto was a citizen of Peru and was living there with 
her family when, in 1943, in a scheme initiated, orchestrated, and financed by the United 
States Government, Ms. Nishimoto was, without any due process or legal justification, 
transported without her consent or intention, to the United States. There, she was 
imprisoned in an Immigration and Naturalization Service detention camp in Crystal City, 
Texas.  
 
13. Henry Toshio Shima, 73 years of age, is a United States citizen, and a resident of Los 
Angeles County. Mr. Shima was born in Peru and living there with his family, when, in 
1943, in a scheme initiated, orchestrated, and financed by the United States Government, 
Mr. Shima was, without any due process or legal justification, transported without his 
consent or intention, to the United States. There, he was imprisoned in Immigration and 
Naturalization Service detention camps in Kennedy, Texas, Kooskia, Idaho, and Crystal 
City, Texas until 1946. Defendants  
 
14. Defendant U.S.A., through its Congress and President, enacted and administers me 
CLA, and is responsible for the abduction and imprisonment of the Latin American 
Japanese.  
 
15. Defendant Janet Reno is the Attorney General of the United States and heads the 
Department of Justice, which administers the CLA. Under the CLA, she is responsible for 
identifying, locating, and paying compensation to each "eligible individual."  
 
16. Defendant Dede Greene is administrator of the Office of Redress Administration 
which, under the CLA, notifies individuals of their potential eligibility and verifies their 
claims.  
 
17. Defendants Unknown U.S. Government Agents ("Agents") carried out the abduction 
and imprisonment of the Latin American Japanese under the direction of the U.S.A.  
 
 
IV. 
 
ACTION ALLEGATIONS 
 
18. Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, 
pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. For purposes of 
enjoining defendants' unconstitutional policy and practice, plaintiffs represent a class of 
persons defined as follows:  
 
19. All persons of Japanese descent, deported from Latin American countries without 
hearings, interned by the U.S. Government in the United States without hearings, and 
ineligible for redress under the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 solely on the basis of CLA 
Sec. 1989b-7(2)(A)'s requirement that, at the time of their internment, those eligible for 
redress must have been United States citizens, or permanent resident aliens of the United 
States.  
 
20. The members of the class defined in the foregoing paragraph, estimated to number 
2,000 or more, are so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  
 
21. There are questions of law and fact common to the members of the plaintiff class. 
These common questions include the following:  
 
22. Whether the Eligibility Provision of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, Sec. 1989b-7(2), 
as applied to the members of the class, which limits eligibility for due process on the 
basis of United States citizenship, or status as a permanent resident alien of the United 
States, violates their equal protection rights under the 5th Amendment to the United 
States Constitution on the basis of alienage;  
 
23. Whether the international law rights of the Latin American Japanese were violated by 
their forcible deportation to, and imprisonment in, the United States during World War II;  
 
24. Whether the international law rights of the Latin American Japanese were violated by 
their exclusion from redress under the Eligibility Provision,  
 
25. Whether the due process rights of the Latin American Japanese under the U.S. 
Constitution were violated by their abduction and imprisonment by the U.S.A. during 
World War II.  
 
26. The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the members of the 
class in that Plaintiffs Carmen Mochizuki, Alice Nishimoto, and Henry Shima, are 
persons of Japanese descent, who were deported from a Latin American country, without 
hearings, forcibly brought to the United States without their consent or intention, and 
imprisoned, without hearings, in United States internment camps, as a direct, intended, 
and foreseeable result of the United States Government's orchestration, direction, and 
financing of a scheme to arrest and deport, without hearings, Latin-Americans of 
Japanese descent. As a consequence, Plaintiffs were deprived of their homes, their jobs, 
their property, their reputations, and their family relationships, and were imprisoned in 
United States internment camps, to be exchanged for United States citizens held prisoner 
in foreign countries.  
 
27. The named plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. 
Plaintiffs have no interest that is now or may be potentially antagonistic to the interests of 
the class. Plaintiffs are represented by Robin S. Toma, Paul L. Mills, Fred Okrand, Legal 
Director Emeritus of the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, and Mark D. 
Rosenbaum, Legal Director of the foundation. Counsel for plaintiffs are well-established 
public interest attorneys and law firms with extensive experience in litigating federal 
court class action cases involving federal civil rights claims.  
 
28. Inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class, 
e.g., that the CLA unconstitutionally denies some members of the class redress, but 
constitutionally denies it to others, would establish incompatible standards of conduct for 
Defendants.  
 
29. Adjudications with respect to individual members of the class, e.g., that they were not 
unconstitutionally denied benefits under the CLA, would, as a practical matter, be 
dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the adjudications, or 
substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interest.  
 
30. Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class, =,, denying all 
members eligibility for redress under the Eligibility Provision, thereby making 
appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the 
class as a whole.  
 
31. The common questions of law and fact predominate, and class treatment is superior to 
other available methods.  
 
 
FACTS 
 
A. The Deportation and Internment Program  
 
32. Prior to United States entry into World War II, Defendants U.S.A. and Agents 
concluded an agreement, with certain Latin-American Governments and their authorized 
agents, to arrest and intern Latin-American Japanese in the event of war.  
 
33. After United States entry into World War II, Defendants U.S.A. and Agents, in 
cooperation with certain Latin-American governments and their authorized agents, 
implemented a program for arresting Latin-American Japanese in their countries, 
deporting them, and interning them in the United States.  
 
34. Before, during, and after the program of Latin-American Japanese deportation and 
internment, the United States Government had no reliable evidence of planned or 
contemplated acts of sabotage, subversion, or espionage by the Plaintiffs.  
 
35. Anti-Latin-American Japanese propaganda in Latin America was planned and 
authorized by Defendants U.S.A. and Agents.  
 
36. Anti-Latin-American Japanese propaganda in Latin America was radio broadcast on 
instructions from, and in cooperation with, Defendants U.S.A. and Agents.  
 
37. Lists of Latin-American Japanese to be deported from Latin America were generated 
and implemented by Defendants U.S.A. and Agents.  
 
38. Blacklists of Latin-American Japanese businesses in Latin America were generated 
by Defendants U.S.A. and Agents, and Latin-American Japanese on those blacklists were 
boycotted by Defendants U.S.A. and Agents, and by others in cooperation with 
Defendants U.S.A. and Agents.  
 
39. The transportation of the deported Plaintiffs to the United States was paid for by 
Defendants U.S.A. and Agents, via transport facilities provided by Defendants U.S.A. 
and Agents.  
 
40. Defendants U.S.A. and Agents confiscated passports and identity documents of the 
deported Plaintiffs during their transportation to the United States.  
 
41. Upon the arrival of the deported Plaintiffs into the United States, Defendants U.S.A. 
and Agents declared them to be illegal immigrants on the grounds mat they had no 
passports, visas, or other documentation.  
 
42. After arrival in the United States, the Plaintiffs were not granted individual hearings 
to determine their status as enemies of the United States, or as illegal immigrants in the 
United States. Between April 1942 and April 1945, Defendants U.S.A. and Agents 
confined approximately 2,300 Plaintiffs in internment camps in the United States.  
 
 
B. The Civil Liberties Act of 1988 
 
43. The Civil Liberties Act of 1988, 50 App. Sec. 1989, as amended, was enacted by the 
United States Congress. The purposes of the CLA are to "(1) acknowledge the 
fundamental injustice of the evacuation, relocation, and internment of United States 
citizens and permanent resident aliens of Japanese ancestry during World War II, (2) 
apologize on behalf of the people of the United States for the evacuation, relocation, and 
internment of such citizens and permanent resident aliens; (3) provide for a public 
education fund to finance efforts to inform the public about the internment of such 
individuals so as to prevent the recurrence of any similar event; (4) make restitution to 
those individuals of Japanese ancestry who were interned; . . . (6) discourage the 
occurrence of similar injustices and violations of civil liberties in the future; and (7) make 
more credible and sincere any declaration of concern by the United States over violations 
of human rights committed by other nations."  
 
44. Section 1989b-7(2) defines those eligible for restitution for relocation and 
confinement during World War II as "any individual of Japanese ancestry who is living 
on the date of the enactment of this Act and who during the evacuation, relocation, and 
internment period [December 7, 1941 to June 30, 1946] (A) was a United States citizen or 
a permanent resident alien."  
 
 
C. Denial of Redress to the Japanese Latin-American  
 
45. Each of the named plaintiffs, and approximately 300 class members, have been 
denied redress by Defendants, on the basis of the Eligibility Provision.  
 
46. The class members were, and are, situated similarly to, and treated differently than, 
United States citizens and permanent residents of the United States of Japanese descent, 
who were relocated and confined during World War II.  
 
47. The Eligibility Provision as applied to Plaintiffs directly contradicts the CLA's stated 
purposes, i.e., to discourage me occurrence of similar injustices and violations of civil 
liberties in the future; to make restitution to those individuals of Japanese ancestry who 
were interned; and to make more credible and sincere any declaration of concern by the 
United States over violations of human rights committed by other nations.  
 
48. Defendants' denial of benefits under the Eligibility Provision, as applied to the class 
members, for the injuries caused to them through their relocation and confinement during 
World War II by Defendants U.S.A. and Agents has, does, and will continue to, cause 
Plaintiffs to suffer injury to their equal protection rights under the 5th Amendment to the 
United States Constitution.  
 
49. Defendants' denial of benefits under the CLA to the class members, for the injuries to 
them through their relocation and confinement during World War II by Defendants 
U.S.A. and Agents directly has, does, and will continue to cause the class members great 
mental and emotional anguish and humiliation, as well as to deprive them of monetary 
restitution.  
 
50. The Eligibility Provision as applied by Defendants against the Plaintiffs is both harsh 
and oppressive.  
 
51. The Eligibility Provision as applied to the class members by Defendants, 
intentionally, purposefully, and invidiously discriminates against Plaintiffs on the basis of 
their alienage.  
 
52. Plaintiffs will continue to suffer injury to their Fifth Amendment equal protection 
rights if the denial of Plaintiffs' restitution is not enjoined.  
 
53. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. Only the relief requested will redress 
plaintiffs' injuries.  
 
54. Members of the class, including the named Plaintiffs, have applied to the Office of 
Redress Administration for redress under the CLA. They were denied on the stated 
ground that the Eligibility Provision excludes them. Exhaustion of administrative 
remedies by all other class members is futile.  
 
 
V. CAUSES OF ACTION 
 
First Cause of Action 
 
55. Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through paragraph 54 herein as though set forth in 
full.  
 
56. The Eligibility Provision, as applied to the class members, violates their right to equal 
protection under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  
 
 
Second Cause of Action 
 
57. Irrespective of whether the Eligibility Provision, when applied to class members, 
violates their right to equal protection under the Fifth Amendment, the actions of 
Defendants U.S.A. and Agents were committed in violation of treaties to which 
Defendant U.S.A. is, and was, a party, and of international law. These violations include, 
but are not limited to: (i) Defendants U.S.A. and Agents' forced deportation of class 
members from their home countries to the United States; and (ii) Defendants U.S.A. and 
Agents' use of class members, from countries that were not at war with Japan, as 
prisoners for exchange with Japan.  
 
58. As a proximate result of such acts by Defendants U.S.A. and Agents, Plaintiffs have 
been severely damaged and (i) have been deprived, and are continuing to be deprived, 
and have lost the value of their homes and businesses, and (ii) incurred personal harm, 
extreme and severe emotional anguish. Plaintiffs will seek leave of the Court to determine 
the amount of said damages, according to proof, at the time of trial.  
 
59. The aforementioned acts of defendants were willful, wanton, malicious, and 
oppressive, and therefore justify the award of punitive damages.  
 
 
Third Cause of Action 
 
60. Plaintiffs incorporate paragraph 1 through paragraph 54 herein as though set forth in 
full.  
 
61. Irrespective of whether plaintiffs are entitled to relief under the Civil Liberties Act of 
1988, or under international law, Plaintiffs are entitled to relief directly under the due 
process clause of the 5th Amendment to the United States Constitution.  
 
62. As a proximate result of such acts by Defendants U.S.A. and Agents, Plaintiffs have 
been severely damaged and (i) have been deprived, and are continuing to be deprived, 
and have lost the value of their homes and businesses, and (ii) incurred personal harm, 
extreme and severe emotional anguish. Plaintiffs will seek leave of the Court to determine 
the amount of said damages, according to proof, at the time of trial.  
 
63. The aforementioned acts of defendants were willful, wanton, malicious, and 
oppressive, and therefore justify the award of punitive damages.  
 
 
VI. 
 
RELIEF 
 
WHEREFORE, plaintiffs request that this Court:  
 
64. Declare that 50 U.S.C. app. Sec. 1989b-7(2)(A), as applied to the members of the 
class, violates their right to equal protection under the Fifth Amendment to the United 
States Constitution;  
 
65. Declare that the acts of Defendants U.S.A. and Agents during World War II, as stated 
herein, violated Plaintiffs' rights under the U.S. Constitution, and international law and 
treaties;  
 
66. Declare that 50 U.S.C. app. Sec. 1989b-7(2)(A), as applied to the members of the 
class, violates their rights under international law and treaties;  
 
67. Enjoin Defendants U.S.A., Reno, and Greene, to grant eligibility for all appropriate 
benefits under the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 to all members of the class denied 
eligibility under the Eligibility Provision, who would otherwise be eligible;  
 
68. Grant plaintiffs costs of suit and attorneys fees, and  
 
69. Grant such other further relief as this court deems just and proper.

OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

96-00259

JEFF SESSIONS
ATTORNEY GENERAL
STATE OF ALABAMA
JUL 12 1996

Honorable Randy Hinshaw
Member, House of Representatives
218 Constitution Drive
Meridianville, AL  35759

Community Notification Act
- Crimes and Offenses -
Sex Offenders - Notices

A criminal sex offender may not establish a legal residence with any
child 18 years old or younger.

Dear Representative Hinshaw:

This opinion is issued in response to your request for an opinion
from the Attorney General.

QUESTION

Does the Community Notification Act prohibit a criminal sex
offender from residing with a minor child who is a relative?

FACTS AND ANALYSIS

Alabama's Community Notification Act prohibits a released sex
crime offender from establishing a legal residence where a person 18
years or younger resides. Act No. 96-793, Section 3. (d):

"No released sex crime offender shall be allowed to establish a legal
residence where a person 18 years of age or younger resides, except
as elsewhere provided by law."

First, as a general rule, we act under the presumption that a
legislative act is constitutional. It is a fundamental rule of statutory
construction that the legislative intent as it is expressed in the statute
is to be ascertained and effectuated. Darks Dairy, Inc. v. Alabama
Dairy Commission, et al., 367 So.2d 1378 (Ala. 1979). The intent
of the statute is to be given effect and, if the language is clear and
unambiguous, then the statute is to be given its clear meaning.
Beavers v. County of Walker, 645 So.2d 1365 (ala. 1994); Attorney
General's opinion to William E. Shinn, dated June 3, 1992, A.G.
No. 92-00294. In applying the clear meaning of a statute, one must
look at its entire statutory scheme rather than at isolated phrases or
clauses. Ex parte Employee's Retirement Systems of Alabama, 644
So.2d 943 (Ala. 1994). The reason and necessity for the statute is
also relevant. Pace v. Armstrong World Industries, Inc., 578 So.2d
281 (Ala. 1991).

In applying these rules of construction to the Community Notification
Act, we acknowledge first that the purpose of the Act is to require
any imprisoned criminal sex offender to declare in writing the
address at which he or she will reside upon release from
incarceration. The residence declared by the sex offender before he
is released from prison becomes his legal residence for the purposes
of this Act. The residence cannot be within 1,000 feet of any public
school, private school, day care center, or any other child care
facility. The residence cannot be within 1,000 feet of any of the sex
offender's former victims.

The Act provides that the legal residence cannot be at a place where a
person 18 years of age or younger resides. There is no exception
from this prohibition for children who are relatives or over whom the
sex offender has custody.

The phrase "except as elsewhere provided by law" might be
interpreted by a court under some unforeseen, extraordinary, and
even improbable circumstances to authorize a judicial determination
and court order as an exception to the residency prohibition.
However, this phrase is not a statutory exemption for relatives or for
any other child over whom the sex offender has custody. When read
in its entirety, the Community Notification Act mandates that the
community be warned of the presence of criminal sex offenders and
prohibits sex offenders from living with children under the age of 18.
The legislature did not exclude the offender's own children or
relatives from its protection. After researching the issue, we find no
other law to the contrary.

CONCLUSION

A criminal sex offender may not establish a legal residence with any
child 18 years old or younger.

I hope this sufficiently answers your question. If our office can be
of further assistance, please contact Jane LeCroy Brannan or my
staff.


Sincerely,

JEFF SESSIONS
Attorney General

<P>On July 1, 1996, Court TV challenged lawyers Evan Wolfson and Rick Duncan to a debate on same-sex marriage.  Wolfson, the senior staff attorney at Lambda Legal Defense, the leading civil rights group for gay men and lesbians, is co-counsel in the Hawaii case.  Duncan, a professor at the University of Nebraska College of Law, wrote a Supreme Court brief on behalf of several states that supported Colorado's anti-gay rights law. The following is a transcript of the event, which took place on America Online's Center Stage.</P>

<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT><p>





Court TV: Good evening, everybody. Welcome to Court TV's Debate on same-sex marriages. We're here on America Online's Center Stage with our guests Evan Wolfson and Rick Duncan. They are standing by, ready to debate questions from the audience.<p>



First, a little about our guests: Rick Duncan is a professor at the University of Nebraska College of Law. He wrote a Supreme Court brief on behalf of several states that supported Colorado's anti-gay rights law. He has written extensively on the law of religion and constitutional law.<p>



Evan Wolfson is the senior staff attorney at Lambda Legal Defense, the leading civil right group for gay men and lesbians. Good evening Mr. Duncan. Please tell us some more about yourself.<p>



Rick: I've written three Law Review articles on gay rights, one on the religious freedom issue, one on Colorado Amendment 2, and one coming out this month on same-sex marriage. I teach constitutional law, and have a special interest in religious freedom and the culture war.<p>



Court TV: Mr. Wolfson, tell us more about your work.<p>



Evan: I'm director of The Marriage Project for Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, and I am co-counsel 	for the couples seeking freedom to marry in the case in Hawaii.<p>



CourtTV9: Why don't we start with an update on that case. <p>



Evan: Well, the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled in May of 1993 that the denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples is discrimination. The court said that unless the government can show a compelling reason for this harsh discrimination it must stop discriminating. So we are in the lower court now and expect a final decision in the case about 2 years from now.

	

Rick: I'd like to point out two things: First, the Hawaii case does not involve the United States Constitution, but rather a provision of the Hawaii constitution that differs from federal rule.<p>



Second, the court in the Hawaii case did not hold that the discrimination was based on homosexuality, but rather was based upon gender. I don't believe it is likely that this whole thing would be duplicated in Federal Courts.<p>



Court TV: We will now take questions from the audience. Our guests will both respond to each question. To be fair, we will alternate the order in which they respond.<p>



Question: Are there any Constitutional precedents that can be used to uphold gay marriages?<p>



Rick: Well, the answer is no. The case that some proponents of gay marriage likely would refer to is Loving v. Virginia, the case that struck down laws prohibiting interracial marriages. That case is completely different from the same-sex marriage issue for a lot of reasons.<p>



Evan: First of all, gay people are denied the freedom to marry in all 50 states. We are fighting to change that. The Hawaii court concluded that the ban on people marrying someone of the "the wrong sex" is clearly analogous to the ban on marrying someone of "the wrong race." In 1987, the Supreme Court defined the four key elements of marriage in striking down a ban on prisoners marrying. All four of the elements apply to gay and lesbian people in love who wish to marry. There is simply no good reason why the government should prevent couples in love from taking on the commitment of marriage.<p>



Question: This country was founded on the belief of "Separation of Church and State." Beyond a moral argument solely based on religious beliefs, what POSSIBLE argument could you have against same-sex marriages?

	

Evan: We believe that government should not force any religion to perform or recognize any marriage it doesn't want to. At the same time, churches or religions should not dictate who gets a civil marriage license.

	

Rick: Churches do not dictate who gets a civil marriage license, the legislatures of all 50 states have defined a marriage as involving a relationship between one man and one woman. The institution of marriage is an attempt to encourage and promote an ideal way of life, and to channel procreation into a committed and complimentary relationship between husband and wife. In short, conventional marriage "gives full expression to the commitment through time and history evident in having and caring for children."<p>



Question: Why do you two feel personally passionate about this issue?<p>



Rick: I believe that the same-sex marriage issue is the most critical battle in the culture war. We are talking about the meaning of the most essential unit in the human community. 	The proponents of same-sex marriage are seeking a fundamental change in society that will have many unintended consequences.<p>



Evan: It's clear that Prof. Duncan does not have a reason why gay people should be barred from marrying. He says it's about how legislatures define marriages. But less than 30 years ago legislatures defined marriage to exclude interracial couples. He says it's about children. But many non-gay married couples do not have children, while many same-sex couples are raising children. What's clear is that our opponents have nothing to say here, except their bottom line dislike of gay people.<p>



Question: Let's say same-sex marriage becomes the law. What would America be like ten, 20 years down the road? Would the world be much different?

	

Evan: The world would be much different for gay people, our families, our children, and our loved ones. It will also be different for non-gay people who are opposed to sexism and who support equality. But the sky will not fall, non-gay people will still get married, and the government will not run out of marriage licenses. These people always predict the end of the world. They said it about contraception. They said it about women's equality. And they said it about interracial marriage.<p>



Rick: I don't know who "these people" are that Mr. Wolfson refers to. My view of the same-sex marriage issue is that it's a demand not for tolerance, but for public endorsement and subsidization of homosexual relationships. Conventional marriage laws do not cruelly prevent same-sex partners from living together, loving each other and even considering themselves married. All conventional marriage laws do, is point toward an ideal, a committed relationship between one man and one woman for procreation and rearing of children. <p>



Question: If you support gay marriage because it is love between consenting adults, why not condone polygamy -- as long as it's polygamy among three or more consenting adults.<p>



Rick: I think the poster makes a good point. 	There are many loving relationships. Those between brothers and sisters who live together, between roommates, and indeed among several people who live together and love one another that are not recognized as marriages, and that do not receive the public benefits that are provided to married couples. If we allow same-sex couples to marry, there seems no good reason to deny marriages to all these other relationships. <p>



Evan: Once again that is exactly the argument that people made against interracial marriage. They said that if we allow interracial marriage, we'll have to allow polygamy. It wasn't true then, and it's not true now. The number of people who can get married should be the same for gay and non-gay people. And when you say it's two, that's a different question from whether the government can add an additional restriction based on race, or religion or sex or sexual orientation. Talking about polygamy is just a scare tactic, not an argument.<p>



Question: Considering the conservative legislation to ban gay marriage on a Federal level and President Clinton's willingness to sign it, how will gay marriage ever pass? The Supreme Court tends to be more conservative than liberal.

	

Evan: Well, first of all, the Federal Anti-Marriage Bill has not passed, and people should urge their senators 	and the president to oppose this radical discriminatory, cruel election year legislation. Second, regardless of whether we win or lose one particular battle, we will win the freedom to marry. We must stick with the fight through setbacks as well as through victories.<p>



Rick: The Defense of Marriage Act is neither cruel nor radical. It takes the position that the people of each state should decide their own marriage policy, not the activist court in Hawaii. All the act does is make clear that Federal Law does not require any state to recognize any out-state-marriage that is contrary to it's public policy. In terms of the United States Supreme Court, there is absolutely no chance that the court would mandate same-sex marriage under the Constitution.<p>



Question: If we allow gay marriages, how would we prevent abuse and exploitation of the system? For example, roommates claiming married status?

	

Rick: If we allow same-sex marriage, there is no reason to not to allow any two people who love one another to claim the benefits of marriage. Why should we deny the benefits of marriage to two sisters who live together, while granting it to a homosexual couple? If the argument is that the state recognizes to encourage committed and loving relationships, then there is no<p>



Evan: First of all, the now 100's of cities, companies, universities and employers who are providing domestic partner benefits (almost all voluntarily, by the way) have reported no problem of abuse, fraud or cost. Second, gay people are no more likely to abuse marriage rights than non-gay people. Third, when two people come to get a marriage license, they do not have to sign a letter of intent to procreate. They do not have to swear a legal affidavit about their sex lives. They get married, and the state respects their marriage.

That's how it should be for non-gay and gay couples alike.<p>



Question: Where is gay marriage legal? How has it worked out?<p>



Evan: No country permits equal marriage, however a number of countries recognize a marriage-like relationship called "registered partnership." Countries like Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and so on have reported absolutely no bad consequences and according to the Wall Street Journal, even people who opposed registered partnership (including some religious figures) now think it was the right decision.<p>



Rick: The strong worldwide consensus supporting the heterosexual norm in marriage is itself significant.

No country or state in the world recognizes same-sex marriage. Moreover, a recent survey by international scholars 	concluded it's unlikely that a foreign same-sex marriage (such as might happen if the Hawaii courts mandate same-sex marriage) "would be fully recognized at the present time as a marriage 	in any jurisdiction in the world". It is Mr. Wolfson who is proposing the truly radical ideas.<p>



Court TV: We've run out of time. Thanks to both of you. Any final thoughts, Mr. Duncan.<p>



Rick: Thanks for the opportunity to take part in this forum.<p>



Evan: Equality always seems radical to those who oppose it. I urge people to not let this important public discussion get shut down or distorted by anti-marriage election year attacks. Thank you.<p>



Court TV: Thanks all. Good night.<p>

<P>Nineteen-year-old Fauziya Kasinga said she came to the United States in 1994 to seek asylum from a grisly and sometimes deadly practice in her West African homeland of Togo -- the ritual mutilation of female genitals.</P>
<P>The U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals held a hearing May 2, 1996 to consider whether Kasinga should be granted political asylum. The following is a transcript.</P>

<PRE>
BOARD OF IMMIGRATION APPEALS 
FALLS CHURCH, VA 
 
In Re:  Fauziya KASINGA 
 
A 73 479 695 
 
 
A hearing on the above-entitled matter was held on Thursday, May 
2, 1996, commencing at approximately 2:00 p.m., at the Board of 
Immigration Appeals, Falls Church, before:  
 
PAUL W. SCHMIDT, Chairman 
 
 
PROCEEDINGS 
 
Mr. Schmidt: Good afternoon, Professor 
Musalo. Good afternoon Mr. Martin. 
 
Mr. Martin: Good afternoon. 
 
Mr. Schmidt: This is Oral Argument in the case of Fauziya 
Kasinga, Docket Number A 73 476 695. Board of Immigration 
Appeals is sitting en bane this afternoon. Paul W. Schmidt, 
Chairman, presiding.  
 
Joining me to my right, Vice Chairman Mary Maguire Dunne, and 
Board members Michael J. Heilman and Gerald S. Hurwitz. 
Joining me to my immediate left, Board members Fred W. Vacca, 
David B. Holmes, and Patricia A. Cole.  
 
Also joining me from right to left, Board members Lauren R. 
Mathon, Gustavo D. Villageliu, Lauri S. Filppu, Lory D. 
Rosenberg, and John W. Guendelsberger. On the far right, the 
Chief Clerk of the Board, April M. Verner and our court reporters 
this afternoon, Sue Gearheart, assisted by Fortune T. Krisak.  
 
Appearing for the applicant, Professor Karen Musalo of the 
International Human Rights Clinic. Professor Musalo, would you 
be kind enough to introduce your colleagues at Counsel table for 
the record?  
 
Ms. Musalo: Yes. Yes, I would. My co-counsel, Professor Richard 
Boswell, and my co-counsel Layli Miller Bashir.  
 
Mr. Schmidt: Welcome. And appearing for the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, David A. Martin, the General Counsel. Mr. 
Martin, would you be kind enough to introduce your colleagues 
and counsel today for the record.  
 
Mr. Martin: Yes, Mr. Chairman, I'd be happy to introduce David 
Dixon who is Chief Appellate Counsel and Dorthea Lay, Assistant 
General Counsel, and Shilpa Khagram, who is Appellate Counsel 
for the Service.  
 
Mr. Schmidt: Welcome. Before we get started, I have several 
preliminary matters to go over. Professor Musalo, I understand that 
your client has consented to this being an open hearing.  
 
Ms. Musalo: Yes, that's correct, Your Honor.  
 
Mr. Schmidt: And I was hoping to get that answer. (Laughter.)  
 
Mr. Schmidt: And Professor Musalo, you've requested and you've 
been granted an extended argument time of 30 minutes. Mr. 
Martin, you've been granted an equal amount of time. Either of you 
may reserve a portion of your time for rebuttal. But 30 minutes is 
inclusive of Board Member questioning and I will notify you when 
five minutes remain. We have a large group in here this afternoon 
and it will be easier for everybody to concentrate if the audience 
could please remain seated for the entire Oral Argument. We really 
appreciate your cooperation. Professor Musalo, you have 30 
minutes. You may proceed.  
 
Ms. Musalo: I would like to thank the 
honorable members of the Board for allowing me to appear before 
you today to argue on behalf of our client Fauziya Kasinga. I 
would also like to thank the Board and its staff for the 
accommodation to the greatest degree possible of the public and 
media interest in this case.  
 
I will argue to you today that Ms. Kasinga clearly qualifies for the 
relief of political asylum and withholding of deportation. I will 
attempt to limit my argument to approximately 20 minutes and to 
reserve 10 minutes for rebuttal. There are three points that I will 
address in making my argument that Ms. Kasinga is eligible for 
relief; they are the following.  
 
Ms. Kasinga is clearly credible and the 
Immigration Judge's ruling to the contrary, was totally unsupported 
by the evidence. Two, this Board can and should exercise its power 
of de nova review and make a ruling in Ms. Kasinga's case rather 
than remanding to the Immigration Judge for a decision. And, 
three, Ms. Kasinga has established a threat to life or freedom and a 
well-founded fear of persecution on account of her membership in 
the particular social group comprised of young women of the 
Chamba Kunsuntu (phonetic sp.) tribe. Therefore she qualifies for 
political asylum and withholding of deportation.  
 
In addition, I will argue one other point and that point is that this 
Board should resist the invitation of the I.N.S. to decide 
hypothetical cases involving female genital mutilation which are 
not implicated in Ms. Kasinga's case. The I.N.S.'s invitation to the 
Board to engage in rule making is inappropriate and the Board 
should restrict itself to the narrow issue raised by this case whether 
a prospective fear of female genital mutilation constitutes a basis 
for asylum and withholding.  
 
Mr. Chairman, is there any need for me to go over the facts in this 
case, or members of the Board.  
 
Mr. Schmidt: I don't believe so. 
 
Ms. Musalo: Okay, thank you. Then I'd like to begin by addressing 
the issue of credibility. The Immigration Judge found Ms. Kasinga 
to be not credible. Although the credibility determination of an 
Immigration Judge is accorded deference, the Judge's 
determination must be supported by the record. The Judge must 
offer a specific cogent reason for his disbelief and there must be a 
rational and supportable connection between the reasons cited and 
the conclusion that the applicant is not credible.  
 
In Ms. Kasinga's case, there was no evidence; and I repeat, no 
evidence in the record to support an adverse credibility finding. 
Not only was Ms. Kasinga consistent, asserting in both her asylum 
application and at her hearing that she fled female genital 
mutilation and forced polygamy, but she provided more 
corroboration than most asylum applicants are able to. Ms. Kasinga 
introduced into evidence two letters from her mother referring to 
her flight from female circumcision and from marriage to an old 
man. The letter also refers to the fact that the police were searching 
for her.  
 
Ms. Kasinga introduced into evidence a marriage certificate 
documenting the marriage between herself and Ebrahim Isaka 
(phonetic sp.). The certificate shows Isaka to be 45 years old and it 
lists Ms. Kasinga's occupation as a student. Consistent with her 
story, the husband's signature appears on the certificate but Ms. 
Kasinga's does not.  
 
In further support of her credibility, Ms. Kasinga introduced 
photographs showing her and Ebrahim Isaka's wife in ceremonial 
dress on the wedding day. She also submitted into evidence two 
extensive reports on female genital mutilation which confirm that it 
is practiced in Togo and that there are no laws in Togo which 
protect women against the deadly practice. Nonetheless, the 
Immigration Judge found Ms. Kasinga to be not credible. A review 
of the Judge's credibility determination will show that he 
substituted his own personal opinion and erroneous assumptions 
for a careful evaluation of the record.  
 
First of all, the Immigration Judge found Ms. Kasinga not credible 
because she testified that F.G.M. was pervasive in Togo but she 
herself had not yet been mutilated. The Immigration Judge thought 
it was not credible that she could have avoided F.G.M. if it was so 
widespread. Yet, Ms. Kasinga had clearly explained the reason to 
him. In her testimony, if you look at the transcript, you will see 
repeated references in which she explains that she had been able to 
avoid F.G.M. because of the protection of her father, a man who 
was able to ignore the cultural norms, because he was a wealthy 
and successful businessman. There was no legitimate reason for the 
Judge to disbelieve the very logical explanation that in a 
patriarchal society, a man, in this case, her father, could protect her 
from a pervasive cultural practice.  
 
Second, the Immigration Judge found Ms. Kasinga not credible 
because she testified that after June of 1993 she did not know 
where her mother was. Ms. Kasinga explained that when she 
returned home from school six months-after her father died, her 
mother was gone and her aunt had taken over the family home. Ms. 
Kasinga heard that her aunt and one of her sisters had been in 
contact with her mother; but Ms. Kasinga herself did not know 
where to find her mother after her mother was banished from the 
family home.  
 
The Immigration Judge found it incredible that Ms. Kasinga would 
not know where her mother was. Yet the Judge| never proffers a 
legally sufficient reason for finding this fact incredible. One can 
only assume that the Immigration Judge did not believe Ms. 
Kasinga on this point because that's not how family life usually 
works in the United States. In the U.S., after a father's death, a 
paternal aunt generally cannot send away a child's mother and 
prevent the child from having contact with the mother. But Togo is 
not the United States and the Judge's reliance upon U.S. cultural 
norms to judge Ms. Kasinga's credibility regarding the 
whereabouts of her mother was totally improper. There is nothing 
anywhere in the record to support a finding that Ms Kasinga's 
testimony regarding her mother was anything but truthful. In 
addition to the Judge's erroneous assumptions about Togo, he 
seized upon tangential issues regarding Ms. Kasinga's stay in 
Germany, to find her not credible. His disbelief regarding events in 
Germany were as equally unfounded as his disbelief regarding 
events in Togo. He found it beyond belief that Ms. Guergs 
(phonetic sp.), the German woman whom Ms. Kasinga met at the 
airport, would let her stay with her for two months. He found it 
incredible that Ms. Kasinga had a chance encounter with Charlie, 
the Nigerian, who sold her the passport. But the Judge gives no 
legally permissible explanation of why these events were 
incredible or unbelievable.  
 
What is beyond belief about a German woman in an airport helping 
Ms. Kasinga upon learning of her plight? As a matter of fact, the 
recent outpouring of support for Ms. Kasinga in the U.S. -- much 
of it from women who were especially touched by her story of 
flight from F.G.M. and forced polygamy, and none of whom have 
even met Ms. Kasinga, only reinforces the credibility of her story 
that this kind German woman befriended her.  
 
What is so unbelievable about her chance meeting with a Nigerian 
man who sold her a British passport? Ms. Kasinga testified that she 
was riding on public transportation in Germany when Charlie 
struck up a conversation with her. Many of us who travel abroad 
have had the experience of running into someone who is from the 
same part of the world as we are and striking up a conversation. 
The fact that Charlie subsequently sold her a passport so that she 
could travel to the United States does not make her story any less 
credible.  
 
Not one of the Judge's reasons for disbelieving Ms Kasinga were 
legally permissible. Nonetheless, Counsel for Ms. Kasinga 
submitted to this Board the affidavit of an expert on Togo 
Professor Merit Paznanski (phonetic sp.) for the limited purpose of 
establishing that the unfounded assumptions made by the Judge 
about Togo are simply false. Professor Paznanski's affidavit 
confirmed that while her father was alive he would have been able 
to protect her from the pervasive practice of F.G.M. but that after 
his death he aunt would have been able to dictate both the F.G.M. 
and the marriage. Professor Paznanski also affirmed that it was 
likely that once her mother was banished, Ms. Kasinga would 
respect her aunt's authority and not try to establish contact with 
her.  
 
Because the Immigration Judge's adverse 
credibility finding is not supported by the record, this Board should 
reverse it and find Ms. Kasinga to be credible. The I.N.S. argues 
that the case should be remanded to the Immigration Judge for him 
to make a credibility determination based on the new evidence 
submitted.  
 
However, there is no reason to remand this case to a Judge who 
ignored the evidence in the record and relied upon impermissible 
and irrelevant factors in denying credibility. It is more appropriate 
for this Board to decide the issue de novo taking into consideration 
the affidavits which were submitted.  
 
Mr. Schmidt: Professor Musalo, if I may?  
 
Ms. Musalo: Yes. 
 
Mr. Schmidt: If you're right as you argue and the credibility 
findings were totally unsupported, then is there any reason why the 
Board should look at any of the new evidence or the additional 
evidence submitted on appeal?  
 
Would we have to do that at all in your view?  
 
Ms. Musalo: My -- yes, Your Honor, my position is that the 
credibility of the applicant is established on the record as it existed 
before we supplemented it with Ms. Kasinga's affidavit and with 
Professor Paznanski's affidavit. But that for the limited purpose of 
responding to what we, feel was an illegitimate ruling by the 
Judge, we submitted additional information.  
 
Mr. Schmidt: So are you saying that your additional information is 
merely cumulative in nature? Is there anything new --  
 
Ms. Musalo: I think I 
 
Mr. Schmidt: -- in there that wasn't already approved in your view 
before the Judge?  
 
Ms. Musalo: Your Honor, the way that I would state it would be 
that credibility has been established through the consistency of Ms. 
Kasinga in telling her story and the corroboration of the two letters 
from her mother, the marriage certificate, the wedding photographs 
and-the documentation confirming the practice of F.G.M. in Togo.  
 
Of course, the additional information is useful but really the point 
is that this Board could and should find Ms. Kasinga credible on 
the record that was before the Immigration Judge without 
considering the additional evidence.  
 
Mr. Schmidt: I'm asking the questions because both parties devoted 
a significant amount of briefing time to the question of whether we 
can consider the evidence and as I hear your argument, you're 
arguing that the answer's clear even without that evidence.  
 
Ms. Musalo: Yes. Yes. Yes. 
 
Mr. Schmidt: Okay. Thank you. 
 
Ms. Musalo: One other point that I'd like to make about the remand 
is that the remand of this case for the Immigration Judge to 
consider the new evidence is simply that the I.N.S. has taken the 
position -- a blanket position -- that the Board cannot accept and 
consider new evidence but must remand to the Immigration Judge. 
But the I.N.S. really cites no cases which support this assertion; 
and to the contrary, there are a number of cases both at the Board 
and Federal Court level as well as in a well respected treatise 
Gordon and Mailman, (phonetic sp.) that say to the contrary.  
 
Now, clearly, the preferred practice at the Board is for the party 
wishing to submit additional evidence to make a motion to remand 
or a motion to reopen, but this Board certainly has accepted and 
considered new evidence and I just wanted to highlight that 
particular point.  
 
Now, I would like to turn to the question of Ms. Kasinga's 
eligibility for a requested relief.  
 
Although the I.N.S. appears to agree that if Ms. Kasinga is 
credible, she qualifies for relief, it's analysis is not consistent with 
developing asylum jurisprudence. In other words, I agree with the 
end destination but not with the route taken to get there. Permit me 
to share my analysis with you. vail in a claim for asylum or  
 
In order to prevail in a claim for asylum or withholding of 
deportation, the applicant must meet three requirements. She must 
establish a type of harm. For asylum, the harm is persecution. For 
withholding, the harm is a threat to life or freedom. She must show 
the requisite likelihood of harm. For asylum, past or a well-
founded fear of future; for withholding, a more likely than not or a 
clear probability; and she must show that the persecution or the 
threat to her life or freedom is inflicted because of one of the five 
enumerated grounds. The race, religion, nationality, political 
opinion, or membership in a particular social group.  
 
As to the first element that the harm must constitute a threat to life 
or freedom or rise to: the level of persecution, there is no doubt 
that female genital mutilation as practiced among the members of 
Ms. Kasinga's tribe, clearly constitutes a threat to life or freedom 
and a fortiori constitutes persecution. The U.N. Handbook also 
affirms the concept that a threat to life or freedom always 
constitutes persecution.  
 
The I.N.S. argues that in order for a harm such as F.G.M. to 
constitute persecution, the harm must be inflicted with a punitive 
or malignant intent. In its brief, the I.N.S. contends that those who 
inflict F.G.M. generally have benign motives, which according to 
the I.N.S. complicates the characterization of F.G.M. as 
persecution. This argument is simply wrong. In stating that in order 
for harm to be persecution, it must be inflicted with a punitive or 
malignant intent, the I.N.S. confuses and conflates the concept of 
persecution with the on account of nexus requirement of the 
statute. The severity of a harm goes towards a harm's 
characterization of persecution or not while the intent or 
motivation of the persecutor goes toward the on account of issue.  
 
The cases which the I.N.S. itself cites 
demonstrates that this is clearly the case. For instance, the I.N.S. 
cites Shalong v. INS and Osaghae v. INS, both of which discuss 
persecution as the infliction of harm for racial, religious, or 
political reasons. Though the intent is the intent that goes to on 
account of. Thus, whether or not -- the question of intent goes not 
to the issue whether a harm is persecution or a threat to life or 
freedom within the meaning of the statute, but to the question 
whether the fear of harm in on account of one of the enumerated 
grounds.  
 
The Supreme Court held in INS v. Zacarias that in order to 
establish that the harm is on account of one of the enumerated 
grounds, the applicant must show that the persecutor intended to 
inflict the harm because of the applicant's race, religion, 
nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social 
group.  
 
It is clear from Zacarias that it is not necessary that the persecutor 
act with a-malignant or punitive intent. It is only necessary that the 
persecutor targets his victims because of one of the five 
enumerated grounds.  
 
If a punitive or malignant intent were required to prove persecution 
on account of the subjective beliefs of a persecutor, no matter how 
misguided, could deprive the victim of refugee protection. The 
results would be cruel and absurd and I would like to give you an 
example of what I mean by that.  
 
For example, imagine a society where the majority race believed 
that the minority race were inferior; and that they could only be 
purified by physical deprivation and punishment. Imagine further 
that the minority race were brainwashed into believing that the 
deprivation and punishment was for their own good. Imagine a 
particular victim from the minority race who did not believe she 
needed such punishment and purification. Would her claim of 
persecution on account of race be defeated by the persecutor's 
assertion that his intentions were benign rather than punitive or 
malignant?  
 
Now, let us bring the example closer to home. Imagine a society 
where the men believe that the women are inferior and tend 
towards promiscuity; and that they can only be controlled and 
purified by cutting out their genitals. Imagine further that the 
women are brainwashed into believing that this mutilation is for 
their own good. Imagine a particular female victim who did not 
believe she should be subjected to such mutilation. Should her 
claim be defeated by the assertion that the mutilators only wish her 
well? I think not.  
 
Whether or not the mutilators in Togo act with a benign intent, 
which I would question because there is much in the record which 
shows the societal context in which F.G.M. takes place, but I don't 
want to use up my time discussing those at this point; but whether 
or not the mutilators in Togo act with a benign intent, the harm 
which they inflict is persecution and in Ms. Kasinga's case it is 
inflicted on account of social group membership as defined by 
gender and tribal affiliation.  
 
Mr. Schmidt: Ms. Musalo, Professor -- hasn't the Government 
agreed with you that in this particular case that even if the intent 
were benign, it would be persecution? That's how I read their brief.  
 
Ms. Musalo: Chairman Schmidt, I agree with you but in this case, 
the I.N.S. has made a lot of fanfare around the issue of creating a 
framework and I disagree with them in that they want the 
framework to extend to cases and facts that are not implicated in 
this case. But I do believe --  
 
Mr. Schmidt: But didn't you argue that we didn't have to decide the 
whole framework to answer this case?  
 
Ms, Musalo:; That's correct but what -- the reason that I feel it's 
important to address the analysis that is appropriate in this case is 
because of my interest in developing a framework that's 
appropriate and consistent wit asylum jurisprudence. And I believe  
 
Mr. Schmidt: So -- so we should accept -- we should go beyond 
what we need to do for your framework but not for the 
Government's framework?  
 
Ms. Musalo: No, Chairman Schmidt, what I'm saying is that in 
analyzing Ms. Kasinga's case, we can draw on traditional 
principles of asylum jurisprudence and I would like to articulate 
those so that we don't end up with simply a result in her case; but 
it's very clear what the-analysis is, and I really think this conflation 
or making the issue of persecution require a malignant or punitive 
intent is a very wrong direction to go and that I feel it's important 
to clarify it in the context of this case.  
 
So I do not invite you to go beyond what you need -- where you 
need to go. But I simply encourage you to look at the definition -- 
it's the Refugee Act definition and look at it in the context of 
developing asylum jurisprudence.  
 
Ms. Rosenberg: Well, can't -- Mr. Chairman, if I may -- Counsel, -- 
are you suggesting that it doesn't matter what the motive is that is 
triggering the infliction of harm on your client?  
 
Ms. Musalo: I'm not suggesting -- what I'm suggesting is twofold: 
that in order to determine whether or not a harm is persecution 
within the meaning of the statute, we don't look to motive; we look 
to the severity of the harm and the question of motive or intent 
goes to the on account of analysis of which there's a clearly 
developing line of cases which I think the Supreme Court made a 
large contribution to in the Zacarias case, and that Zacarias does 
not require a punitive or malignant intent.  
 
It simply requires that the persecutor be motivate or chooses or 
targets the victim because of their identification or their belief or 
their -- put it this way targets them because of their beliefs or status 
as defined by the five enumerated grounds.  
 
Ms. Rosenberg: But you would have no objection in this case if we 
were to find that the imposition of F.G.M. was a form of 
subjugation of women, would you not?  
 
Ms. Musalo: I would have no problem with that and the only point 
that I'm making is that the way in which the definition of 
persecution has developed in asylum jurisprudence, it does not -- 
that part of the -- that there are three prongs and that part of the 
prong does not require a finding of malignant or punitive intent. 
That's the only point that I am very -- very -- trying to be very clear 
about.  
 
Mr. Filppu: Counsel; does your argument depend on the way in 
which this is performed? There is some indication in the record 
that in a very small percentage of cases, there may be a surgical 
procedure performed in what we might consider a hospital or some 
kind of clinic under anesthesia. Would that matter to your 
argument about whether it amounts to persecution -- whether the 
harm is severe enough?  
 
Ms. Musalo: If we look at the facts of what female genital 
mutilation is generally understood to be, that one of its mildest 
forms is the removal of the entire clitoris of the woman, which the 
analog in a male would be the amputation of most of the penis, and 
clearly whether you do that under anesthesia or not, it is 
persecution of the individual.  
 
Mr. Filppu: So the way in which it -- the brutality of the act in its 
most common form doesn't really matter to your case?  
 
Ms. Musalo: The -- well, it -- the brutality matters. It adds to the 
fact that this is such an egregious practice but I don't think you 
need to have the extreme ends of it to say that it's persecution.  
That would really be my response.  
 
I know I'm running out of my time and so I want to make one or 
two more points so that I can save at least five minutes for rebuttal.  
 
Mr. Schmidt: You have about 10 minutes left.  
 
Ms. Musalo: I have about 10 minutes? Well, thank you. You're 
keeping better track that I am. I appreciate that.  
 
Now, I wanted to get into the on account of issue and to say that in 
Ms. Kasinga's case, the harm is inflicted on account of social group 
membership as defined by gender and tribal affiliation. As this 
Board held as early as 1985, in Acosta, a social group may be 
defined by characteristics which are either immutable or so 
fundamental that the individual ought not be required to change 
them.  
 
The Board in Acosta specifically mentioned gender as a paradigm 
of the type of immutable characteristic which could define a social 
group. Both the Third and the Eighth Circuit Courts of Appeal 
have affirmed that persecution inflicted because of gender can 
constitute social group persecution. The Third Circuit affirmed this 
principle in Fatin (phonetic sp.) and the Eight Circuit in Safai 
(phonetic sp.).  
 
The Immigration Judge appeared to be oblivious to Acosta and the 
line of cases accepting gender persecution as social group 
persecution. Instead, he compared Ms. Kasinga' case to Matter of 
Chang, which is not a gender case. Matter of Chang involved the 
claim of a male applicant who did not want to submit to coercive 
family planning practices in the People's Republic of China, which 
were imposed on men and women alike. In Chang, the Board ruled 
that the men and women who disagreed with coercive family 
planning did not constitute a particular social group.  
 
Because Matter of Chang involved a practice which was inflicted 
on men and women alike, it is inapplicable to a claim involving 
persecution which is inflicted solely on the basis of gender. F.G.M. 
is inflicted only on women. There is no analogous procedure 
inflicted upon men.  
 
Existing case law clearly supports the granting of relief to Ms. 
Kasinga. The harm of F.G.M. which she fled is a threat to her life 
or freedom and, undoubtedly, constitutes persecution. It is inflicted 
because of her social group membership as defined by the 
immutable characteristics of gender and tribe.  
 
Furthermore, the evidence demonstrates that this harm is more 
likely than not should she be returned to Togo. Ms. Kasinga is a 
young woman in a patriarchal society with no one to protect her. 
The powerful man who is legally her husband demands that she be 
mutilated. There is little doubt about the fate that awaits her in her 
home country. The Board should reverse the Immigration Judge 
and grant her the requested relief.  
 
Finally, I have one last point which I feel is critical to make. The 
case before you involves a narrow legal issue whether a woman 
who will be subjected to F.G.M. and forced polygamy qualifies for 
relief under the Refugee Act. The I.N.S. is not content to have the 
Board decide this narrow issue. In his brief and in public 
statements, the General Counsel has proposed that the Board 
address not only Ms. Kasinga's eligibility but that it develop a 
framework to determine the eligibility of potential claimants whose 
cases pose distinctly different facts.  
 
Mr. Martin invites the Board to rule that women who have already 
suffered mutilation are not eligible for relief. He also asks the 
Board to rule that women who are subjected to ostracism or 
economic pressures for refusing F.G.M. are not eligible. The 
General Counsel's request is inappropriate. A judicial body such as 
the Board has the role of deciding a case on the record before it.  
 
Ms. Kasinga had not already been mutilated. Nowhere in the 
record is there the least evidence that she could resist and simply 
be subjected to ostracism or economic pressure. Therefore, these 
issues are not before the Board. It would constitute an injustice to 
women asylum seekers who have been mutilated or to women who 
face ostracism or economic pressure if the Board were to foreclose 
their claims without these women having the opportunity to 
develop their records and make the cases before this Board.  
 
The Board should resist Mr. Martin's invitation to decide all the 
F.G.M. cases which are not before it. The Board is not a legislative 
body; it is a judicial body and it performs its functions best when it 
remains true to its adjudicatory role.  
 
Thank you very much. 
 
Mr. Schmidt: Thank you, Professor Musalo. You have five minutes 
left for rebuttal.  
 
Mr. Martin, you have 30 minutes, you may proceed.  
 
Mr. Martin: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to reserve 
three minutes of my time for possible --  
 
Mr. Schmidt: All right 
 
Mr. Martin: -- response. 
 
Mr. Schmidt: I'll make sure and notify you.  
 
Mr. Martin: Thank you. Mr. Chairman and members of the Board 
of Immigration Appeals, I do appreciate the opportunity to appear 
before the newly expanded Board on what I understand is the first 
time that you have met en bane. It is an appropriate occasion to do 
that. This case does present novel and difficult legal issues. It asks 
the Board to apply the law of asylum and of withholding of 
deportation to cultural practices of wide application in the home 
country. This is not a case involving the classic situations of 
persecution that are much more familiar in the Board's docket and 
the kinds of cases that the Service confronts.  
 
Classic persecution cases involving actions by dictators, for 
example, against political opponents, or particular actions that are 
directed against minority groups because of a campaign of ethnic 
hatred. This, instead, asks you to consider a practice of wide 
application within the culture of certain parts of the world.  
 
It is our submission as we've laid it out in the brief and as I will 
develop more fully in my remarks here, it is our submission that 
female genital mutilation is the kind of practice that can provide 
the basis for asylum in carefully identified circumstances. We 
submit that it should be judged persecution even if the intention of 
the actor who was subjecting the individual to -- or who might 
subject the individual to female genital mutilation or F.G.M. -- 
even if those motivations are subjectively benign.  
 
Now, ordinarily, the case law establishes quite clearly that 
persecution requires an intent to inflict harm or punishment. Ms. 
Musalo suggests that this is some sort of doctrine that we have 
somehow cooked up in this case in order to establish an exception 
in these circumstances. But our brief makes very clear that there is 
abundant case law that describes the concept of persecution as 
including a notion of malignant or punitive intent.  
 
The Board itself in the Acosta case which Ms. Musalo has relied 
on very significantly in her own presentation, describes the idea of 
persecution and it says, two significant aspects of this accepted 
construction of the term persecution were as follows; and I'll only 
read the first one. Harm or suffering had to be inflicted upon an 
individual in order to punish him for possessing a belief or 
characteristic a persecutor sought to overcome. That's consistent 
with the kinds of statements that we find in other decisions as well 
that suggest that ordinarily there is a requirement that the 
persecutor intend to inflict harm or punishment.  
 
Now, we suggest in this particular case -- we do suggest that that 
doctrine should apply in most circumstances. That is a hallmark for 
persecution; that is part of what must be looked to, to decide 
whether severe practices have the special qualitative characteristic 
that marks them as persecution. Ordinarily, that should happen. 
But we do suggest in our brief that there are certain kinds of 
practices that are so extreme that they should be regarded as 
persecution whatever may be the frame of mind of the individual 
who is engaging in the practice or subjecting the individual to that 
practice.  
 
We go further in our brief and suggest, just to outline our argument 
here, we do suggest that if the facts as developed upon remand 
suggest that Ms. Kasinga would be subjected to this practice that it 
could be held to be persecution on account of membership in a 
particular social group. We think the appropriate way to understand 
the social group in this particular case is not as broad as what Ms. 
Musalo has suggested; but, instead, should be considered young 
women of the Chamba Kunsuntu tribe who have not been 
circumcised in accordance with tribal custom. If the facts establish 
on remand that she would be subjected to this practice, we believe 
it would be performed on account of her membership in that 
particular social group.  
 
Now, we also believe there are important limits on this doctrine. 
As we have suggested that the Board should understand the 
application of asylum law to these kind of cases, it would not mean 
that all women who come from countries where female genital 
mutilation is practiced would be entitled to persecution. I believe 
that the way Ms. Musalo has set forth the doctrine that essentially 
that would be the case; that any woman who had been subjected to 
this in the past would be -- would qualify as a refugee in this 
country. I'll develop some of those limitations further later on.  
 
We believe it's very important to make sure that the doctrine is 
established to shelter here in.this country those people who risk 
forcible subjection to the practice upon return. The protection 
should focus in that fashion.  
 
Mr. Schmidt: Excuse me, Mr. Martin -- 
 
Mr. Martin: Yes. 
 
Mr. Schmidt: -- if I may -- does this case involve any claim of past 
persecution at all in any way?  
 
Mr. Martin: This case does not, to my knowledge but we believe 
it's important here to establish -- to deal with the full range of 
issues here and it's important to understand the implications of a 
particular interpretation.  
 
Mr. Schmidt: But I mean this issue isn't in the case, right?  
 
Mr. Martin: That issue is not in the case. That's correct.  
 
Mr. Schmidt: But you think we need to think about that issue in 
order to understand what we're doing in this case?  
 
Mr. Martin: Obviously, the Board -- we-would expect that the 
Board has in mind the possibility of issuing a precedent decision -- 
that's why the Board is gathered en bane.  
 
Mr. Schmidt: That's what both of you are asking us to do, I take 
that  
 
Mr. Martin: And in that case, obviously, the precedent decisions of 
the Board have wide application and are very important for 
providing guidance for Immigration Judges and for Asylum 
Officers in deciding these cases in the future. It would help to 
consider, at least here in this particular setting, whatever the Board 
may do in its opinion, to consider its application in other sorts of 
circumstances.  
 
And I really want to emphasize, we're not talking here necessarily 
about hypotheticals, as Ms. Musalo has suggested. It's very 
important in this case to recognize that the Immigration Judge 
found Ms. Kasinga not credible. We believe that that particular 
ruling should receive another look once the Board has provided 
greater elaboration with the --  
 
Mr. Schmidt: Do you agree that she was -- is she credible or not 
credible in your view?  
 
Mr. Martin: Well, we believe that that particular issue should be 
given another look once -- because it may have been influenced by 
an incomplete understanding of the doctrine as it should apply in 
these circumstances.  
 
Mr. Schmidt: But presumably when we're done with all this, the 
Board will understand the doctrine -- don't we have de novo review 
power and couldn't we just look at the record and complete this 
case? Why would we need to return that to a Judge?  
 
Mr. Martin: But you do have that power -- yes -- to make a de 
novo determination based on what was before the Immigration 
Judge. We believe that even with elaborated doctrine here that the 
matter should receive another factual look before the Immigration 
Judge. There are inconsistencies in the story. The initial asylum 
application, for example, stated that she would risk being married 
when she returned. In fact, her submission now is that she has 
already been married to the individual involved.  
 
Ms. Rosenberg: Mr. Martin, before you proceed into those alleged 
inconsistencies that may or may not be in the record, let me just 
ask you this question. I understood the statements you made a 
moment ago to suggest that this Board should consider whether or 
not the impact of our ruling in this individual case would impact 
other cases to follow and how it would impact other cases to 
follow; and I want to ask you with regard to -- at least what I 
understood to be your suggestion -- that would it make a difference 
to the Service -- are you arguing that we should reach a different 
result if, for example, we would find that this practice-was 
persecution and that it would have been persecution on anyone 
who was subjected to it? And in light of that, I'd like you to 
address whether or not you are asking us to take a position directly 
at odds with Bolanos-Hernandez and other Circuit Court cases 
which have found that the fact that a broad group of people may be 
able to benefit from our protection minimizes in any extent the 
degree of their persecution or whether that persecution is 
protected?  
 
Mr. Martin: Yes, we're not asking you to reject that particular 
position. It's a matter of defining the particular -- the doctrine as it 
applies in this particular case and part of that is a matter of 
understanding how it might apply in different factual situations as 
they might be developed in this particular case if the matter is 
remanded as we are suggesting that it should be. It's not entirely 
clear -- it was not a very ample record that was developed. 
Therefore, Ms. Musalo and her brief has made a great deal out of 
the many places in the transcript where it is recorded as inaudible, -
- we think there are a variety of reasons -- the inconsistencies in the 
record, in addition to the insufficiency of the transcript that we 
have, that would justify a remand.  
 
Now, she has also suggested -- she submitted  
 
Ms. Rosenberg: Aren't you really asking, Mr. Martin, this Board to 
give the Immigration Service another chance to defeat a case that's 
being presented below?  
 
Mr. Martin: Well, we're not asking necessarily for that. I believe 
that it is Ms. Musalo's suggestion primarily that there are grave 
deficiencies in the record. Her initia suggestion in the Board was 
that it could -- in the brief was that it could be -- those gaps could 
be filled by looking at the extensive affidavits that she has 
submitted with her brief here. It is our submission that -- first of 
all, and primarily, we hope that the Board will provide guidance on 
considering these difficult and challenging legal issues, and that we 
believe that the entire record of the case, because of various 
deficiencies in the record itself in these circumstances should ^- it 
should go back to the Immigration Judge and there should be 
another look there.  
 
Now, there may be many different things that develop upon 
remand there.  
 
Mr. Schmidt: So I assume if we -- and the case has been pending 
for quite a while -- so I assume if we sent that back then the 
Government has a specific position that she's not credible that you 
present and document at that hearing as something that we couldn't 
do here?  
 
Mr. Martin: Well, I mean there are some other -some other items 
that we believe should be looked at and that would benefit from 
additional development; such as the inconsistency between the 
asylum application and the statements on the record such as some 
further questions about  
 
Mr. Schmidt: Do you think those would 
be sufficient to deny a claim -- that 
 
Mr. Martin: Well, if -- only 
 
Mr. Schmidt: -- those are such a magnitude that those would be a 
ground to deny the claim -- assuming there is an inconsistency is it 
really material to what we're talking about here?  
 
Mr. Martin: Well, there could potentially be some that -- that are of 
that character -- I mean it clearly -- we are not suggesting that any 
inconsistency about any part of the story would be a reason to 
reject her claim. Obviously, the focus should be on what's likely to 
happen to her; what is the relationship within her family; whether 
there are other possible circumstances under which she could find 
protection in the home country.  
 
But there are matters of record here now that do raise genuine 
credibility issues. We are not saying that we are committed to an 
ultimate ruling that she is incredible. But we do think they merit 
further inquiry. Let me provide --  
 
Ms. Rosenberg: Mr. Martin, weren't you -- wasn't the Service 
given an opportunity to raise all the matters that you just suggested 
as to whether this really-would happen to her? What her 
relationship was with her family? And so on? In the first instance?  
 
Mr. Martin: Those matters were raised and the Immigration Judge 
ruled that she was not credible. That's exactly what we're arguing 
for.  
 
Ms. Rosenberg: And then isn't it for us to make the determination 
of whether or not we want to,,uphold that credibility finding?  
 
Mr. Martin: It is for you to do that but ordinarily in most 
circumstances when additional evidence is suggested like this or 
when there is doubt cast upon the credibility finding if the Board 
were to find that -- on the credibility finding of the Immigration 
Judge -- the ordinary course would be for it to be remanded. 
Particularly in a case with this thin a record as Ms. Musalo herself 
has suggested. She has suggested a number of additional avenues 
of inquiry; and I would point out to the Court, there are some 
additional matters in the record itself that were not explored before. 
We didn't have to raise those in great detail; the Judge was already 
-- the Judge did rule on the credibility in that fashion.  
 
Mr. Schmidt: -- 
 
Mr. Martin: But there is an additional matter that's attached to the 
asylum application itself, for example. It's in French. It was not 
translated-before. But it seems to even suggest on a basic element 
of her case, and this deserves some further examination, that's 
essentially a missing person notice and it is -- it says, Mr. Kasinga 
is looking for his daughter who left Togo in December of 1994.  
 
Now, there may be many explanations for that but that's a part of 
the record that Ms. Kasinga herself had added into the record. That 
at least requires some further inquiry as to the situation of her 
father.  
 
Mr. Schmidt: Well, two questions, Mr. Martin. First, my reading of 
the record is that document was there when your Trial Attorney 
tried the case so that that could have been a subject far cross-
examination. I don't remember in reading the record that there was 
any mention of that. Is that correct?  
 
Mr. Martin: That is correct. But we don't have to call attention to it 
for the Judge to take it into account. The Judge did say there was 
lack of consistency and -  
 
Mr. Schmidt: But then I also read your brief as -maybe I'm 
misreading it but I read your brief as disassociating yourself to a 
large degree from the Judge's not only legal rulings but also 
credibility rulings.  
 
Mr. Martin: Here's out -- here was our central  
 
Mr. Schmidt: If I misread that part of your brief?  
 
Mr. Martin:  Yes. Our central position-is -- to deal with the legal 
questions which we believe are essential for the Board's 
consideration here en bane in these circumstances. That is our 
central submission. We believe in light of that it is appropriate to 
remand and to consider it. We would be happy to have the Judge 
take another look at the credibility issue, and, as I say, we are not 
asserting all out that under any circumstances she should be found 
incredible.  
 
On the other hand, it's not a nullity. The Immigration Judge who 
heard the case for several hours, who had her on the witness stand, 
found questions about the credibility. Now, maybe on further 
examination those could be -- could be dealt with.  
 
Mr. Schmidt: Why couldn't we examine that? I have the transcript 
here.  
 
Mr. Martin: Well, I mean, it is -- it is within your power to do that. 
We are submitting that it is the better course under these 
circumstances to establish a clear' framework of legal doctrine and 
because -- especially because of the novelty and complexity of 
these issues, to resubmit it to the  
 
Mr. Holmes: Mr. Martin, there were three elements as I read them 
to the Immigration Judge's finding regarding a lack of credibility. 
One was internal inconsistencies which you've addressed. There 
were two other things you referenced. One was a lack of rationality 
of her story? And the other was the inherent lack of inherent 
persuasiveness of her story. What's the Government's position with 
regard to those other two elements of the Immigration Judge's 
adverse credibility finding? Do you find that there's something 
irrational about this story or something inherently unpersuasive 
about this story aside from the questions of what may have been 
some factual inconsistencies?  
 
Mr. Martin: Well, I mean I think to some extent those may address 
the factual inconsistencies to the extent that they could be more 
fully informed by their more complete understanding of practices 
in that society and of differences of practices within that particular 
culture and that perhaps is another reason why those ought to be 
looked at.  
 
Mr. Holmes: But there is a fair amount of background evidence 
submitted before the Immigration Judge regarding this practice and 
regarding this practice in Togo. I mean, when you look at that 
background evidence and this applicant's story, is there a lack of 
rationality or a lack of inherent persuasiveness to what she says?  
 
Mr. Martin: Well, there are questions about the persuasiveness here 
which would derive from the inconsistencies including the 
document that they submitted that seems to suggest-that Mr. 
Kaninga is still -- is still alive.  
 
Mr. Holmes: So your point though goes back to inconsistencies in 
her story.  
 
Mr. Martin: That would be -- that would be the central element. 
And again, I suggest that the appropriate course is for this to be 
remanded for another close look in light of the greater 
amplification -- but we certainly do not believe that the Board 
should act here upon the basis, in any way whatsoever, of 
affidavits that have been submitted with the Board.  
 
Ms. Musalo cites several cases where the Board has occasionally 
taken into account a document that was  
 
(OFF THE RECORD) 
 
(ON THE RECORD) 
 
Mr. Martin: -- submitted only upon appeal. Those have been very 
limited circumstances. Because there have been circumstances, for 
example, where it was a Library of Congress document, where it 
was a document where the Board said there could be no question 
about the authenticity of it. It would extraordinary for the Board to 
rely upon affidavits filed by someone who's been found not to be 
credible by an Immigration Judge and to suggest that that in itself 
somehow cures the finding of credibility.  
 
Ms. Rosenberg: I'm glad - 
 
Mr. Martin: We believe there should be a remand for another look 
at thin.  
 
Ms. Rosenberg: I'm glad you're raising that, Mr. Martin, because 
disregarding for a moment the affidavit of the applicant, what 
objections do you have -- is it the Service's position that Professor 
Paznanski's affidavit is not to be believed either on the grounds 
that he shouldn't have -- doesn't have the credentials that are valid 
to establish that he's an expert or -- I'd like to know exactly what it 
is that you object to that would make his affidavit less than 
competent evidence that we should review?  
 
Mr. Martin: Well, this is clearly the kind of information that could 
have been presented before -- that should have been if they wanted 
to do it. They have in no way complied with the requirements of a 
Motion to Reopen, no shown why this was unavailable to begin 
with. Moreover, this is exactly the kind of situation where we 
would like an opportunity to test it through cross-examination. We 
think that we're entitled to that before the Board would rely on it. 
And he may very well be a fine expert on that. I am no trying to 
cast any doubt on him but I have not met him. All I know from him 
is what -- we have on the cold paper.  
 
Now, I would like to return to the legal argument because that 
really, I believe is crucial here. We do submit that there are issues 
of credibility that should be addressed on remand. But on the legal 
doctrine, we -- it is our submission -- as I was indicating earlier -- 
that-persecution usually means deliberate infliction of suffering or 
harm. It's often equated with punishment and I have provided with 
you some -- provided you with some quotes from Circuit Court 
decisions and also from the Board's own decision such as in 
Acosta.  
 
We believe, however, that with a -- we agree with that as the usual 
standard for judging whether or not a particular practice is 
persecution. But for a small category of cases, that particular factor 
should be overridden. When the practice is so extreme as to shock 
the conscience of a great part of the world community and of the 
people in the receiving society, then the victim's perspective must 
predominate and her perception of the practice as the infliction of 
suffering or harm or punishment should prevail.  
 
Now, if the facts as established on remand suggest that she would 
be subjected to this, we believe that female genital mutilation is 
one of the most extreme forms of this practice certainly should be 
held to meet this test. We recognize that a shock the conscience 
test may be a difficult one. It is not -- it does not give precise 
guidelines. It is meant to set the bar high. It's not just any practice 
that arouses a certain amount of objection in the receiving society.  
 
We believe there are also certain objective indicia that could be 
looked to and in this particular case, we've cited in our brief, and so 
has Ms. Musalo, a wide variety of international documents that 
have condemned the practice. This has been an objective of U.S. -- 
of human rights diplomacy for many years to help curtail the 
practice, to condemn it in international forums like the Beijing 
meeting last year.  
 
And we think that although there may be some difficult cases to fit 
within that particular standard, there can be no doubt that this is an 
extreme practice and it has been judged as such by the world 
community.  
 
Mr. Holmes: Mr. Martin. 
 
Mr. Martin: Yes 
 
Mr. Holmes: At that point in your brief, you also cite again to 
Osaghae and you note that it is imposed, "for reasons that our 
country does not recognize as legitimate." But I can't find in the 
Government's brief where you articulate what the Government's 
position is as to what the reasons are that F.G.M. is imposed. Does 
the Government have a view as to why F.G.M. is imposed?  
 
Mr. Martin: Well, no. I mean, it is part of a cultural practice there. 
It's not necessarily for us to try to justify. We are trying to submit -
-  
 
Mr. Holmes:- Well, I'm not asking you to justify it. I'm asking you, 
does the Government have a position as to why this cultural 
practice is imposed?  
 
Mr. Martin: -- no, we -- we do not. But we -- we are at a loss to 
come up with a reason that would be regarded as legitimate and -- 
and that's another reason why this particular circumstance -- the 
practice should be regarded a meeting the threshold of -- of 
shocking the conscience.  
 
Mr. Holmes: Well, some of the background evidence in front of the 
Immigration Judge, for example, characterize F.G.M. as a form of 
sexual oppression based on manipulation of women's sexuality in 
order to assure male dominance and exploitation. Does the 
Government disagree with that?  
 
Mr. Martin: Well, we indicated in our brief that -- that there are 
important sociological insights and descriptions of that kind. We 
do not think that it's necessary for us to take a position on that one 
way or another. We suggest in particular that we are not -- that the 
Board is not required to analyze the practice in those particular 
terms. Certainly, there's an element of that -of exactly what that 
description is.  
 
-- and again, it's our position that there is no particular reason that 
our society is prepared to regard as legitimate -- that's entails it 
even a practice.  
 
Mr. Holmes: But if I understood what you just said at the end 
there, there is an element of sexual oppression to assure male 
dominance that the Government will agree with that?  
 
Mr. Martin: Well, yes, sociologists have describe it in that way. 
That could be a particular element of it. We do not think though 
that -- as we indicated in our brief -- that the refugee definition or 
the asylum provisions that we're looking at here require analysis at 
that particular level. It's sufficient to find that the practice is a 
severe bodily invasion and that it rises to the level of meeting the 
threshold here so that even if it's done with subjectively benign 
intent, it should be regarded as persecution for purposes of the 
asylum standard.  
 
Mr. Holmes: Well, I understood Professor Musalo to argue that her 
client's claim could be found to come within the refugee definition 
without the Board having to reexamine or overrule or modify 
Matter of Chang. Is that also the position of the Government?  
 
Mr. Martin: That is the position of the 
Government. Yes, we believe this is distinguishable from Matter of 
Chang.  
 
Ms. Dunne: Even though you're defining the social group by the 
act of persecution itself?  
 
Mr. Martin: No, we're not defining the social group by the act of 
persecution itself. We're defining the social group by the objective 
characteristics of the young women who have been uncircumcised 
in the -- in the -- within that particular tribe.  
 
We think that Matter of Chang can be distinguished really on three 
important grounds. First of all, the Board was prepared to accept in 
Matter of Chang that the basic underlying policy -- and we 
certainly do not challenge it -the basic underlying policy of 
controlling population in China, the most populous country of the 
world, was a legitimate purpose, an underlying legitimate purpose. 
As I've indicated, we see no purpose that our society is prepared to 
regard as legitimate in these particular circumstances.  
 
Moreover, Matter of Chang -- the decision -- the practice was 
judged to be applied evenhandedly throughout the society. Here 
this is a practice that it seems to be applied only within certain 
ethnic groups; applied only in certain based on certain 
characteristics of both gender and tribe within Togo. And, thirdly, 
and importantly, -- in Matter of Chang, there were potentially other 
ways in which someone could comply with the law and have only 
one child in the family. We suggest here, -- and this is an important 
point that I have not really had a chance up till now to emphasize, -
- we suggest here that this kind of protection should apply in these 
circumstances for people who don't have a choice, who can 
establish that the would be forcibly subjected to this upon return. 
There is no alternative.  
 
Now, that's exactly why I think it is important to consider the kinds 
of matters that Ms. Musalo rejected as hypotheticals for as dictum 
in our submission. It is -- the asylum protection should be there for 
people who would be subjected to this practice against their 
consent. If there are other alternatives for protection within the 
country, then that's a matter that probably should be developed 
further on remand but the Judge made a specific finding on that 
and, in any case, -- then there are other forms of protection and it 
would not justify a finding that there is a well-founded fear of 
persecution -  
 
Mr. Filppu: If I may follow up, Counsel, on a question that the 
Vice Chairman asked with regard to the social group definition that 
you have offered. It does seem that there is some element of 
defining the social group against the persecution, at least in terms 
of the way I read the briefs of both parties. And I asked in that 
regard for what other societal purpose does this particular social 
group that you've defined exist? You said it's not defined against 
the persecution. For what other purpose does the society recognize 
that group? The one you've defined.  
 
Mr. Martin: Well, no, I -- I mean I -- perhaps I misunderstood the 
earlier question but it's not -- it's not defined simply in terms of the 
practice and those who oppose the particular practice. That was a 
matter that was -- an issue that was raised in Matter of Chang. In 
theme particular circumstances -- it is -- it is a group that has social 
and behavioral reality and it happens to be the important 
characteristic that is picked out -- in certain circumstances where 
this happens -- that it is picked out as the basis for visiting this 
particular practice on the individuals. It's -- it is under the 
submissions here and if they're found to be borne out on remand, it 
is visited upon young women of this particular ethnic group who 
have not been circumcised in accordance with tribal custom.  
 
Ms. Dunne: But the circumcision is critical to definition of the 
group. I mean, you're not including in group women who have 
been circumcised. Just the uncircumcised.  
 
Mr. Martin: Well, that's right. In these particular circumstances, 
yes. The practice -- the persecution would happen on account of 
their membership in that particular social group. Now, the practice 
that -- let me finish one earlier point and come also to -- to the 
issue about -- about past -- people who have been subjected to this 
in the past.  
 
I mentioned that there may be other possibilities for protection 
elsewhere in the country. That's an issue that should be explored. 
We want to protect people who would be forcibly subjected to this 
practice if they will return to their home country; but if they have 
an alternative mode of protection within that country, then that's a 
relevant basis as cases like Matter of Fuentes establish for --  
 
Ms. Rosenberg: What's your view of the standard of the -- what is 
your view of the standard or obligation that would be imposed 
upon an applicant to show that that individual would not be subject 
to this kind of harm or mutilation on a countrywide basis? What 
are you proposing that we adopt?  
 
Mr. Martin: Well, I mean that's 
 
Mr. Schmidt: Mr. Martin, before you answer, you're at the five 
minute mark now.  
 
Mr. Martin: Okay. Fine. 
 
That's a clear example of the kind of situation that should be 
answered by country conditions information; could be developed 
from human rights reports from the State Department Country 
Report and also whatever light can be she upon it by the testimony 
of the individual or anybody else -from that society. Perhaps an 
expert, Mr. Paznanski, might be able to testify to that sort of an 
issue.  
 
We don't want to impose an impossible standard on that. You don't 
have to negate all possible possibilities but there should be a 
reasonable inquiry into that--  
 
Ms. Rosenberg: But isn't it true that the U.N. Handbook states that 
the way to examine the possibility of avoiding the harm is whether 
it's reasonably appropriate to expect the individual to relocate 
within the country?  
 
Mr. Martin: Well, yes, of course. I mean, it depends -- if the 
circumstances of relocation are only in some remote area where 
essentially the person has no prospect of anything but sickening 
and dying early, that's not a reasonable alternative within the 
country. But, we do think -- I mean it's important to understand 
here -- we are talking about protection in this country. We're not 
talking about broad issues of human rights concerns. That extends 
much more expansively than the particulars of asylum doctrine.  
 
So it has to be applied with some notion of reasonableness there 
but there does need to be some inquiry into that particular issue.  
 
Mr. Schmidt: Going into reasonableness, wasn't there testimony at 
this hearing below that she would be in danger anywhere in the 
country and wasn't there a Group Exhibit 4 which contained 
information both from your resource center and the State 
Department indicating that this practice is widespread in Togo and 
that the Government, while not particularly addressing female 
genital mutilation that the government of Togo generally hasn't 
demonstrated much interest in protecting women from any types of 
abuses and wouldn't that be sufficient for somebody to find that 
this is a countrywide threat?  
 
Mr. Martin: Well, that's exactly the kind of information, yes.  
 
Mr. Schmidt: But it's there. Yeah, I - 
 
Mr. Martin: It should be looked to - 
 
Mr. Schmidt: -- read it this morning. It's there.  
 
Mr. Martin: -- in making a decision. Well, the Immigration Judge, 
however, based upon that -- presumably looking at that and also 
the specifics of the questioning of the individual found that there 
had not been adequate inquiry into the possibility of going 
elsewhere.  
 
Mr. Schmidt: But I'm not bound -- but this Board isn't bound by 
the Immigration Judge's finding. We have de novo --  
 
Mr. Martin: There is also evi- -- 
 
Mr. Schmidt: -- review authority. 
 
Mr. Martin: There's also evidence in the record that it is 
approximately 50 percent of the women in Togo who have been 
circumcised. So I mean that -- that suggests some reason to look 
more closely at the particulars of this -- of this individual case.  
 
Mr. Schmidt: Well, 50 percent is a pretty large number, isn't it?  
 
Mr. Martin: It is a large number and we -- I mean, our submission 
is this -- this could very well be the basis for a valid claim of 
political asylum but there are unanswered factual issues that should 
be examined on remand after an elaboration of --  
 
Mr. Schmidt: I mean, the standard for asylum is just what a 
reasonable likelihood -- what a reasonable person -- I would think 
50 percent is well within that standard.  
 
Mr. Martin: Well, I do not mean to suggest that that goes to the 
well-founded fear issue in that particular respect as it was 
developed, for example in Cardoza-Fonseca. But if there are 
internal flight alternatives, cases like Matter of Fuentes suggest 
that that should be examined.  
 
Mr. Schmidt: You're at your three minute mark.  
 
Mr. Martin: Okay, I will take one more minute to close out a 
couple of additional points. One of them we've been criticized for 
asking the Board to look at hypothetical cases involving ostracism 
or social pressure. We do not know -- but again because we submit 
that the case should be returned to the Immigration Judge for 
further fact finding. This may not be a hypothetical.  
 
The protection of asylum should be reserved for those who are 
severely at risk upon return. Now, I do not want to be understood 
on that. Anyone who is subjected to social pressure or ostracism 
that is intended to force them into undergoing this procedure, that 
is a matter of human rights concern. That is something to which the 
Federal Government has objected. It has been an important part of 
our human rights diplomacy everywhere.  
 
But the Board is asked to apply the specifics of the asylum and 
withholding standards. That must be reserved for people who 
really need the protection and although we would object to 
ostracism or social pressure here, if that's all they're being sent 
back to, there is a choice. It would be like Matter of Chang. But if, 
on the other hand, would be forcibly subjected to it, there should 
be protection in these circumstances for people who would be 
potential victims of F.G.M.  
 
Finally, I just want to mention that there are other important limits 
on this that we suggest in the brief and are more elaborated there in 
terms of understanding either the shock a conscience test or the 
application of this in the past.  
 
The bodily invasions are likely to meet the shock a conscience test 
but when they are visited upon unconsenting individuals and, 
therefore, we think if -- for the practice -- if the practice were 
visited upon someone at a time when they consented to it, that 
would not have the special invidious quality that makes for 
persecution so the past persecution analysis would not apply.  
 
The protection should be available for people who have a serious 
risk of being forcibly subjected to F.G.M. upon return. We ask you 
to elaborate the document as we have suggested here and remand 
the case to the Immigration Judge for further development in light 
of the Board's standards.  
 
Thank you very much. 
 
Mr. Schmidt: Thank you, Mr. Martin and you have about 
approximately two minutes left for rebuttal.  
 
Mr. Martin: Thank you. 
 
Mr. Schmidt: Professor Musalo, you have five minutes for rebuttal.  
 
Ms. Musalo: Thank you. There is a record in this case and there is 
a clear legal standard for reviewing the credibility finding of the 
Judge. And there is -- it is very clear what the Judge's reasons were 
for finding Ms. Kasinga not credible and we can look at each of 
those reasons and see if there's evidence in the record which is 
what I addressed when I listed the different reasons that the Judge 
relied upon and how none of them were supported by the record.  
 
What the I.N.S. has done is to try to raise some additional grounds 
of lack of credibility but these are also so tangential and so -- I 
think transparently -- almost absurd -- to say that an individual who 
is forced into marriage is being inconsistent when at sometime she 
says, if I go back, I'll be forced to marry; and at other times she 
says, I have been married. I mean, a person who is forced to do 
something isn't going to refer to their husband as their husband and 
isn't going to return to -- refer to a shotgun marriage as a marriage.  
 
I think that is very explicable that at times she has said, I was 
forced to marry. And at other times she says, if I'm forced to go 
back, I'll have to marry. And this -- the other thing that's always 
been raised by the I.N.S. is this whole relationship with this 
German woman at the airport or the issue of Ms. Kasinga couldn't 
explain who performs F.G.M. These are things that don't go to 
credibility. They simply don't.  
 
She has testified she was protected from the practice. The fact that 
she would be inconsistent in describing how F.G.M. was 
performed simply doesn't go to credibility. So again I just would 
like to -- to, you know, emphasize the point that we do have a 
record. We do have a legal standard for evaluating the credibility 
determination of a Judge and clearly there is no substantial 
evidence to support the Judge's adverse credibility finding, period.  
 
Then the I.N.S. seizes upon the issue of this possibility of internal 
flight alternative and I think as Board Member Holmes, or Your 
Honor, mentioned that there was a record that addressed that very 
issue. If we look at Group Exhibit 4, there's quite a bit on the 
inability to relocate.  
 
The Judge simply did not read the record. It is patently apparent 
that this Judge did not look at the record and he just simply should 
not be given another ---another bite at the apple at my client's 
expense. He refers to sterilization at the beginning of the hearing 
when he refers to the documentation that was submitted.  
 
He asked the Counsel representing Ms. Kasinga, what is F.G.M.? It 
is inconceivable that any Judge that could have read this record 
could ask, what is F.G.M.? F.G.M. is all over this record in terms 
of Group Exhibit 4 and its discussion and simply is no reason to 
send it back to him to look at what he did -- since he abdicated his 
responsibility in the first place to carefully and conscientiously 
evaluate the evidence and make a determination.  
 
The Judge also failed to be aware of cases that are directly on 
point, such as the Fatin (phonetic sp.) case in the Third Circuit 
which directly addresses the issue of practices which were imposed 
on individuals because of their gender and lays out a test for the 
application -- or for the evaluation of a claim which raises gender 
as a social group characteristic. The Judge didn't mention Fatin.  
 
I think that there are so many things that the Judge didn't do that he 
should have done then that there's really no reason to send it back 
to him.  
 
Finally, I wanted to make one other point and it really -- this 
follows up on a point raised by one of the Honorable Board 
Members and I don't remember which one of you raised this but 
the record is very -- there is much evidence in the record to explain 
the reason why F.G.M. is inflicted and I just want to remind a few 
of you of what I know you've already reviewed. The report by 
Nehid Tobia (phonetic sp.) talks about the fact that the practice of 
F.G.M. is purely for the purpose of gender subjugation and the 
perpetuation of social injustice at Page 16.  
 
At Page 18, her report says, although nearly all society subjugate 
women in some way, F.G.M. is the most drastic measure taken by 
any society to control women's sexuality and reproduction.  
 
And on Page 35 of that same report, it says, in the few studies on 
the subject when researchers asked men and women why they 
performed genital mutilation, the answers were surprising clear 
about the patriarchal underpinnings of the practice and the ways in 
which women came to accept their secondary status. A constant 
reiterated theme was inferiority of women. A fact both men and 
women seem to accept.  
 
And there -- I think looking at this, it's very clear the societal 
context in which this practice takes place and I would beg to 
disagree with the General Counsel when he says that the societal 
context is irrelevant.  
 
I think in political asylum claims, the 
societal and political context-is the very texture in which the 
claims must be evaluated. If we evaluate a claim of race 
discrimination or persecution on account of race, we need to know 
the societal attitudes towards that race. And if we're talking about 
persecution on account of gender, we must know the societal 
attitudes towards gender. So I think it's simply is to me 
incomprehensible to argue that the societal reasons underlying a 
practice are irrelevant in a claim of this nature.  
 
Mr. Schmidt: Thank you, Professor Musalo.  
 
Ms. Musalo: Thank you. 
 
Mr. Schmidt: Mr. Martin, you have two minutes.  
 
Mr. Martin: Thank you. Perhaps I've been misunderstood, the 
social context -- the societal context -is certainly relevant.  It needs 
to be looked at here. That's exactly part of what we're suggesting 
here. We urge the Board to establish doctrine that points the Fact-
finders in exactly that direction and to examine it closely in the 
context of the society in which it arises.  
 
Most of what Ms. Musalo had spoken to on rebuttal went to 
credibility. We believe that particularly with a record that has the 
gaps and the inaudibles that are presented here, that it is not 
appropriate and it is not wise -- although we do not doubt the 
Board's power -- it is not appropriate in this kind of a case to make 
the factual determinations here.  
 
This is a situation that calls out for further inquiry and we do 
believe that the Board can establish doctrine that will help very 
importantly to guide that kind of inquiry and to help to sensitize 
those who are the Decision-makers in these cases to the kinds of 
cross-cultural determinations that have to be taken into account 
here.  
 
We believe that's important in these circumstances. We do urge 
you to adopt doctrine as we have suggested -- that F.G.M. could be 
the basis for a political asylum claim but within certain narrow and 
carefully defined limits. And then we urge you to remand it for 
further inquiry into credibility and other -- potential other factual 
matters upon remand to an Immigration Judge.  
 
Thank you very much. 
 
Mr. Schmidt: Thank you, Mr. Martin. And thank you, Professor 
Musalo. I thank both of you for your enlightening and outstanding 
arguments. The Board will take this matter under consideration. 
We will advise you of our Decision in writing.  
 
This hearing is now adjourned.

CIVIL ACTION NO:


COMPLAINT

The plaintiffs, Harvey Thomas Gardner and Jason Thomas Gardner, by
Harvey Thomas Gardner, next friend, by counsel, file this complaint
and say as follows:

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1.   Original jurisdiction is conferred upon this Court by title 28
United States Code, section 1343(3) as this complaint sufficiently
alleges state action subjecting the plaintiffs to actual deprivation
of civil rights guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to
the Constitution of the United States and arising under the Civil
Rights Act. 42 U.S.C. Section 1983. Jurisdiction of this Court is also
invoked pursuant to federal question subject matter under 28 U.S.C.
Section 1331. This court has jurisdiction over all claims arising from
Virginia state and common law through supplemental jurisdiction
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1367(a). All claims in this complaint
arise from the same set of operative facts and thus form part of the
same case or controversy under Article III of the United States
Constitution.

2.   Venue lies in the Western District of Virginia under 28 U.S.C.
Section 1391, the causes of action set forth herein having arisen in
the County of Bedford, Virginia, within this judicial district, and
wherein the plaintiffs and all defendants reside.

PARTIES

3.   Plaintiff Harvey Thomas Gardner (hereinafter referred to as
"Father") is, and at all times mentioned in this complaint was, a
resident of Bedford County, Virginia and custodial parent of Plaintiff
Jason Thomas Gardner (hereinafter referred to as "Student"), a student
attending Montvale Elementary School.

4.   Plaintiff Jason Thomas Gardner is, and at all times mentioned in
this complaint was, a nine-year-old student attending Montvale
Elementary School in Bedford County, presently assigned to defendant
Bruce Bays' fourth grade free reading period. Plaintiff Jason Thomas
Gardner is the son of plaintiff Harvey Thomas Gardner and brings this
action through plaintiff Harvey Thomas Gardner.

5.   Defendant Bruce Bays (hereinafter referred to as "Teacher") is,
and at all times mentioned in this complaint was, a teacher at
Montvale Elementary School and is sued in his official capacity as
such teacher. As a teacher at Montvale Elementary School, defendant
Bruce Bays is responsible for monitoring Student's Free Reading
Period.


6.   Defendant Ronald Mason (hereinafter referred to as "Principal")
is, and at all times mentioned in this complaint was, the principal of
Montvale Elementary School and is sued in his official capacity as
such principal. As principal of Montvale Elementary School, defendant
Ronald Mason is responsible for implementing policies set down by the
Bedford County School Board as well as overseeing day to day
administration of Montvale Elementary School.

7.   Defendant John A. Kent, Ph.D. (hereinafter referred to as
"Superintendent") is, and at all times mentioned in this complaint
was, the superintendent of Schools for Bedford County and is sued in
his official capacity as such superintendent. As superintendent, he
oversees the Bedford school system, setting policy and procedures in
schools including Montvale Elementary School.

8.   Defendant Bedford County School Board is sued in its capacity as
the governing body of the Bedford County school system and
specifically Montvale Elementary School, establishing school policy
and curriculum.

9.   Defendant Elizabeth A. Bailey is, and at all times mentioned in
this complaint was, chairman of the Bedford County School Board and is
sued in her official capacity as such member.

10.  Defendant Shirley B. McCabe is, and at all times mentioned in
this complaint was, vice-chairman of the Bedford County School Board
and is sued in her official capacity as such member.

11.  Defendant Wesley P. Gordon, Jr. is, and at all times mentioned in
this complaint was, a member of the Bedford County School Board and is
sued in his official capacity as such member.

12.  Defendant Billy R. Tuck is, and at all times mentioned in this

16.  Defendant Stanley W. Butler is, and at all times mentioned in
this complaint was, a member of the Bedford County School Board and is
sued in his official capacity as such member.

17.  An actual and substantial controversy exists between plaintiffs
and defendants. Plaintiffs contend that Student's First Amendment
rights to free speech and to receive information were and continue to
be deprived by defendants taking possession of the Book, refusing to
return possession of the Book to Student, and by refusing to let
Student read the Book during Free Reading Period. Plaintiffs further
contend that Father's constitutional right to rear and educate his
child is infringed by the same actions. Upon information and belief,
defendants deny that their actions are unconstitutional and intend to
prevent Student from re-gaining possession of the Book and from
reading the Book during Free Reading Period. A declaration is
necessary to resolve this conflict.


COUNT ONE - FIRST AMENDMENT

18.  In his class, defendant Teacher includes a fourth grade Free
Reading Period in which students bring to school books of their own
choosing, without teacher pre-approval, for private, silent reading.

19.  By establishing a free reading period in which Student was given
discretion in choosing reading material, defendants created and
afforded Student a constitutional First Amendment right to receive
information from the literary source of his choosing during the Free
Reading Period.

20.  On or about May 16, 1996, plaintiff Jason Thomas Gardner brought
in the book, The Way Things Ought To Be (hereinafter referred to as
the "Book"), written by Rush Limbaugh. Student read the Book in his
Fourth Grade Free Reading Period and in accordance with the rules of
Free Reading Period.

21.  During the Free Reading Period on May 16, 1996, defendant Teacher
seized the Book from Student, preventing Student from continuing to
read the Book for the duration of the period.

22.  Defendant Teacher inquired and was informed by the Student that
he had parental permission to possess and read the Book.

23.  Defendant Teacher then turned possession of the Book over to
Principal.

24.  Principal contacted Father and was informed that the Student had
Father's permission to possess and read the Book.

25.  Father wrote a letter delivered to Principal requesting that the
Book be returned to his son.

26.  Defendant Principal refused and continues to refuse to return
possession of the Book to Student, from whom the Book was seized.

27.  At no time during free reading period did Student show the book
to any other student, communicate the Book's contents, or in any way
create a disturbance.

28.  No substantial government interest was served by terminating
Student's possession of the Book.

29.  The Book is a work of at least some value that would have no
harmful effect on the Student or any other person attending Montvale
Elementary School.

30.  Access to and reading the Book promotes free thinking and public
exchange of ideas, regardless of whether one agrees or disagrees with
its content or author. Its purpose is at the very core of free speech
constitutional protections.

31.  Montvale Elementary School, defendants Teacher and Principal are
presently in possession of the Book with no legitimate reason to
retain possession.

32.  Upon information and belief, Superintendent and the Bedford
County School Board and its members are responsible for all Montvale
Elementary School policy and procedure, and, through their acts and
omissions allowed and continue to allow the alleged constitutional
violations to occur and continue to occur.

33.  Plaintiffs request judgment against defendants as set forth
below.


COUNT TWO - PARENTAL RIGHTS

34.  Plaintiffs reallege Paragraphs 1 through 33 of this complaint as
set forth in full.

35.  Plaintiff Harvey Thomas Gardner possesses a constitutionally
protected right to raise Student, his son.

36.  Defendant's Free Reading Period allowed control over the choice
of the Student's Free Reading Period reading material be left to the
discretion of Father. Defendants had developed no curriculum
associated with the Free Reading Period, nor were pursuing any
educational goal beyond encouraging Student's interest in reading.

36.  Defendants Teacher and Principal were each informed that Student
enjoyed Father's permission to possess and read the Book.

37.  Defendants originally provided the student the right to read the
book of his choice during the Free Reading Period. Defendants
thereafter decided the book chosen by the student did not promote
Defendants' ideas and philosophies.

38.  Defendants, by taking and retaining possession of Book,
condemning the Book, and refusing to allow Student to read Book during
Free Reading Period have infringed on the Father's constitutional
right to raise his son. Defendants' actions further no educational or
disciplinary purpose; as such, defendants, as agents of the state are
constitutionally barred from contravening decisions made by a parent
concerning his child.

39.  Plaintiff Harvey Thomas Gardner requests judgment against
defendants as set forth below.

40.  Father and Student are entitled to permanent injunctive and
preliminary injunctive relief because:

a.   Each will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not
granted;

b.   Said harm outweighs possible adverse effects, if any, potentially
suffered by the respective defendants;

c.   Plaintiffs, respectively, are likely to succeed on the merits of
the case;

d.   The public interest lies with granting the relief requested.

41.  The First Amendment protects the student's access to ideas and
philosophies of all types and sources, regardless of the government's
annoyance or support of such views. Its tenants are not to limit but
to expand the student's exposure in a forum which allows examination,
and acceptance or rejection. To seize the student's book, for the
student and society, is to close the door of learning afforded by the
First Amendment and deny the very goal of education.

WHEREFORE, the plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court:

1.   Enter judgment declaring defendants' refusal to return the Book
to Student and refusal to allow Student to read the Book during Free
Reading Period unconstitutional as a violation of the right of free
speech and the right to receive information guaranteed by the First
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States as applied to the
Commonwealth of Virginia under the Fourteenth Amendment to the
Constitution of the United States.

2.   Enter judgment declaring unconstitutional defendants' refusal to
honor Father's decision that the Book is appropriate reading material
for Student's private reading in Free Reading Period, as such refusal
interferes with Father's right to rear and educate his son as
protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.

3.   Plaintiffs request this Court issue preliminary and permanent
injunctions requiring defendants to return possession of the Book to
Student and to permit Student to read the Book during Free Reading
Period.

4.   Plaintiffs further request that the Court award the costs of this
action including all reasonable attorney's fees as well as other and
further relief as the Court considers just and proper.

CIVIL ACTION NO:


COMPLAINT

The plaintiffs, Harvey Thomas Gardner and Jason Thomas Gardner, by
Harvey Thomas Gardner, next friend, by counsel, file this complaint
and say as follows:

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1.   Original jurisdiction is conferred upon this Court by title 28
United States Code, section 1343(3) as this complaint sufficiently
alleges state action subjecting the plaintiffs to actual deprivation
of civil rights guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to
the Constitution of the United States and arising under the Civil

invoked pursuant to federal question subject matter under 28 U.S.C.

Virginia state and common law through supplemental jurisdiction
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1367(a). All claims in this complaint
arise from the same set of operative facts and thus form part of the
same case or controversy under Article III of the United States
Constitution.

2.   Venue lies in the Western District of Virginia under 28 U.S.C.
Section 1391, the causes of action set forth herein having arisen in
the County of Bedford, Virginia, within this judicial district, and
wherein the plaintiffs and all defendants reside.

PARTIES

3.   Plaintiff Harvey Thomas Gardner (hereinafter referred to as
"Father") is, and at all times mentioned in this complaint was, a
resident of Bedford County, Virginia and custodial parent of Plaintiff
Jason Thomas Gardner (hereinafter referred to as "Student"), a student
attending Montvale Elementary School.

4.   Plaintiff Jason Thomas Gardner is, and at all times mentioned in
this complaint was, a nine-year-old student attending Montvale
Elementary School in Bedford County, presently assigned to defendant
Bruce Bays' fourth grade free reading period. Plaintiff Jason Thomas
Gardner is the son of plaintiff Harvey Thomas Gardner and brings this
action through plaintiff Harvey Thomas Gardner.

5.   Defendant Bruce Bays (hereinafter referred to as "Teacher") is,
and at all times mentioned in this complaint was, a teacher at
Montvale Elementary School and is sued in his official capacity as
such teacher. As a teacher at Montvale Elementary School, defendant
Bruce Bays is responsible for monitoring Student's Free Reading
Period.


6.   Defendant Ronald Mason (hereinafter referred to as "Principal")
is, and at all times mentioned in this complaint was, the principal of
Montvale Elementary School and is sued in his official capacity as
such principal. As principal of Montvale Elementary School, defendant
Ronald Mason is responsible for implementing policies set down by the
Bedford County School Board as well as overseeing day to day
administration of Montvale Elementary School.

7.   Defendant John A. Kent, Ph.D. (hereinafter referred to as
"Superintendent") is, and at all times mentioned in this complaint
was, the superintendent of Schools for Bedford County and is sued in
his official capacity as such superintendent. As superintendent, he
oversees the Bedford school system, setting policy and procedures in
schools including Montvale Elementary School.

8.   Defendant Bedford County School Board is sued in its capacity as
the governing body of the Bedford County school system and
specifically Montvale Elementary School, establishing school policy
and curriculum.

9.   Defendant Elizabeth A. Bailey is, and at all times mentioned in
this complaint was, chairman of the Bedford County School Board and is
sued in her official capacity as such member.

10.  Defendant Shirley B. McCabe is, and at all times mentioned in
this complaint was, vice-chairman of the Bedford County School Board

16.  Defendant Stanley W. Butler is, and at all times mentioned in
this complaint was, a member of the Bedford County School Board and is
sued in his official capacity as such member.

17.  An actual and substantial controversy exists between plaintiffs
and defendants. Plaintiffs contend that Student's First Amendment
rights to free speech and to receive information were and continue to
be deprived by defendants taking possession of the Book, refusing to
return possession of the Book to Student, and by refusing to let
Student read the Book during Free Reading Period. Plaintiffs further
contend that Father's constitutional right to rear and educate his
child is infringed by the same actions. Upon information and belief,
defendants deny that their actions are unconstitutional and intend to
prevent Student from re-gaining possession of the Book and from
reading the Book during Free Reading Period. A declaration is
necessary to resolve this conflict.


COUNT ONE - FIRST AMENDMENT

18.  In his class, defendant Teacher includes a fourth grade Free
Reading Period in which students bring to school books of their own
choosing, without teacher pre-approval, for private, silent reading.

19.  By establishing a free reading period in which Student was given
discretion in choosing reading material, defendants created and
afforded Student a constitutional First Amendment right to receive
information from the literary source of his choosing during the Free
Reading Period.

20.  On or about May 16, 1996, plaintiff Jason Thomas Gardner brought
in the book, The Way Things Ought To Be (hereinafter referred to as
the "Book"), written by Rush Limbaugh. Student read the Book in his
Fourth Grade Free Reading Period and in accordance with the rules of
Free Reading Period.

21.  During the Free Reading Period on May 16, 1996, defendant Teacher
seized the Book from Student, preventing Student from continuing to
read the Book for the duration of the period.

22.  Defendant Teacher inquired and was informed by the Student that
he had parental permission to possess and read the Book.

23.  Defendant Teacher then turned possession of the Book over to
Principal.

24.  Principal contacted Father and was informed that the Student had
Father's permission to possess and read the Book.

25.  Father wrote a letter delivered to Principal requesting that the
Book be returned to his son.

26.  Defendant Principal refused and continues to refuse to return
possession of the Book to Student, from whom the Book was seized.

27.  At no time during free reading period did Student show the book
to any other student, communicate the Book's contents, or in any way
create a disturbance.

28.  No substantial government interest was served by terminating
Student's possession of the Book.

29.  The Book is a work of at least some value that would have no
harmful effect on the Student or any other person attending Montvale
Elementary School.

30.  Access to and reading the Book promotes free thinking and public
exchange of ideas, regardless of whether one agrees or disagrees with
its content or author. Its purpose is at the very core of free speech
constitutional protections.

31.  Montvale Elementary School, defendants Teacher and Principal are
presently in possession of the Book with no legitimate reason to
retain possession.

32.  Upon information and belief, Superintendent and the Bedford
County School Board and its members are responsible for all Montvale
Elementary School policy and procedure, and, through their acts and
omissions allowed and continue to allow the alleged constitutional
violations to occur and continue to occur.

33.  Plaintiffs request judgment against defendants as set forth
below.


COUNT TWO - PARENTAL RIGHTS

34.  Plaintiffs reallege Paragraphs 1 through 33 of this complaint as
set forth in full.

35.  Plaintiff Harvey Thomas Gardner possesses a constitutionally
protected right to raise Student, his son.

36.  Defendant's Free Reading Period allowed control over the choice
of the Student's Free Reading Period reading material be left to the
discretion of Father. Defendants had developed no curriculum
associated with the Free Reading Period, nor were pursuing any
educational goal beyond encouraging Student's interest in reading.

36.  Defendants Teacher and Principal were each informed that Student
enjoyed Father's permission to possess and read the Book.

37.  Defendants originally provided the student the right to read the
book of his choice during the Free Reading Period. Defendants
thereafter decided the book chosen by the student did not promote
Defendants' ideas and philosophies.

38.  Defendants, by taking and retaining possession of Book,
condemning the Book, and refusing to allow Student to read Book during
Free Reading Period have infringed on the Father's constitutional
right to raise his son. Defendants' actions further no educational or
disciplinary purpose; as such, defendants, as agents of the state are
constitutionally barred from contravening decisions made by a parent
concerning his child.

39.  Plaintiff Harvey Thomas Gardner requests judgment against
defendants as set forth below.

40.  Father and Student are entitled to permanent injunctive and
preliminary injunctive relief because:

a.   Each will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not
granted;

b.   Said harm outweighs possible adverse effects, if any, potentially
suffered by the respective defendants;

c.   Plaintiffs, respectively, are likely to succeed on the merits of
the case;

d.   The public interest lies with granting the relief requested.

41.  The First Amendment protects the student's access to ideas and
philosophies of all types and sources, regardless of the government's
annoyance or support of such views. Its tenants are not to limit but
to expand the student's exposure in a forum which allows examination,
and acceptance or rejection. To seize the student's book, for the
student and society, is to close the door of learning afforded by the
First Amendment and deny the very goal of education.

WHEREFORE, the plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court:

1.   Enter judgment declaring defendants' refusal to return the Book
to Student and refusal to allow Student to read the Book during Free
Reading Period unconstitutional as a violation of the right of free
speech and the right to receive information guaranteed by the First
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States as applied to the
Commonwealth of Virginia under the Fourteenth Amendment to the
Constitution of the United States.

2.   Enter judgment declaring unconstitutional defendants' refusal to
honor Father's decision that the Book is appropriate reading material
for Student's private reading in Free Reading Period, as such refusal
interferes with Father's right to rear and educate his son as
protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.

3.   Plaintiffs request this Court issue preliminary and permanent
injunctions requiring defendants to return possession of the Book to
Student and to permit Student to read the Book during Free Reading
Period.

4.   Plaintiffs further request that the Court award the costs of this
action including all reasonable attorney's fees as well as other and
further relief as the Court considers just and proper.

<P>For the second time in recent weeks, a federal appeals court has struck down a state's ban on doctor-assisted suicide. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled April 2, 1996, that two New York laws were unconstitutional because they failed to treat individuals equally. The court noted that patients on life support can ask to be disconnected. But others wanting medication to hasten death were not allowed to be given it.</P>

UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

No. 60 -- August Term, 1995.

(Argued: September 1, 1995 Decided: April 2, 1996)

DENNIS C. VACCO, Attorney General of the State of

of New York; ROBERT M. MORGENTHAU, District
Attorney of New York County,

Defendants-Appellees.

Before: MINER and CALABRESI, Circuit Judges, and
POLLACK, Senior District Judge.*

Appeal from summary judgment for defendants entered
in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York (Griesa, Ch. J.) in action to declare
unconstitutional two New York statutes penalizing
assistance in suicide to extent that the statutes prohibit
physicians from acceding to requests of terminally-ill,

Plaintiffs-appellants Timothy E. Quill, Samuel C.
Klagsbrun and Howard A. Grossman appeal from a
summary judgment entered in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York (Griesa, Ch.
J.) dismissing their 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 action against
defendants-appellees. The action was brought by
plaintiffs-appellants, all of whom are physicians, to
declare unconstitutional in part two New York statutes
penalizing assistance in suicide. The physicians contend
that each statute is invalid to the extent that it prohibits
them from acceding to the requests of terminally-ill,
mentally competent patients for help in hastening death.
In granting summary judgment in favor of defendants-
appellees, the district court considered and rejected
challenges to the statutes predicated upon the Due Process
and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the United States Constitution. Quill v.
Koppell, 870 F. Supp. 78 (S.D.N.Y. 1994). We reverse in
part, holding that physicians who are willing to do so may
prescribe drugs to be self-administered by mentally
competent patients who seek to end their lives during the
final stages of a terminal illness.

BACKGROUND

The action giving rise to this appeal was commenced by
a complaint filed on July 20, 1994. The plaintiffs named
in that complaint were the three physicians who are the
appellants here and three individuals then in the final
stages of terminal illness: Jane Doe (who chose to conceal
her actual identity), George A. Kingsley and William A.
Barth. The sole defendant named in that complaint was
G. Oliver Koppell, then the Attorney General of the State
of New York. He has been succeeded as Attorney
General by Dennis C. Vacco, who has been substituted for
him as an appellee on this appeal. According to the
complaint, Jane Doe was a 76-year-old retired physical
education instructor who was dying of thyroid cancer;
Mr. Kingsley was a 48-year-old publishing executive
suffering from AIDS; and Mr. Barth was a 28- year-old
former fashion editor under treatment for AIDS. Each of
these plaintiffs alleged that she or he had been advised and
understood that she or he was in the terminal stage of a
terminal illness and that there was no chance of recovery.
Each sought to hasten death "in a certain and humane
manner" and for that purpose sought "necessary medical
assistance in the form of medications prescribed by [her
or his] physician to be self- administered."

The physician plaintiffs alleged that they encountered, in
the course of their medical practices, "mentally
competent, terminally ill patients who request assistance
in the voluntary self-termination of life."  Many of these
patients apparently "experience chronic, intractable pain
and/or intolerable suffering" and seek to hasten their
deaths for those reasons. Mr. Barth was one of the
patients who sought the assistance of Dr. Grossman. Each
of the physician plaintiffs has alleged that "[u]nder certain
circumstances it would be consistent with the standards of
[his] medical practice" to assist in hastening death by
prescribing drugs for patients to self-administer for that
purpose. The physicians alleged that they were unable to
exercise their best professional judgment to prescribe the
requested drugs, and the other plaintiffs alleged that they
were unable to receive the requested drugs, because of the
prohibitions contained in sections 125.15(3) and 120.30 of
the New York Penal Law, all plaintiffs being residents of
New York.

Section 125.15 of the New York Penal Law provides in
pertinent part:


A person is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree
when:...

3. He intentionally . . . aids another person to commit
suicide.


A violation of this provision is classified as a class C
felony. Id.

Section 120.30 of the New York Penal Law provides:


A person is guilty of promoting a suicide attempt when
he intentionally .... aids another person to attempt suicide.


A violation of this provision is classified as a class E
felony. Id.

Count I of the complaint included an allegation that
"[t]he Fourteenth Amendment guarantees the liberty of
mentally competent, terminally ill adults with no chance
of recovery to make decisions about the end of their
lives." It also included an allegation that

[t]he Fourteenth Amendment guarantees the liberty of
physicians to practice medicine consistent with their best
professional judgment, including using their skills and
powers to facilitate the exercise of the decision of
competent, terminally ill adults to hasten inevitable death
by prescribing suitable medications for the patient to self-
administer for that purpose.


Count II of the complaint included an allegation that
[t]he relevant portions of . . . the New York Penal Law
deny the patient-plaintiffs and the patients of the
physician-plaintiffs the equal protection of the law by
denying them the right to choose to hasten inevitable
death, while terminally ill persons whose treatment
includes life support are able to exercise this choice with
necessary medical assistance by directing termination of
such treatment.


In their prayer for relief the plaintiffs requested
judgment declaring the New York statutes complained of
constitutionally invalid and therefore in violation of 42
U.S.C. Section 1983 "as applied to physicians who assist
mentally competent, terminally ill adults who choose to
hasten inevitable death."  Plaintiffs also sought an order
permanently enjoining defendants from enforcing the
statutes and an award of attorney's fees.

By order to show cause filed on September 16, 1994, the
plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin
then- Attorney General Koppell "and all persons acting in
concert and participation with him from enforcing New
York Penal Law sections 125.15(3) and 120.30 against
physicians who prescribe medications which mentally
competent, terminally ill patients may use to hasten their
impending deaths."  A declaration by each of the plaintiffs
was submitted in support of the application, although Jane
Doe had died prior to the filing of the order to show
cause. Plaintiffs Kingsley and Barth were then in the
advanced stages of AIDS and therefore sought an
immediate determination by the district court.


In her declaration, Jane Doe stated:

I have a large cancerous tumor which is wrapped around
the right carotid artery in my neck and is collapsing my
esophagus and invading my voice box. The tumor has
significantly reduced my ability to swallow and prevents
me from eating anything but very thin liquids in
extremely small amounts. The cancer has metastasized to
my plural [sic] cavity and it is painful to yawn or cough. .
. . In early July 1994 I had the [feeding] tube implanted
and have suffered serious problems as a result. . . . I take
a variety of medications to manage the pain. . . . It is not
possible for me to reduce my pain to an acceptable level
of comfort and to retain an alert state. . . . At this time, it
is clear to me, based on the advice of my doctors, that I
am in the terminal phase of this disease. . . . At the point
at which I can no longer endure the pain and suffering
associated with my cancer, I want to have drugs available
for the purpose of hastening my death in a humane and
certain manner. I want to be able to discuss freely with
my treating physician my intention of hastening my death
through the consumption of drugs prescribed for that
purpose.


Mr. Kingsley subscribed to a declaration that included
the following:


At this time I have almost no immune system function. .
. My first major illness associated with AIDS was
cryptosporidiosis, a parasitic infection which caused me
severe fevers and diarrhea and associated pain, suffering
and exhaustion. . . . I also suffer from cytomegalovirus
("CMV") retinitis, an AIDS-related virus which attacks
the retina and causes blindness. To date I have become
almost completely blind in my left eye. I am at risk of
losing my sight altogether from this condition. . . . I also
suffer from toxoplasmosis, a parasitic infection which has
caused lesions to develop on my brain. . . . I . . . take
daily infusions of cytovene for the . . . retinitis condition.
This medication, administered for an hour through a
Hickman tube which is connected to an artery in my chest,
prevents me from ever taking showers and makes simple
routine functions burdensome. In addition, I inject my
leg daily with neupogen to combat the deficient white cell
count in my blood. The daily injection of this medication
is extremely painful. . . At this point it is clear to me,
based on the advice of my doctors, that I am in the
terminal phase of [AIDS]. . . . It is my desire that my
physician prescribe suitable drugs for me to consume for
the purpose of hastening my death when and if my
suffering becomes intolerable.


In his declaration, Mr. Barth stated:


In May 1992, I developed a Kaposi's sarcoma skin
lesion. This was my first major illness associated with
AIDS. I underwent radiation and chemotherapy to treat
this cancer... In September 1993, I was diagnosed with
cytomegalovirus ("CMV") in my stomach and colon
which caused severe diarrhea, fevers and wasting. . . . In
February 1994, I was diagnosed with microsporidiosis, a
parasitic infection for which there is effectively no
treatment. . . . At approximately the same time, I
contracted AIDS-related pneumonia. The pneumonia's
infusion therapy treatment was so extremely toxic that I
vomited with each infusion. . . . In March 994, I was
diagnosed with cryptosporidiosis, a parasitic infection
which has caused severe diarrhea, sometimes producing
20 stools a day, extreme abdominal pain, nausea and
additional significant wasting. I have begun to lose bowel
control... For each of these conditions I have undergone a
variety of medical treatments, each of which has had
significant adverse side effects. . . . While I have tolerated
some [nightly intravenous] feedings, I am unwilling to
accept this for an extended period of time... I understand
that there are no cures. . . . I can no longer endure the
pain and suffering . . . and I want to have drugs available
for the purpose of hastening my death


A cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings was filed
by Attorney General Koppell on October 11, 1994.
Thereafter, on October 14, 1994, an amended complaint
was filed by the three physicians and Mr. Kingsley
naming as defendants Attorney General Koppell and New
York State Governor Mario M. Cuomo. The counts of the
complaint were the same as set forth in the original
complaint, alleging violations of liberty interests
guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment in Count I and
violation of equal protection rights guaranteed by the
Fourteenth Amendment in Count II. The prayer for
relief remained the same as in the original complaint.
Supplemental declarations in support of the plaintiff's
motion for preliminary injunction also were filed on
October 14, 1994. In their supplemental declarations,
Doctors Klagsbrun and Grossman reiterated their desire
"to prescribe drugs, if and when medically and
psychiatrically appropriate, for such patients to self-
administer at the time and place of their choice for the
purpose of hastening their impending deaths."

In his supplemental declaration, Dr. Quill declared:


The removal of a life support system that directly results
in the patient's death requires the direct involvement by
the doctor, as well as other medical personnel. When such
patients are mentally competent, they are consciously
choosing death as preferable to life under the
circumstances that they are forced to live. Their doctors
do a careful clinical assessment, including a full
exploration of the patient's prognosis, mental competence
to make such decisions, and the treatment alternatives to
stopping treatment. It is legally and ethically permitted
for physicians to actively assist patients to die who are
dependent on life-sustaining treatments. . . .
Unfortunately, some dying patients who are in agony that
can no longer be relieved, yet are not dependent on life-
sustaining treatment, have no such options under current
legal restrictions. It seems unfair, discriminatory, and
inhumane to deprive some dying patients of such vital
choices because of arbitrary elements of their condition
which determine whether they are on life- sustaining
treatment that can be stopped.


Along with the supplemental declarations filed on
October 14th, an original declaration in support of the
motion was filed by Dr. Jack Froom, a physician and
Professor of Family Medicine with substantial experience
in detecting depression in primary care patients. He
declared:


Physicians can determine whether a patient's request to
hasten death is rational and competent or motivated by
depression or other mental illness or instability.
Physicians currently make these determinations as to
patient capacity to make end-of-life decisions with respect
to orders not to  resuscitate and refusal of life-sustaining
treatment. . . . Terminally ill persons who seek to hasten
death by consuming drugs need medical counseling
regarding the type of drugs and the amount and manner
in which they should be taken, as well as a prescription,
which only a licensed medical doctor can provide. . . .
Knowing what drug, in what amount, will hasten death
for a particular patient, in light of the patient's medical
condition and medication regimen, is a complex medical
task. . . . It is not uncommon, in light of present legal
constraints on physician assistance, that patients seeking to
hasten their deaths try to do so without medical advice. .
Very often, patients who survive a failed suicide attempt
find themselves in worse condition than before the
attempt. Brain damage, for example, is one result of
failed suicide attempts.


A second amended complaint was filed on October 20,
1994. The parties, allegations and prayer for relief were
the same as those contained in the first amended
complaint, except that Robert M. Morgenthau, District
Attorney of New York County, was added as a defendant
in his official capacity. Both Dr. Grossman and Dr.
Klagsbrun practice medicine in New York City, and Mr.
Morgenthau is responsible for the prosecution of crimes
occurring in New York County. The physician plaintiffs
each filed second supplemental declarations on November
28, 1994, in support of the motion for a preliminary
injunction. Each stated that he was currently treating
mentally competent, terminally-ill patients who desired to
hasten their deaths by self-administering drugs to be
provided by the physicians "if and when medically and
psychiatrically appropriate."  These patients, according to
the physicians, understood "their condition, diagnosis, and
prognosis and wish[ed] to avoid prolonged suffering by
hastening their deaths if and when their suffering
[became] intolerable." None of the three terminally-ill
plaintiffs named in the original complaint survived to the
date of the district court's decision.

The opinion of the district court was filed on December
16, 1994. The district court denied the motion for a
preliminary injunction and granted the defendants' cross
motion to dismiss the action, treating the cross motion as
one for summary judgment "since the court has
considered matters outside the pleadings-- i.e.,
declarations filed on the motion for preliminary
injunction." Quill, 870 F. Supp. at 79. After finding that
the action presented a justiciable case or controversy, the
district court first addressed the due process issue. The
court determined that physician assisted suicide could not
be classified as a fundamental right within the meaning of
the Constitution:


The Supreme Court has described the considerations
which are appropriate before there can be a declaration
that rights "not readily identifiable in the Constitution's
text" are deserving of constitutional protection. Such
rights must be implicit in the concept of ordered liberty
so that neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were
sacrificed. The Supreme Court has also characterized such
rights as those liberties that are deeply rooted in the
nation's history and traditions.


The trouble is that plaintiffs make no attempt to argue
that physician assisted suicide, even in the case of
terminally ill patients, has any historic recognition as a
legal right.


Id. at 83 (internal citations omitted). Accordingly, the
district court concluded "that the type of physician
assisted suicide at issue in this case does not involve a
fundamental liberty interest protected by the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."  Id. at 84.

Turning to the equal protection issue, the district court
identified a reasonable and rational basis for the
distinction drawn by New York law between the refusal
of treatment at the hands of physicians and physician
assisted suicide:


[I]t is hardly unreasonable or irrational for the State to
recognize a difference between allowing nature to take its
course, even in the most severe situations, and
intentionally using an artificial death-producing device.
The State has obvious legitimate interests in preserving
life, and in protecting vulnerable persons. The State has
the further right to determine how these crucial interests
are to be treated when the issue is posed as to whether a
physician can assist a patient in committing suicide.


Id. at 84-85. Accordingly, the court held "that plaintiffs
have not shown a violation of the Equal Protection Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment."  Id. at 85.

DISCUSSION

I. Justiciability

As they did in the district court, the state defendants
contend on appeal that this action does not present a
justiciable case or controversy. We reject this contention.

In Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat'l Union, 442
U.S. 289 (1979), the Supreme Court was faced with a
constitutional challenge to an Arizona farm labor statute.
The Court stated that, when contesting the
constitutionality of a state criminal statute, it is not
necessary that the plaintiff first expose himself to actual
prosecution. Id. at 298. Rather,


[w]hen the plaintiff has alleged an intention to engage in
a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional
interest, but proscribed by a statute, and there exists a
credible threat of prosecution thereunder, he "should not
be required to await and undergo a criminal prosecution
as the sole means of seeking relief."


Id. (quoting Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 188 (1973)).
The Court in Doe held that plaintiff physicians had
presented a justiciable controversy despite the fact that
none had been threatened with prosecution. 410 U.S. at
188. The law that the physicians challenged was a
criminal statute that directly criminalized the physician's
participation in abortion. Accordingly, a sufficiently
concrete controversy was presented.

The same principles lead to the conclusion that there is a
case or controversy at issue here. Dr. Quill has had a
criminal proceeding instituted against him in the past, and
the state nowhere disclaims an intent to repeat a
prosecution in the event of further assisted suicides. The
other two physician plaintiffs also face the threat of
criminal prosecution. Like the physicians in Doe, they
"should not be required to await and undergo a criminal
prosecution as the sole means of seeking under Doe, the
physicians may raise the rights relief." Finally, of their
terminally-ill patients. See id.

Although District Attorney Morgenthau argues in his
brief on appeal that appellants have not shown that they
are in any jeopardy of prosecution in New York County,
a recent indictment by a New York County grand jury
demonstrates the contrary. A newspaper report printed on
December 15, 1995 disclosed the following:


Yesterday, District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau of
Manhattan announced that a grand jury had indicted
[George] Delury, an editor who lives on the Upper West
Side, on manslaughter charges for helping his 52-year-
old wife, Myrna Lebov, commit suicide last summer.


Carey Goldberg, Suicide's Husband Is Indicted: Diary
Records Pain of 2 Lives, N.Y. Times, Dec. 15, 1995, at
B1.[1] The physician plaintiffs have good reason to fear
prosecution in New York County.

II. Substantive Due Process

Plaintiffs argue for a right to assisted suicide as a
fundamental liberty under the substantive component of
the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
This Clause assures the citizenry that any deprivation of
life, liberty or property by a state will be attended by
appropriate legal processes.

However, despite the language of the Due Process
Clause] of the... Fourteenth Amendment, which appears to
focus only on the processes by which life, liberty, or
property is taken, the cases are legion in which that
Clause has een interpreted to have substantive content,
subsuming rights that to a great extent are immune from .
. . state regulation or proscription. Among such cases are
those recognizing rights that have little or no textual
support in the constitutional language.


Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 191 (1986).

Rights that have no textual support in the language of the
Constitution but qualify for heightened judicial protection
include fundamental liberties so "implicit in the concept
of ordered liberty" that "neither liberty nor justice would
exist if they were sacrificed." Palko v. Connecticut, 302
U.S. 319, 325- 26 (1937). Fundamental liberties also have
been described as those that are "deeply rooted in this
Nation's history and tradition." Moore v. City of East
Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 503 (1977); see also Griswold v.
Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 506 (1965) (White, J.,
concurring). It is well settled that the state must not
infringe fundamental liberty interests unless the
infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling
state interest. Reno v. Flores, 113 S. ct. 1439, 1447
(1993). The list of rights the Supreme Court has actually
or impliedly identified as fundamental, and therefore
qualified for heightened judicial protection, include the
fundamental guarantees of the Bill of Rights as well as the
following: freedom of association; the right to participate
in the electoral process and to vote; the right to travel
interstate; the right to fairness in the criminal process; the
right to procedural fairness in regard to claims for
governmental deprivations of life, liberty or property;
and the right to privacy. 2 Ronald D. Rotunda & John E.
Nowak, Treatise on Constitutional Law Section 15.7, at
434-36 (2d ed. 1992). The right of privacy has been held
to encompass personal decisions relating to marriage,
procreation, family relationships, child rearing and
education, contraception and abortion. See Carey v.
Population Servs. Int'l, 431 U.S. 678, 684-85 (1977).
While the Constitution does not, of course, include any
explicit mention of the right of privacy, this right has
been recognized as encompassed by the Fourteenth
Amendment's Due Process Clause. Id. at 684.
Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has been reluctant to
further expand this particular list of federal rights, and it
would be most speculative for a lower court to do so. See
Rotunda & Nowak, Treatise on Constitutional Law, supra,
Section 15.7, at 433-37.

In any event, the Supreme Court has drawn a line, albeit
a shaky one, on the expansion of fundamental rights that
are without support in the text of the Constitution. In
Bowers, the Supreme Court framed the issue as "whether
the Federal Constitution confers a fundamental right upon
homosexuals to engage in sodomy and hence invalidates
the laws of the many States that still make such conduct
illegal and have done so for a very long time." 478 U.S.
at 190. Holding that there was no fundamental right to
engage in consensual sodomy, the Court noted that the
statutes proscribing such conduct had "ancient roots." Id.
at 192. The Court noted that sodomy was a common law
criminal offense, forbidden by the laws of the original 13
states when they ratified the Bill of Rights, and that 25
states and the District of Columbia still penalize sodomy
performed in private by consenting adults. Id. at 192-93.

As in Bowers, the statutes plaintiffs seek to declare
unconstitutional here cannot be said to infringe upon any
fundamental right or liberty. As in Bowers, the right
contended for here cannot be considered so implicit in
our understanding of ordered liberty that neither justice
nor liberty would exist if it were sacrificed. Nor can it
be said that the right to assisted suicide claimed by
plaintiffs is deeply rooted in the nation's traditions and
history. Indeed, the very opposite is true. The Common
Law of England, as received by the American colonies,
prohibited suicide and attempted suicide. See Thomas J.
Marzen et al., Suicide: A Constitutional Right?, 24 Duq.
L. Rev. 1, 56-67 (1985). Although neither suicide nor
attempted suicide is any longer a crime in the United
States, 32 states, including New York, continue to make
assisted suicide an offense. The New York State Task
Force on Life and the Law, When Death Is Sought:
Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia in the Medical Context,
55 (1994) ("When Death Is Sought"). Clearly, no "right"
to assisted suicide ever has been recognized in any state in
the United States. See generally Mark E. Chopko &
Michael F. Moses, Assisted Suicide: Still a Wonderful
Life?, 70 Notre Dame L. Rev. 519, 561 (1995); Yale
Kamisar, Are Laws against Assisted Suicide
Unconstitutional?, 23 Hastings Center Rep., May-June
1993, at 32.

In rejecting the due process-fundamental rights
argument of the plaintiffs, we are mindful of the
admonition of the Supreme Court:


Nor are we inclined to take a more expansive view of
our authority to discover new fundamental rights
imbedded in the Due Process Clause. The Court is most
vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when it deals
with judge-made constitutional law having little or no
cognizable roots in the language or design of the
Constitution.


Bowers, 478 U.S. at 194. The right to assisted suicide
finds no cognizable basis in the Constitution's language or
design, even in the very limited cases of those competent
persons who, in the final stages of terminal illness, seek
the right to hasten death. We therefore decline the
plaintiffs' invitation to identify a new fundamental right,
in the absence of a clear direction from the Court whose
precedents we are bound to follow. The limited room for
expansion of substantive due process rights and the
reasons therefor have been clearly stated: "As a general
matter, the Court has always been reluctant to expand the
concept of substantive due process because guideposts for
responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are
scarce and open- ended." Collins v. City of Harker
Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 125 (1992). Our position in the
judicial hierarchy constrains us to be even more reluctant
than the Court to undertake an expansive approach in this
unchartered area.

III. Equal Protection

According to the Fourteenth Amendment, the equal
protection of the laws cannot be denied by any State to
any person within its jurisdiction. U.S. Const. amend.
XIV, Section 1. This constitutional guarantee simply
requires the states to treat in a similar manner all
individuals who are similarly situated. See 3 Rotunda &
Nowak, Treatise on Constitutional Law, supra, Section
18.2, at 7. But disparate treatment is not necessarily a
denial of the equal protection guaranteed by the
Constitution. The Supreme Court has described the wide
discretion afforded to the states in establishing acceptable
classifications:


The Equal Protection Clause directs that "all persons
similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike." But so too,
"[t]he Constitution does not require things which are
different in fact or opinion to be treated in law as though
they were the same." The initial discretion to determine
what is "different" and what is "the same" resides in the
legislatures of the States. A legislature must have
substantial latitude to establish classifications that roughly
approximate the nature of the problem perceived, that
accommodate competing concerns both public and
private, and that account for limitations on the practical
ability of the State to remedy every ill. In applying the
Equal Protection Clause to most forms of state action, we
thus seek only the assurance that the classification at issue
bears some fair relationship to a legitimate public
purpose.


Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216 (1982) (internal
citations omitted and alteration in original).

The general rule, then, is that state legislation carries a
presumption of validity if the statutory classification is
"rationally related to a legitimate state interest."  City of
Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432,
440 (1985). In Cleburne, the equal protection issue
revolved around a zoning ordinance that required a
special use permit for homes for the mentally retarded
but not for other multiple-dwelling and care- giving
facilities. The Supreme Court resolved the issue as
follows:


Because in our view the record does not reveal any
rational basis for believing that the Featherston home [for
the mentally retarded] would pose any special threat to the
city's legitimate interests, we affirm the judgment below
insofar as it holds the ordinance


Id. at 448. In arriving at this conclusion, the Court
rejected the city's claims that the disparate classification
was justified by the negative attitudes of property owners
in the neighborhood of the proposed facility, the location
of the facility across the street from a junior high school
and on a 500-year flood plain, concerns about legal
responsibility for actions that might be taken by the
mentally retarded, or concerns about the size of the
facility and the number of occupants. Id. at 448-50. The
Court carefully examined each of these claims before
finding that there was no acceptable reason for the
disparate classification in any of them.

Also found invalid under the Equal Protection Clause
for failure to survive rational basis scrutiny was a New
Mexico statute providing a partial exemption from the
state's property tax for certain honorably discharged
veterans. Hooper v. Bernalillo County Assessor, 472 U.S.
612 (1985). The exemption was limited to veterans who
had served on active duty during the Vietnam War for at
least 90 continuous days and were New Mexico residents
before May 8, 1976. In finding the residence requirement
invalid under the Equal Protection Clause, the Court
analyzed the New Mexico statute in light of the following
principles: "When a state distributes benefits unequally,
the distinctions it makes are subject to scrutiny under the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Generally, a law will survive that scrutiny if the
distinction rationally furthers a legitimate state purpose."
Id. at 618 (footnote omitted). The Court determined that
the distinction made between veterans who arrived in the
state prior to May 8, 1976 and those who arrived
thereafter bore no rational relationship to the state's
declared objectives of encouraging veterans to settle in the
state and of rewarding citizens who resided in the state
prior to the cut-off date for their military service. Id. at
619-20.

As to the first objective, the Court wrote:


The distinction New Mexico makes between veterans
who established residence before May 8, 1976, and those
veterans who arrived in the State thereafter bears no
rational relationship to one of the State's objectives-
-encouraging Vietnam veterans to move to New Mexico.
The legislature set this eligibility date long after the
triggering event occurred. The legislature cannot
plausibly encourage veterans to move to the State by
passing such retroactive legislation.


Id. at 619 (internal citation omitted). As to the second
declared objective, the Court noted that a state court may
legitimately compensate resident veterans

or past services by providing various advantages, but
that "the New Mexico statute's distinction between
resident veterans is not rationally related to the State's
asserted legislative goal." Id. at 621-22.   The Court held:


The State may not favor established residents over new
residents based on the view that the State may take care of
"its own," if such is defined by prior residence.
Newcomers, by establishing bona fide residence in the
State, become the State's "own" and may not be
discriminated against solely on the basis of their arrival in
the State after May 8, 1976.


Id. at 623. See also Zobel v. Williams, 457 U.S. 55
(1982) (holding that Alaska statute using length of
residence as basis for distribution of oil reserve dividends
violated Equal Protection Clause.)

While rational basis scrutiny governs judicial review of
the constitutionality of legislation in the areas of social
welfare and economics, see Bowen v. Owens, 476 U.S.
340, 345 (1986), strict scrutiny is the standard of review
where a classification "impermissibly interferes with the
exercise of a fundamental right or operates to the peculiar
disadvantage of a suspect class," Massachusetts Bd. of
Retirement v. Murqia, 427 U.S. 307, 312 (1976)
(footnotes omitted). Suspect classes are those identified by
race, alienage or national origin, Cleburne, 473 U.S. at
440, and fundamental rights are those explicitly or
implicitly derived from the Constitution itself, see San
Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 33-34
(1973). For the reasons described in Part II, supra, the
New York statutes prohibiting assisted suicide during the
terminal stages of illness do not impinge on any
fundamental rights nor can it be said that they involve
suspect classifications. Laws subject to strict scrutiny will
survive such review only if they are suitably tailored to
serve a compelling state interest. Cleburne, 473 U.S. at
440.

An intermediate level of scrutiny has been applied in
analyzing certain equal protection guarantee violations.
To pass this scrutiny, the classification must be
substantially related to an important governmental
objective. Clark v. Jeter, 486 U.S. 456, 461 (1988). This
sort of examination has been applied to classifications
based on sex or illegitimacy. Id.; see also Kadrmas v.
Dickinson Pub. Sch., 487 U.S. 450, 459 (1988);
Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718,
723-24 (1982). A heightened level of equal protection
scrutiny also was applied in Plyler, where the Supreme
Court struck down a Texas statute withholding from local
school districts funding for the education of children not
legally admitted into the United States. 457 U.S. at 202.

Applying the foregoing principles to the New York
statutes criminalizing assisted suicide, it seems clear that:
1) the statutes in question fall within the category of social
welfare legislation and therefore are subject to rational
basis scrutiny upon judicial review; 2) New York law
does not treat equally all competent persons who are in
the final stages of fatal illness and wish to hasten their
deaths; 3) the distinctions made by New York law with
regard to such persons do not further any legitimate state
purpose; and 4) accordingly, to the extent that the statutes
in questions prohibit persons in the final stages of
terminal illness from having assistance in ending their
lives by the use of self-administered, prescribed drugs,
the statutes lack any rational basis and are violative of the
Equal Protection Clause.

The right to refuse medical treatment long has been
recognized in New York. In 1914 Judge Cardozo wrote
that, under New York law, "[e]very human being of adult
years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall
be done with his own body." Schloendorff v. Society of
New York Hosp., 211 N.Y. 125, 129 (1914). In 1981, the
New York Court of Appeals held that this right extended
to the withdrawal of life-support systems. In re Eichner
(decided with In re Storar), 52 N.Y.2d 363, cert. denied,
454 U.S. 858 1981). The Eichner case involved a
terminally-ill, 83-year-old patient whose guardian
ultimately was authorized to withdraw the patient's
respirator. The Court of Appeals determined that the
guardian had proved by clear and convincing evidence
that the patient, prior to becoming incompetent due to
illness, had consistently expressed his view that life should
not be prolonged if there was no hope of recovery. Id. at
379-80. In Storar, the companion case to Eichner, the
Court of Appeals determined that a profoundly retarded,
terminally-ill patient was incapable of making a decision
to terminate blood transfusions. There, the patient was
incapable of making a reasoned decision, having never
been competent at any time in his life. Id. at 380. In both
these cases, the New York Court of Appeals recognized
the right of a competent, terminally-ill patient to hasten
his death upon proper proof of his desire to do so.

The Court of Appeals revisited the issue in Rivers v.
Katz, 67 N.Y.2d 485 (1986) (establishing the right of
mentally incompetent persons to refuse certain drugs). In
that case, the Court recognized the right to bring on death
by refusing medical treatment not only as a "fundamental
common-law right" but also as "coextensive with [a]
patient's liberty interest protected by the due process
clause of our State Constitution."  Id. at 493. The
following language was included in the opinion:


In our system of a free government, where notions of
individual autonomy and free choice are cherished, it is
the individual who must have the final say in respect to
decisions regarding his medical treatment in order to
insure that the greatest possible protection is accorded his
autonomy and freedom from unwanted interference with
the furtherance of his own desires.


Id.

After these cases were decided, the New York legislature
placed its imprimatur upon the right of competent citizens
to hasten death by refusing medical treatment and by
directing physicians to remove life-support systems
already in place. In 1987, the legislature enacted Article
29-B of the New York Public Health Law, entitled
"Orders Not to Resuscitate." N.Y. Pub. Health Law
Sections 2960-79 (McKinney 1993). The Article provides
that an "adult with capacity" may direct the issuance of an
order not to resuscitate. Section 2964. "Order not to
resuscitate" is defined as "an order not to attempt
cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the event a patient
suffers cardiac or respiratory arrest."  Section 2961(17).
"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation" is defined as "measures .
. . to restore cardiac function or to support ventilation in
the event of a cardiac or respiratory arrest."  Section
2961(4). An elaborate statutory scheme is in place, and it
provides, among other things, for surrogate decision-
making,  Section 2965, revocation of consent, Section
2969, physician review, Section 2970, dispute mediation,
Section 2972, and judicial review, Section 2973.

In 1990, the New York legislature enacted Article 29-C
of the Public Health Law, entitled "Health Care Agents
and Proxies." N.Y. Pub. Health Law Sections 2980-94
(McKinney 1993). This statute allows for a person to sign
a health care proxy, Section 2981, for the purpose of
appointing an agent with "authority to make any and all
health care decisions on the principal's behalf that the
principal could make."  Section 2982(1). These decisions
include those relating to the administration of artificial
nutrition and hydration, provided the wishes of the
principal are known to the agent. Section 2982(2). The
agent's decision is made "[a]fter consultation with a
licensed physician, registered nurse, licensed clinical
psychologist or certified social worker."  Id.
Accordingly, a patient has the right to hasten death by
empowering an agent to require a physician to withdraw
life- support systems. The proxy statute also presents a
detailed scheme, with provisions for a determination that
the principal lacks capacity to make health care decisions,
for such a determination to be made only by the attending
physician in consultation with another physician "[f]or a
decision to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining
treatment," Section 2983, for provider's obligations,
Section 2984, for revocation, Section 2985, and for
special proceedings, Section 2992, among other matters.

The concept that a competent person may order the
removal of life-support systems found Supreme Court
approval in Cruzan v. Director. Missouri Dep't of Health,
497 U.S. 261 (1990). There the Court upheld a
determination of the Missouri Supreme Court that
required proof by clear and convincing evidence of a
patient's desire for the withdrawal of life-sustaining
equipment. The patient in that case, Nancy Cruzan, was in
a persistent vegetative state as the result of injuries
sustained in an automobile accident. Her parents sought
court approval in the State of Missouri to terminate the
artificial nutrition and hydration with which she was
supplied at the state hospital where she was confined. The
hospital employees refused to withdraw the life-support
systems, without which Cruzan would suffer certain
death. The trial court authorized the withdrawal after
finding that Cruzan had expressed some. years before to a
housemate friend some thoughts that suggested she would
not wish to live on a life-support system. The trial court
also found that one in Cruzan's condition had a
fundamental right to refuse death- prolonging procedures.

The Missouri Supreme Court, in reversing the trial
court, refused to find a broad right of privacy in the state
constitution that would support a right to refuse
treatment. Moreover, that court doubted that such a right
existed under the United States Constitution. It did
identify a state policy in the Missouri Living Will Statute
favoring the preservation of life and concluded that, in
the absence of compliance with the statute's formalities or
clear and convincing evidence of the patient's choice, no
person could order the withdrawal of medical life-support
services.

In affirming the Missouri Supreme Court, the United
States Supreme Court stated: "The principle that a
competent person has a constitutionally protected liberty
interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be
inferred from our prior decisions." Id. at 278. The Court
noted that the inquiry is not ended by the identification of
a liberty interest, because there also must be a balancing
of the state interests and the individual's liberty interests
before there can be a determination that constitutional
rights have been violated. Id. at 279. The Court all but
made that determination in the course of the following
analysis:


Petitioners insist that under the general holdings of our
cases, the forced administration of life- sustaining medical
treatment, and even of artificially- delivered food and
water essential to life, would implicate a competent
person's liberty interest. Although we think the logic of
the cases discussed above would embrace such a liberty
interest, the dramatic consequences involved in refusal of
such treatment would inform the inquiry as to whether
the deprivation of that interest is constitutionally
permissible. But for purposes of this case, we assume that
the United States Constitution would grant a competent
person a constitutionally protected right to refuse
lifesaving hydration and nutrition.

The Court went on to find that Missouri allowed a
surrogate to "act for the patient in electing to have
hydration and nutrition withdrawn in such a way as to
cause death," subject to "a procedural safeguard to assure
that the action of the surrogate conforms as best it may to
the wishes expressed by the patient while competent."  Id.
at 280. The Court then held that the procedural safeguard
or requirement imposed by Missouri--the heightened
evidentiary requirement that the incompetent's wishes be
proved by clear and convincing evidence--was not
forbidden by the United States Constitution. Id. at 280-82.

In view of the foregoing, it seems clear that New York
does not treat similarly circumstanced persons alike: those
in the final stages of terminal illness who are on life-
support systems are allowed to hasten their deaths by
directing the removal of such systems; but those who are
similarly situated, except for the previous attachment of
life-sustaining equipment, are not allowed to hasten death
by self-administering prescribed drugs. The district judge
has identified "a difference between allowing nature to
take its course, even in the most severe situations, and
intentionally using an artificial death-producing device."
Quill, 870 F. Supp. at 84. But Justice Scalia, for one, has
remarked upon "the irrelevance of the action-inaction
distinction," noting that "the cause of death in both cases
is the suicide's conscious decision to 'pu[t] an end to his
own existence."' Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 296-297 (citations
omitted and alteration in original) (Scalia, J., concurring).
See also Note, Physician-Assisted Suicide and the Right to
Die with Assistance, 105 Harv. L. Rev. 2021, 2028-31
(1992) (arguing that there is no distinction between
assisted suicide and the withholding or withdrawal of
treatment).

Indeed, there is nothing "natural" about causing death by
means other than the original illness or its complications.
The withdrawal of nutrition brings on death by
starvation, the withdrawal of hydration brings on death
by dehydration, and the withdrawal of ventilation brings
about respiratory failure. By ordering the discontinuance
of these artificial life-sustaining processes or refusing to
accept them in the first place, a patient hastens his death
by means that are not natural in any sense. It certainly
cannot be said that the death that immediately ensues is the
natural result of the progression of the disease or
condition from which the patient suffers.

Moreover, the writing of a prescription to hasten death,
after consultation with a patient, involves a far less active
role for the physician than is required in bringing about
death through asphyxiation, starvation and/or
dehydration. Withdrawal of life support requires
physicians or those acting at their direction physically to
remove equipment and, often, to administer palliative
drugs which may themselves contribute to death. The
ending of life by these means is nothing more nor less
than assisted suicide. It simply cannot be said that those
mentally competent, terminally-ill persons who seek to
hasten death but whose treatment does not include life
support are treated equally.

A finding of unequal treatment does not, of course, end
the inquiry, unless it is determined that the inequality is
not rationally related to some legitimate state interest. The
burden is upon the plaintiffs to demonstrate irrationality.
See Kadrmas, 487 U.S. at 463. At oral argument and in
its brief, the state's contention has been that its principal
interest is in preserving the life of all its citizens at all
times and under all conditions. But what interest can the
state possibly have in requiring the prolongation of a life
that is all but ended? Surely, the state's interest lessens as
the potential for life diminishes. See In re Quinlan, 70
N.J. 10, 41, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 922 (1976). And what
business is it of the state to require the continuation of
agony when the result is imminent and inevitable? What
concern prompts the state to interfere with a mentally
competent patient's "right to define [his] own concept of
existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery
of human life," Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 112 S. Ct.
2791, 2807 (1992), when the patient seeks to have drugs
prescribed to end life during the final stages of a terminal
illness? The greatly reduced interest of the state in
preserving life compels the answer to these questions:
"None."

A panel of the Ninth Circuit attempted to identify some
state interests in reversing a district court decision
holding unconstitutional a statute of the state of
Washington criminalizing the promotion of a suicide
attempt. Compassion in Dying v. Washington, 49 F.3d
586 (9th Cir. 1995) .2 The plaintiffs in the Washington
case contended for physician- assisted suicide for the
terminally-ill, but the panel majority found that the statute
prohibiting suicide promotion furthered the following:
the interest in denying to physicians "the role of killers of
their patients"; the interest in avoiding psychological
pressure upon the elderly and infirm to consent to death:
the interest of preventing the exploitation of the poor and
minorities; the interest in protecting handicapped persons
against societal indifference; the interest in preventing the
sort of abuse that "has occurred in the Netherlands
where... legal guidelines have tacitly allowed assisted
suicide or euthanasia in response to a repeated request
from a suffering, competent patient." Id. at 592-93. The
panel majority also raised a question relative to the lack
of clear definition of the term "terminally ill." Id. at 593.

The New York statutes prohibiting assisted suicide,
which are similar to the Washington statute, do not serve
any of the state interests noted, in view of the statutory
and common law schemes allowing suicide through the
withdrawal of life- sustaining treatment. Physicians do not
fulfill the role of "killer" by prescribing drugs to hasten
death any more than they do by disconnecting life-support
systems. Likewise, "psychological pressure" can be
applied just as much upon the elderly and infirm to
consent to withdrawal of life-sustaining equipment as to
take drugs to hasten death. There is no clear indication
that there has been any problem in regard to the former,
and there should be none as to the latter. In any event, the
state of New York may establish rules and procedures to
assure that all choices are free of such pressures. With
respect to the protection of minorities, the poor and the
non-mentally handicapped, it suffices to say that these
classes of persons are entitled to treatment equal to that
afforded to all those who now may hasten death by means
of life-support withdrawal. In point of fact, these persons
themselves are entitled to hasten death by requesting such
withdrawal and should be free to do so by requesting
appropriate medication to terminate life during the final
stages of terminal illness.

As to the interest in avoiding abuse similar to that
occurring in the Netherlands, it seems clear that some
physicians there practice nonvoluntary euthanasia,
although it is not legal to do so. When Death Is Sought,
supra, at 133-34. The plaintiffs here do not argue for
euthanasia3 at all but for assisted suicide for terminally-
ill, mentally competent patients, who would self-
administer the lethal drugs. It is difficult to see how the
relief the plaintiffs seek would lead to the abuses found in
the Netherlands   Moreover, note should be taken of the
fact that the Royal Dutch Medical Association recently
adopted new guidelines for those physicians who choose
to accede to the wishes of patients to hasten death. Under
the new guidelines, patients must self-administer drugs
whenever possible, and physicians must obtain a second
opinion from another physician who has no relationship
with the requesting physician or his patient. Marlise
Simons, Dutch Doctors to Tighten Rules on Mercy
Killings, N.Y. Times, Sept. 11, 1995, at A3.

Finally, it seems clear that most physicians would agree
on the definition of "terminally ill," at least for the
purpose of the relief that plaintiffs seek. The plaintiffs
seek to hasten death only where a patient is in the "final
stages" of "terminal illness," and it seems even more
certain that physicians would agree on when this condition
occurs. Physicians are accustomed to advising patients
and their families in this regard and frequently do so
when decisions are to be made regarding the furnishing
or withdrawal of life-support systems. Again, New York
may define that stage of illness with greater particularity,
require the opinion of more than one physician or impose
any other obligation upon patients and physicians who
collaborate in hastening death.4

The New York statutes criminalizing assisted suicide
violate the Equal Protection Clause because, to the extent
that they prohibit a physician from prescribing
medications to be self- administered by a mentally
competent, terminally-ill person in the final stages of his
terminal illness, they are not rationally related to any
legitimate state interest.

CONCLUSION

We reverse the judgment of the district court and
remand for entry of judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in
accordance with the foregoing. No costs are awarded to
either side. See Fed. R. App. P. 39(a).

ENDNOTES

* The Honorable Milton Pollack of the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York,
sitting by designation.

1. On March 15, 1996, Delury pleaded guilty to second-
degree attempted manslaughter. Pam Belluck, Man Will
Get Prison Term for Helping His Wife Kill Herself, N.Y.
Times, Mar. 16, 1996, at 23, 26.

2. On rehearing in banc, the Ninth Circuit vacated the
decision of the panel and affirmed the decision of the
district court. Compassion in Dying v. Washington, No.
94-35534, 1996 WL 94848 (9th Cir. Mar. 6, 1996) (in
banc).

3. There are those who use the terms "assisted suicide"
and "euthanasia" interchangeably. See Patricia A. Unz,
Note, Euthanasia: A Constitutionally Protected Peaceful
Death, 37 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 439, 439 n.8 (1992).
While euthanasia is derived from the Greek words
meaning "good death," id. at 441, it seems clear that most
states, including New York, make a distinction between
the two acts. See When Death Is Sought, supra, at 63. In
euthanasia, one causes the death of another by direct and
intentional acts. Id. Accordingly, euthanasia falls within
the definition of murder in New York. See N.Y. Penal
Law Section 125.25(1) (McKinney 1987).

4. For example, the state might take steps to assure the
competence of prescribing physicians by imposing
education and training qualifications, including pain
management; it may require the establishment of local
ethics committees as resources for physicians faced with
questions relating to requests for lethal medications; it
could specify the information to be furnished to the
patient to ascertain that the patient's choice is a fully
voluntary one; it might require consultations with other
physicians for further diagnosis and prognosis in regard
to the patient's illness, for psychiatric evaluation, and for
evaluation of pain control possibilities; it may provide a
time delay between a request for lethal medication and the
prescription in order to allow a time for reflection; and it
may suggest some sort of notification to the patient's
family.

Recently, a group of physicians known as "Physicians
for Mercy" proposed ten guidelines for doctor-assisted
suicide. Doctors Offer Some Support to Kevorkian: Urge
10 Guidelines in Assisting Suicide, N.Y. Times, Dec. 5,
1995, at A21. These guidelines call for a physician who
assists in suicide, called an "obitiatrist," to refer his
patients to a psychiatrist, a specialist in the patient's
specific illness, and, if necessary, a specialist in pain
management, before acting at the behest of a mentally
competent person with an incurable affliction. Id.
"Physicians for Mercy" has decided to call the practice of
physician assisted suicide "patholysis," a term coined by
Dr. Jack Kevorkian, who has assisted in more than two
dozen suicides. Id. However, Dr. Kevorkian's assistance
has not been rendered exclusively to those beset by
terminal illnesses. Bruce Fein, The Right to Determine
One's Exit from Life, Wash. Times, Jan. 3, 1996, at A14.

<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>The Supreme Court Oct. 1 agreed to decide whether states may ban doctor-assisted suicides, setting the stage for a momentous ruling in the national debate over the ``right to die.''</P> 

<P>The justices said they will review federal appeals court rulings that let doctors in New York and Washington state prescribe life-ending drugs for mentally competent patients who are terminally ill and no longer want to live. <P>

<P>A decision by the nation's highest court is expected sometime by July. </P>

<P>Dr. Jack Kevorkian has become the central figure in this argument and shortly before his third assisted suicide trial, Court TV challenged Kevorkian's lawyer and a prosecutor opposing him to a Right-to-Die debate. On April 2, 1996, the second day of jury selection, defense lawyer Geoffrey Fieger and prosecutor John Skrzynski met after court On America Online's Center Stage. Questions were posed by the audience. The following is a transcript of that event.</P>
<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>Court TV:</B> Welcome to a right-to-die debate. Our guests tonight will be Jack Kevorkian's lawyer Geoffrey Fieger and Oakland County assistant prosecutor John Skrzynski. They are opposing attorneys in the Kevorkian trial that began this week.</P>

<P><B>Our rules tonight:</B> We will take questions from the audience. Then each lawyer will get a chance to offer his position. They will alternate; Mr. Skrynski will go first.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> How does the case last month [against Jack Kevorkian] differ from the one that's starting now?</P>

<P><B>John Skrzynski:</B> First, neither of the women involved in this case had a terminal illness. [In the last case, those who received assisted suicide had less than six months to live.] And second, the last case was prosecuted under a statute, while this case is being brought under the common law. So the law is different [this time], too. And what we have to prove is different.</P>

<P>As of today, it is still not settled exactly what the elements of the crime are. The Court of Appeals will be deciding that issue soon. The Supreme Court has halted the trial until the Court of Appeals decides.</P>

<P><B>Geoffrey Fieger:</B> This case is different from the prior case in several ways. First, the prior case was tried under a law that had expired. The jury had found Dr. Kevorkian not guilty on both charges. The jury found that Dr. Kevorkian had intended to relieve pain and suffering, and was not the killer that the prosecutor had painted him to be.</P>

<P>The new case is the equivalent of children playing a game and making up the rules as they go along. In Michigan, the appellate court system is populated by right-wing radicals. When they saw that no jury would convict Dr. Kevorkian under a law passed by the legislature, the radicals made up a law and claimed it was an unwritten common law that had secretly existed -- and no one knew about. Thus, the new case claimed that Dr. Kevorkian, in 1991, violated a secret unwritten law that had not been discovered until late 1994. Can one believe that this is going on in America in 1996?</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> I understand in this case that the prosecutors are not using the so-called Anti-Kevorkian law. They are using the Michigan common law. What does Michigan common law say on medically assisted suicide?</P>

<P><B>Geoffrey Fieger:</B> There is no such thing as unwritten Michigan common law unless you believe in the tooth fairy. Apparently, according to the prosecutor, unwritten law is whatever they can get a fascist on the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court to say it is at any particular time.</P>

<P><B>John Skrzynski:</B> This is the very first opportunity for [Kevorkian] to be tried under the common law. The court did not find a common law offense existed after Kevorkian was acquitted; rather, they interpreted the law. Originally, under Michigan case law, assisting a suicide was considered murder. That was on our books as early as the 1920's. In 1994, the Michigan Supreme Court modified the law, changing assisting suicide from murder to a five- year felony called criminal assisted suicide.</P>

<P>There is no fascist plot anywhere -- it is simply an interpretation of Michigan's laws. As to what common law is, before laws were collected as statutes, disputes were decided on a case-by-case basis. Gradually courts began to keep records of their findings, and those records were used to guide courts in deciding similar subsequent disputes. This collection of records is the common law. Eventually the common law was codified by legislatures into statutes. Michigan's constitution preserves any of the common law.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What would Dr. Kevorkian do if someone <I>did</I> change their mind at the last minute? Could he stop the process?</P>

<P><B>Geoffrey Fieger:</B> The patient always has total control and can stop the process up until the last moment. Dr. Kevorkian has absolutely no control over the process. It is totally under the patient's control. With the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals [decision], and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruling today that assisted suicide is a constitutional right, the trial going on in Michigan against Dr. Kevorkian is the equivalent of trying to jail Rosa Parks for riding in the front of the bus.</P>

<P><B>John Skrzynski:</B> Neither of [those] two federal courts involved Michigan; furthermore, when the Michigan Supreme Court held that assisted suicide is not constitutional right, and Kevorkian tried to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, they refused to hear the case. It is likely that the U.S. Supreme Court will reverse both the Second and Ninth Circuit courts.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> I understand Dr. Kevorkian [came to court] dressed like Thomas Jefferson this week and in the last trial he dressed like a prisoner from the Middle Ages. What sort of message is he trying to send by doing this?</P>

<P><B>John Skrzynski:</B> Kevorkian belittles the system. He has always failed in the system -- and so he belittles it. The only way he has gotten notoriety and attention is by defying the system. Everything he does demonstrates what an outsider he is. This is just another example.</P>

<P><B>Geoffrey Fieger:</B> If it weren't for Jack Kevorkian, the Oregon voters would have never passed the law allowing assisted suicide. It would have never been on the ballot in Washington or California; the Ninth Circuit would not have ruled it was a fundamental right for the western United States and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals would not have ruled it was a fundament right for the eastern United States. Although Michigan is a progressive state, it has been politically taken over by the radical Christian right wing. As a result, the persecution against Dr. Kevorkian continues and whatever statement he can make to underscore to the world the anachronistic persecution that continues here is appropriate.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Is jury selection in this sort of case more important than in other cases, since this issue calls on people's personal beliefs?</P>

<P><B>Geoffrey Fieger:</B> Yes.</P>

<P><B>John Skrzynski:</B> I agree.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> If a person chooses death because of inadequate help and unaddressed pain relief, are they really making a free choice?</P>

<P><B>John Skrzynski:</B> Obviously they are under the influence of their pain, and I think you have to ask what kind of legitimate medical treatment they have had. Have they really had adequate treatment for their pain? A lot is available. Unfortunately the medical community may not be doing the best job of informing people of what <i>is</i> available.</P>

<P><B>Geoffrey Fieger:</B> One of the platitudes always used by the right-to- life organizations is that people who are dying or in tremendous pain are not getting adequate medical treatment or pain relief, and thus their desire to end their suffering by ending their life is the result of inadequate treatment. Until you are the person suffering from the pain, you cannot possibly know how horrible it really is. Who would want right-to-life [advocates] telling us that we have to continue to be tortured by the disease from which we are suffering?</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Has anyone suggested putting this trial on hold till the Supreme Court rules on this matter?</P>

<P><B>Geoffrey Fieger:</B> No one has suggested that this case be put on hold for two reasons: One, we don't want the case put on hold because the jury is going to acquit Dr. Kevorkian and expose the prosecutor for the fascist that he is. Two, the prosecutor does not want to put the case on hold, as any delay in the case might leave it pending during the election in the fall. The voters of Oakland County are sure to throw him out of office for the millions of dollars he has wasted for attempting to persecute Dr. Kevorkian.</P>

<P><B>John Skrzynski:</B> The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear Kevorkian's appeal from Michigan's ruling. The federal courts have held in direct contradiction to Michigan's Supreme Court. Therefore you can predict that the Supreme Court will reverse the federal court. As to his charges of a waste of taxpayer money, any money spent for the prosecution is part of the prosecutor's budget, allocated by the Board of Commissioners. No money being spent on Kevorkian would otherwise be spent on anything else. All the work that is given to the prosecutor is being done. There is no waste of money.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What other countries permit euthanasia? How is it accepted there?</P>

<P><B>John Skrzynski:</B> The one that I am most familiar with is the Netherlands. It is not legal there, but the law is simply not enforced. Studies have been done on the Netherlands and show that patients are being euthanized even against their will. So-called assisted suicide is being abused by doctors ors in the Netherlands. That is the true danger of assisted suicide: There is no meaningful way to regulate it. Once you open the floodgates, you lose control.</P>

<P><B>Geoffrey Fieger:</B> Everything the prosecutor said is bunk. To think that the Netherlands, a progressive western democracy, is liberalizing euthanasia even though the prosecutor claims it is being abused is absurd. Euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal in the following countries and geographic area, either on a <I>de facto</I> or a <I>de jure</I> [basis]: Netherlands, Northern Territories of Australia, Germany, Norway, nine western states of the U.S., including Oregon, California and Washington, New York and the other eastern states which make up the Second Circuit Court of Appeals district.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What does Kevorkian do if there is conflict in the family over dying? Would he take the case?</P>

<P><B>Geoffrey Fieger:</B> Dr. Kevorkian has strict set of criteria which would prevent him from taking a case if all the family members did not agree. This was particularly true in the case of Dr. Kloster, whose son felt that God intended that his father should suffer the ravages of Alzheimer's disease rather than end his life before he was curled up into a fetal position (the manner in which this disease would kill him).</P>

<P><B>John Skrzynski:</B> Kevorkian's alleged strict criteria arise from his book, <I>Medicide, the Goodness of Planned Death</I>, in which he says that his ultimate aim is not merely helping doomed people kill themselves. Kevorkian writes that he would find the greatest satisfaction in performing experiments and drug trials on live human beings before they are euthanized.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Is it possible that [assisted suicide] will move through each state because of the cost of dying?</P>

<P><B>John Skrzynski:</B> This is going to be one of the biggest threats of all involving assisted suicide. If assisted suicide becomes an option, I believe that there is a strong financial incentive to substitute assisted suicide for extended health care for those with chronic and terminal illnesses. Once the financial incentive kicks in we will lose control completely over assisted suicide and those who are exposed to it. Rather than an option, assisted suicide will become a duty. These are very real dangers in these times, and something people should think about.</P>

<P><B>Geoffrey Fieger:</B> The prosecutor mouths the lies of [the] right-to- life [movement] and the moneyed medical society. Can you believe that in America in 1996 we have people like the Oakland County prosecutor not only saying that when we are suffering we can be kept alive against our will, but also that they can take all our money from us while they are keeping us alive? We all need to be protected from these people. These people are really dangerous -- they are the equivalent of communists trying to run our life. Anyone who loves freedom will take a stand against these people. If we don't, they own our lives, and government can tell us when we are allowed to die.</P>

<P><B>John Skrzynski:</B> Just get Kevorkian's book and read it. I think you will be shocked and amazed by what he really has to say.</P>

<P><B>Court TV:</B> I want to thank both our guests.</P>

<P>Jane Bronstein, a 54-year-old woman from New York City, did not think it funny that a videotape of her eating a peach in an unsightly manner at the U.S. Open was repeatedly shown on "The Late Show" with David Letterman. In this Jan. 26, 1996 complaint, she claims Letterman used the images in advertisements and on the Times Square Jumbotron giant screen television in violation of her right to privacy and other civil rights. <PRE> </P>

<P>A federal appeals court ruled March 6, 1996, that the state of Washington's ban on doctor-assisted suicide was unconstitutional. The case was the first of its kind to be decided by a full federal appeals court.  Judge Richard Reinhardt of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said the state's ban violates the rights of a mentally competent, terminally ill adult to have "a dignified and humane death." </P>

REINHARDT, Circuit Judge:

I.

This case raises an extraordinarily important and difficult issue.
It compels us to address questions to which there are no easy or
simple answers, at law or otherwise. It requires us to confront
the most basic of human concerns -- the mortality of self and
loved ones -- and to balance the interest in preserving human life
against the desire to die peacefully and with dignity. People of
good will can and do passionately disagree about the proper
result, perhaps even more intensely than they part ways over the
constitutionality of restricting a woman's right to have an
abortion. Heated though the debate may be, we must determine
whether and how the United States Constitution applies to the
controversy before us, a controversy that may touch more people
more profoundly than any other issue the courts will face in the
foreseeable future.

Today, we are required to decide whether a person who is
terminally ill has a constitutionally-protected liberty interest
in hastening what might otherwise be a protracted, undignified,
and extremely painful death. If such an interest exists, we must
next decide whether or not the state of Washington may
constitutionally restrict its exercise by banning a form of
medical assistance that is frequently requested by terminally ill
people who wish to die. We first conclude that there is a
constitutionally-protected liberty interest in determining the
time and manner of one's own death, an interest that must be
weighed against the state's legitimate and countervailing
interests, especially those that relate to the preservation of
human life. After balancing the competing interests, we conclude
by answering the narrow question before us: We hold that insofar
as the Washington statute prohibits physicians from prescribing
life-ending medication for use by terminally ill, competent adults
who wish to hasten their own deaths, it violates the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

II.

Preliminary Matters and History of the Case

This is the first right-to-die case that this court or any other
federal court of appeals has ever decided.[FOOTNOTE 1] The
plaintiffs are four physicians who treat terminally ill patients,
three terminally ill patients, and a Washington non-profit
organization called Compassion In Dying.[FOOTNOTE 2] The four
physicians -- Dr. Harold Glucksberg, Dr. Thomas A. Preston, Dr.
Abigail Halperin, and Dr. Peter Shalit -- are respected doctors
whose expertise is recognized by the state. All declare that they
periodically treat terminally ill, competent adults who wish to
hasten their deaths with help from their physicians. The doctors
state that in their professional judgment they should provide that
help but are deterred from doing so by a Washington statute that
makes it a felony to knowingly aid another person to commit
suicide.

Under the Washington statute, aiding a person who wishes to end
his life constitutes a criminal act and subjects the aider to the
possibility of a lengthy term of imprisonment, even if the
recipient of the aid is a terminally ill, competent adult and the
aider is a licensed physician who is providing medical assistance
at the request of the patient. The Washington statute provides in
pertinent part: "A person is guilty of promoting a suicide when he
knowingly causes or aids another person to attempt suicide." RCW
9A.36.060 (emphasis added). A violation of the statute constitutes
a felony punishable by imprisonment for a maximum of five years
and a fine of up to $10,000. RCW 9A.36.060(2) and 9A.20.020(1)(c).

On appeal, the four plaintiff-doctors asserted the rights of
terminally ill, competent adult patients who wished to hasten
their deaths with the help of their physicians so that they might
die peacefully and with dignity. That group included the three
patient-plaintiffs. The district court described the
patient-plaintiffs, each of whom desired to obtain prescription
drugs to hasten his death, as follows:

Jane Roe is a 69-year-old retired pediatrician who has suffered
since 1988 from cancer which has now metastasized throughout her
skeleton. Although she tried and benefitted temporarily from
various treatments including chemotherapy and radiation, she is
now in the terminal phase of her disease. In November 1993, her
doctor referred her to hospice care. Only patients with a life
expectancy of less than six months are eligible for such care.

Jane Roe has been almost completely bedridden since June of 1993
and experiences constant pain, which becomes especially sharp and
severe when she moves. The only medical treatment available to her
at this time is medication, which cannot fully alleviate her pain.
In addition, she suffers from swollen legs, bed sores, poor
appetite, nausea and vomiting, impaired vision, incontinence of
bowel, and general weakness.

Jane Roe is mentally competent and wishes to hasten her death by
taking prescribed drugs with the help of Plaintiff Compassion in
Dying. In keeping with the requirements of that organization, she
has made three requests for its members to provide her and her
family with counseling, emotional support, and any necessary
ancillary drug assistance at the time she takes the drugs.

John Doe is a 44-year-old artist dying of AIDS. Since his
diagnosis in 1991, he has experienced two bouts of pneumonia,
chronic, severe skin and sinus infections, grand mal seizures and
extreme fatigue. He has already lost 70% of his vision to
cytomegalovirus retinitis, a degenerative disease which will
result in blindness and rob him of his ability to paint. His
doctor has indicated that he is in the terminal phase of his
illness.

John Doe is especially cognizant of the suffering imposed by a
lingering terminal illness because he was the primary caregiver
for his long-term companion who died of AIDS in June of 1991. He
also observed his grandfather's death from diabetes preceded by
multiple amputations as well as loss of vision and hearing. Mr.
Doe is mentally competent, understands there is no cure for AIDS
and wants his physician to prescribe drugs which he can use to
hasten his death.

James Poe is a 69-year-old retired sales representative who
suffers from emphysema, which causes him a constant sensation of
suffocating. He is connected to an oxygen tank at all times, and
takes morphine regularly to calm the panic reaction associated
with his feeling of suffocation. Mr. Poe also suffers from heart
failure related to his pulmonary disease which obstructs the flow
of blood to his extremities and causes severe leg pain. There are
no cures for his pulmonary and cardiac conditions, and he is in
the terminal phase of his illness. Mr. Poe is mentally competent
and wishes to commit suicide by taking physician-prescribed drugs.

Compassion In Dying, 850 F. Supp. at 1456-57.

The names of the patients are pseudonymous in order to protect
their privacy. All three patients died after the case began. Two
had died by the time the District Court issued its decision. See
Compassion In Dying v. State of Washington, 850 F.Supp. 1454, 1456
n.2 (W.D. Wash. 1994). The other died prior to the date of the
decision by the three-judge panel of this court. Compassion In
Dying v. State of Washington, 49 F.3d 586, 588 (9th Cir. 1995).

Since the District Court properly granted the physicians standing
to assert the rights of their terminally ill patients in general,
850 F.Supp. at 1467, it is clear that this case was not rendered
moot by the death of the three named patients. The physicians meet
both Article III and jurisprudential standing requirements. See
Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 116-17 (1976) (holding that
doctors had standing to challenge -- on behalf of women patients
in general -- a Missouri law banning Medicaid reimbursement for
abortions that were not medically required). See also Doe v.
Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 188 (1973) (holding that physicians,
asserting the rights of their patients, have standing to challenge
the constitutionality of a criminal abortion statute even though
"the record does not disclose that any one of them has been
prosecuted, or threatened with prosecution, for violation of the
State's abortion statutes"); Planned Parenthood of Cent. Mo. v.
Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 62 (1976) (same). Although there is some
ambiguity in Bolton as to whether the physicians were asserting
their own rights or the rights of their patients, the Court in
Singleton, after discussing Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479
(1965), described Bolton as a case "where the Court also permitted
physicians to assert the rights of their patients."[FOOTNOTE 3]

The doctors in Bolton were held to have standing to assert their
patients' rights even though the doctors had never been threatened
with prosecution. The doctors here also meet the standing
requirements because they run a severe risk of prosecution under
the Washington statute, which proscribes the very conduct in which
they seek to engage. The state has never indicated that it would
not prosecute doctors who violate that law. See Babbitt v. United
Farm Workers National Union, 442 U.S. 289 (1979) (holding that
plaintiff does not have to risk arrest or prosecution in order to
have standing to challenge the constitutionality of a criminal
statute). See also Planned Parenthood of Cent. Mo., 428 U.S. at
62; Bolton, 410 U.S. at 188 (saying that the "physician is the one
against whom these criminal statutes directly operate" and that
the "physician-appellants, therefore, assert a sufficiently direct
threat of personal detriment . . . . [and] should not be required
to await and undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole means of
seeking relief").

We need not decide whether, the deaths of the three
patient-plaintiffs would negate the ability of their lawyers to
continue the challenge that those patients brought while they were
still alive. See Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U.S.
498, 515 (1911) (holding a case is not moot when the controversy
is capable of repetition yet evading review). We note, however,
that in invoking the capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review
doctrine in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), the Court
specifically relied, in part, on the fact that other women would
become pregnant.[FOOTNOTE 4] The Court said:

[W]hen, as here, pregnancy is a significant fact in the
litigation, the normal 266-day human gestation period is so short
that the pregnancy will come to term before the usual appellate
procedure is complete. If that termination makes a case moot,
pregnancy litigation will seldom survive much beyond the trial
stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied. Our law
should not be that rigid. Pregnancy often comes more than once to
the same woman, and in the general population, if man is to
survive, it will always be with us.

Roe, 410 U.S. at 125 (emphasis added). So, too, unfortunately,
will terminal illness.[FOOTNOTE 5]

The District Court in this case reached only claims asserted by
two of the three categories of plaintiffs: the patients' claims
that they had a right to receive medical assistance from their
physicians and the claims that the physicians asserted on behalf
of their patients. It did not address the claim asserted by
Compassion In Dying. Nor, correlatively, did it reach the claim by
the terminally ill patients that they had a right to receive
assistance from organizations such as Compassion In Dying.

Like the District Court, we decide only claims brought by the
terminally ill patients and the doctors.[FOOTNOTE 6] We consider
those claims to the extent that they relate to the provision of
certain medical assistance to terminally ill persons by physicians
or persons acting pursuant to their authorization or direction.
The claims involving Compassion In Dying are not before us. The
district court suggested that it would reach those additional
claims at a later stage in the proceedings if Compassion In Dying
so desired. We have jurisdiction over this appeal from partial
summary judgment because the district court certified the appeal
at the request of both parties under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 54(b).

The plaintiffs do not challenge Washington statute RCW 9A.36.060
in its entirety. Specifically they do not object to the portion of
the Washington statute that makes it unlawful for a person
knowingly to cause another to commit suicide. Rather, they only
challenge the statute's "or aids" provision. They challenge that
provision both on its face and as applied to terminally ill,
mentally competent adults who wish to hasten their own deaths with
the help of medication prescribed by their doctors.[FOOTNOTE 7]
The plaintiffs contend that the provision impermissibly prevents
the exercise by terminally ill patients of a
constitutionally-protected liberty interest in violation of the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and also that it
impermissibly distinguishes between similarly situated terminally
ill patients in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.

In an extremely thoughtful opinion, Chief District Judge Barbara
Rothstein held that "a competent, terminally ill adult has a
constitutionally guaranteed right under the Fourteenth Amendment
to commit physician-assisted suicide." 850 F. Supp. at 1462.
Ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court
concluded that the Washington statute places an undue burden on
the exercise of that constitutionally-protected liberty interest.
Id. at 1465. The District Court held that the Washington law also
violates the Equal Protection Clause because it impermissibly
treats similarly situated groups of terminally ill patients
differently. Id. at 1467. Although the scope of the relief the
District Judge ordered is not clear, id. 1456, 1459, 1462-1464,
1467, it appears that she declared the statute invalid only
insofar as it applies to the prescription of medication to
terminally ill competent adults who wish to hasten their deaths --
or, to use the district court's precise terminology, only insofar
as it applies to "physician-assisted suicide," id. at
1467.[FOOTNOTE 8]

On appeal, a three-judge panel of this court voted 2-1 to reverse
the district court decision. Compassion In Dying v. State of
Washington, 49 F.3d 586 (9th Cir. 1995). The majority held that
there is no due process liberty interest in physician-assisted
suicide. It also concluded that the Washington statute does not
violate the Equal Protection Clause. Accordingly, the majority
held that the statute is not invalid facially or as applied. Judge
Wright dissented and would have held that the statute is invalid
as applied to terminally ill, mentally competent adults because it
violates their privacy and equal protection rights. Id. at 594,
597 (Wright, J., dissenting). Because of the extraordinary
importance of this case, we decided to rehear it en banc.
Compassion In Dying v. State of Wash., 62 F.3d 299 (9th Cir.
1995).

We now affirm the District Court's decision and clarify the scope
of the relief. We hold that the "or aids" provision of Washington
statute RCW 9A.36.060, as applied to the prescription of
life-ending medication for use by terminally ill, competent adult
patients who wish to hasten their deaths, violates the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.[FOOTNOTE 9] Accordingly, we
need not resolve the question whether that provision, in
conjunction with other Washington laws regulating the treatment of
terminally ill patients,[FOOTNOTE 10] also violates the Equal
Protection Clause.

III.

Overview of Legal Analysis: Is There a Due Process Violation?

In order to answer the question whether the Washington statute
violates the Due Process Clause insofar as it prohibits the
provision of certain medical assistance to terminally ill,
competent adults who wish to hasten their own deaths, we first
determine whether there is a liberty interest in choosing the time
and manner of one's death -- a question sometimes phrased in
common parlance as: Is there a right to die? Because we hold that
there is, we must then determine whether prohibiting physicians
from prescribing life-ending medication for use by terminally ill
patients who wish to die violates the patients' due process
rights.

The mere recognition of a liberty interest does not mean that a
state may not prohibit the exercise of that interest in particular
circumstances, nor does it mean that a state may not adopt
appropriate regulations governing its exercise. Rather, in cases
like the one before us, the courts must apply a balancing test
under which we weigh the individual's liberty interests against
the relevant state interests in order to determine whether the
state's actions are constitutionally permissible. As Chief Justice
Rehnquist, writing for the Court, explained in Cruzan v. Director,
Missouri Dept. of Health, 497 U.S. 261 (1990), the only
right-to-die case that the Court has heretofore considered:

[D]etermining that a person has a "liberty interest" under the Due
Process Clause does not end our inquiry; "whether respondent's
constitutional rights have been violated must be determined by
balancing his liberty interests against the relevant state
interests." Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 321, 102 S.Ct. 2452,
2461, 73 L.Ed.2d 28, (1982); See also Mills v. Rogers, 457 U.S.
291, 299, 102 S.Ct. 2442, 2448, 73 L.Ed. 2d 16 (1982).

Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 279 (footnote omitted).

The Court has invoked a balancing test in a number of substantive
due process cases, not just in the right-to-die context. For
example, as the Cruzan Court noted, the Court applied a balancing
test in Youngberg  and Mills, liberty interest cases involving the
right to refuse medical treatment. Youngberg addressed the rights
of patients involuntarily committed to state mental institutions.
The Court said: "In determining whether a substantive right
protected by the Due Process Clause has been violated, it is
necessary to balance the liberty of the individual and the demands
of organized society." Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 320 (internal
citation and quotation omitted). Mills addressed the question of
the right of mental patients to refuse treatment with
antipsychotic drugs. There, the Court stated explicitly that the
"state interests" are "to be balanced against an individual's
liberty interests." 457 U.S. at 304. As the Cruzan Court also
noted, the use of a balancing test is deeply rooted in our legal
traditions. The Court has been applying a balancing test in
substantive due process cases at least since 1905, when in
Jacobsen v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905), "the Court balanced
an individual's liberty interest in declining an unwanted smallpox
vaccine against the State's interest in preventing disease."
Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 278.

As Justice O'Connor explained in her concurring opinion in Cruzan,
the ultimate question is whether sufficient justification exists
for the intrusion by the government into the realm of a person's
"liberty, dignity, and freedom." Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 287, 289
(O'Connor, J., concurring). If the balance favors the state, then
the given statute -- whether it regulates the exercise of a due
process liberty interest or prohibits that exercise to some degree
-- is constitutional. If the balance favors the individual, then
the statute -- whatever its justifications -- violates the
individual's due process liberty rights and must be declared
unconstitutional, either on its face or as applied. Here, we
conclude unhesitatingly that the balance favors the individual's
liberty interest.[FOOTNOTE 11]

IV.

Is There a Liberty Interest?

Before beginning our inquiry into whether a liberty interest
exists, we reiterate a few fundamental precepts that guide us. The
first lies in the Court's cautionary note in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S.
113, 116 (1973):

We forthwith acknowledge our awareness of the sensitive and
emotional nature of the . . . controversy, of the vigorous
opposing views, even among physicians, and of the deep and
seemingly absolute convictions that the subject inspires. One's
philosophy, one's experiences, one's exposure to the raw edges of
human existence, one's religious training, one's attitude toward
life and family and their values, and the moral standards one
establishes and seeks to observe, are all likely to influence and
to color one's thinking and conclusions . . . .

Like the Roe Court, we endeavor to conduct an objective analysis
of a most emotionally-charged of topics. In doing so, we bear in
mind the second Justice Harlan's admonition in his now-vindicated
dissent in Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 543 (1961) (Harlan, J.,
dissenting from dismissal on jurisdictional grounds):

[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process
Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the
specific guarantees elsewhere in the Constitution. This 'liberty'
is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the
taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion;
the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable
searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum
which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial
arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints, . . . and which
also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must,
that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of
the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment.

Applying Justice Harlan's teaching, we must strive to resist the
natural judicial impulse to limit our vision to that which can
plainly be observed on the face of the document before us, or even
that which we have previously had the wisdom to recognize.

Most important, we undertake our difficult task with a profound
respect for the noble objectives of the Constitution, as described
by Justice Brandeis in the second most famous dissent in American
jurisprudence.[FOOTNOTE 12] In Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S.
438 (1928), Justice Brandeis wrote, and his words have since been
quoted in full in several opinions of the Court and in innumerable
appellate court decisions:

The makers of our Constitution undertook to secure conditions
favorable to the pursuit of happiness. They recognized the
significance of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings and of his
intellect. They knew that only a part of the pain, pleasure and
satisfaction of life are to be found in material things. They
sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts,
their emotions and their sensations. They conferred, as against
the government, the right to be let alone -- the most
comprehensive of rights, and the right most valued by civilized
men.

Id. at 478 (Brandeis, J., dissenting).

In examining whether a liberty interest exists in determining the
time and manner of one's death, we begin with the compelling
similarities between right-to-die cases and abortion cases. In the
former as in the latter, the relative strength of the competing
interests changes as physical, medical, or related circumstances
vary. In right-to-die cases the outcome of the balancing test may
differ at different points along the life cycle as a person's
physical or medical condition deteriorates, just as in abortion
cases the permissibility of restrictive state legislation may vary
with the progression of the pregnancy.[FOOTNOTE 13] Equally
important, both types of cases raise issues of life and death, and
both arouse similar religious and moral concerns. Both also
present basic questions about an individual's right of choice.

Historical evidence shows that both abortion and assisted suicide
were for many years condemned, but that the efforts to prevent
people from engaging in the condemned conduct were always at most
only partially successful. Even when prohibited, abortions and
assisted-suicides flourished in back alleys, in small street-side
clinics, and in the privacy of the bedroom. Deprived of the right
to medical assistance, many pregnant women and terminally ill
adults ultimately took matters into their own hands, often with
tragic consequences.

Because they present issues of such profound spiritual importance
and because they so deeply affect individuals' right to determine
their own destiny, the abortion and right-to-die cases have given
rise to a highly emotional and divisive debate. In many respects,
the legal arguments on both sides are similar, as are the
constitutional principles at issue.

In deciding right-to-die cases, we are guided by the Court's
approach to the abortion cases. Casey in particular provides a
powerful precedent, for in that case the Court had the opportunity
to evaluate its past decisions and to determine whether to adhere
to its original judgment. Although Casey was influenced by the
doctrine of stare decisis, the fundamental message of that case
lies in its statements regarding the type of issue that confronts
us here: "These matters, involving the most intimate and personal
choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to
personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty
protected by the Fourteenth Amendment." Casey, 112 S.Ct. at 2807.

A.

Defining the Liberty Interest and Other Relevant Terms

The majority opinion of the three-judge panel that first heard
this case on appeal defined the claimed liberty interest as a
"constitutional right to aid in killing oneself." Compassion In
Dying, 49 F.3d at 591 (emphasis added). However, the subject we
must initially examine is not nearly so limited. Properly
analyzed, the first issue to be resolved is whether there is a
liberty interest in determining the time and manner of one's
death. We do not ask simply whether there is a liberty interest in
receiving "aid in killing oneself" because such a narrow interest
could not exist in the absence of a broader and more important
underlying interest -- the right to die. In short, it is the end
and not the means that defines the liberty interest.

The broader approach we employ in defining the liberty interest is
identical to the approach used by the Supreme Court in the
abortion cases. In those cases, the Court initially determined
whether a general liberty interest existed (an interest in having
an abortion), not whether there was an interest in implementing
that general liberty interest by a particular means (with medical
assistance). Specifically, in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973),
the Court determined that women had a liberty interest in securing
an abortion, not that women had a liberty interest in obtaining
medical assistance for purpose of an abortion. The Court did so
even though the Texas statute at issue did not prohibit a woman
from inducing her own abortion; nor did it criminalize a woman's
conduct in securing an abortion. Rather, the Texas statute, like
the Washington statute here, prohibited the rendering of
assistance; specifically, the Texas statute prohibited only
assisting a woman to secure an abortion. Roe, 410 U.S. at 151-52.
The Court first determined that a woman had a constitutional right
to choose an abortion. Only after it did so, did it proceed to the
second step: to determine whether the state's prohibition on
assistance unconstitutionally restricted the exercise of that
liberty interest. Similarly, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 112
S.Ct. 2791 (1992), the Court first reaffirmed, after extensive
analysis, its earlier holding that women have a liberty interest
in obtaining an abortion. In determining the existence of that
liberty interest, the Court did not address the subject of spousal
notification. As in Roe, only after affirming a woman's right to
have an abortion, did the Court proceed to the second step: to
examine whether the statutory provision requiring married women to
notify their spouses prior to obtaining an abortion posed an undue
burden on the exercise of that liberty interest. In this case, our
analysis is necessarily the same. First we must determine whether
there is a liberty interest in determining the time and manner of
one's death; if so, we must then examine whether Washington's ban
on assisted suicide unconstitutionally restricts the exercise of
that liberty interest.

While some people refer to the liberty interest implicated in
right-to-die cases as a liberty interest in committing suicide, we
do not describe it that way. We use the broader and more accurate
terms, "the right to die," "determining the time and manner of
one's death," and "hastening one's death" for an important reason.
The liberty interest we examine encompasses a whole range of acts
that are generally not considered to constitute "suicide."
Included within the liberty interest we examine, is for example,
the act of refusing or terminating unwanted medical treatment. As
we discuss later at pp. 3179-3180, a competent adult has a liberty
interest in refusing to be connected to a respirator or in being
disconnected from one, even if he is terminally ill and cannot
live without mechanical assistance. The law does not classify the
death of a patient that results from the granting of his wish to
decline or discontinue treatment as "suicide." Nor does the law
label the acts of those who help the patient carry out that wish,
whether by physically disconnecting the respirator or by removing
an intravenous tube, as assistance in suicide. Accordingly, we
believe that the broader terms -- "the right to die," "controlling
the time and manner of one's death," and "hastening one's death"
-- more accurately describe the liberty interest at issue here.
Moreover, as we discuss later, we have serious doubts that the
terms "suicide" and "assisted suicide" are appropriate legal
descriptions of the specific conduct at issue here. See infra
3185-3186.

There is one further definitional matter we should emphasize.
Following our determination regarding the existence of a liberty
interest in hastening one's death, we examine whether the
Washington statute unconstitutionally infringes on that liberty
interest. Throughout that examination, we use the term
"physician-assisted suicide," a term that does not appear in the
Washington statute but is frequently employed in legal and medical
discussions involving the type of question before us. For purposes
of this opinion, we use physician-assisted suicide as it is used
by the parties and district court and as it is most frequently
used: the prescribing of medication by a physician for the purpose
of enabling a patient to end his life.[FOOTNOTE 14] It is only
that conduct that the plaintiffs urge be held
constitutionally-protected in this case.[FOOTNOTE 15]

B.

The Legal Standard

There is no litmus test for courts to apply when deciding whether
or not a liberty interest exists under the Due Process Clause. Our
decisions involve difficult judgments regarding the conscience,
traditions, and fundamental tenets of our nation. We must
sometimes apply those basic principles in light of changing values
based on shared experience. Other times we must apply them to new
problems arising out of the development and use of new
technologies. In all cases, our analysis of the applicability of
the protections of the Constitution must be made in light of
existing circumstances as well as our historic traditions.

Historically, the Court has classified "fundamental rights" as
those that are "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty," Palko
v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325-26 (1937). The Court reasserted
this historic standard, along with an alternative description, in
its highly controversial Bowers v. Hardwick opinion, 478 U.S. 186,
191-92 (1986):[FOOTNOTE 16]

Striving to assure itself and the public that announcing rights
not readily identifiable in the Constitution's text involves much
more than the imposition of the Justices' own choice of values on
the States and the Federal Government, the Court has sought to
identify the nature of the rights qualifying for heightened
judicial protection. In Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325,
326, 82 L.Ed 288, 58 S.Ct. 149 (1937), it was said that this
category includes those fundamental liberties that are "implicit
in the concept of ordered liberty," such that "neither liberty nor
justice would exist if [they] were sacrificed." A different
description of fundamental liberties appeared in Moore v. East
Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 503, 97 S. Ct. 1932, 1937, 52 L Ed. 2d
531 (1977) (opinion of POWELL, J.), where they are characterized
as those liberties that are "deeply rooted in this Nation's
history and tradition." Id. at 503, 97 S.Ct. at 1938 (POWELL, J.).

In recent years, the Court has spoken more frequently of
substantive due process interests than of fundamental due process
rights. Compare Thornburgh v. American Coll. of Obst., 476 U.S.
747, 772 (1986) (describing "fundamental right" to abortion) and
Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.S. 416,
420 n.1 (1983) (same) with Webster v. Reproductive Health
Services, 492 U.S. 490, 520 (1989) (plurality opinion) (describing
women's entitlement to an abortion as a "liberty interest
protected by Due Process Clause"). See also Cruzan, 497 U.S. 2841.
The Court has also recently expressed a strong reluctance to find
new fundamental rights. Collins v. City of Harker Heights, Tex.,
112 S.Ct. 1061, 1068 (1992).

The Court's evolving doctrinal approach to substantive due process
claims is consistent with the basic truth enunciated by Justice
Harlan and later endorsed by the Court in Casey: "the full scope
of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause is a rational
continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all
substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints . .
543 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting from dismissal on
jurisdictional grounds).[FOOTNOTE 17] As Justice Harlan noted,
some liberty interests are weightier than others. Under the
Court's traditional jurisprudence, those classified as fundamental
rights cannot be limited except to further a compelling and
narrowly tailored state interest. See Collins, 112 S.Ct. at 1068.
Other important interests, such as the liberty interest in
refusing unwanted medical treatment, are subject to a balancing
test that is less restrictive, but nonetheless requires the state
to overcome a substantial hurdle in justifying any significant
impairment.

Recent cases, including Cruzan, suggest that the Court may be
heading towards the formal adoption of the continuum approach,
along with a balancing test, in substantive due process cases
generally. If so, there would no longer be a two-tier or
three-tier set of tests that depends on the classification of the
right or interest as fundamental, important, or marginal. Instead,
the more important the individual's right or interest, the more
persuasive the justifications for infringement would have to be.
We see the evolution in the Court's approach more as a recognition
of the artificiality of the current classification system than as
a fundamental change in the Court's practical approach to specific
issues. So long as the liberty interest is an important one, the
state must shoulder the burden of justifying any significant
limitations it seeks to impose. However, we need not predict the
Court's future course in order to decide the case before us. Here,
as we have said, even under the Court's traditional mode of
analysis, a balancing test is applicable.

Nothing in Reno v. Flores, 113 S.Ct. 1439 (1993), the
insubstantial reed on which the dissent rests its case -- even
though the case was not cited by any of the parties or any of the
eleven amici who filed briefs before this court -- suggests
anything to the contrary. In Flores, the Court simply declined to
find a new fundamental right, and repeated its general reluctance
to do so. Id. at 1447. The Court did not, as the dissent implies,
purport to establish a new classification system under which all
liberty interests other than fundamental rights would be subject
to rational basis review. Nor did Flores purport to overrule, or
even hint at any desire to modify, the Court's ninety-year-old
practice of using a balancing test in liberty interest cases that
raise important issues of the type before us. In fact, Flores did
not mention Cruzan, Youngberg, Mills, Jacobsen, or any other
balancing case.[FOOTNOTE 18] While one might legitimately argue
either that the liberty interest at issue here rises to the level
of a fundamental right or that it is simply an important liberty
interest that is subject to a balancing test, one point is
absolutely clear: there can be no legitimate argument that
rational basis review is applicable, and nothing in Flores
suggests that it is.

Although in determining the existence of important rights or
liberty interests, the Court examines our history and experience,
it has stated on a number of occasions that the limits of the
substantive reach of the Due Process Clause are not frozen at any
point in time. In Casey, the Court said: "Neither the Bill of
Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the
adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the
substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment
protects." 112 S.Ct. at 2805. Justice Frankfurter may have put it
best when, writing for the Court in Rochin v. California, 342 U.S.
165, 171-72 (1952), he declared, "To believe that this judicial
exercise of judgment could be avoided by freezing 'due process of
law' at some fixed stage in time or thought is to suggest that the
most important aspect of constitutional adjudication is a function
for inanimate machines and not for judges . . . ." Certainly, it
would be difficult to imagine a more felicitous expression of the
dynamism of constitutional interpretation. Thus, while historical
analysis plays a useful role in any attempt to determine whether a
claimed right or liberty interest exists, earlier legislative or
judicial recognition of the right or interest is not a sine qua
non.

In Casey, the Court made it clear that the fact that we have
previously failed to acknowledge the existence of a particular
liberty interest or even that we have previously prohibited its
exercise is no barrier to recognizing its existence. In discussing
a woman's liberty interest in securing an abortion, the Casey
Court stated that pregnancy involves "suffering [that] is too
intimate and personal for the State to insist, without more, upon
its own vision of the woman's role, however dominant that vision
has been in the course of our history and culture." Casey, 112
S.Ct. at 2807 (emphasis added).

In contrast to Casey, the majority opinion of the three-judge
panel in the case now before us erroneously concluded that a
historical analysis alone is sufficient basis for rejecting
plaintiffs' claim to a substantive liberty interest or right.
Compassion In Dying, 49 F.3d at 591. As explained below, we
believe that the panel's historical account is misguided, but even
if it were indisputably correct, historical evidence alone is not
a sufficient basis for rejecting a claimed liberty
interest.[FOOTNOTE 19]

Were history our sole guide, the Virginia anti-miscegenation
statute that the Court unanimously overturned in Loving v.
Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967), as violative of substantive due
process and the Equal Protection Clause, would still be in force
because such anti-miscegenation laws were commonplace both when
the United States was founded and when the Fourteenth Amendment
was adopted.[FOOTNOTE 20] The Court explicitly acknowledged as
much in Casey, 112 S.Ct. at 2805, in rejecting the view that
substantive due process protects rights or liberties only if they
possess a historical pedigree. In Casey, the Court said:

It is . . . tempting . . . to suppose that the Due Process Clause
protects only those practices, defined at the most specific level,
that were protected against government interference by other rules
of law when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. . . . But such
a view would be inconsistent with our law. It is a promise of the
Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the
government may not enter. We have vindicated this principle
before. Marriage is mentioned nowhere in the Bill of Rights and
interracial marriage was illegal in most States in the 19th
century, but the Court was no doubt correct in finding it to be an
aspect of liberty protected against state interference by the
substantive component of the Due Process Clause in Loving v.
Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 18 L.Ed. 2d 1010
(1967), (relying, in an opinion for eight Justices, on the Due
Process Clause). Similar examples may be found in Turner v.
Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 94-99, 107 S. Ct. 2254, 2265-67, 96 L. Ed.2d
64 (1987) [holding that prisoners have a constitutionally
protected right to marry a civilian or other inmate]; in Carey v.
Population Services International, 431 U.S. 678, 684, 686, 97 S.
Ct. 2010, 2015-2017, 52 L.Ed.2d 675 (1977) [holding that the state
cannot prohibit the sale of contraceptives to all minors or bar
everyone but licensed pharmacists from selling contraceptives to
adults]; in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 481-82, 85 S.
Ct. 1678, 1680-81, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965) [holding that a
Connecticut law forbidding the use of contraceptives
unconstitutionally intrudes on the right of marital privacy] . . .

Casey, 112 S.Ct. at 2805. Indeed, if historical evidence of
accepted practices at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was
enacted were dispositive, the Court would not only have decided
Loving differently, but it would not have held that women have a
right to have an abortion. As the dissent pointed out in Roe, more
than three-quarters of the existing states (at least 28 out of 37
states), as well as eight territorial legislatures restricted or
prohibited abortions in 1868 when the Fourteenth Amendment was
adopted. Roe, 410 U.S. at 175-76 & n.1 (Rehnquist, J.,
dissenting).

Historical Attitudes Toward Suicide

The majority opinion of the three-judge panel claimed that "a
constitutional right to aid in killing oneself" was "unknown to
the past." Compassion In Dying, 49 F.3d at 591. As we have pointed
out at p. 3138, our inquiry is not so narrow. Nor is our
conclusion so facile. The relevant historical record is far more
checkered than the majority would have us believe.

Like the Court in Roe, we begin with ancient attitudes.[FOOTNOTE
21] In Greek and Roman times, far from being universally
prohibited, suicide was often considered commendable in
literature, mythology, and practice.

The first of all literary suicides, that of Oedipus' mother,
Jocasta, is made to seem praiseworthy, an honorable way out of an
insufferable situation. Homer records self-murder without comment,
as something natural and heroic. The legends bear him out. Aegeus
threw himself into the sea -- which therefore bore his name --
when he mistakenly thought his son Theseus had been slain by the
Minotaur.

A. Alvarez, The Background, in Suicide: The Philosophical Issues
18 (M.Pabst Battin and David J. Mayor, eds. 1980). In Athens, as
well as the Greek colonies of Marseilles and Ceos, magistrates
kept a supply of hemlock for those who wished to end their lives.
The magistrates even supplied those who wished to commit suicide
with the means to do so.

Whoever no longer wishes to live shall state his reasons to the
Senate, and after having received permission shall abandon life.
If your existence is hateful to you, die; if you are overwhelmed
by fate, drink the hemlock. If you are bowed with grief, abandon
life. Let the unhappy man recount his misfortune, let the
magistrate supply him with the remedy, and his wretchedness will
come to an end.[FOOTNOTE 22]

While Socrates counseled his disciples against committing suicide,
he willingly drank the hemlock as he was condemned to do, and his
example inspired others to end their lives. Id. at 19. Plato,
Socrates' most distinguished student, believed suicide was often
justifiable.

He suggested that if life itself became immoderate, then suicide
became a rational, justifiable act. Painful disease, or
intolerable constraint were sufficient reasons to depart. And this
when religious superstitions faded was philosophic justification
enough. Id.

Many contemporaries of Plato were even more inclined to find
suicide a legitimate and acceptable act. In Roe, while surveying
the attitudes of the Greeks toward abortion, the Court stated that
"only the Pythagorean school of philosophers frowned on the
related act of suicide," 410 U.S. at 131; it then noted that the
Pythagorean school represented a distinctly minority view. Id.

The Stoics glorified suicide as an act of pure rational
will.[FOOTNOTE 23] Cato, who killed himself to avoid dishonor when
Ceasar crushed his military aspirations, was the most celebrated
of the many suicides among the Stoics. Montaigne wrote of Cato:
"This was a man chosen by nature to show the heights which can be
attained by human steadfastness and constancy . . . . Such courage
is above philosophy."

Like the Greeks, the Romans often considered suicide to be
acceptable or even laudable.[FOOTNOTE 24]

To live nobly also meant to die nobly and at the right time.
Everything depended on a dominant will and a rational choice.

This attitude was reinforced by Roman law. . . . According to
Justinian's Digest, suicide of a private citizen was not
punishable if it was caused by "impatience of pain or sickness, or
by another cause," or by "weariness of life . . . lunacy, or fear
of dishonor." Since this covered every rational cause, all that
was left was the utterly irrational suicide "without cause," and
that was punishable on the grounds that "whoever does not spare
himself would much less spare another." In other words, it was
punished because irrational, not because it was a crime. Id. at
22-23.

The Romans did sometimes punish suicide. Under Roman law, people
convicted of crimes forfeited their property to the Emperor,
thereby disinheriting their heirs. Roman law imposed a special
penalty on people who were caught committing a crime and then
committed suicide prior to conviction to avoid forfeiting the
property. To protect the Emperor's interests, the property of
people who committed suicide under such circumstances was
forfeited, just as if they had been convicted of the crime
involved. Marzen at 57-58.

The early Christians saw death as an escape from the tribulations
of a fallen existence and as the doorway to heaven.[FOOTNOTE 25]
"In other words, the more powerfully the Church instilled in
believers the idea that this world was a vale of tears and sin and
temptation, where they waited uneasily until death released them
into eternal glory, the more irresistible the temptation to
suicide became." Id. at 25. The Christian impulse to martyrdom
reached its height with the Donatists, who were so eager to enter
into martyrdom that they were eventually declared heretics.
Gibbon, in the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, described
them this way:

They sometimes forced their way into courts of justice and
compelled the affrighted judge to give orders for their execution.
They frequently stopped travellers on the public highways and
obliged them to inflict the stroke of martyrdom by promise of a
reward, if they consented -- and by the threat of instant death,
if they refused to grant so singular a favour.[FOOTNOTE 26]

St. Augustine said of the Donatists, "to kill themselves out of
respect for martyrdom is their daily sport." Id. at 27. Prompted
in large part by the utilitarian concern that the rage for suicide
would deplete the ranks of Christians, St. Augustine argued that
committing suicide was a "detestable and damnable wickedness" and
was able to help turn the tide of public opinion. Id. Even
staunch opponents of a constitutional right to suicide acknowledge
that "there were many examples of Christian martyrs whose deaths
bordered on suicide, and confusion regarding the distinction
between suicide and martyrdom existed up until the time of St.
Augustine (354-430 A.D.)."[FOOTNOTE 27]

In 562 A.D., the Council of Braga denied funeral rites to anyone
who killed himself. A little more than a century later, in 693
A.D., the Council of Toledo declared that anyone who attempted
suicide should be excommunicated. Id. at 27-28. Once established,
the Christian view that suicide was in all cases a sin and crime
held sway for 1,000 years until philosophers, poets, and even some
clergymen -- Montesquieu, Voltaire, Diderot, Francis Bacon, David
Hume, John Donne, Sir Thomas More, among others[FOOTNOTE 28] --
began to challenge the all-encompassing nature of the dominant
ideology. In his book Utopia, Sir Thomas More, who was later
canonized by the Roman Catholic Church, strongly supported the
right of the terminally ill to commit suicide and also expressed
approval of the practice of assisting those who wished to hasten
their deaths.[FOOTNOTE 29] Hume argued that a decision by a
terminally ill patient to end his life was often
laudable.[FOOTNOTE 30] France even enacted a statute legalizing
suicide in 1790, primarily as a result of the influence of the
nation's leading philosophers.[FOOTNOTE 31]

Suicide was a crime under the English common law, at least in
limited circumstances, probably as early as the thirteenth
century.[FOOTNOTE 32] Bracton, incorporating Roman Law as set
forth in Justinian's Digest, declared that if someone commits
suicide to avoid conviction of a felony, his property escheats to
his lords.[FOOTNOTE 33] Bracton said "[i]t ought to be otherwise
if he kills himself through madness or unwillingness to endure
suffering."[FOOTNOTE 34] Despite his general fidelity to Roman
law, Bracton did introduce a key innovation: "[I]f a man slays
himself in weariness of life or because he is unwilling to endure
further bodily pain . . . he may have a successor, but his movable
goods [personal property] are confiscated. He does not lose his
inheritance [real property], only his movable goods."[FOOTNOTE 35]
Bracton's innovation was incorporated into English common law,
which has thus treated suicides resulting from the inability to
"endure further bodily pain" with compassion and understanding
ever since a common law scheme was firmly established.

Sir Edward Coke, in his Third Institute published in 1644, held
that killing oneself was an offense and that someone who committed
suicide should forfeit his movable property. But Coke listed an
exception for someone who "by the rage of sickness or infirmity or
otherwise," kills himself "while he is not of compos mentia," or
sound mind.[FOOTNOTE 36] In eighteenth century England, many and
perhaps most juries compensated for the perceived unfairness of
the law by concluding that anyone who killed himself was
necessarily not of sound mind.[FOOTNOTE 37] Thus, although,
formally, suicide was long considered a crime under English common
law, in practice it was a crime that was punished leniently, if at
all, because juries frequently used their power to nullify the
law.

The traditional English experience was also shaped by the taboos
that have long colored our views of suicide and perhaps still do
today. English common law reflected the ancient fear that the
spirit of someone who ended his own life would return to haunt the
living. Accordingly, the traditional practice was to bury the body
at a crossroads -- either so the suicide could not find his way
home or so that the frequency of travelers would keep his spirit
from rising.[FOOTNOTE 38] As added insurance, a stake was driven
through the body.

English attitudes toward suicide, including the tradition of
ignominious burial, carried over to America[FOOTNOTE 39] where
they subsequently underwent a transformation. By 1798, six of the
13 original colonies had abolished all penalties for suicide
either by statute or state constitution.[FOOTNOTE 40] There is no
evidence that any court ever imposed a punishment for suicide or
attempted suicide under common law in post-revolutionary
America.[FOOTNOTE 41] By the time the Fourteenth Amendment was
adopted in 1868, suicide was generally not punishable, and in only
nine of the 37 states is it clear that there were statutes
prohibiting assisting suicide.[FOOTNOTE 42]

The majority of states have not criminalized suicide or attempted
suicide since the turn of the century.[FOOTNOTE 43] The New Jersey
Supreme Court declared in 1901 that since suicide was not
punishable it should not be considered a crime. "[A]ll will admit
that in some cases it is ethically defensible," the court said, as
when a woman kills herself to escape being raped or "when a man
curtails weeks or months of agony of an incurable disease."
Campbell v. Supreme Conclave Improved Order Heptasophs, 66 N.J.L.
274, 49 A. 550, 553 (1901).[FOOTNOTE 44] Today, no state has a
statute prohibiting suicide or attempted suicide; nor has any
state had such a statute for at least 10 years.[FOOTNOTE 45] A
majority of states do, however, still have laws on the books
against assisting suicide.[FOOTNOTE 46]

D.

Current Societal Attitudes

Clearly the absence of a criminal sanction alone does not show
societal approbation of a practice. Nor is there any evidence that
Americans approve of suicide in general. In recent years, however,
there has been increasingly widespread support for allowing the
terminally ill to hasten their deaths and avoid painful,
undignified, and inhumane endings to their lives. Most Americans
simply do not appear to view such acts as constituting suicide,
and there is much support in reason for that conclusion. See infra
at pp. 3185-3186.

Polls have repeatedly shown that a large majority of Americans --
sometimes nearing 90% -- fully endorse recent legal changes
granting terminally ill patients, and sometimes their families,
the prerogative to accelerate their death by refusing or
terminating treatment.[FOOTNOTE 47] Other polls indicate that a
majority of Americans favor doctor-assisted suicide for the
terminally ill. In April, 1990, the Roper Report found that 64% of
Americans believed that the terminally ill should have the right
to request and receive physician aid-in-dying.[FOOTNOTE 48]
Another national poll, conducted in October 1991, shows that
"nearly two out of three Americans favor doctor-assisted suicide
and euthanasia for terminally ill patients who request
it."[FOOTNOTE 49] A 1994 Harris poll found 73% of Americans favor
legalizing physician-assisted suicide.[FOOTNOTE 50] Three states
have held referenda on proposals to allow physicians to help
terminally ill, competent adults commit suicide with somewhat
mixed results. In Oregon, voters approved the carefully-crafted
referendum by a margin of 51 to 49 percent in November of
1994.[FOOTNOTE 51] In Washington and California where the measures
contained far fewer practical safeguards, they narrowly failed to
pass, each drawing 46 percent of the vote.[FOOTNOTE 52] As such
referenda indicate, there is unquestionably growing popular
support for permitting doctors to provide assistance to terminally
ill patients who wish to hasten their deaths.[FOOTNOTE 53]

Just as the mere absence of criminal statutes prohibiting suicide
or attempted suicide does not indicate societal approval so the
mere presence of statutes criminalizing assisting in a suicide
does not necessarily indicate societal disapproval. That is
especially true when such laws are seldom, if ever, enforced.
There is no reported American case of criminal punishment being
meted out to a doctor for helping a patient hasten his own
death.[FOOTNOTE 54] The lack of enforcement of statutes
prohibiting assisting a mentally competent, terminally ill adult
to end his own life would appear to reflect widespread societal
disaffection with such laws.[FOOTNOTE 55]

Our attitudes toward suicide of the type at issue in this case are
better understood in light of our unwritten history and of
technological developments. Running beneath the official history
of legal condemnation of physician-assisted suicide is a strong
undercurrent of a time-honored but hidden practice of physicians
helping terminally ill patients to hasten their deaths.[FOOTNOTE
56] According to a survey by the American Society of Internal
Medicine, one doctor in five said he had assisted in a patient's
suicide.[FOOTNOTE 57] Accounts of doctors who have helped their
patients end their lives have appeared both in professional
journals[FOOTNOTE 58] and in the daily press.[FOOTNOTE 59]

The debate over whether terminally ill patients should have a
right to reject medical treatment or to receive aid from their
physicians in hastening their deaths has taken on a new prominence
as a result of a number of developments. Two hundred years ago
when America was founded and more than one hundred years ago when
the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, Americans died from a slew
of illness and infirmities that killed their victims quickly but
today are almost never fatal in this nation -- scarlet fever,
cholera, measles, diarrhea, influenza, pneumonia, gastritis, to
name a few. Other diseases that have not been conquered can now
often be controlled for years, if not decades -- diseases such as
diabetes, muscular dystrophy, Parkinson's disease, cardiovascular
disease, and certain types of cancer. As a result, Americans are
living longer, and when they finally succumb to illness, lingering
longer, either in great pain or in a stuporous, semi-comatose
condition that results from the infusion of vast amounts of pain
killing medications.[FOOTNOTE 60] Despite the marvels of
technology, Americans frequently die with less dignity than they
did in the days when ravaging diseases typically ended their lives
quickly. AIDS, which often subjects its victims to a horrifying
and drawn-out demise, has also contributed to the growing number
of terminally ill patients who die protracted and painful deaths.

One result has been a growing movement to restore humanity and
dignity to the process by which Americans die.[FOOTNOTE 61] The
now recognized right to refuse or terminate treatment and the
emergent right to receive medical assistance in hastening one's
death are inevitable consequences of changes in the causes of
death, advances in medical science, and the development of new
technologies. Both the need and the capability to assist
individuals end their lives in peace and dignity have increased
exponentially.[FOOTNOTE 62]

E.

Prior Court Decisions

Next we examine previous Court decisions that delineate the
boundaries of substantive due process. We believe that a careful
examination of these decisions demonstrates that there is a strong
liberty interest in determining how and when one's life shall end,
and that an explicit recognition of that interest follows
naturally, indeed inevitably, from their reasoning.

The essence of the substantive component of the Due Process Clause
is to limit the ability of the state to intrude into the most
important matters of our lives, at least without substantial
justification.[FOOTNOTE 63] In a long line of cases, the Court has
carved out certain key moments and decisions in individuals' lives
and placed them beyond the general prohibitory authority of the
state. The Court has recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment
affords constitutional protection to personal decisions relating
to marriage, Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967), procreation,
Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535 (1942), family relationships,
Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944), child rearing and
education, Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 534-535
(1925), and intercourse for purposes other than procreation,
Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965). The Court has
recognized the right of individuals to be free from government
interference in deciding matters as personal as whether to bear or
beget a child, Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972), and
whether to continue an unwanted pregnancy to term, Roe v. Wade,
410 U.S. 113 (1973).[FOOTNOTE 64]

A common thread running through these cases is that they involve
decisions that are highly personal and intimate, as well as of
great importance to the individual.[FOOTNOTE 65] Certainly, few
decisions are more personal, intimate or important than the
decision to end one's life, especially when the reason for doing
so is to avoid excessive and protracted pain. Accordingly, we
believe the cases from Pierce through Roe provide strong general
support for our conclusion that a liberty interest in controlling
the time and manner of one's death is protected by the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

While the cases we have adverted to lend general support to our
conclusion, we believe that two relatively recent decisions of the
Court, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (1992) and
Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dept. of Health, 497 U.S. 261 (1990),
are fully persuasive, and leave little doubt as to the proper
result.

F.

Liberty Interest under Casey

In Casey, the Court surveyed its prior decisions affording
"constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to
marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child
rearing, and education", id. at 2807 and then said:

These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a
person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity
and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the
Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of liberty is the right to
define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the
universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these
matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they
formed under compulsion of the State.

Id. at 2807. The district judge in this case found the Court's
reasoning in Casey "highly instructive" and "almost prescriptive"
for determining "what liberty interest may inhere in a terminally
ill person's choice to commit suicide." Compassion In Dying, 850
F. Supp. at 1459. We agree.

Like the decision of whether or not to have an abortion, the
decision how and when to die is one of "the most intimate and
personal choices a person may make in a lifetime," a choice
"central to personal dignity and autonomy." A competent terminally
ill adult, having lived nearly the full measure of his life, has a
strong liberty interest in choosing a dignified and humane death
rather than being reduced at the end of his existence to a
childlike state of helplessness, diapered, sedated, incontinent.
How a person dies not only determines the nature of the final
period of his existence, but in many cases, the enduring memories
held by those who love him.

Prohibiting a terminally ill patient from hastening his death may
have an even more profound impact on that person's life than
forcing a woman to carry a pregnancy to term. The case of an AIDS
patient treated by Dr. Peter Shalit, one of the
physician-plaintiffs in this case, provides a compelling
illustration. In his declaration, Dr. Shalit described his
patient's death this way:

One patient of mine, whom I will call Smith, a fictitious name,
lingered in the hospital for weeks, his lower body so swollen from
oozing Kaposi's lesions that he could not walk, his genitals so
swollen that he required a catheter to drain his bladder, his
fingers gangrenous from clotted arteries. Patient Smith's friends
stopped visiting him because it gave them nightmares. Patient
Smith's agonies could not be relieved by medication or by the
excellent nursing care he received. Patient Smith begged for
assistance in hastening his death. As his treating doctor, it was
my professional opinion that patient Smith was mentally competent
to make a choice with respect to shortening his period of
suffering before inevitable death. I felt that I should
accommodate his request. However, because of the statute, I was
unable to assist him and he died after having been tortured for
weeks by the end-phase of his disease.[FOOTNOTE 66]

For such patients, wracked by pain and deprived of all pleasure, a
state-enforced prohibition on hastening their deaths condemns them
to unrelieved misery or torture. Surely, a person's decision
whether to endure or avoid such an existence constitutes one of
the most, if not the most, "intimate and personal choices a person
may make in a life-time," a choice that is "central to personal
dignity and autonomy." Casey, 112 S.Ct. at 2807. Surely such a
decision implicates a most vital liberty interest.

G.

Liberty Interest under Cruzan

In Cruzan, the Court considered whether or not there is a
constitutionally-protected, due process liberty interest in
terminating unwanted medical treatment. The Court said that an
affirmative answer followed almost inevitably from its prior
decisions holding that patients have a liberty interest in
refusing to submit to specific medical procedures. Those cases
include Jacobsen v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 24-30 (1905), in
which the Court balanced an individual's liberty interest in
declining an unwanted small pox vaccine against the State's
interest in preventing disease; Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S.
210, 221-222, in which the Court said: "The forcible injection of
medication into a nonconsenting person's body represents a
substantial interference with that person's liberty"; and Parham
v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 600 (1979), in which it said: "[A] child,
in common with adults, has a substantial liberty interest in not
being confined unnecessarily for medical treatment". Writing for a
majority that included Justices O'Connor and Scalia, Chief Justice
Rehnquist said that those cases helped answer the first critical
question at issue in Cruzan, stating: "The principle that a
competent person has a constitutionally protected liberty interest
in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred from our
prior decisions." Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 278 (emphasis
added).[FOOTNOTE 67]

In her concurrence, Justice O'Connor explained that the majority
opinion held (implicitly or otherwise) that a liberty interest in
refusing medical treatment extends to all types of medical
treatment from dialysis or artificial respirators to the provision
of food and water by tube or other artificial means. As Justice
O'Connor said: "I agree that a protected liberty interest in
refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred from our prior
decisions, and that the refusal of artificial delivery of food and
water is encompassed in that liberty interest." Cruzan, 497 U.S.
261, 287, 287 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (emphasis added).

Justice O'Connor further concluded that under the majority's
opinion, "[r]equiring a competent adult to endure such procedures
against her will burdens the patient's liberty, dignity, and
freedom to determine the course of her own treatment." Id. at 289
(O'Connor, J., concurring). In the majority opinion itself, Chief
Justice Rehnquist made a similar assertion, writing:

The choice between life and death is a deeply personal decision of
obvious and overwhelming finality. We believe Missouri may
legitimately seek to safeguard the personal element of this choice
through the imposition of heightened evidentiary requirements. It
cannot be disputed that the Due Process Clause protects an
interest in life as well as an interest in refusing
life-sustaining medical treatment.

Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 281 (emphasis added).

These passages make it clear that Cruzan stands for the
proposition that there is a due process liberty interest in
rejecting unwanted medical treatment, including the provision of
food and water by artificial means.[FOOTNOTE 68] Moreover, the
Court majority clearly recognized that granting the request to
remove the tubes through which Cruzan received artificial
nutrition and hydration would lead inexorably to her death.
Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 267-68, 283.[FOOTNOTE 69] Accordingly, we
conclude that Cruzan, by recognizing a liberty interest that
includes the refusal of artificial provision of life-sustaining
food and water, necessarily recognizes a liberty interest in
hastening one's own death.[FOOTNOTE 70]

H.

Summary

Casey and Cruzan provide persuasive evidence that the Constitution
encompasses a due process liberty interest in controlling the time
and manner of one's death -- that there is, in short, a
constitutionally recognized "right to die." Our conclusion is
strongly influenced by, but not limited to, the plight of mentally
competent, terminally ill adults. We are influenced as well by the
plight of others, such as those whose existence is reduced to a
vegetative state or a permanent and irreversible state of
unconsciousness. See note 68 supra.

Our conclusion that there is a liberty interest in determining the
time and manner of one's death does not mean that there is a
concomitant right to exercise that interest in all circumstances
or to do so free from state regulation. To the contrary, we
explicitly recognize that some prohibitory and regulatory state
action is fully consistent with constitutional principles.

In short, finding a liberty interest constitutes a critical first
step toward answering the question before us. The determination
that must now be made is whether the state's attempt to curtail
the exercise of that interest is constitutionally justified.





V.

Relevant Factors and Interests

To determine whether a state action that impairs a liberty
interest violates an individual's substantive due process rights
we must identify the factors relevant to the case at hand, assess
the state's interests and the individual's liberty interest in
light of those factors, and then weigh and balance the competing
interests. The relevant factors generally include: 1) the
importance of the various state interests, both in general and in
the factual context of the case; 2) the manner in which those
interests are furthered by the state law or regulation; 3) the
importance of the liberty interest, both in itself and in the
context in which it is being exercised; 4) the extent to which
that interest is burdened by the challenged state action; and, 5)
the consequences of upholding or overturning the statute or
regulation.

A.

The State's Interests

We analyze the factors in turn, and begin by considering the
first: the importance of the state's interests. We identify six
related state interests involved in the controversy before us: 1)
the state's general interest in preserving life; 2) the state's
more specific interest in preventing suicide; 3) the state's
interest in avoiding the involvement of third parties and in
precluding the use of arbitrary, unfair, or undue influence; 4)
the state's interest in protecting family members and loved ones;
5) the state's interest in protecting the integrity of the medical
profession; and, 6) the state's interest in avoiding adverse
consequences that might ensue if the statutory provision at issue
is declared unconstitutional.[FOOTNOTE 71]

1. Preserving Life

The state may assert an unqualified interest in preserving life in
general. As the Court said in Cruzan, "we think a State may
properly decline to make judgments about the 'quality' of life
that a particular individual may enjoy, and simply assert an
unqualified interest in the preservation of human life . . ."
Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 282. Thus, the state may assert its interest
in preserving life in all cases, including those of terminally
ill, competent adults who wish to hasten their deaths.

Although the state's interest in preserving life may be
unqualified, and may be asserted regardless of the quality of the
life or lives at issue, that interest is not always
controlling.[FOOTNOTE 72] Nor is it of the same strength in each
case. To the contrary, its strength is dependent on relevant
circumstances, including the medical condition and the wishes of
the person whose life is at stake.

Most tellingly, the state of Washington has already decided that
its interest in preserving life should ordinarily give way -- at
least in the case of competent, terminally ill adults who are
dependent on medical treatment-- to the wishes of the patients. In
its Natural Death Act, RCW 70.122.020 et seq., Washington permits
adults to have "life-sustaining treatment withheld or withdrawn in
instances of a terminal condition or permanent unconsciousness."
RCW 70.122.010.[FOOTNOTE 73] In adopting the statute, the
Washington legislature necessarily determined that the state's
interest in preserving life is not so weighty that it ought to
thwart the informed desire of a terminally ill, competent adult to
refuse medical treatment.

Not only does Washington law acknowledge that terminally ill and
permanently unconscious adults have a right to refuse
life-sustaining treatment, the statute includes specific
legislative findings that appear to recognize that a due process
liberty interest underlies that right. The statute states:

The legislature finds that adult persons have the fundamental
right to control the decisions relating to the rendering of their
own medical care, including the decision to have life-sustaining
procedures withheld or withdrawn in instances of terminal
condition.

The legislature further finds that modern medical technology has
made possible the artificial prolongation of human life beyond
natural limits.

The legislature further finds that, in the interest of protecting
individual autonomy, such prolongation of life for persons with a
terminal condition may cause loss of patient dignity, and
unnecessary pain and suffering, while providing nothing medically
necessary or beneficial to the patient.

RCW 70.122.010.[FOOTNOTE 74]

The Washington statute permits competent adults to reject
life-sustaining medical treatment in advance by means of living
wills and durable powers of attorney. RCW 70.122.010-030. Even in
cases in which the Washington Natural Death Act does not authorize
surrogate decision-making, the Washington Supreme Court has found
that legal guardians may sometimes have life-sustaining treatment
discontinued. In re Guardianship of Grant, 747 P.2d 445 (Wash.
1987); In re Colyer, 660 P.2d 738 (Wash. 1983).[FOOTNOTE 75]

There is nothing unusual about Washington's recognition that the
state's interest in preserving life is not always of the same
force and that in some cases at least other considerations may
outweigh the state's.[FOOTNOTE 76] More than 40 other states have
adopted living will statutes that permit competent adults to
declare by advance directive that they do not wish to be kept
alive by medical treatment in the latter stages of a terminal
illness.[FOOTNOTE 77] Like Washington, many states also permit
competent adults to determine in advance that they do not wish any
medical treatment should they become permanently and irreversibly
unconscious.[FOOTNOTE 78] Also, like Washington, many states allow
patients to delegate decision-making power to a surrogate through
a durable power of attorney, health care proxy, or similar device,
or permit courts to appoint surrogate decision-makers.[FOOTNOTE
79] Finally, Congress favors permitting adult patients to refuse
life-sustaining treatment by advance directive and requires
hospitals receiving federal financial support to notify adult
patients of their rights to execute such instruments upon
admission.[FOOTNOTE 80]

As the laws in state after state demonstrate, even though the
protection of life is one of the state's most important functions,
the state's interest is dramatically diminished if the person it
seeks to protect is terminally ill or permanently comatose and has
expressed a wish that he be permitted to die without further
medical treatment (or if a duly appointed representative has done
so on his behalf). When patients are no longer able to pursue
liberty or happiness and do not wish to pursue life, the state's
interest in forcing them to remain alive is clearly less
compelling. Thus, while the state may still seek to prolong the
lives of terminally ill or comatose patients or, more likely, to
enact regulations that will safeguard the manner in which
decisions to hasten death are made, the strength of the state's
interest is substantially reduced in such circumstances.

2. Preventing Suicide

a.

While the state's general commitment to the preservation of life
clearly encompasses the prevention of suicide, the state has an
even more particular interest in deterring the taking of one's own
life. The fact that neither Washington nor any other state
currently bans suicide, or attempted suicide, does not mean that
the state does not have a valid and important interest in
preventing or discouraging that act.

During the course of this litigation, the state has relied on its
interest in the prevention of suicide as its primary justification
for its statute.[FOOTNOTE 81] The state points to statistics
concerning the rate of suicide among various age groups,
particularly the young. Compassion In Dying, 850 F.Supp. at 1464.
As the state notes, in 1991, suicide was the second leading cause
of death after accidents for the age groups 15-19, 20-24, and
25-34 and one of the top five causes of death for age groups 35-44
and 45-54.[FOOTNOTE 82] These figures are indeed distressing.

Although suicide by teenagers and young adults is especially
tragic, the state has a clear interest in preventing anyone, no
matter what age, from taking his own life in a fit of desperation,
depression, or loneliness or as a result of any other problem,
physical or psychological, which can be significantly ameliorated.
Studies show that many suicides are committed by people who are
suffering from treatable mental disorders. Most if not all states
provide for the involuntary commitment of such persons if they are
likely to physically harm themselves. For similar reasons, at
least a dozen states allow the use of nondeadly force to prevent
suicide attempts.[FOOTNOTE 83]

While the state has a legitimate interest in preventing suicides
in general, that interest, like the state's interest in preserving
life, is substantially diminished in the case of terminally ill,
competent adults who wish to die.[FOOTNOTE 84] One of the
heartaches of suicide is the senseless loss of a life ended
prematurely. In the case of a terminally ill adult who ends his
life in the final stages of an incurable and painful degenerative
disease, in order to avoid debilitating pain and a humiliating
death, the decision to commit suicide is not senseless, and death
does not come too early.[FOOTNOTE 85] Unlike "the depressed
twenty-one year old, the romantically devastated twenty-eight year
old, the alcoholic forty-year old," Compassion In Dying, 49 F.3d
at 590-91, or many others who may be inclined to commit suicide, a
terminally ill competent adult cannot be cured. While some people
who contemplate suicide can be restored to a state of physical and
mental well-being, terminally ill adults who wish to die can only
be maintained in a debilitated and deteriorating state, unable to
enjoy the presence of family or friends. Not only is the state's
interest in preventing such individuals from hastening their
deaths of comparatively little weight, but its insistence on
frustrating their wishes seems cruel indeed.[FOOTNOTE 86] As Kent
said in King Lear, when signs of life were seen in the dying
monarch:

Vex not his ghost: O! let him pass; he hate him That would upon
the rack of this tough world Stretch him out longer.[FOOTNOTE 87]

b.

The state has explicitly recognized that its interests are
frequently insufficient to override the wishes of competent,
terminally ill adult patients who desire to bring their lives to
an end with the assistance of a physician. Step by step, the state
has acknowledged that terminally ill persons are entitled in a
whole variety of circumstances to hasten their deaths, and that in
such cases their physicians may assist in the process. Until
relatively recently, while physicians routinely helped patients to
hasten their deaths, they did so discreetly because almost all
such assistance was illegal. However, beginning about twenty years
ago a series of dramatic changes took place. Each provoked the
type of division and debate that surrounds the issue before us
today. Each time the state's interests were ultimately
subordinated to the liberty interests of the individual, in part
as a result of legal actions and in part as a result of a growing
recognition by the medical community and society at large that a
more enlightened approach was essential.

The first major breakthrough occurred when the terminally ill were
permitted to reject medical treatment.[FOOTNOTE 88] The line was
drawn initially at extraordinary medical treatment because the
distinction between ordinary and extraordinary treatment appeared
to some to offer the courts an objective, scientific standard that
would enable them to recognize the right to refuse certain medical
treatment without also recognizing a right to suicide or
euthanasia.[FOOTNOTE 89] That distinction, however, quickly proved
unworkable, and after a while, terminally ill patients were
allowed to reject both extraordinary and ordinary treatment. For a
while, rejection of treatment, often through "do not resuscitate"
orders, was permitted, but termination was not. This dividing
line, which rested on the illusory distinction between commission
and omission (or active and passive), also appeared for a short
time to offer a natural point of repose for doctors, patients and
the law. However, it, too, quickly proved untenable, and
ultimately patients were allowed both to refuse and to terminate
medical treatment,[FOOTNOTE 90] ordinary as well as extraordinary.
Today, many states also allow the terminally ill to order their
physicians to discontinue not just traditional medical treatment
but the artificial provision of life-sustaining food and water,
thus permitting the patients to die by self-starvation. Equally
important, today, doctors are generally permitted to administer
death-inducing medication, as long as they can point to a
concomitant pain-relieving purpose.

In light of these drastic changes regarding acceptable medical
practices, opponents of physician-assisted suicide must now
explain precisely what it is about the physician's conduct in
assisted suicide cases that distinguishes it from the conduct that
the state has explicitly authorized. The state responds by urging
that physician-assisted suicide is different in kind, not degree,
from the type of physician-life-ending conduct that is now
authorized, for three separate reasons. It argues that "assisted
suicide": 1) requires doctors to play an active role; 2) causes
deaths that would not result from the patient's underlying
disease; and 3) requires doctors to provide the causal agent of
patients' deaths.

The distinctions suggested by the state do not individually or
collectively serve to distinguish the medical practices society
currently accepts. The first distinction -- the line between
commission and omission -- is a distinction without a difference
now that patients are permitted not only to decline all medical
treatment, but to instruct their doctors to terminate whatever
treatment, artificial or otherwise, they are receiving. In
disconnecting a respirator, or authorizing its disconnection, a
doctor is unquestionably committing an act; he is taking an active
role in bringing about the patient's death. In fact, there can be
no doubt that in such instances the doctor intends that, as the
result of his action, the patient will die an earlier death than
he otherwise would.

Similarly, drawing a distinction on the basis of whether the
patient's death results from an underlying disease no longer has
any legitimacy. While the distinction may once have seemed
tenable, at least from a metaphysical standpoint, it was not based
on a valid or practical legal foundation and was therefore quickly
abandoned. When Nancy Cruzan's feeding and hydration tube was
removed, she did not die of an underlying disease. Rather, she was
allowed to starve to death.[FOOTNOTE 91] In fact, Ms. Cruzan was
not even terminally ill at the time, but had a life expectancy of
30 years.[FOOTNOTE 92] Similarly, when a doctor provides a
conscious patient with medication to ease his discomfort while he
starves himself to death -- a practice that is not only legal but
has been urged as an alternative to assisted suicide[FOOTNOTE 93]
-- the patient does not die of any underlying ailment. To the
contrary, the doctor is helping the patient end his life by
providing medication that makes it possible for the patient to
achieve suicide by starvation.

Nor is the state's third and final distinction valid. Contrary to
the state's assertion, given current medical practices and current
medical ethics, it is not possible to distinguish prohibited from
permissible medical conduct on the basis of whether the medication
provided by the doctor will cause the patient's death. As part of
the tradition of administering comfort care, doctors have been
supplying the causal agent of patients' deaths for decades.
Physicians routinely and openly provide medication to terminally
ill patients with the knowledge that it will have a "double
effect" -- reduce the patient's pain and hasten his
death.[FOOTNOTE 94] Such medical treatment is accepted by the
medical profession as meeting its highest ethical
standards.[FOOTNOTE 95] It commonly takes the form of putting a
patient on an intravenous morphine drip, with full knowledge that,
while such treatment will alleviate his pain, it will also
indubitably hasten his death.[FOOTNOTE 96] There can be no doubt,
therefore, that the actual cause of the patient's death is the
drug administered by the physician or by a person acting under his
supervision or direction. Thus, the causation argument is simply
"another bridge crossed" in the journey to vindicate the liberty
interests of the terminally ill, and the state's third distinction
has no more force than the other two.

c.

We acknowledge that in some respects a recognition of the
legitimacy of physician-assisted suicide would constitute an
additional step beyond what the courts have previously approved.
We also acknowledge that judicial acceptance of physician-assisted
suicide would cause many sincere persons with strong moral or
religious convictions great distress. Nevertheless, we do not
believe that the state's interest in preventing that additional
step is significantly greater than its interest in preventing the
other forms of life-ending medical conduct that doctors now engage
in regularly. More specifically, we see little, if any, difference
for constitutional or ethical purposes between providing
medication with a double effect and providing medication with a
single effect, as long as one of the known effects in each case is
to hasten the end of the patient's life. Similarly, we see no
ethical or constitutionally cognizable difference between a
doctor's pulling the plug on a respirator and his prescribing
drugs which will permit a terminally ill patient to end his own
life. In fact, some might argue that pulling the plug is a more
culpable and aggressive act on the doctor's part and provides more
reason for criminal prosecution. To us, what matters most is that
the death of the patient is the intended result as surely in one
case as in the other. In sum, we find the state's interests in
preventing suicide do not make its interests substantially
stronger here than in cases involving other forms of
death-hastening medical intervention. To the extent that a
difference exists, we conclude that it is one of degree and not of
kind.

d.

Moreover, we are doubtful that deaths resulting from terminally
ill patients taking medication prescribed by their doctors should
be classified as "suicide." Certainly, we see little basis for
such a classification when deaths that result from patients'
decisions to terminate life support systems or to refuse
life-sustaining food and water, for example, are not. We believe
that there is a strong argument that a decision by a terminally
ill patient to hasten by medical means a death that is already in
process, should not be classified as suicide. Thus,
notwithstanding the generally accepted use of the term
"physician-assisted suicide," we have serious doubt that the
state's interest in preventing suicide is even implicated in this
case.

e.

In addition to the state's purported interest in preventing
suicide, it has an additional interest in preventing deaths that
occur as a result of errors in medical or legal judgment. We
acknowledge that it is sometimes impossible to predict with
certainty the duration of a terminally ill patient's remaining
existence, just as it is sometimes impossible to say for certain
whether a borderline individual is or is not mentally
competent.[FOOTNOTE 97] However, we believe that sufficient
safeguards can and will be developed by the state and medical
profession, see infra p. 3204, to ensure that the possibility of
error will ordinarily be remote. Finally, although life and death
decisions are of the gravest order, should an error actually occur
it is likely to benefit the individual by permitting a victim of
unmanageable pain and suffering to end his life peacefully and
with dignity at the time he deems most desirable.[FOOTNOTE 98]

3. Avoiding the Involvement of Third Parties, and Precluding the
Use of Arbitrary, Unfair, or Undue Influence

a.

A state may properly assert an interest in prohibiting even
altruistic assistance to a person contemplating suicide on the
grounds that allowing others to help may increase the incidence of
suicide, undercut society's commitment to the sanctity of life,
and, adversely affect the person providing the assistance. In
addition, joint action is generally considered more serious than
action by a single person. While we recognize that these concerns
are legitimate, the most important -- the first two -- diminish in
importance to the same extent that the state's interest in
preventing the act itself diminishes. All are at their minimums
when the assistance is provided by or under the supervision or
direction of a doctor and the recipient is a terminally ill
patient.

In upholding Washington's statute, the majority of the three-judge
panel relied heavily on the state's interest in preventing the
exercise of undue, arbitrary or unfair influences over the
individual's decision to end his life. Compassion In Dying, 49
F.3d at 592-93. We agree that this is an important interest, but
for entirely different reasons than the majority suggests. One of
the majority's prime arguments is that the statute is necessary to
protect "the poor and minorities from exploitation," 49 F.3d at
592 -- in other words, to protect the disadvantaged from becoming
the victims of assisted suicide. This rationale simply recycles
one of the more disingenuous and fallacious arguments raised in
opposition to the legalization of abortion.[FOOTNOTE 99] It is
equally meretricious here. In fact, as with abortion, there is far
more reason to raise the opposite concern: the concern that the
poor and the minorities, who have historically received the least
adequate health care, will not be afforded a fair opportunity to
obtain the medical assistance to which they are entitled -- the
assistance that would allow them to end their lives with a measure
of dignity. The argument that disadvantaged persons will receive
more medical services than the remainder of the population in one,
and only one, area -- assisted suicide -- is ludicrous on its
face. So, too, is the argument that the poor and the minorities
will rush to volunteer for physician-assisted suicide because of
their inability to secure adequate medical treatment.

Our analysis is similar regarding the argument relating to the
handicapped. Again, the opponents of physician-assisted suicide
urge a variation of the discredited anti-abortion argument.
Despite the dire predictions, the disabled were not pressured into
seeking abortions. Nor is it likely that the disabled will be
pressured into committing physician-assisted suicide.
Organizations representing the physically impaired are
sufficiently active politically and sufficiently vigilant that
they would soon put a halt to any effort to employ assisted
suicide in a manner that affected their clients unfairly. There
are other more subtle concerns, however, advanced by some
representatives of the physically impaired, including the fear
that certain physical disabilities will erroneously be deemed to
make life "valueless." While we recognize the legitimacy of these
concerns, we also recognize that seriously impaired individuals
will, along with non-impaired individuals, be the beneficiaries of
the liberty interest asserted here -- and that if they are not
afforded the option to control their own fate, they like many
others will be compelled, against their will, to endure unusual
and protracted suffering. The resolution that would be best for
all, of course, would be to ensure that the practice of assisted
suicide is conducted fairly and well, and that adequate safeguards
sufficient to avoid the feared abuses are adopted and enforced.

b.

There is a far more serious concern regarding third parties that
we must consider -- one not even mentioned by the majority in the
panel opinion. That concern is the fear that infirm, elderly
persons will come under undue pressure to end their lives from
callous, financially burdened, or self-interested relatives, or
others who have influence over them. The risk of undue influence
is real -- and it exists today. Persons with a stake in the
outcome may now pressure the terminally ill to reject or decline
life-saving treatment or take other steps likely to hasten their
demise. Surrogates may make unfeeling life and death decisions for
their incompetent relatives. This concern deserves serious
consideration, as it did when the decision was made some time ago
to permit the termination of life-support systems and the
withdrawal or withholding of other forms of medical treatment, and
when it was decided to recognize living wills, durable powers of
attorney, and the right of courts to appoint substitute
decision-makers. While we do not minimize the concern, the
temptation to exert undue pressure is ordinarily tempered to a
substantial degree in the case of the terminally ill by the
knowledge that the person will die shortly in any event. Given the
possibility of undue influence that already exists, the
recognition of the right to physician-assisted suicide would not
increase that risk unduly. In fact, the direct involvement of an
impartial and professional third party in the decision-making
process would more likely provide an important safeguard against
such abuse.

We also realize that terminally ill patients may well feel
pressured to hasten their deaths, not because of improper conduct
by their loved ones, but rather for an opposite reason -- out of
concern for the economic welfare of their loved ones. Faced with
the prospect of astronomical medical bills, terminally ill
patients might decide that it is better for them to die before
their health care expenses consume the life savings they planned
to leave for their families, or, worse yet, burden their families
with debts they may never be able to satisfy. While state
regulations can help ensure that patients do not make rash,
uninformed, or ill considered decisions, we are reluctant to say
that, in a society in which the costs of protracted health care
can be so exorbitant, it is improper for competent, terminally ill
adults to take the economic welfare of their families and loved
ones into consideration.

Throughout its analysis, the dissent relies heavily on Professor
Kamisar, a long-time, outspoken, and nationally-recognized
opponent of assisted-suicide. Following Professor Kamisar's lead,
our dissenting colleagues suggest that the nation's priorities are
misplaced because some of the problems we address result from the
"lack of universal access to medical care." Dissent at 3249. We
would be inclined to agree that the country's refusal to provide
universal health care, and the concomitant suffering so many
Americans are forced to undergo, demonstrates a serious flaw in
our national values. One answer, of course, is that concerns over
the absence of decent medical coverage in this country should be
addressed to Congress, which, if it recognizes the values the
dissenters and others espouse, will surely enact the
sorely-needed, health-care legislation it has up to now rejected.
As members of the judicial branch, however, we are compelled to
stand aside from that battle. On the other hand, we are certainly
not obligated to pile injury upon injury by holding that all of
our citizens may be subjected to the prospect of needless pain,
suffering, and degradation at the end of their lives, either
because of our concern over Congress' failure to provide
government-insured health care or alternatively in order to
satisfy the moral or religious precepts of a portion of the
population.

c.

We are also aware of the concern that doctors become hardened to
the inevitability of death and to the plight of terminally ill
patients, and that they will treat requests to die in a routine
and impersonal manner, rather than affording the careful,
thorough, individualized attention that each request deserves. The
day of the family doctor who made house calls and knew the
frailties and strengths of each family member is long gone. So,
too, in the main, is the intense personal interest that doctors
used to take in their patients' welfare and activities. Doctors
like the rest of society face constantly increasing pressures, and
may not always have the patience to deal with the elderly, some of
whom can be both difficult and troublesome. Nevertheless, there
are many doctors who specialize in geriatric care and there are
many more who are not specialists but who treat elderly patients
with great compassion and sensitivity. We believe that most, if
not all, doctors would not assist a terminally ill patient to
hasten his death as long as there were any reasonable chance of
alleviating the patient's suffering or enabling him to live under
tolerable conditions. We also believe that physicians would not
assist a patient to end his life if there were any significant
doubt about the patient's true wishes. To do so would be contrary
to the physicians' fundamental training, their conservative
nature, and the ethics of their profession. In any case, since
doctors are highly-regulated professionals, it should not be
difficult for the state or the profession itself to establish
rules and procedures that will ensure that the occasional
negligent or careless recommendation by a licensed physician will
not result in an uninformed or erroneous decision by the patient
or his family.

Having said all this, we do not dismiss the legitimate concerns
that exist regarding undue influence. While steps can be taken to
minimize the danger substantially, the concerns cannot be wholly
eliminated. Accordingly, they are of more than minimal weight and,
in balancing the competing interests, we treat them seriously.

4. Effect on Children, Other Family Members, and Loved Ones

The state clearly has a legitimate interest in safeguarding the
interests of innocent third parties such as minor children and
other family members dependent on persons who wish to commit
suicide. That state interest, however, is of almost negligible
weight when the patient is terminally ill and his death is
imminent and inevitable. The state cannot help a minor child or
any other innocent third party by forcing a terminally ill patient
to die a more protracted and painful death. In fact, witnessing a
loved one suffer a slow and agonizing death as a result of state
compulsion is more likely to harm than further the interests of
innocent third parties.[FOOTNOTE 100]

5. Protecting the Integrity of the Medical Profession

The state has a legitimate interest in assuring the integrity of
the medical profession, an interest that includes prohibiting
physicians from engaging in conduct that is at odds with their
role as healers.[FOOTNOTE 101] We do not believe that the
integrity of the medical profession would be threatened in any way
by the vindication of the liberty interest at issue here. Rather,
it is the existence of a statute that criminalizes the provision
of medical assistance to patients in need that could create
conflicts with the doctors' professional obligations and make
covert criminals out of honorable, dedicated, and compassionate
individuals.

The assertion that the legalization of physician-assisted suicide
will erode the commitment of doctors to help their patients rests
both on an ignorance of what numbers of doctors have been doing
for a considerable time and on a misunderstanding of the proper
function of a physician. As we have previously noted, doctors have
been discreetly helping terminally ill patients hasten their
deaths for decades and probably centuries, while acknowledging
privately that there was no other medical purpose to their
actions. They have done so with the tacit approval of a
substantial percentage of both the public and the medical
profession, and without in any way diluting their commitment to
their patients.

In addition, as we also noted earlier, doctors may now openly take
actions that will result in the deaths of their patients. They may
terminate life-support systems, withdraw life-sustaining
gastronomy tubes, otherwise terminate or withhold all other forms
of medical treatment, and, may even administer lethal doses of
drugs with full knowledge of their "double effect."[FOOTNOTE 102]
Given the similarity between what doctors are now permitted to do
and what the plaintiffs assert they should be permitted to do, we
see no risk at all to the integrity of the profession. This is a
conclusion that is shared by a growing number of doctors who
openly support physician-assisted suicide and proclaim it to be
fully compatible with the physicians' calling and with their
commitment and obligation to help the sick.[FOOTNOTE 103] Many
more doctors support physician-assisted suicide but without openly
advocating a change in the legal treatment of the practice. A
recent study of Oregon physicians found that 60% of those who
responded believed that physician-assisted suicide should be
legal.[FOOTNOTE 104] A recent study of attitudes among physicians
in Michigan, where the state legislature adopted a law banning
assisted-suicide as a result of Dr. Jack Kevorkian's activities,
found that only 17.2% of the physicians who responded favored a
law prohibiting assisted-suicide. Almost all the rest supported
one of three options: legalizing physician-assisted suicide
(38.9%); permitting the medical profession to regulate the
practice (16.1%); or leaving decisions about physician-assisted
suicide to the doctor-patient relationship (16.6%).[FOOTNOTE 105]
Thus over 70% of the Michigan doctors answering the poll appear to
believe that professional ethics do not preclude doctors from
engaging in acts that today are classified as "assisted suicide."
Even among those doctors who oppose assisted suicide medical
ethics do not lie at the heart of the objections. The "most
important personal characteristic" separating those doctors from
their colleagues is a strong religious identification.[FOOTNOTE
106]

Whether or not a patient can be cured, the doctor has an
obligation to attempt to alleviate his pain and suffering. If it
is impossible to cure the patient or retard the advance of his
disease, then the doctor's primary duty is to make the patient as
comfortable as possible. When performing that task, the doctor is
performing a proper medical function, even though he knows that
his patient's death is a necessary and inevitable consequence of
his actions.[FOOTNOTE 107]

As noted earlier, the American Medical Association filed an amicus
brief urging that we uphold the practice of administering medicine
with a dual effect. At the same time, it takes the position that
physician-assisted suicide should not be legalized, at least as of
this time.[FOOTNOTE 108] Twenty years ago, the AMA contended that
performing abortions violated the Hippocratic Oath; today, it
claims that assisting terminally ill patients to hasten their
death does likewise. Clearly, the Hippocratic Oath can have no
greater import in deciding the constitutionality of physician
assisted-suicide than it did in determining whether women had a
constitutional right to have an abortion. In Roe, the Court cited
a scholar's conclusion that the Hippocratic Oath "originated in a
group representing only a small segment of Greek opinion and that
it certainly was not accepted by all ancient physicians." The
Court stressed the Oath's "rigidity" and was not deterred by its
prohibitory language regarding abortion.[FOOTNOTE 109] As Roe
shows, a literalist reading of the Hippocratic Oath does not
represent the best or final word on medical or legal controversies
today.[FOOTNOTE 110] Were we to adhere to the rigid language of
the oath, not only would doctors be barred from performing
abortions or helping terminally ill patients hasten their deaths,
but according to a once-accepted interpretation, they would also
be prohibited from performing any type of surgery at all,[FOOTNOTE
111] a position that would now be recognized as preposterous by
even the most tradition-bound AMA members. More important,
regardless of the AMA or its position, experience shows that most
doctors can readily adapt to a changing legal climate. Once the
Court held that a woman has a constitutional right to have an
abortion, doctors began performing abortions routinely and the
ethical integrity of the medical profession remained undiminished.
Similarly, following the recognition of a constitutional right to
assisted suicide, we believe that doctors would engage in the
permitted practice when appropriate, and that the integrity of the
medical profession would survive without blemish.

Recognizing the right to "assisted-suicide" would not require
doctors to do anything contrary to their individual principles. A
physician whose moral or religious beliefs would prevent him from
assisting a patient to hasten his death would be free to follow
the dictates of his conscience. Those doctors who believe that
terminally ill, competent, adult patients should be permitted to
choose the time and manner of their death would be able to help
them do so. We believe that extending a choice to doctors as well
as to patients would help protect the integrity of the medical
profession without compromising the rights or principles of
individual doctors and without sacrificing the welfare of their
patients.[FOOTNOTE 112]

6. Fear of Adverse Consequences

We now consider the state's final concern. Those opposed to
permitting physician-assisted suicide often point to a concern
that could be subsumed under the state's general interest in
preserving life, but which for clarity's sake we treat separately.
The argument is a purely pragmatic one that causes many people
deep concern: permitting physician-assisted suicide would "open
Pandora's Box."[FOOTNOTE 113]

Once we recognize a liberty interest in hastening one's death, the
argument goes, that interest will sweep away all restrictions in
its wake. It will only be a matter of time, the argument
continues, before courts will sanction putting people to death,
not because they are desperately ill and want to die, but because
they are deemed to pose an unjustifiable burden on
society.[FOOTNOTE 114] Known as a slippery slope argument or what
one commentator has called the "thin edge of the wedge"
argument,[FOOTNOTE 115] the opponents of assisted-suicide conjure
up a parade of horribles and insist that the only way to halt the
downward spiral is to stop it before it starts. See Compassion In
Dying, 49 F.3d at 590-91 (providing list of horribles).

This same nihilistic argument can be offered against any
constitutionally-protected right or interest. Both before and
after women were found to have a right to have an abortion,
critics contended that legalizing that medical procedure would
lead to its widespread use as a substitute for other forms of
birth control or as a means of racial genocide. Inflammatory
contentions regarding ways in which the recognition of the right
would lead to the ruination of the country did not, however, deter
the Supreme Court from first recognizing and then two decades
later reaffirming a constitutionally-protected liberty interest in
terminating an unwanted pregnancy. In fact, the Court has never
refused to recognize a substantive due process liberty right or
interest merely because there were difficulties in determining
when and how to limit its exercise or because others might someday
attempt to use it improperly.

Recognition of any right creates the possibility of abuse. The
slippery slope fears of Roe's opponents have, of course, not
materialized. The legalization of abortion has not undermined our
commitment to life generally; nor, as some predicted, has it led
to widespread infanticide. Similarly, there is no reason to
believe that legalizing assisted suicide will lead to the horrific
consequences its opponents suggest.

The slippery slope argument also comes in a second and closely
related form. This version of the argument states that a due
process interest in hastening one's death, even if the exercise of
that interest is initially limited to the terminally ill, will
prove infinitely expansive because it will be impossible to define
the term "terminally ill." See Compassion In Dying, 49 F.3d at
593. (After all, all of us are terminal in some sense of the word,
are we not?). See id. The argument rests on two false premises.
First it presupposes a need for greater precision than is required
in constitutional law.[FOOTNOTE 116] Second, it assumes that the
terms "terminal illness" or "terminal condition" cannot be
defined, even though those terms have in fact been defined
repeatedly. They have, for example, been defined in a model
statute, The Uniform Rights of the Terminally Ill Act,[FOOTNOTE
117] and in more than 40 state natural death statutes,[FOOTNOTE
118] including Washington's. The model statute and some of the
state statutes have defined the term without reference to a fixed
time period; others have taken the opposite approach, defining
terminal to mean that death is likely to ensue within six months.
As we have noted earlier, the Washington Act, like some others,
includes persons who are permanently unconscious, that is in an
irreversible coma or a persistent vegetative state. RCW
70.122.020(6). While defining the term "terminally ill" is not
free from difficulty, the experience of the states has proved that
the class of the terminally ill is neither indefinable nor
undefined. Indeed, all of the persons described in the various
statutes would appear to fall within an appropriate definition of
the term. In any event, it is apparent that purported definitional
difficulties that have repeatedly been surmounted provide no
legitimate reason for refusing to recognize a liberty interest in
hastening one's death.

We do not dispute the dissent's contention that the prescription
of lethal medication by physicians for use by terminally ill
patients who wish to die does not constitute a clear point of
demarcation between permissible and impermissible medical conduct.
We agree that it may be difficult to make a principled distinction
between physician-assisted suicide and the provision to terminally
ill patients of other forms of life-ending medical assistance,
such as the administration of drugs by a physician. We recognize
that in some instances, the patient may be unable to
self-administer the drugs and that administration by the
physician, or a person acting under his direction or control, may
be the only way the patient may be able to receive them.[FOOTNOTE
119] The question whether that type of physician conduct may be
constitutionally prohibited must be answered directly in future
cases, and not in this one. We would be less than candid, however,
if we did not acknowledge that for present purposes we view the
critical line in right-to-die cases as the one between the
voluntary and involuntary termination of an individual's life. In
the first case -- volitional death -- the physician is aiding or
assisting a patient who wishes to exercise a liberty interest, and
in the other -- involuntary death -- another person acting on his
own behalf, or, in some instances society's, is determining that
an individual's life should no longer continue.[FOOTNOTE 120] We
consider it less important who administers the medication than who
determines whether the terminally ill person's life shall end. In
any event, here we decide only the issue before us -- the
constitutionality of prohibiting doctors from prescribing
medication for use by terminally ill patients who wish to hasten
their death.

B.

The Means by Which the State Furthers Its Interests

In applying the balancing test, we must take into account not only
the strength of the state's interests but also the means by which
the state has chosen to further those interests.

1. Prohibition -- A Total Ban for the Terminally Ill

Washington's statute prohibiting assisted suicide has a drastic
impact on the terminally ill. By prohibiting physician assistance,
it bars what for many terminally ill patients is the only
palatable, and only pra********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************e technique generally
depends, however, on the assistance of a physician, whether tacit
or unknowing (although it is possible to end one's life with
over-the-counter medication). Even if the terminally ill patients
are able to accumulate sufficient drugs, given the pain killers
and other medication they are taking, most of them would lack the
knowledge to determine what dose of any given drug or drugs they
must take, or in what combination. Miscalculation can be tragic.
It can lead to an even more painful and lingering death.
Alternatively, if the medication reduces respiration enough to
restrict the flow of oxygen to the brain but not enough to cause
death, it can result in the patient's falling into a comatose or
vegetative state.

Thus for many terminally ill patients, the Washington statute is
effectively a prohibition. While technically it only prohibits one
means of exercising a liberty interest, practically it prohibits
the exercise of that interest as effectively as prohibiting
doctors from performing abortions prevented women from having
abortions in the days before Roe.[FOOTNOTE 121]

2. Regulation -- A Permissible Means of Promoting State Interests

State laws or regulations governing physician-assisted suicide are
both necessary and desirable to ensure against errors and abuse,
and to protect legitimate state interests. Any of several model
statutes might serve as an example of how these legitimate and
important concerns can be addressed effectively.[FOOTNOTE 122]

By adopting appropriate, reasonable, and properly drawn safeguards
Washington could ensure that people who choose to have their
doctors prescribe lethal doses of medication are truly competent
and meet all of the requisite standards. Without endorsing the
constitutionality of any particular procedural safeguards, we note
that the state might, for example, require: witnesses to ensure
voluntariness; reasonable, though short, waiting periods to
prevent rash decisions; second medical opinions to confirm a
patient's terminal status and also to confirm that the patient has
been receiving proper treatment, including adequate comfort care;
psychological examinations to ensure that the patient is not
suffering from momentary or treatable depression; reporting
procedures that will aid in the avoidance of abuse. Alternatively,
such safeguards could be adopted by interested medical
associations and other organizations involved in the provision of
health care, so long as they meet the state's needs and
concerns.[FOOTNOTE 123]

While there is always room for error in any human endeavor, we
believe that sufficient protections can and will be developed by
the various states, with the assistance of the medical profession
and health care industry, to ensure that the possibility of error
will be remote. We do not expect that, in this nation, the
development of appropriate statutes and regulations will be taken
lightly by any of the interested parties, or that those charged
with their enforcement will fail to perform their duties properly.

In treating a prohibition differently from a regulation, we are
following the approach that the Court took in the only
right-to-die case to come before it. In Cruzan, the Court
recognized that the states had a legitimate role to play in
regulating the process of refusing or terminating life-sustaining
medical treatment even if they could not prohibit the making of
decisions that met applicable state standards. The Court
explicitly recognized that states did not have to refrain from
acting, but rather could adopt appropriate regulations to further
their legitimate interests. Missouri's requirement for clear and
convincing evidence of a patient's wishes was a regulation
designed to reduce the risk of erroneous decisions. The Court
upheld that regulation, a requirement that, of course, had far
less impact on the exercise of the due process liberty interest
than the de facto prohibition at issue here.

To those who argue that courts should refrain from declaring that
the terminally ill have a constitutional right to
physician-assisted suicide and that we should leave such matters
to the individual states, we reply that where important liberty
interests are at stake it is not the proper role of the state to
adopt statutes totally prohibiting their exercise. Rather, the
state should enact regulatory measures that ensure that the
exercise of those interests is properly circumscribed and that all
necessary safeguards have been provided. In the case of abortions
and in the case of the withdrawal of life-sustaining medical
treatment, the Court permitted states to enact appropriate
regulations that would further its legitimate interests. In this
case, like the others, the guiding principle is found in the words
of Justice O'Connor. "[T]he more challenging task of crafting
appropriate procedures for safeguarding . . . [terminally ill
patients'] liberty interests is entrusted to the 'laboratory' of
the states in the first instance." Cruzan 497 U.S. at 287, 292
(O'Connor, J., concurring) (internal citation omitted).[FOOTNOTE
124]

C.

The Strength of the Liberty Interest

Earlier in the opinion we described the liberty interest at issue
here and explained its importance. We also explained that the
strength of that interest is dependent on a number of factors,
especially the individual's physical condition. We noted that an
individual's liberty interest in hastening his death is at its low
point when that person is young and healthy, because forcing a
robust individual to continue living does not, at least absent
extraordinary circumstances, subject him to "pain . . . [and]
suffering that is too intimate and personal for the State to
insist on . . . ." Casey, 112 S.Ct. at 2807. As we also made
clear, when a mentally competent adult is terminally ill, and
wishes, free of any coercion, to hasten his death because his
remaining days are an unmitigated torture, that person's liberty
interest is at its height. For such a person, being forced to live
is indeed being subjected to "pain . . . [and] suffering that is
too intimate and personal for the State to insist on . . . ." Id.

D.

The Burden on the Liberty Interest

We have also previously discussed at some length the nature and
extent of the burden that the Washington statute imposes on the
liberty interest. Here, we need only mention some of the specific
evidence introduced by the plaintiffs and refer to some of our
earlier analysis. The plaintiffs offered considerable specific
testimony involving individual patients that strongly supports
their claims that the Washington statute frequently presents an
insuperable obstacle to terminally ill persons who wish to hasten
their deaths by peaceful means. The testimony produced by the
plaintiffs shows that many terminally ill patients who wish to die
with dignity are forced to resort to gruesome alternatives because
of the unavailability of physician assistance. One such patient, a
34-year-old man dying from AIDS and lymphoma, asked his physician
for drugs to hasten his inevitable death after enduring four
excruciatingly painful months because he did not wish to die in a
hospital in a drug-induced stupor. His doctor, Dr. Harold
Glucksberg, one of the physician plaintiffs in this case, refused
because he feared prosecution under Washington Statute RCW
9A.36.060. Denied medical assistance, the patient ended his life
by jumping from the West Seattle bridge and plummeting to his
death.[FOOTNOTE 125] Fortunately, he did not survive the plunge
and require permanent hospitalization in an even more exacerbated
state of pain.

Deprived of physician assistance, another terminally ill patient
took his own life by withholding his insulin and letting himself
die of insulin shock.[FOOTNOTE 126] Like many terminally ill
patients, one individual killed himself in a secretive and lonely
fashion, in order to spare his family from possible criminal
charges; as a result he was deprived of a chance to die in a
dignified manner with his loved ones at his side. The man's
daughter described her father's death this way:
When he realized that my family was going to be away for a day, he
wrote us a beautiful letter, went down to his basement, and shot
himself with his 12 gauge shot gun. He was 84. . . My son-in-law
then had the unfortunate and unpleasant task of cleaning my
father's splattered brains off the basement walls.[FOOTNOTE 127]

The plaintiffs also produced testimony showing that some
terminally ill patients who try to kill themselves are
unsuccessful, maiming instead of killing themselves, or that they
succeed only after subjecting themselves to needless, excruciating
pain.[FOOTNOTE 128] One such terminally ill patient, a mentally
competent woman in her 80s suffering from metastatic breast
cancer, sought medication to hasten her death from her primary
care physician, Dr. Abigail Halperin, one of the physician
plaintiffs in this case. Although Dr. Halperin believed, in her
professional judgment, that she should accommodate her patient's
wishes, she did not do so because she feared prosecution under
Washington statute RCW 9A.36.060. The patient acted on her own to
hasten her death by placing a plastic bag over her head, securing
it so no more air could enter. She suffocated to death, an end
that was certainly more painful and inhumane than the death she
would have experienced had she been given the prescriptions she
sought.[FOOTNOTE 129]

Next, the plaintiffs produced testimony showing that many
terminally ill patients are physically or psychologically unable
to take their lives by the violent means that are almost always
their only alternatives in the absence of assistance from a
physician. One man declared that his terminally ill wife "wanted
to die but we did not know how to do it. We could not ask her
doctors. . . She feared over-the-counter pills, hearing of all the
cases where the person woke up a vegetable. Carbon monoxide was
out since she wanted the dignity of dying in her own bed,
surrounded by the things she loved."[FOOTNOTE 130] Another woman
told how her father, "to whom dignity was very important, lay
dying, diapered, moaning in pain, begging to die."[FOOTNOTE 131]

Following the approach of the Court in Casey, 112 S.Ct. at 2828,
we note that there is also an extensive body of legal,[FOOTNOTE
132] medical,[FOOTNOTE 133] and sociological literature,[FOOTNOTE
134] lending support to the conclusion that a prohibition on
physician assistance imposes an onerous burden on terminally ill,
competent adults who wish to hasten their deaths. That conclusion
is further buttressed by extensive anecdotal evidence compiled in
newspapers[FOOTNOTE 135] and magazines.[FOOTNOTE 136] Although the
statute at issue does not totally prohibit the exercise of the
liberty interest by all who possess it, it does effectively
prohibit its exercise by almost all of the terminally ill. In
fact, as applied, the ban on the liberty interest is close to
complete; for, there are few terminally ill persons who do not
obtain illicit help from someone in the course of their efforts to
hasten their deaths.

There is an additional burden on loved ones and family members
that is often overlooked. Some terminally ill persons enlist their
children, parents, or others who care for them deeply, in an
agonizing, brutal and damaging endeavor, criminalized by the
state, to end their pain and suffering. The loving and dedicated
persons who agree to help -- even if they are fortunate enough to
avoid prosecution, and almost all are -- will likely suffer pain
and guilt for the rest of their lives. Those who decline to assist
may always wonder whether they should have tried to save their
parent or mate from enduring, unnecessary and protracted agony.
This burden would be substantially alleviated if doctors were
authorized to assist terminally ill persons to end their lives and
to supervise and direct others in the implementation of that
process.

E. The Consequences of Upholding or Overturning the Statutory
Provision

In various earlier sections of this opinion, we have discussed
most of the consequences of upholding or overturning the
Washington statutory provision at issue, because in this case
those consequences are best considered as part of the discussion
of the specific factors or interests. The one remaining
consequence of significance is easy to identify: Whatever the
outcome here, a host of painful and agonizing issues involving the
right to die will continue to confront the courts. More important,
these problems will continue to plague growing numbers of
Americans of advanced age as well as their families, dependents,
and loved ones. The issue is truly one which deserves the most
thorough, careful, and objective attention from all segments of
society.

VI.

Application of the Balancing Test and Holding

Weighing and then balancing a constitutionally-protected interest
against the state's countervailing interests, while bearing in
mind the various consequences of the decision, is quintessentially
a judicial role. Despite all of the efforts of generations of
courts to categorize and objectify, to create multi-part tests and
identify weights to be attached to the various factors, in the end
balancing entails the exercise of judicial judgment rather than
the application of scientific or mathematical formulae. No
legislative body can perform the task for us. Nor can any
computer. In the end, mindful of our constitutional obligations,
including the limitations imposed on us by that document, we must
rely on our judgment, guided by the facts and the law as we
perceive them.

As we have explained, in this case neither the liberty interest in
choosing the time and manner of death nor the state's
countervailing interests are static. The magnitude of each depends
on objective circumstances and generally varies inversely with the
other. The liberty interest in hastening death is at its strongest
when the state's interest in protecting life and preventing
suicide is at its weakest, and vice-versa.

The liberty interest at issue here is an important one and in, the
case of the terminally ill, is at its peak. Conversely, the state
interests, while equally important in the abstract, are for the
most part at a low point here. We recognize that in the case of
life and death decisions the state has a particularly strong
interest in avoiding undue influence and other forms of abuse.
Here, that concern is ameliorated in large measure because of the
mandatory involvement in the decision-making process of
physicians, who have a strong bias in favor of preserving life,
and because the process itself can be carefully regulated and
rigorous safeguards adopted. Under these circumstances, we believe
that the possibility of abuse, even when considered along with the
other state interests, does not outweigh the liberty interest at
issue.

The state has chosen to pursue its interests by means of what for
terminally ill patients is effectively a total prohibition, even
though its most important interests could be adequately served by
a far less burdensome measure. The consequences of rejecting the
as-applied challenge would be disastrous for the terminally ill,
while the adverse consequences for the state would be of a far
lesser order. This, too, weighs in favor of upholding the liberty
interest.

We consider the state's interests in preventing assisted suicide
as being different only in degree and not in kind from its
interests in prohibiting a number of other medical practices that
lead directly to a terminally ill patient's death. Moreover, we do
not consider those interests to be significantly greater in the
case of assisted suicide than they are in the case of those other
medical practices, if indeed they are greater at all. However,
even if the difference were one of kind and not degree, our result
would be no different. For no matter now much weight we could
legitimately afford the state's interest in preventing suicide,
that weight, when combined with the weight we give all the other
state's interests, is insufficient to outweigh the terminally ill
individual's interest in deciding whether to end his agony and
suffering by hastening the time of his death with medication
prescribed by his physician. The individual's interest in making
that vital decision is compelling indeed, for no decision is more
painful, delicate, personal, important, or final than the decision
how and when one's life shall end. If broad general state policies
can be used to deprive a terminally ill individual of the right to
make that choice, it is hard to envision where the exercise of
arbitrary and intrusive power by the state can be halted. In this
case, the state has wide power to regulate, but it may not ban the
exercise of the liberty interest, and that is the practical effect
of the program before us. Accordingly, after examining one final
legal authority, we hold that the "or aids" provision of
Washington statute RCW 9A.36.06 is unconstitutional as applied to
terminally ill competent adults who wish to hasten their deaths
with medication prescribed by their physicians.[FOOTNOTE 137]

A.

One Possible Obstacle

The final legal obstacle we examine is an opinion of the District
Court of Oregon issued after the panel decision in this case. In
Lee v. State of Oregon, 891 F.Supp. 1429, 1438 (D. Or. 1995),
Chief Judge Hogan held that the Oregon Death With Dignity Act, a
voter initiative that permits doctors to prescribe medications for
terminally ill patients for use in ending their lives, violates
the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it
deprives terminally ill persons of a benefit that is afforded to
the non-terminally ill. The benefit that the Oregon District Court
thought the terminally ill were being deprived of is an Oregon
statutory prohibition making it a crime for anyone, including
doctors, to assist any person, including terminally ill patients,
to end their lives, by providing medical assistance or otherwise.
The Oregon District Court's reasoning conflicts squarely with the
reasoning of this opinion and with the legal conclusions we have
reached. Here, we determine that a statute that prohibits doctors
from aiding terminally ill persons to hasten their deaths by
providing them with prescription medications unconstitutionally
burdens the liberty interests of the terminally ill. The benefit
we conclude the terminally ill are entitled to receive in this
case -- the right to physician-assisted suicide -- is precisely
what Judge Hogan determined to be a burden and thus unlawful. In
short, Lee treats a burden as a benefit and a benefit as a burden.
In doing so, Judge Hogan clearly erred. Lee not only does not aid
us in reaching our decision, it is directly contrary to our
holding.[FOOTNOTE 138]

B.

Is There An Equal Protection Violation?

In the case before us, Chief Judge Rothstein struck down the "or
aids" provision of the Washington statute as it applies to the
terminally ill, not only on due process grounds but also on the
ground that it violates the Equal Protection Clause. Because we
are convinced that her first reason is correct, we need not
consider the second. One constitutional violation is enough to
support the judgment that we reach here.[FOOTNOTE 139]

VII.

Conclusion

We hold that a liberty interest exists in the choice of how and
when one dies, and that the provision of the Washington statute
banning assisted suicide, as applied to competent, terminally ill
adults who wish to hasten their deaths by obtaining medication
prescribed by their doctors, violates the Due Process
Clause.[FOOTNOTE 140] We recognize that this decision is a most
difficult and controversial one, and that it leaves unresolved a
large number of equally troublesome issues that will require
resolution in the years ahead. We also recognize that other able
and dedicated jurists, construing the Constitution as they believe
it must be construed, may disagree not only with the result we
reach but with our method of constitutional analysis. Given the
nature of the judicial process and the complexity of the task of
determining the rights and interests comprehended by the
Constitution, good faith disagreements within the judiciary should
not surprise or disturb anyone who follows the development of the
law. For these reasons, we express our hope that whatever debate
may accompany the future exploration of the issues we have touched
on today will be conducted in an objective, rational, and
constructive manner that will increase, not diminish, respect for
the Constitution.

There is one final point we must emphasize. Some argue strongly
that decisions regarding matters affecting life or death should
not be made by the courts. Essentially, we agree with that
proposition. In this case, by permitting the individual to
exercise the right to choose we are following the constitutional
mandate to take such decisions out of the hands of the government,
both state and federal, and to put them where they rightly belong,
in the hands of the people. We are allowing individuals to make
the decisions that so profoundly affect their very existence --
and precluding the state from intruding excessively into that
critical realm. The Constitution and the courts stand as a bulwark
between individual freedom and arbitrary and intrusive
governmental power. Under our constitutional system, neither the
state nor the majority of the people in a state can impose its
will upon the individual in a matter so highly "central to
personal dignity and autonomy," Casey, 112 S.Ct. at 2807. Those
who believe strongly that death must come without physician
assistance are free to follow that creed, be they doctors or
patients. They are not free, however, to force their views, their
religious convictions, or their philosophies on all the other
members of a democratic society, and to compel those whose values
differ with theirs to die painful, protracted, and agonizing
deaths.

AFFIRMED




FN1. The Second Circuit currently has before it a similar case:
Quill v. Vacco, No. 95-7028 (2d Cir.). The district court in that
case, Quill v. Koppell, 870 F.Supp. 78 (S.D.N.Y. 1994), held that
terminally ill, competent adult patients do not have a fundamental
substantive due process right to physician-assisted suicide and
that the New York statutes that prohibit assisted-suicide while
permitting terminally ill patients to reject life-sustaining
treatment do not violate the Equal Protection Clause.

FN2. Compassion In Dying provides information, counseling, and
assistance to mentally competent, terminally ill adult patients
considering hastening their deaths. It also provides similar
services to the families of such patients. Compassion In Dying v.
State of Wash., 850 F.Supp. 1454, 1458 (W.D. Wash. 1994).

FN3. For purposes of this appeal, we do not distinguish between
the two capacities in which the doctors sue. As we explain in the
text immediately following, the doctors have standing to sue on
their own behalf as well as on behalf of the patients. In both
cases, the doctors are required to raise the patients' liberty
interests. Regardless of the capacity in which the doctors sue,
the result depends on the identical constitutional inquiry: May
the provision of certain medical assistance to competent,
terminally ill adult patients who wish to die be prohibited by
state law in light of the patients' rights and interests protected
by the Due Process Clause?

FN4. Cases after Roe, without mentioning Roe, have said that the
capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review doctrine applies when
there is a reasonable expectation that the same party could be
subject to the same action again. Murphy v. Hunt, 455 U.S. 478,
482 (1982); Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 400-402 (1975). None of
these cases, however, involved terminally ill persons. We would
think that a distinction could reasonably be drawn between the
terminally ill, all of whom necessarily will die prior to
completion of the litigation, and those whose cases become moot
for more mundane or less predictable reasons. In this connection,
we note that the most common classification of terminally ill
persons limits that group to individuals who are expected to die
within six months. In any event we emphasize that even if the
Murphy-Sosna interpretation of the
capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review requirement applies to
cases involving terminally ill plaintiffs, this case would not be
moot because the doctors have standing to challenge the Washington
statute both on behalf of terminally ill patients and on their own
behalf.

FN5. City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983) is not to
the contrary. In that case, Lyons claimed that Los Angeles police
officers placed him in a chokehold without provocation and secured
an injunction to keep LAPD officers from placing people in
chokeholds except as necessary for self-defense. The Court
reversed the injunction, saying that the lower court lacked
jurisdiction to enter it because Lyons had not established that he
was in real and immediate danger of being needlessly subjected to
a chokehold again. The Court said that any future danger to Lyons
was speculative because that danger would only materialize if
Lyons again committed an act that caused the police to arrest him,
and the police then again acted improperly or illegally. In this
case, by contrast, there are unquestionably patients who are
terminally ill and the danger to them and to their doctors is
neither speculative nor dependent on illegal or improper actions
by state actors.

FN6. While the District Court did not reach the claims that the
doctors asserted on their own behalf, as we explained supra note
3, those claims are properly before us, and, given the result we
reach, they are necessarily resolved by our decision.

FN7. In their complaint, under Causes of Action, plaintiffs
stated: "The Fourteenth Amendment protects the rights of
terminally ill adults with no chance of recovery to make decisions
about the end of their lives, including the right to choose to
hasten inevitable death with suitable physician-prescribed drugs
and thereby avoid pain and suffering."

FN8. Notwithstanding the District Court's declaration that the
Washington statute is unconstitutional, the effect of its ruling
is unclear. It is extremely unlikely that the district judge
intended to strike down the entire statute, as the state asserts
she did, in view of the fact that the appellants attacked only its
"or aids" provision. This is particularly true because the "or
aids" provision is clearly severable under Washington law. See
Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491, 505 (1985).

It is equally unclear whether the District Judge intended to
strike the "or aids" provision on its face or as applied. Compare
Compassion In Dying, 850 F.Supp. at 1456 with id. at 1459 and id.
at 1462-64. Again, we think it unlikely that she intended to
strike the entire provision for two reasons. First, the plaintiffs
only argued that the assisted-suicide provision violated the
constitutional rights of terminally ill, competent adults, and
only offered evidence to that end. The parties did not address
whether broader relief was permitted or required, and the District
Court offered no explanation as to why a finding that the
provision was unconstitutional as applied to the terminally ill
would cause her to strike the provision on its face rather than as
applied to the injured group. Second, as we noted previously, the
District Court did not reach the claims raised by Compassion In
Dying. Id. at 1467. As to Compassion In Dying, Judge Rothstein
found only that summary judgment was not warranted "at this time."
Id. at 1467-68. If the District Court had struck down the
provision on its face, there would have been no purpose to its
denying Compassion In Dying's summary judgment motion with a
qualification that so clearly suggests that further proceedings
might transpire. Nor would there have been any reason for it to
have denied the doctors' motion on their own behalf in an equally
non-final manner.

FN9. Declaring a statute unconstitutional as applied to members of
a group is atypical but not uncommon. See, e.g., Tennessee v.
Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 11 (1985) (holding that state law permitting
police officers to use deadly force to prevent the escape of
felony suspects was unconstitutional as applied to suspects who
pose no immediate threat to officers or others); Wisconsin v.
Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972) (holding Wisconsin's mandatory
attendance law unconstitutional but only as applied to Amish
children who have graduated from eight grade). Although the Court
did not explicitly use the term "as applied," it did explicitly
affirm the judgment of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, id. at 207,
which struck down the statute only as applied to Amish children
who had graduated from the eighth grade. Wisconsin v. Yoder, 182
N.W.2d 539 (Wis. 1971).

Because we are not deciding the facial validity of RCW 9A.36.060,
there can be no question that the exacting test for adjudicating
claims of facial invalidity announced in United States v. Salerno,
481 U.S. 739 (1987), is inapplicable here. ("A facial challenge to
a legislative Act is, of course, the most difficult challenge to
mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no
set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid."
Id. at 744). For that reason alone, we would reject Washington's
suggestion that we use the Salerno test for adjudicating
plaintiffs' constitutional challenge.

Moreover, not only is there strong evidence that the Court does
not generally apply the Salerno test, see Michael C. Dorf, Facial
Challenges to State and Federal Statutes, 46 Stan. L. Rev. 235
(1994), but it is clear that it has applied a different test for
judging the constitutionality of statutes restricting a woman's
right to secure an abortion. Casey, 112 S.Ct. at 2829-30. Since
the claimed liberty issue in this case is in many respects similar
to the liberty issue involved in Casey, see discussion infra at
pp. 3162-3164 and 3138, we believe that the Salerno test would not
in any event be the appropriate one for adjudicating a facial
challenge to Washington's prohibition on assisted suicide.

FN10. The Washington Natural Death Act, RCW 70.122.010 et seq.,
states:

adult persons have the fundamental right to control the decisions
relating to the rendering of their own health care, including the
decision to have life-sustaining treatment withheld or withdrawn,
in instances of a terminal condition or permanent unconscious
condition . . . .

RCW 70.122.010.

FN11. For a brief discussion of the dissent's rejection by
implication of the balancing test, see pp. 3139-3140 infra.

FN12. The most famous dissent, of course, was that of the first
Justice Harlan in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896).

FN13. Most of the liberty interests or rights that the Court
recognized before Roe are static. One's liberty interest in
marriage, procreation, family relationships, child rearing,
intercourse for purposes other than procreation, and whether or
not to bear or beget children, for instance, remains relatively
constant, at least throughout one's adult years. Similarly the
state's countervailing interests change little if at all. Abortion
cases require a more dynamic mode of analysis, however. In Roe,
the Court explained that the relative weight of a woman's liberty
interest in terminating an unwanted pregnancy, compared to the
state's interest in protecting life shifts dramatically during the
course of a pregnancy. As a result, the extent to which state
action is permissible shifts dramatically as well. See also
Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (1992).

FN14. See, e.g., Sarah Henry, The Battle Over Assisted-Suicide,
Calif. Law., 1, 35 (defining physician-assisted death "as
providing or prescribing medication to someone, knowing that that
person intends to take a lethal dose of the medication").

FN15. We use the terms "assisted suicide" and "physician-assisted
suicide" interchangeably throughout this opinion, although as we
have noted, we have serious doubts as to the correctness or
propriety of the terms, as they are generally used. We should
note, however, that there is another commonly used term --
"physician-aid-in-dying" -- that is also relevant to our
discussion. That term includes not only the prescribing of drugs
("assisted suicide") but also the administration of drugs by the
physician. The issue of the constitutionality of prohibiting
physicians from administering life-ending drugs to terminally ill
persons is not before us for decision.

FN16. The case was decided by a 5-4 vote, and Justice Powell
subsequently announced on several occasions that he regretted that
vote. "I think I probably made a mistake," Powell reportedly once
said. Upon rereading the opinion a few months after it was issued,
he reportedly remarked, "I thought the dissent had the better of
the argument." David Cole, Playing Pornography's Rule: The
Regulation of Sexual Expression, 143 U. Pa. L. Rev. 111, 176-77
(1994), citing Linda Greenhouse, When Second Thoughts in a Case
Come Too Late, N.Y. Times, Nov. 5, 1990, at 14. The Bowers
decision has been widely criticized by commentators. William N.
Eskridge Jr. and Phillip P. Frickey, The Supreme Court 1993 --
Forward: Law as Equilibrium, 108 Harv. L.Rev. 26, 95 (1994)
(criticizing Bowers for embodying "segregationist" caste
distinctions similar to those upheld in Plessy v. Ferguson);
Kendall Thomas, The Eclipse of Reason: A Rhetorical Reading of
Bowers v. Hardwick, 79 Va. L. Rev. 1805, 1806 (1993) (saying
Bowers represents a homophobic ideology); Lance Liebman, A Tribute
to Justice Byron A. White, 107 Harv. L.Rev. 13, 19 (1993) (calling
Bowers Justice White's worst opinion). The passage quoted in the
text, however, is not controversial.

FN17. This passage appears in Part II of the joint opinion by
Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter. In their concurring
opinions, both Justice Stevens and Justice Blackmun joined in that
part of the joint opinion. 112 S.Ct. at 2843. Thus Part II
represents the views of five justices and so the Court. Unless
otherwise noted, all passages cited from Casey represent the
opinion of the Court and not merely a plurality of its members.

FN18. In one case in which the liberty interest was at a bare
minimum because it involved the interest of uniformed police
officers in their appearance -- a matter in which the Court said
that the citizenry at large had only "some sort of liberty
interest" and suggested that uniformed police officers had far
less even than that -- the Court subjected departmental grooming
regulations to rational basis review. See Kelley v. Johnson, 425
U.S. 238, 244, 248-249 (1976). Subsequent to that decision,
however, with liberty interests of more than minimal weight, the
Court has consistently applied either strict scrutiny or a
balancing test.

FN19. The district judge who heard the constitutional challenge to
the New York Statute barring doctors from helping terminally ill,
competent adults to hasten their deaths committed a similar error
in concluding that plaintiffs' alleged failure to offer historical
evidence was fatal to their claim. Quill v. Koppell, 870 F.Supp.
78, 83 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) ("The trouble is that plaintiffs make no
attempt to argue that physician assisted suicide, even in the case
of terminally ill patients, has any historic recognition as a
legal right.").

FN20. Had the Court applied a rigid, originalist view of
constitutional interpretation, a married couple consisting of a
black husband and a white wife (or vice-versa) would be unable to
live in the state of Virginia today. Our nation's long history of
outlawing racially-mixed marriages is traceable to the early
colonial period. The first anti-miscegenation statute was passed
in Maryland in 1661. Harvey M. Applebaum, Miscegenation Statutes:
A Constitutional and Social Problem, 53 Geo. L.J. 49, 50 (1964).

As the nation grew, so did the number of states with miscegenation
bans. Forty-one states enacted anti-miscegenation statutes at one
time or another; all but three of these forty-one states had such
statutes during the nineteenth century. Applebaum, supra, at 50 &
n.9. During the time surrounding the Congressional debates
concerning the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, all the slave
states and most of the non-slave states had anti-miscegenation
statutes. R. Carter Pittman, The Fourteenth Amendment: Its
Intended Effect on Anti-Miscegenation Laws, 43 N.C. L. Rev. 92,
106 (1964).

The passage of the Fourteenth Amendment had little effect on the
judiciary's view of the constitutionality of anti-miscegenation
statutes. Even as late as the early 1960's, only a few years
before the Loving decision, the courts continued to hold to the
strong tradition prohibiting interracial marriages:

The courts of last resort of fifteen states have reached the
question of their [anti-miscegenation statutes'] constitutionality
and all but one have upheld them. In addition, the federal
[district] courts and the one federal court of appeals that have
been confronted with the statutes have sustained their
constitutional validity.

Applebaum, supra, at 56 (footnotes omitted). See also James
Trosino, American Wedding: Same-Sex Marriage and the Miscegenation
Analogy, 73 B.U. L. Rev. 93, 104 (1993) ("In the 100 years
following the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, only one
state court overturned an anti-miscegenation law.").

The Supreme Court did not directly address the constitutionality
of proscriptions against interracial marriage until its decision
in Loving. It could have done so previously but chose to sidestep
the issue. See Pace v. Alabama, 106 U.S. 583, 585 (1883). At the
time of the Loving decision, sixteen states still prohibited and
punished interracial marriages. Loving, 388 U.S. at 6. Six of
those states went so far as to include in their state
constitutions a provision banning interracial marriages. 388 U.S.
at 6 n.5.

The Loving Court declared anti-miscegenation statutes
unconstitutional, saying that they violated both the Equal
Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause. In so doing, the
Court rejected three hundred years of tradition and overwhelming
precedent to the contrary.

FN21. When the Court turns to history, it does not limit its
inquiry to the practices at the time of the founding or the time
of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. Rather, the Court
also looks to British common law and beyond. In Roe, for example,
Justice Blackmun, writing for the majority, went to great pains to
show that abortion was practiced "in Greek times and in the Roman
era" and also that abortion of a fetus before quickening was not a
crime at English common law or in the early days of the American
Republic. Roe, 410 U.S. at 130-140.

acceptance. Hundreds of Jews killed themselves at Masada in order
to avoid being captured by Roman legions. The ancient Sythians
believed it was an honor to commit suicide when they became too
frail for their nomadic way of life. The Vikings believed that the
next greatest honor, after death in battle, was death by suicide.

-- Samson, Saul, Abimlech, and Achitophel -- and none is treated

Judas Iscariot is not treated as a further sin, rather as an act
of repentance.

FN54. Franklin G. Miller et al, Regulating Physician-Assisted
Death, 331 N. Eng. J. Med. 119, 119 (1994). Dr. Jack Kevorkian is
currently facing criminal charges for helping several patients
hasten their deaths. His case presents a number of peculiar
factors that prevent us from drawing any particular inferences
from the fact that local authorities in Michigan have made a
number of efforts to obtain a conviction.

In a celebrated, though less complicated, recent example, a grand
jury decided against indicting Dr. Timothy Quill, who admitted in
the pages of the New England Journal of Medicine that he had
intentionally prescribed the barbiturates that a terminally ill
patient used to end her life. Pugliese, supra note 46, at 1298 n.
47.

Quill's case was not exceptional. In 1973, a New York physician
who administered a lethal injection to a comatose patient was
acquitted of assisted suicide. In 1950, another doctor was
acquitted after injecting a "fatal air embolism into the blood
vessels of a carcinoma patient, who had repeatedly urged him to
end her misery." Id. at 1298 nn. 45-46.

FN56. See generally Pugliese, supra note 46. Some experts estimate
that notwithstanding criminal sanctions, physicians may play a
role in hastening the deaths of 6,000 terminally ill patients a
day, many through the use of pain relieving drugs that accelerate
death. Timothy E. Quill, et al., Care of the Hopelessly Ill:

slow acting ailments such as heart disease, cancer, and

disease diagnosed at least 29 months in advance; chronic
conditions were the cause of more than 87% of the deaths in 1978.

familiar surroundings, with their loved ones around them. No

FN62. As a sidenote, President Francois Mitterrand of France,
acknowledged universally as one of the contemporary world's
greatest leaders, recently decided to hasten his death, only a
short time after his voluntary retirement from office. He did so,
after consulting with his doctor, by ceasing to take the
medication that had not only been keeping him alive, but had
enabled him to perform most of life's important tasks. As his
doctor told him would be the case, he died three days later.
President Mitterrand's decision was widely publicized and his
final act was generally considered an act of courage and dignity.
See Scott Kraft, Forsaking Cancer Medication, Mitterrand Wrote Own
Final Chapter, L.A. Times, Jan. 13, 1996.

FN63. When we refer to the Due Process Clause in this opinion, we
refer to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,
whether or not we include the reference to the specific numbered
amendment. The due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, of
course, provides inter alia, similar protection against comparable
invasions by the federal government.

FN64. The dissent points to language in Palko v. Connecticut, 302
U.S. 319, 325 (1937), referring to liberty interests that are such
that "neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were
sacrificed." That language, however, has never been applied
literally. It would be difficult, if not impossible, for any
fundamental right or liberty interest to meet such a standard. One
could hardly argue for example that neither liberty nor justice
would survive if contraceptives were banned, as they were for most
of our history. Nor, indubitably, would even the most vigorous
proponent of abortion rights argue that neither liberty nor
justice existed in this nation prior to Roe.

FN65. In this respect, Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986),
would appear to be aberrant and to turn on the specific sexual act
at issue. In Bowers, the Court held that the Constitution does not
"confer[ ] a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in
[homosexual] sodomy." 478 U.S. at 190. We do not believe that the
Bowers holding controls the outcome here or is in any way
inconsistent with our conclusion that there is a liberty interest
in dying peacefully and with dignity. We also note, without
surprise, that in the decade since Bowers was handed down the
Court has never cited its central holding approvingly.

FN66. Declaration of Peter Shalit, M.D., at 5-6.

FN67. In a passage that has caused confusion among commentators,
the Chief Justice later said that the Court would assume the
existence of a constitutionally protected right to reject
life-sustaining delivery of food and water for purposes of
deciding the controversy presented in Cruzan. The Court stated:

Although we think the logic of the cases discussed above would
embrace such a liberty interest, the dramatic consequences
involved in refusal of such treatment would inform the inquiry as
to whether the deprivation of that interest is constitutionally
permissible. But for purposes of this case, we assume that the
United States Constitution would grant a competent person a
constitutionally protected right to refuse lifesaving hydration
and nutrition.

Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 279 (emphasis added). The passage is not
inconsistent with, nor does it undermine, the Court's earlier
statement that a due process liberty interest may be inferred from
its prior holdings. Rather, the Court found a liberty interest and
assumed a liberty right. That is, the Court recognized that an
overall deprivation of the liberty interest would not be
permissible and then assumed for purposes of deciding the ultimate
issue before it that in the circumstances presented by Cruzan the
interest resulted in a constitutional right and the state could
not prohibit its exercise. Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 279. The ultimate
question before the Court was whether or not Missouri could
constitutionally require clear and convincing evidence of a
comatose patient's previously stated wish not to be kept alive by
artificial provision of food and water. The Court answered that
question in the affirmative.

FN68. Justice Scalia, despite explicitly joining the majority
opinion appears to assert that a person has no liberty interest in
rejecting forced nourishment, at least when doing so is
tantamount, in his opinion, to committing suicide. Cruzan, 497
U.S. at 293-94 (Scalia, J., concurring). We have two comments in
response to that assertion. First, we interpret Justice Scalia's
statement as setting forth his view on a somewhat different point
-- one that the Court explicitly did not decide -- when, whether,
and under what circumstances Nancy Cruzan's exercise of a liberty
interest could be prohibited by the state. Second, if we are wrong
and Justice Scalia intended his statement to reflect an opposite
view of the majority opinion to that stated by Justice O'Connor,
his expression of his individual view cannot serve to change the
opinion itself. In our view, Justice O'Connor's interpretation of
the opinion is correct. Moreover, Justice Brennan, in a dissent
joined by Justices Marshall and Blackmun, concluded that Nancy
Cruzan has "a fundamental right to be free from unwanted
artificial nutrition and hydration," id. at 302, as did Justice
Stevens in his dissent, id. at 343. Thus, at least eight of the
justices recognized a strong due process liberty interest in
rejecting unwanted medical treatment, including the artificial
provision of food and water.

Even if, however, the majority opinion had only recognized a
liberty interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment without
deciding whether or not that liberty interest encompasses the
rejection of the artificial provision of food and water, five
justices (Justice O'Connor, in her concurrence, and the four
dissenting justices) still clearly found a liberty interest in
rejecting the artificial provision of food and water. The Supreme
Court has previously recognized that concurring and dissenting
justices can constitute a controlling majority on a particular
issue, at least where that view does not conflict with the holding
of the majority. Here, there is no conflict of any kind with the
majority opinion. Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 194 n. 8
(1977).

FN69. It is also clear that the proposition recognized by Cruzan
is one of general applicability and not limited to the terminally
ill. Id. at 278. Indeed, Nancy Cruzan was not terminally ill, and
as the Court noted, "[m]edical experts testified that she could
live another thirty years." Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 266 n.1. Thus, the
Court could not have resolved the case as it did by finding a
liberty interest only in the terminally ill.

FN70. Prior to the Court's decision in Cruzan, more than 15 states
specifically prohibited implementing an advance directive that
would have led to the termination of artificial nutrition and
hydration. Alan Meisel, The Right to Die 369 & n.63 (1989). A few
years after Cruzan, however, only a few states still prohibited
the termination of nutrition and hydration as part of a living
will, a prohibition that is probably unconstitutional under
Cruzan. Alan Meisel, The Right to Die; 1994 Cumulative Supplement
No. 2 395-99 (1994).

FN71. The majority of the three-judge panel identified five state
interests. First, "[t]he interest in not having physicians in the
role of killers of their patients." Second, "[t]he interest in not
subjecting the elderly and even the not-elderly but infirm to
psychological pressure to consent to their own deaths." Third,
"[t]he interest in protecting the poor and minorities from
exploitation." Fourth, "[t]he interest in protecting all of the
handicapped from societal indifference and apathy." Fifth, "[a]n
interest in preventing abuse similar to what has occurred in the
Netherlands where, since 1984, legal guidelines have tacitly
allowed assisted suicide or euthanasia in response to a repeated
request from a suffering, competent patient." Compassion In Dying,
49 F.3d at 592-93. The district court, by contrast, employing more
dispassionate and traditional terms, identified two somewhat
broader state interests: preventing suicide and preventing undue
influence and abuse. Compassion In Dying, 850 F.Supp. at 1464-65.

In two substituted judgment cases about halting the
life-sustaining treatment of patients who were in or almost in a
vegetative state, the Washington Supreme Court listed four
possible countervailing state interests: 1) the preservation of
life; 2) the protection of the interests of innocent third
parties; 3) the prevention of suicide; and 4) the maintenance of
the integrity of the medical profession. In re Guardianship of
Grant, 747 P.2d 455, 451 (Wash. 1987); In re Colyer, 660 P.2d.
738, 743 (Wash. 1983).

In Superintendent of Belchertown State School v. Saikewicz, 373
Mass. 728 (1977), one of several state supreme court cases
discussed in Cruzan, the state court found four state interests:
preservation of life, protection of the interests of innocent
third parties, the prevention of suicide, and the maintenance of
the ethical integrity of the medical profession. Cruzan, 497 U.S.
at 271.%%

FN72. Were it otherwise no state could administer capital
punishment; similarly, the draft, as well as the defense budget,
would be unconstitutional.

FN73. The statute, enacted in 1979, includes the following
definition of terminal condition:

"Terminal condition" means an incurable and irreversible condition
caused by injury, disease, or illness, that, within reasonable
medical judgment will cause death within a reasonable period of
time in accordance with accepted medical standards, and where the
application of life-sustaining treatment serves only to prolong
the process of dying.

RCW 70.122.020(9).

FN74. Other states have recognized liberty interests similar to
those recognized by Washington. See e.g. Ala. Code section 22-8A-2
(1995) (stating that adults have a "fundamental right" to control
decisions relating to the rendering of their own medical care even
when no longer able to participate actively in those decisions);
Alaska Stat. section 18.12.100 (1995) (recognizing that some
medical procedures "serve only to prolong the dying process");
Cal. Health & Safety Code section 7185.5 (West 1996) (finding that
adults have "fundamental right" to control decisions affecting
their medical care and recognizing that continued, unwanted
medical treatment "violate[s] patient dignity and cause[s]
unnecessary pain and suffering, while providing nothing medically
necessary or beneficial to the person"); Ga. Code Ann. section
31-32-1 (1995) (protecting patient autonomy from loss of dignity
and unnecessary pain and suffering); 19 Haw. Rev. Stat. section
327D-1 (recognizing that "artificial prolongation of life for
persons with a terminal condition . . . secure[s] only a

FN75. A "living will" permits a competent adult to direct in
advance that under certain specific circumstances future
life-sustaining treatment should be withheld or terminated. A
"durable power of attorney" for health care decisions allows a
competent adult to designate someone else to make future medical
decisions for him should he lose the capacity to make them
himself. In cases in which an incompetent individual has not
completed a living will or executed a durable power of attorney,
some states permit the courts to appoint a guardian to make
medical decisions on his behalf.

FN76. In Grant, the Washington Supreme Court said that the state's
interest in preserving life "weakens considerably, however, if
treatment will merely postpone death for a person with a terminal
and incurable condition." 747 P.2d at 451; In Colyer, the
Washington Supreme Court held that the state's interest in
preserving life "weakens, however, in situations where continued
treatment only serves to prolong a life inflicted with an
incurable condition." 660 P.2d at 743.

An increasing number of states now define terminal condition to
include permanent or persistent vegetative state and/or
irreversible coma. See, e.g., Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. section

Code Ann. section 54.1-2982 (Michie Supp. 1992). Other statutes
reach the same result by defining qualified patient as one who is
in a terminal condition or a persistent vegetative state. See,
e.g., Cal. Health & Safety Code section 7186(h) (west Supp. 1992);
Colo. Rev. Stat. section 15-18-103(9) (1987 & Supp. 1992); Iowa

Hawaii statute, however, achieves this result by deleting the
definition of "qualified patient" and adding a definition of
"permanent loss of the ability to communicate concerning medical
treatment decisions" which includes being in a persistent
vegetative state or a deep coma or having a permanent loss of the
capacity to participate in medical treatment decisions. See Haw.
Rev. Stat. Ann. section 327D-2 (1991). Still other statutes reach
the same result by including a separate definition of persistent
vegetative state or permanent unconsciousness. See, e.g., Conn.

FN86. While recognizing the state's general interest in preventing
suicide, the district court in this case said that it did not
apply in the case of terminally ill, competent adults who wished
to hasten their deaths. The court said:

As to them, preventing suicide simply means prolonging a dying
person's suffering, an aim in which the State can have no
interest. In other words, the State's legitimate interest in
preventing suicide is not abrogated by allowing mentally competent
terminally ill patients to freely and voluntarily commit
physician-assisted suicide.

doctors from even attempting certain types of care and could
thereby force them into hasty and premature decisions to allow a

FN91. As the Missouri Supreme Court starkly put it:

This is also a case in which euphemisms readily find their way to
the fore, perhaps to soften the reality of what is really at
stake. But this is not a case in which we are asked to let someone
die. Nancy is not dead. Nor is she terminally ill. This is a case
in which we are asked to allow the medical profession to make
Nancy die by starvation and dehydration.

Cruzan By Cruzan v. Harmon, 760 S.W.2d 408, 412 (1988) (emphasis
added). The facts corroborate the Missouri Supreme Court's
assertion. Nancy Cruzan was kept alive through artificial feeding
for nearly eight years. After the United States Supreme Court
remanded the case, a Missouri court determined that she had
expressed a clear wish before her accident not to be kept alive by
artificial means and ordered a halt to the artificial feeding. She
died twelve days later. Cathaleen A. Roach, Paradox and Pandora's
Box: The Tragedy of Current Right-To-Die Jurisprudence, 25 U.
Mich. J.L.Ref. 133, 138 (1991), citing Cruzan v. Mouton Estate No.
CV384-9P (Mo.Cir.Ct. Dec. 14, 1990). As the Missouri Supreme Court
told us would be the case, it was the discontinuance of the
provision of food and water, not Cruzan's accident almost eight
years earlier, that caused her death. Thus, Nancy Cruzan did not
die from an underlying illness, but from deliberate
self-starvation.

FN92. The removal of the gastronomy tube, which was clearly the
precipitating cause of her death, is not considered to be the
legal cause only because a judicial judgment has been made that
removing the feeding tube is permissible. See Note,

FN94. Decisions Near the End of Life, a report by the Council on
Ethical and Judicial Affairs of the American Medical Association,
provides an informative discussion of "double effect." An abridged
version of the report, published in the Journal of American
Medicine described the Council's conclusions this way:

The Council stated in its 1988 report that "the administration of
a drug necessary to ease the pain of a patient who is terminally
ill and suffering excruciating pain may be appropriate medical
treatment even though the effect of the drug may shorten life."
The Council maintains this position and further emphasizes that a
competent patient must be the one who decides whether the relief
from pain and suffering is worth the danger of hastening death.
The principle of respect for patient autonomy and
self-determination requires that patients decide about such
treatment.

Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, American Medical
Association, 54 Decisions Near the End of Life, 267 The Journal of
the American Medical Association (April 22-29 1992).

FN95. Timothy E. Quill, M.D., Death and Dignity: Making Choices
and Taking Charge 107-108 (1993). The term "double effect"
originates in Roman Catholic moral theology, which holds that it
is sometimes morally justifiable to cause evil in the pursuit of
good. See May, Double Effect, in Encyclopedia of Bioethics 316 (W.
Reich ed. 1978).

See also Report of the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs of
the American Medical Association, 10 Issues L. & Med. 91 (1994).
In its report, the Council said:

The intent of palliative treatment is to relieve pain and
suffering, not to end the patient's life, but the patient's death
is a possible side effect of the treatment. It is ethically
acceptable for a physician to gradually increase the appropriate
medication for a patient, realizing that the medication may
depress respiration and cause death.

Id. at 92 (emphasis added). The euphemistic use of "possible" and
"may" may salve the conscience of the AMA, but it does not change
the realities of the practice of medicine or the legal
consequences that would normally flow from the commission of an
act one has reason to believe will likely result in the death of
another. In the case of "double effect" we excuse the act or, to
put it more accurately, we find the act acceptable, not because
the doctors sugarcoat the facts in order to permit society to say
that they couldn't really know the consequences of their action,
but because the act is medically and ethically appropriate even
though the result -- the patient's death -- is both foreseeable
and intended.

FN96. Analgesics, most notably morphine, when applied in
sufficient doses, will bring about a patient's death because they
serve to repress respiration.

FN97. See generally Harold G. Koenig, Legalizing
Physician-Assisted Suicide: Some Thoughts and Concerns, 37 J. Fam.
Prac. 171 (1993).

FN98. There is some evidence that the state's efforts to prohibit
assisted suicide in hopes of deterring suicide is at least
partially counter-productive. As a result of the state's ban, some
terminally ill adults probably commit suicide although they
otherwise might not have done so and others probably commit
suicide sooner than they would have done so.

In his recent book, Judge Richard Posner suggests that "permitting
physician-assisted suicide . . . [in] cases of physical incapacity
might actually reduce the number of suicides and postpone the
suicides that occur." Richard Posner, Age and Old Age 224 (1995).
Judge Posner concludes that assuring such individuals that they
would be able to end their lives later if they wished to, even if
they became totally physically incapacitated, would deter them
from committing suicide now and would also give such people a
renewed peace of mind. He says that some of those individuals
would eventually commit suicide but others would decide never to
do so. Id. 243-253.

The suicide of Nobel Prize winning physicist Percy Bridgman,
recounted in one of the amicus briefs, graphically illustrates the
point. Dr. Bridgman, 79, was in the final stages of cancer when he
shot himself on August 20, 1961, leaving a suicide note that said:
"It is not decent for society to make a man do this to himself.
Probably this is the last day I will be able to do it myself."
Sherman B. Nuland, How We Die, 152-53 (1993).

FN99. The argument there was that the poor and the minorities
would either be persuaded to have too many abortions or would be
forced to have them against their will: The fact is that the poor
and the minorities have been disproportionately deprived of the
opportunity to have abortions, not only because they cannot afford
such operations, but because in numerous instances restrictive
legislation, sponsored by those who oppose abortion rights,
prohibits the use of public funds to pay for them. See, e.g., 42
U.S.C. section 300a-6 (prohibiting the use of Title X grants in
programs in which abortions are performed or abortion counseling
is offered); Planned Parenthood Affiliates of Cal. v. Swoap, 173
Cal.App.3d 1187 (Cal. Ct. App. 1985) (holding that section of
state budget act containing restrictive language regarding use of
family planning funds for abortion-related services violated the
state constitution).

FN100. According to its protocol, Compassion In Dying will not
assist terminally ill patients unless the patient has obtained the
approval of family members or others with whom the patient has a
close personal relationship. While we do not reach Compassion In
Dying's claim or consider the merits of the safeguards it has
devised, we note that a similar requirement by the state would
raise constitutional concerns. We in no way suggest, however, that
a private organization is not free to adopt higher standards than
the state is permitted to impose in order to advance its interests
or those of its clients.

FN101. Cf. Middlesex County Ethics Committee v. Gasrden, 457 U.S.
423, 434 (1982) (noting that state has important interest in
"maintaining and assuring the professional conduct of professional
attorneys it licenses").

FN102. The American Medical Association devotes a considerable
portion of the amicus brief it filed in this case to arguing that
doctors who give medication with knowledge that it will have a
double effect, including hastening death, should not be deemed to
have violated Washington's assisted suicide law. The organization
struggles mightily, albeit unsuccessfully, to distinguish for
legal purposes between the administration of medication for a dual
and a single effect. Nevertheless, we agree with the AMA's point
-- the administration of dual effect medication, with informed
consent, does not constitute a criminal act. However, if, as the
AMA contends, administering medicine that will result in death is
lawful, we cannot comprehend the logic of its equivocal conclusion
that prescribing life-ending medication for the patient at his
request can constitute a crime, at least "at this time." (If the
patient's consent has not been obtained for dual effect treatment,
there would of course be even less justification for the AMA's
fallacious distinction.) The line the AMA seeks to draw conflicts
with reason as well as with the proper constitutional approach.
The key factor in both dual effect and physician-assisted suicide
cases is that it is the terminally ill patient's voluntary and
informed wish that the doctor assist him to die through medical
treatment. Were we to agree with those who would label some of the
current medical practices engaged in at life's end as killing a
patient or "euthanasia," we would put the AMA-sanctioned dual
effect practice on that side of the line long before we would
include the act of prescribing medication that is to be
self-administered. It is the glaring inconsistency in the AMA's
position that is undoubtedly responsible in part for the dissent's
rejection of the AMA's plea to hold lawful the "dual effect"
practice. See Dissent at 3223.

FN103. For a recent example, see Francis Moore, M.D., Easing
Life's End: Doctors, Patients and the Final Medical Dilemma, Harv.
Mag. at 46, 47 Aug. 1995 ("It is my credo that assisting people to
leave the dwelling place of their body when it is no longer
habitable is becoming an obligation of the medical profession").

The Oregon AMA refrained from taking a position on a successful
ballot initiative to legalize physician assisted suicide because
its membership was sharply divided on whether to back or oppose
the measure. Melinda A. Lee & Susan W. Tolle, Oregon's Assisted
Suicide Vote: the Silver Lining, 124 Annals of Internal Med. 267

FN106. Id. at 308.

FN107. The state also has an interest in furthering the progress
of medical science. Some argue that the relentless search for new
and better treatments for the terminally ill might be undermined
by permitting physicians to help terminally ill patients hasten
their deaths. We put no stock in this argument. As is shown by the
experience of countless patients suffering from cancer and AIDS,
most patients are not willing to give up hope until they have
exhausted all possibilities provided by established treatments and
in addition have tried any available experimental ones. We are
certain that there will be neither a shortage of patients willing
to volunteer for controlled studies of new medications and
treatments nor of researchers equally willing to develop new forms
and manners of treatment.

FN108. In its amicus brief in this case, the AMA attached a
Journal of American Medicine article, reporting the conclusion of
the AMA's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs. The article
concluded this way: "the societal risk of involving physicians in
medical interventions to cause patients' death is too great in
this culture to condone euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide
at this time" (emphasis added).

FN109. In one of the two translations quoted by the Roe Court, the
Oath says:

I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor
will I make a suggestion to this effect. Similarly I will not give
a woman an abortive remedy.

Roe, 410 U.S. at 131.

FN110. We note that even in ancient times many physicians did not
interpret the oath literally. As three commentators said, "It is
well established that Greek and Roman physicians, even those who
were Hippocratic, often supplied their patients with the means to
commit suicide, despite the injunction against assistance in
suicide embodied in the Hippocratic oath." Rebecca C. Morgan et
al., The Issue of Personal Choice: The Competent Incurable Patient
and the Right to Commit Suicide, 57 Missouri L.Rev. 3, 46 (1992).

FN112. Patients who are concerned about the possibility that they
will suffer an unwanted agonizing death because of a doctor's
unwillingness to provide them with the medication they need would
have the opportunity to select a doctor whose view of the
physician's role comports with theirs. See Michigan Commission on
Death and Dying, Final Report (June 1994), which reprints Model

to provide aid-in-dying.

FN114. The dissent cites the experience in the Netherlands, where
physician-aid-in-dying is allowed in some circumstances, to
buttress both its claims that physician-assisted suicide cannot be
adequately regulated and that approval of that limited practice
will inevitably lead to the administration of death-inducing drugs
without the patient's consent. Dissent at 3250, 3259. We note that
the reports on relevant medical practices in the Netherlands are
so mixed that it is difficult to draw any conclusions from them.
See, e.g., Maurice A.M., de Wachter, Euthanasia in the
Netherlands; Dying Well? A Colloquy on Euthanasia and Assisted
Suicide, The Hastings Center Report (1992) (describing sharply
divergent appraisals of Dutch practices). We also note, that even
if it were clear what lessons to draw from the Dutch experience,
it would be far from clear how to apply those lessons to the
United States. As two commentators have said: "One must be wary,
however, of inferences drawn from the Netherlands and applied to
the United States. Cultural, legal, psychological, and other
variables make generalizations problematic, even in the
Netherlands itself." T. Howard Stone & William J. Winslade,

the attending physician, result in death in a relatively short

FN119. When the physician rather than the patient administers the
drug, the act is ordinarily classified as physician-aid-in-dying.

FN120. In the latter case, "involuntary death," when the motive is
benign or altruistic, we classify the act as "euthanasia." There
is, however, no universally accepted meaning for that term. Some
commentators distinguish between active and passive euthanasia,
for example, while others do not. We define euthanasia as the act
or practice of painlessly putting to death persons suffering from
incurable and distressing disease, as an act of mercy, but not at
the person's request. The issue of euthanasia is not implicated
here. While we place euthanasia, as we define it, on the opposite
side of the constitutional line we draw for purposes of this case,
we do not intimate any view as to the constitutional or legal
implications of the practice. Finally, we should make it clear
that a decision of a duly appointed surrogate decision maker is
for all legal purposes the decision of the patient himself.

FN121. See also Carey v. Population Services International, 431
U.S. 678 (1977). Building on its decision in Griswold that the
state could not ban the sale of contraceptives, the Court held in
Carey, that the state could not prohibit adults from securing
contraceptives through the most readily available channels by
prohibiting everyone but licensed pharmacists from distributing
them.

Oregon's Death With Dignity Act, described in Lee, supra note 104,

FN123. We do not suggest that all of these safeguards are either
necessary or desirable singularly or collectively. That is
essentially a matter for the states to determine. In doing so,
they would of course consider the practical implications of the
various potential procedural safeguards before deciding which, if
any, to adopt.

FN124. For an opposing view, see Posner, supra note 74, at 260-61.
Posner argues that while laws banning assisted suicide (as applied
to the terminally ill) violate Millsian principles and should, as
a matter of policy, be repealed, the decision as to whether to do
so should be made at the state level by voters and legislators.
His reasoning for leaving the question to the states is based in
part on his belief that moral values are sometimes coterminous
with state boundaries, and that a national rule would be
premature. He uses as an example the case of abortion, suggesting
that Roe v. Wade wrongfully preempted the ability of individual
states to resolve that issue properly.

One problem with allowing each state to decide whether to prohibit
the exercise of a liberty interest is the human suffering that
results from a patchwork-quilt pattern of prohibitory legislation.
Permitting assisted suicide in one state but prohibiting it in a
neighboring one can easily lead to entangled legal battles in
which the dying patient or his family tries to obtain approval for
his transfer to the more permissive state. The unseemly legal
struggle that ensues turns out all too often to have been
academic, since by the time the matter is resolved, the patient
has suffered the distressing fate he sought to avoid.

1462-64. There can be no doubt whatsoever that Washington's ban on
assisted suicide places a "substantial obstacle" in the path of
terminally ill, competent adults who wish to choose the time and

FN138. We note, incidentally, that if Lee's equal protection
ruling were correct, we could not examine the as-applied due
process violation we examine here, or arrive at the limited
holding we do. A ruling in favor of the terminally ill that was
not equally applicable to all other persons would, under Lee,
violate the Equal Protection Clause. Thus Lee would require us to
determine whether the entire "or aids" provision of the statute is
unconstitutional on its face. Because Lee was erroneously decided,
we need not undertake that task.

FN139. Unlike Lee's highly irregular equal protection holding --
that no rational basis exists for a state's allowing the
terminally ill to receive medical assistance that will enable them
to hasten their deaths while preventing the young and healthy from
receiving similar medical assistance -- the equal protection
argument relied on by Chief Judge Rothstein is not insubstantial.
Judge Rothstein based her equal protection determination on the
difference in the statutory treatment afforded 1) those terminally
ill persons who are being kept alive through medical treatment
(including the use of artificial medical devices) whose deaths can
be brought about by the withdrawal of that treatment and 2) those
terminally ill people who have no means of accelerating their
deaths unless their doctor provides them with medical assistance.
She concluded that it was unconstitutional to permit doctors to
take actions that would permit the first group of terminally ill
persons to die in comfort while preventing doctors from providing
such services to the second group.

FN140. We would add that those whose services are essential to
help the terminally ill patient obtain and take that medication
and who act under the supervision or direction of a physician are
necessarily covered by our ruling. That includes the pharmacist
who fills the prescription; the health care worker who facilitates
the process; the family member or loved one who opens the bottle,
places the pills in the patient's hand, advises him how many pills
to take, and provides the necessary tea, water or other liquids;
or the persons who help the patient to his death bed and provide
the love and comfort so essential to a peaceful death.


BEEZER, Circuit Judge, Dissenting:

Wash. Laws 1975, 1st Ex.Sess., ch. 260, section 9A.36.060 says:

PROMOTING A SUICIDE ATTEMPT.

(1) A person is guilty of promoting a suicide attempt when he
knowingly causes or aids another person to attempt suicide.

(2) Promoting a suicide attempt is a Class C felony.

This law is codified as RCW 9A.36.060. A Class C felony is
punishable by imprisonment of up to five years and a fine of up to
$10,000. RCW 9A.20.020(1)(c).

The question is whether Washington's criminal prohibition of
promoting a suicide attempt, defined as knowingly causing or
aiding another person to attempt suicide, violates the
constitutional substantive due process or equal protection rights
of mentally competent, terminally ill adults to commit
physician-assisted suicide. The district court held the Washington
statute unconstitutional and I would reverse.

To succeed in arguing that a statute violates substantive due
process, the party challenging the statute must show either: (1)
that the statute violates a fundamental right and is not narrowly
tailored to serve a compelling state interest, or (2) that the
statute violates an ordinary, nonfundamental, liberty interest and
does not rationally advance some legitimate governmental purpose.
Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, ___, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 1447-1449
(1993). I would hold that the mentally competent, terminally ill
adults do not have a fundamental right to physician-assisted
suicide, but I would hold that they do have an ordinary,
nonfundamental, liberty interest in doing so. I would further hold
that RCW 9A.36.060 rationally advances four legitimate
governmental purposes: preserving life, protecting the interests
of innocent third parties, preventing suicide and maintaining the
ethical integrity of the medical profession. Because RCW 9A.36.060
rationally advances these four legitimate governmental purposes,
it does not violate plaintiffs' constitutional substantive due
process rights.

Likewise, I would hold that RCW 9A.36.060 does not violate
plaintiffs' constitutional equal protection rights. Plaintiffs are
not similarly situated to patients who wish to refuse or withdraw
life-sustaining medical treatment, so an equal protection analysis
is not even appropriate. If it were appropriate, I would hold that
RCW 9A.36.060 rationally advances four legitimate legislative
goals and does not violate plaintiffs' constitutional equal
protection rights.

I

It is imperative that I make clear what I mean by
physician-assisted suicide. The process should be distinguished
definitionally from both euthanasia and the withdrawal or refusal
of life-sustaining treatment.

Euthanasia occurs when the physician actually administers the
agent which causes death. An example is when a physician injects
the patient with a poisonous substance. A gray area between
euthanasia and bona fide treatment arises when, for example, a
physician administers ever-increasing doses of palliative
pain-killing medication, and those doses eventually reach toxic
levels.

Life-sustaining treatment is defined in Washington as "any medical
means that uses mechanical or other artificial means, including
artificially provided nutrition and hydration, to sustain,
restore, or replace a vital function, which, when applied to a
qualified patient, would serve only to prolong the process of
dying. [It does not include treatment] deemed necessary solely to
alleviate pain." RCW 70.122.020(5). A patient has a nonfundamental
constitutionally protected liberty-based right to refuse or
withdraw life-sustaining treatment, including respirators and
artificial nutrition and hydration. See Cruzan v. Director,
Missouri Dep't of Health, 497 U.S. 261 (1990). In Washington, that
right is also explicitly guaranteed by the Natural Death Act, RCW
70.122.010 et seq.

Physician-assisted suicide encompasses the situation where a
physician makes available to a patient the means for that patient
intentionally to cause his or her own death. For example,
physician-assisted suicide would be the proper description of a
process in which a physician, with the intent to assist a patient
to commit suicide, prescribes medication which, when taken by the
patient in sufficient potency and quantity, is lethal. The
prescription may be part of a bona fide treatment, or it may be
specifically prescribed as a means by which the patient commits
suicide.

In all three sorts of cases, euthanasia, withdrawal of
life-sustaining treatment, and physician-assisted suicide, there
is a decision that other factors outweigh the patient's continuing
to live. Plaintiffs ask us to blur the line between withdrawal of
life-sustaining treatment and physician-assisted suicide. At the
same time, some proponents of physician-assisted suicide would
maintain a conceptual distinction between physician-assisted
suicide and euthanasia. Associating physician-assisted suicide
with a relatively accepted procedure and dissociating it from an
unpalatable one are rhetorically powerful devices, but run counter
to U.S. Supreme Court precedent,[FOOTNOTE 1] Washington State
statutory law,[FOOTNOTE 2] medical ethics guidelines of the
American Medical Association and the American College of
Physicians,[FOOTNOTE 3] and legal reasoning.[FOOTNOTE 4]

The proper place to draw the line is between withdrawing
life-sustaining treatment (which is based on the right to be free
from unwanted intrusion) and physician-assisted suicide and
euthanasia (which implicate the assistance of others in
controlling the timing and manner of death). The former is
constitutionally protected (under Cruzan); the latter are not.

II

There are several jurisdictional and prudential concerns which I
consider before addressing the merits of this appeal.

A. Procedural posture

This is an interlocutory appeal from the district court's grant of
partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiff patients and
physicians, insofar as the physicians represent the interests of
their patients. The partial summary judgment has been certified as
final pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). Plaintiff Compassion in
Dying is not a party to this appeal; neither are plaintiff
physicians, insofar as they represent their own interests.

Three groups, representing four sets of interests, filed this
action in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Washington, seeking a declaration that RCW 9A.36.060 violates the
Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States
Constitution. The groups also sought to enjoin the State of
Washington from enforcing the statute.

The first plaintiff is Compassion in Dying, a Washington nonprofit
corporation organized to assist mentally competent, terminally ill
patients in committing suicide by providing them information,
counselling and emotional support. The second group of plaintiffs
consisted of three mentally competent, terminally ill patients,
litigating under pseudonyms: Jane Roe, John Doe, and James Poe.
All three are now dead. The third group consists of four
physicians licensed by the State of Washington to practice
medicine and surgery (Drs. Glucksberg, Preston, Halperin, and
Shalit), representing their own interests and those of their
patients. Compassion in Dying v. Washington, 850 F.Supp. 1454,
1457-1458 (W.D. Wash. 1994).

Defendants in this action are the State of Washington ("the
State") and Christine Gregoire, the Attorney General of
Washington. In suits against the State, the Attorney General is
designated by statute as the person to receive service of the
summons and complaint and to appear and act as counsel for the
State. RCW 4.92.020, 4.92.030.

On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted
only the motions of the patients and of the physicians "insofar as
the physicians purport to raise claims on behalf of their
terminally ill patients." Compassion in Dying, 850 F.Supp. at
1457. It denied the motions of Compassion in Dying, the physicians
on behalf of themselves, and the State. The district court also
declined to enjoin the State from enforcing the statute. The
district court found that the statute violated the patients' equal
protection and due process rights.

The State appealed, and a panel of this court filed an opinion
reversing the district court. Compassion in Dying, 49 F.3d 586
(9th Cir. 1995). A majority of the active judges of this court
voted to grant a rehearing en banc. Compassion in Dying, 62 F.3d
299 (9th Cir. 1995).

The district court's grant of summary judgment is reviewed de
novo. Warren v. City of Carlsbad, 58 F.3d 439, 441 (9th Cir.
1995). There are no factual issues in dispute; the only issues are
constitutional.

B. Mootness

Because the plaintiff patients have all died, the case is now moot
as to them. The only remaining plaintiffs who were parties to the
partial summary judgment are the plaintiff physicians, insofar as
they represent the interests of their patients.

C. Standing

"[T]o satisfy the 'case' or 'controversy' requirement of Article
III of the United States Constitution, a plaintiff must allege a
present or immediate injury in fact which is fairly traceable to
the challenged action and is likely to be redressed by a favorable
court decision." Board of Natural Resources v. Brown, 992 F.2d
937, 945 (9th Cir. 1993). The plaintiff physicians assert a
sufficient injury in fact to satisfy Article III's standing
requirements. See Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 195 (1976) (liquor
store owner had standing to challenge restriction on selling beer
with 3.2% alcohol content to 18-20 year-old males). The
physicians' injury is fairly traceable to the challenged statute,
and the relief sought will redress their harm.

When one party asserts the rights of another party, there is also
a prudential component to standing. This prudential component
consists of three factors: "the relationship of the litigant to
the person whose rights are being asserted; the ability of the
person to advance his own rights; and the impact of the litigation
on third party interests." Caplin & Drysdale Chartered v. United
States, 491 U.S. 617, 623 n.3 (1989). In the abortion context,
physicians may assert the rights of their patients. Singleton v.
Wulff, 428 U.S. 106 (1976). The same reasoning, regarding jus
tertii standing based on the physician-patient relationship,
applies in this case. In Quill v. Koppell, 870 F.Supp. 78
(S.D.N.Y. 1994),[FOOTNOTE 5] a case similar to this one, the
district court for the Southern District of New York held that
physician plaintiffs do have standing to represent the interests
of their patients, apparently on the theory that the physicians
are in a special relationship with their patients in respects
relevant to the alleged right. Id. at 82.

III

Plaintiffs' challenge to the Washington statute is "as applied."
Challenges to a statute may either be facial or as applied.
Justice Scalia concisely summarizes the operation of facial and as
applied challenges:

Statutes are ordinarily challenged, and their constitutionality
evaluated, "as applied"--that is, the plaintiff contends that the
application of the statute in the particular context in which he
has acted, or in which he proposes to act, would be
unconstitutional. The practical effect of holding a statute
unconstitutional "as applied" is to prevent its future application
in a similar context but not to render it utterly inoperative. To
achieve the latter result, the plaintiff must succeed in
challenging the statute "on its face." Our traditional rule has
been, however, that a facial challenge must be rejected unless
there exists no set of circumstances in which the statute can
constitutionally be applied. See, e.g., United States v. Salerno,
481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 2100, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987).

Ada v. Guam Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 113 S.Ct.
633, 634 (1992) (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of
certiorari). See also, e.g., Frazier v. Heebe, 482 U.S. 641, 643
(1986) (petition alleged unconstitutionality of a regulation on
its face and as applied); United States v. James Daniel Good Real
Property, ___ U.S. ___, 114 S.Ct. 492, 513 (1993) (O'Connor, J.,
concurring in part, dissenting in part) (characterizing the
constitutional challenge in that case as "as applied").

The district court characterizes plaintiffs' challenge as
"facial." Compassion in Dying, 850 F. Supp. at 1459. The district
court's characterization is apparently due to the fact that the
action is a preenforcement review seeking a declaratory judgment.
It has not yet been "applied" to the plaintiffs, in the sense that
no party to this action has been prosecuted. This is an incorrect
usage of the "facial" and "as applied" distinction.

In Salerno, the Supreme Court described what is necessary to
succeed in a facial constitutional challenge to a statute:

A facial challenge to a statute is, of course, the most difficult
challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must
establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act
would be valid. The fact that the [statute] might operate
unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is
insufficient to render it wholly invalid, since we have not
recognized an "overbreadth" doctrine outside the limited context
of the First Amendment.

481 U.S. at 745.

Plaintiffs here do not challenge the applicability and
constitutionality of the statute to, for example, prison inmates
who incite their coprisoners to suicide. Rather, as the district
court states, "Plaintiffs challenge the statute only insofar as it
bans physician-assisted suicide by mentally competent, terminally
ill adults who knowingly and voluntarily choose to hasten their
death." Compassion in Dying, 850 F. Supp. at 1456. Because
plaintiffs have made no attempt to demonstrate that there is no
set of circumstances under which the statute would be valid, their
challenge cannot be facial under Salerno.

Analyzing RCW 9A.36.060, the district court concludes "that the
Casey 'undue burden' standard, set forth by the Supreme Court five
years after Salerno, controls in this case." Compassion in Dying,
850 F. Supp. at 1462 (citing Planned Parenthood of Southeastern
Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, ___, 112 S.Ct. 2791,
2836-2837 (1992) ("Casey")). The district court relies on two
Court of Appeals cases and a concurrence by Justice O'Connor to
support the proposition that Casey and Salerno conflict with each
other. Id. at 1463. All of the cases cited by the district court
deal with the abortion context.

To date, the Supreme Court has not extended Casey's undue burden
test beyond abortion cases. See Planned Parenthood of Southeastern
Pennsylvania v. Casey, 114 S.Ct. 909, 911 (1994) (Souter, J., in
chambers) (describing the undue burden test as "the standard for
assessing constitutionality of abortion regulation") ("Casey II").
The language of Casey supports the proposition that the undue
burden test is unique to the abortion right and derived from the
right itself. As restated by Casey, the essence of the abortion
right is "the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion
before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from
the State." Casey, 112 S.Ct. at 2804.

Since Casey, the Court has continued to expressly rely on Salerno
for facial challenges in non-abortion contexts. E.g., Anderson v.
Edwards, 115 S.Ct. 1291, 1298-1299 n.6 (1995); Reno v. Flores, 113
S.Ct. at 1446.

Applying the Salerno analysis to RCW 9A.36.060, the group affected
by the statute consists of all people who attempt suicide with
someone else's assistance or encouragement. This includes
prisoners encouraged by their cellmates, depressed teenagers in
suicide pacts, ailing persons of advanced age assisted by their
spouses, and mentally competent terminally ill adults seeking the
assistance of a physician in committing suicide. The group
allegedly enjoying constitutional protection consists only of
mentally competent, terminally ill adults seeking the assistance
of a physician in committing suicide. The entire group affected by
the statute is not a subset of those claiming constitutional
protection; rather, only a portion of the group affected by the
statute overlaps with the group claiming constitutional
protection. The inquiry in Salerno for the permissibility of a
facial challenge is what proportion of the instances of
application of the statute will impede constitutional rights. If
the answer in the Salerno inquiry is less than 100%, then a facial
challenge is impermissible.

The challenge of RCW 9A.36.060 cannot be a facial challenge. It is
an "as applied" challenge. Because the challenge is "as applied,"
the fact that there has been no violation of the statute or
threatened prosecution for a violation of the statute implicates
straightforward ripeness concerns.

IV

The doctrine of ripeness contains two criteria: (1) hardship to
parties in delaying resolution of the issues; (2) fitness of
issues for judicial resolution. See Abbott Laboratories v.
Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967). The legal issues are fit for
judicial resolution. Waiting for further factual development would
require someone to attempt physician-assisted suicide, and for
that person's physician to face reasonably foreseeable prosecution
under the statute. This is a ripe and justiciable controversy.

It has been suggested that Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497 (1961)
might control the ripeness inquiry in this case. Poe does not
apply here. In Poe, the Supreme Court held unripe a challenge by a
physician and patients to a Connecticut statute prohibiting the
use of contraceptive devices and the giving of medical advice
about the use of such devices. The statute had been on the books
since 1879, but had been enforced only once in the ensuing eight
decades--and that case was a test case in 1940 that was ultimately
dismissed. Additionally, contraceptives were "commonly and
notoriously" sold in drug stores in Connecticut. Accordingly, the
Supreme Court determined that there had been an "undeviating
policy of nullification by Connecticut of its anti-contraceptive
laws." Poe, 367 U.S. at 502. It added, " 'Deeply embedded
traditional ways of carrying out state policy . . .'--or not
carrying it out--'are often tougher and truer law than the dead
words of the written text.' " Id. (citation omitted). The Court
concluded that there was no "realistic fear of prosecution" and
therefore no justiciable controversy ripe for adjudication. Poe,
367 U.S. at 508.

Though the history of RCW 9A.36.060 bears some similarities to the
statute in Poe, the cases may be readily distinguished. In Poe,
the statute had been on the books for a very long time, and it had
never been enforced. And there was more than just a pattern of
nonenforcement; the statute was openly and notoriously violated on
a regular basis. RCW 9A.36.060 has similarly been on the books, in
one form or another, since 1854. But it has been enforced. E.g.,
State v. Jamison, 619 P.2d 352 (Wash. 1980). Further, the factual
circumstances in this case are different. First, there is no
evidence that the Washington statute is at all "commonly and
notoriously" flouted, particularly in the narrow circumstances of
physician-assisted suicide for the mentally competent and
terminally ill. Second, the issue of physician-assisted suicide as
a plausible medical alternative is relatively new. Only since Dr.
Kevorkian started assisting patients to commit suicide in Michigan
in 1990 has there been significant public and legal attention to
the possible differences between physician-assisted suicide and
ordinary cases of aiding and abetting suicide. Research indicates
at least a dozen prosecutions in states other than Washington of
suicide-assisters since 1961.[FOOTNOTE 6] Additionally, there have
been a number of murder prosecutions of people who were more
actively involved in helping others end their lives (i.e. these
defendants actually pulled the trigger or committed similar active
steps to cause death).[FOOTNOTE 7]

A limited reading of Poe is consistent with intervening Supreme
Court precedent. Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat'l Union, 442
U.S. 289, 302 (1974) ("when fear of criminal prosecution under an
allegedly unconstitutional statute is not imaginary or wholly
speculative a plaintiff need not 'first expose himself to actual
arrest or prosecution to be entitled to challenge [the] statute' "
(citation omitted)).

We have construed Poe narrowly as well. San Francisco County
Democratic Central Committee v. Eu, 826 F.2d 814, 821 (9th Cir.
1987), aff'd, 489 U.S. 214 (1989) (justiciable controversy exists
over constitutionality of never-enforced statute where there is no
record that the statute has been commonly and notoriously
violated).

In short, there are no jurisdictional or prudential concerns which
foreclose consideration of the constitutional issues presented by
the parties to this appeal.

V

I turn now to an historical account of the role of suicide and
assisted suicide in the traditions and consciences of our
forbears. Thomas Marzen et al. (Marzen) devote over eighty pages
to a survey of the attitudes of the "Western Tradition" to
suicide. Thomas Marzen et al., "Suicide: A Constitutional Right?"
24 Duq. L. Rev. 1, 17-100. The "Western Tradition" has some of its
roots in the laws and philosophy of Judeo-Christian groups;
however, I am concerned here with the underlying moral and
philosophical arguments, and their impact on the historical
development of attitudes about suicide.

Here I recount and supplement salient portions of Marzen's
account.

Marzen finds only eight instances of suicide in the Old Testament,
including the Apocrypha. Seven of the eight instances were cases
of ignoble death; the only exception is Samson's destruction of
the Philistine temple. Marzen at 18. Marzen speculates that "[t]he
infrequency of suicide among the Hebrews . . . was most probably
due to their religious creed's positive emphasis on the value of
life and the special providence of God." Marzen at 20.

In Plato's philosophy, the ultimate good, aspiration to the realm
of the gods and the Forms, is attainable only upon death. However,
that death should not be hastened by suicide. Marzen at 21. As
Socrates explained, "[I]t probably seems strange to you that it
should not be right for those to whom death would be an advantage
to benefit themselves . . . [but] we men are put in a sort of
guard post, from which one must not release oneself or run away."
Plato, Phaedo 62a-62b (in Edith Hamilton and Hungtington Cairns,
eds., Plato: The Collected Dialogues 44-45, 1987). Plato views
suicide as a breach of the relationship between the individual,
the state, and the universe. "[W]hen suicide is a rational and
deliberate choice, it is deemed to be a flagrant act of contempt
for the state and an abandonment of duty to society and the divine
order." Marzen at 23-24.

Aristotle echoed Plato's sentiments against suicide:

To kill oneself to escape from poverty or love or anything else
that is distressing is not courageous but rather the act of a
coward, because it shows weakness of character to run away from
hardships, and the suicide endures death not because it is a fine
thing to do but in order to escape from suffering.

Marzen at 24 (quoting Aristotle, Ethics Bk. III, ch. 7 (J.
Thompson, trans., 1977)).

By contrast, the Stoics endorsed suicide. As Marzen states, "the
inevitability of death is the ultimate challenge to liberty . . .
[and one must] 'make death [one's] own in order to be free from
it.' " Marzen at 25.

Roman law forbade suicide, and introduced the penalty of
forfeiture of one's goods and property. Marzen at 26.

Between the decline of the Roman Empire and the rise of the Common
Law, ecclesiastical law was a dominant force in the English legal
order. See Sir Frederick Pollock and Frederic William Maitland,
The History of English Law, vol. 1, pp. 1-20 (1968).

St. Augustine opposed suicide as violative of the sixth
commandment ("Thou shalt not kill.") Marzen at 27. In his Summa
Theologica, St. Thomas Aquinas stated that

it is unlawful to kill oneself for three reasons[:] . . . [first],
suicide is contrary to the inclination of nature, and to charity
whereby every man should love himself[;] . . . [second], every man
is part of the community, . . . [and] by killing himself he
injures the community[;] . . .[third], because life is God's gift
to man, . . . whoever takes his own life, sins against God.

St. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica, II-II, q. 64, art. 5,
(Fathers of the English Dominican Province, eds., vol. 2, pp. 1465
et seq., 1947). Martin Luther and John Calvin also opposed
suicide. Marzen at 31.

In the mid-thirteenth century, Henry de Bracton wrote that a felon
committing suicide to escape punishment forfeited all his real
property and movable goods, but a person committing suicide "in
weariness of life or because he is unwilling to endure further
bodily pain . . . may have a successor [of his real property], but
his movable goods are confiscated." 2 Bracton on the Laws of
England 424 (fol. 150) (G. Woodbine ed., S. Thorne trans. 1968).
"The principle that suicide of a sane person, for whatever reason,
was a punishable felony was thus introduced into English common
law." Marzen at 59. In 1644, Sir Edward Coke published his Third
Institute, in which he treated suicide by a sane person as a form
of murder. Marzen at 60-61.

In 1765, Sir William Blackstone condemned suicide in his
Commentaries on the Laws of England:

[T]he suicide is guilty of a double offence; one spiritual, in
invading the prerogative of the Almighty, and rushing into his
immediate presence uncalled for; the other temporal, against the
king, who hath an interest in the preservation of all his
subjects; the law has therefore ranked this among the highest
crimes, making it a peculiar species of felony, a felony committed
on one's self.

William Blackstone, 4 Commentaries ch. 14, *189.

Among the philosophers who influenced America's founders, John
Locke opposed suicide as against natural law and the principle of
self-preservation. Marzen at 42.

The American colonies in the seventeenth century generally adopted
the English common law criminal prohibitions of suicide. Marzen at
63-66. However, in 1701, William Penn abolished the criminal
penalty of forfeiture for suicide, and most of the rest of the
colonies (later states) followed suit by the end of the eighteenth
century. Marzen at 65-68. Most states have adopted the English
common law, to the extent that it does not conflict with state or
federal statutory or constitutional requirements. Washington did
so in 1862.[FOOTNOTE 8]

Thomas Jefferson opposed criminal prohibitions of suicide,
presaging the sentiments of the drafters of the Model Penal Code:

Men are too much attached to this life to exhibit frequent
instances of depriving themselves of it. At any rate, the
quasi-punishment of confiscation will not prevent it. For if one
can be found who can calmly determine to renounce life, who is so
weary of his existence here as rather to make experiment of what
is beyond the grave, can we suppose him, in such a state of mind,
susceptible to influence from the losses to his family by
confiscation? That men in general disapprove of this severity is
apparent from the constant practice of juries finding the suicide
in a state of insanity; because they have no other way of saving
the forfeiture.

Marzen at 45 (quoting Thomas Jefferson, 6 The Papers of Thomas
Jefferson 155 (J.P. Boyd ed. 1952)).

By the turn of the nineteenth century, criminal penalties for
suicide appear to have been abandoned in the United States. But
the reason for doing so was not a recognition of the supremacy of
individual autonomy; rather, it was the desire not to penalize the
decedent's family combined with a recognition of the limited
deterrent effect of criminal penalties for suicide.

As the nineteenth century progressed, states began to enact
criminal prohibitions on assisting suicide. Marzen at 71-74. By
1868, when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, twenty-one of
the thirty-seven states prohibited assisted suicide by either
statute or common law. Marzen at 75. Within the first year of
becoming a Territory, Washington enacted a prohibition of assisted
suicide.[FOOTNOTE 9] Thirty-six states and territories currently
have statutes imposing criminal sanctions for aiding, assisting,
causing, or promoting suicide.[FOOTNOTE 10] Three additional
states and the District of Columbia do not impose explicit
criminal sanctions on assisted suicide, but nonetheless condemn
assisted suicide in statutes allowing withdrawal of medical
treatment.[FOOTNOTE 11] Three other states have definitions of
criminally negligent homicide that are sufficiently broad to
encompass aiding, assisting, causing or promoting
suicide.[FOOTNOTE 12] An additional four states impose criminal
penalties under case law.[FOOTNOTE 13] In total, forty-four
states, the District of Columbia and two territories prohibit or
condemn assisted suicide.

The trend toward repeal of criminal sanctions against suicide,
while still regarding suicide as an indicium of mental illness,
and continued prohibition of aiding or assisting suicide, has
produced what appears to be a modern consensus on the subject. The
modern consensus consists of an overall disapproval of suicide
which is manifested through (1) not criminally punishing suicide
itself,[FOOTNOTE 14] but instead treating it as a medical or
psychological problem;[FOOTNOTE 15] (2) allowing the state to
intervene to prevent someone from committing suicide; and (3)
enacting criminal statues prohibiting the aiding or assisting of
suicide.

VI

Plaintiffs allege that RCW 9A.36.060 violates their substantive
due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United
States Constitution. They argue that physician-assisted suicide
fits within the broad description of the liberty aspect of the
substantive due process right set forth in Casey:

These matters, including the most intimate and personal choices a
person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity
and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the
Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of liberty is the right to
define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the
universe, and of the mystery of human life.

Casey, 112 S.Ct. at 2807.

Specifically, plaintiffs allege that mentally competent,
terminally ill adults have a constitutionally protected liberty
interest in committing physician-assisted suicide. The district
court also addresses the issue in those terms. This narrow
formulation follows the teaching of the Supreme Court in Cruzan,
which says, "in deciding 'a question of such magnitude and
importance . . . it is the [better] part of wisdom not to attempt,
by any general statement, to cover every possible phase of the
subject.' " Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 278. See also Reno v. Flores, 113
S.Ct. at 1447 (" 'Substantive due process' analysis must begin
with a careful description of the asserted right, for '[t]he
doctrine of judicial self-restraint requires us to exercise the
utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this
field.' ").

I would hold that mentally competent, terminally ill adults do not
have a fundamental right to commit physician-assisted suicide. The
Supreme Court has repeatedly indicated an unwillingness to expand
the list of rights deemed fundamental. Physician-assisted suicide
is not currently on that list. To be fundamental, a liberty
interest must be central to personal autonomy or deeply rooted in
history. The district court relies on language in Casey's
plurality opinion to hold that substantive due process protects a
wide range of autonomy-based liberty interests, including
physician-assisted suicide. Such a reading of Casey is
permissible, provided it is clearly understood that the liberty
interests so protected are not fundamental. Casey's reaffirmation
of the abortion right is best understood as a decision that relies
heavily on stare decisis; the abortion right, uniquely protected
under the undue burden standard, is sui generis. The second test
for determining the existence of fundamental rights, whether the
interest is rooted in the nation's history, similarly militates
against a fundamental right to physician-assisted suicide.

I would hold that mentally competent, terminally ill adults do
have an autonomy-based, nonfundamental liberty interest in
committing physician-assisted suicide.

A. No new fundamental rights

While the list of fundamental rights has not been definitively
closed to expansion, the Court has indicated an unwillingness to
find new penumbral, privacy-type fundamental rights. In Reno v.
Flores, 113 S.Ct. 1439 (1993), the Court refuses to expand the
list of fundamental rights to include a right of juveniles to be
released into a noncustodial setting. Reno states:

We are unaware . . . that any court--aside from the courts
below--has ever held that [the asserted fundamental right exists].
The mere novelty of such a claim is reason enough to doubt that
"substantive due process" sustains it; the alleged right certainly
cannot be considered " 'so rooted in the traditions and conscience
of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.' " Salerno, supra,
481 U.S., at 751, 107 S.Ct., at 2103 (quoting Snyder v.
Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 105, 54 S.Ct. 330, 332, 78 L.Ed. 674
(1934)).

113 S.Ct. at 1447. See also Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 190
(1986) ("[T]here should be . . . great resistance to expand the
substantive reach of [the due process clauses of the Fifth and
Fourteenth Amendments], particularly if it requires redefining the
category of rights deemed fundamental.").

Bowers clearly identifies its liberty inquiries as fundamental,
and states the two tests as follows:

In Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325, 326 (1937), it was
said that this category [of rights which qualify for heightened
judicial protection] includes those fundamental liberties that are
"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty," such that "neither
liberty nor justice would exist if [they] were sacrificed." A
different description of fundamental liberties appeared in Moore
v. East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 503 (1977) (opinion of Powell,
J.), where they are characterized as those liberties that are
"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition."

Bowers, 487 U.S. at 191-192.

These tests are distinct from the broader nonfundamental liberty
inquiry of Casey. The sweeping description of liberty in Casey is
never characterized as "fundamental" under the Constitution;
rather, its wide purview covers all liberty protected by the
Fourteenth Amendment, nonfundamental as well as fundamental.

There is no fundamental liberty interest in physician-assisted
suicide. First, as discussed above in Part V, there is no history
or tradition supporting any form of suicide. Second, however
compelling the suicidal wishes of terminally ill patients are
regarded, it cannot honestly be said that neither liberty nor
justice will exist if access to physician-assisted suicide is
proscribed.

B. The abortion right's strength rests on <IB>stare decisis

The Casey plurality states repeatedly that it is the combined
force of stare decisis and liberty that protects a woman's right
to abortion. Casey, 112 S.Ct. at 2804, 2808. This implies that
liberty alone would be insufficient to support a new fundamental
right to abortion.

The plurality never characterizes the abortion right as
fundamental. This omission is significant, given the plurality's
broad characterization of the liberty interest, as well as its use
of the undue burden test in lieu of the strict scrutiny ordinarily
applied to fundamental rights. The four-Justice dissent goes
farther, stating that it would hold the abortion right to be
nonfundamental:

We are now of the view that, in terming this right fundamental,
the Court in Roe read the earlier opinions upon which it based its
decision much too broadly. Unlike marriage, procreation and
contraception, abortion "involves the purposeful termination of
human life." The abortion decision must therefore "be recognized
as sui generis, different in kind from the others that the Court
has protected under the rubric of personal or family privacy and
autonomy."

Casey, 112 S.Ct. at 2859 (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring in the
judgment in part and dissenting in part) (citations omitted).
Central to the dissent's reason for wanting to call the abortion
right nonfundamental is the fact that it involves the purposeful
termination of human life. Abortion is sui generis, and the courts
are on notice that these four Justices will not find fundamental
any other asserted right that involves the purposeful termination
of human life.

The other main end-of-life case, Cruzan, presumes a nonfundamental
liberty interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment. This
interest was subjected to ordinary balancing against the state
interests, rather than strict scrutiny. Cruzan, 497 U.S. 261.

These cases, combined with the Supreme Court's disinclination to
find new fundamental rights, compel the conclusion that a liberty
interest in physician-assisted suicide, if one exists, is
nonfundamental.

C. The history test does not support a liberty interest in
physician-assisted suicide

In a recent English case, Lord Hoffman succinctly articulated the
misperception upon which a history-based right to suicide is
premised: "Suicide is no longer a crime, but its decriminalization
was a recognition that the principle of self-determination should
in that case prevail over the sanctity of life." Airedale N.H.S.
Trust v. Bland (C.A.), 2 W.L.R. 316, 351-352 (1993).

Yale Kamisar harshly criticizes this misperception:

[T]he decriminalization of both suicide and attempted suicide did
not come about because suicide was deemed a "human right" or even
because it was no longer considered reprehensible. These changes
occurred, rather, because punishment was seen as unfair to
innocent relatives of the suicide and because those who committed
or attempted to commit the act were thought to be prompted by
mental illness.

Yale Kamisar, "Are Laws Against Assisted Suicide
Unconstitutional?" 23 Hastings Center Report 32 (5/93) (citing
"the most comprehensive and most heavily documented law review
article ever written on the subject," Thomas Marzen et al.,
"Suicide: A Constitutional Right?" 24 Duq. L. Rev. 1, 68-100
(1985)). Kamisar also quotes the comments to the Model Penal Code,
which explain the elimination of criminal sanctions for suicide:
"There is a certain moral extravagance in imposing criminal
punishment on a person who has sought his own self-destruction . .
attention." Kamisar, id.

As I discussed above in Part V, suicide and assisted suicide are
clearly not "deeply rooted in this Nation's history and
tradition." Bowers, 487 U.S. at 192. Nor are suicide or assisted
suicide rooted in the English Common Law as adopted by the states,
or in the legal and philosophical order underlying the English
Common Law.

D. The autonomy test supports a limited liberty interest in
physician-assisted suicide

The district court's starting point for the autonomy inquiry is
the now-famous assertion in Casey that "[a]t the heart of liberty
is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning,
of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about
these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were
they formed under compulsion of the State." Casey, 112 S.Ct. at
2807. Application of this statement in the adjudication of
substantive due process claims is a matter of "reasoned judgment."
Casey, 112 S.Ct. at 2806. This throws courts into the wide-open
realm of pure moral reasoning about liberty. As a practical
matter, such unfettered theoretical musing could not plausibly
form the basis of a constitutional fundamental rights
jurisprudence. This is borne out by Casey's notable omission to
mention "fundamental" rights. Casey should therefore be read as
describing more general, nonfundamental liberty.

There is scant guidance in the quoted passage from Casey as to
what may constitute a nonfundamental liberty interest. Taken out
of context, the "right to define one's own concept of existence"
is so broad and melodramatic as to seem almost comical in its
rhetorical flourish. But the preceding sentence in Casey provides
a more somber and usable definition of liberty. Personal decisions
which "involv[e] the most intimate and personal choices a person
may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and
autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth
Amendment." Casey, 112 S.Ct. at 2807.

As plaintiffs and amicus Ten Surviving Family Members in Support
of Physician-Assisted "Suicide" assert, a terminally ill person is
dying, not eventually as all humans do, but imminently. Often, the
decline to death is not only painful, but debilitating and
demoralizing. Ideally, terminally ill people will be surrounded by
caring, supportive family members, doctors, and friends, who will
be able to alleviate the pain and the low morale. But ultimately,
many of those who are terminally ill will face a choice of whether
to continue the slow decline to death, or instead to truncate
their lives.

The Hemlock Society's how-to suicide book, Final Exit illustrates
that there are many feasible methods of ending one's life. But
many of the choices are not terribly dignified. Casey says that
liberty protects not only choices that are personal, intimate and
central to autonomy, but also that are central to personal
dignity. Suicide by physician-prescribed medication is seen by
some as an inherently more dignified way to hasten an imminent and
inevitable death than other methods in common usage.

To the extent that Casey defines the outer limits of the
Constitution's nonfundamental liberty right, it can plausibly be
said to include decisions about the manner and timing of one's
death.

VII

Whatever test is ultimately used to evaluate the constitutionality
of RCW 9A.36.060, the plaintiffs' liberty interest must be
compared against the state interests underlying the statute.

The State asserts three interests: (1) preventing suicide, (2)
protecting vulnerable individuals from abuse or undue influence
and (3) preserving and protecting the lives of its people. It
asserts that the interest in preventing suicide applies equally to
all the state's citizens; the State does not evaluate the quality
of life among its citizenry, and preserve and protect only those
whose lives are deemed "worth living."

Washington courts recognize four state interests common to
end-of-life cases: (1) the preservation of life, (2) the
protection of the interests of innocent third parties, (3) the
prevention of suicide, and (4) the maintenance of the ethical
integrity of the medical profession. In re Guardianship of Grant,
747 P.2d 445, 451 (Wash. 1987); In re Colyer, 660 P.2d 738, 743
(Wash. 1983). The Supreme Court has also recognized all four of
these state interests. Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 271.

The four governmental interests recognized by Washington courts
and endorsed by the Supreme Court are all very strong, and apply
with undiminished vigor to justify RCW 9A.36.060's prohibition of
physician-assisted suicide for mentally competent, terminally ill
adults. Any one of these interests would be sufficient to support
this application of the statute under a rational relationship
test. Were it necessary for me to do so, I would even be inclined
to hold that the cumulative force of all four governmental
interests is sufficient to enable this application of the statute
to withstand strict scrutiny.

A. The preservation of life

This interest has been addressed extensively in the cases
involving withdrawal of nutrition and hydration. In particular,
Grant and Colyer describe the contours of Washington's interest in
the preservation of life. The Colyer court held that the interest
"weakens . . . in situations where continued treatment serves only
to prolong a life inflicted with an incurable condition." Colyer,
660 P.2d at 743. The Grant court held the interest "weaken[s]
considerably . . . if treatment will merely postpone death for a
person with a terminal and incurable condition." Grant, 747 P.2d
at 451.

It may be tempting to extrapolate from these cases a principle
that terminally ill patients seeking to commit physician-assisted
suicide fall within the zone where the state's interest in
preserving life is weakened. Such an extrapolation would be
improper. The state's interest is weakened only where continued
medical treatment would do nothing more than postpone death. This
is the holding of both Colyer and Grant, and it matches the line
drawn in Part I of this opinion, between discontinuing medical
treatment on one hand, and physician-assisted suicide and
euthanasia on the other hand. As applied to terminally ill adults
seeking physician-assisted suicide, the state's interest in
preserving life remains at full strength.

The state's interest in preserving life is equally strong when
applied to terminally ill patients seeking to commit assisted
suicide as it is when applied to the general populace. The analogy
to abortion is a rough one: in the abortion context, the Supreme
Court tells us that the state's interests in fetal life are weaker
before viability than they are once the fetus becomes viable. See
Casey, 112 S.Ct. at 2804. A state's interest in preserving human
life is stronger when applied to viable beings than it is when
applied to nonviable beings. Like a first-trimester fetus, a
person kept alive by life-sustaining treatment is essentially
nonviable. A terminally ill patient seeking to commit
physician-assisted suicide, by contrast, is essentially viable.
The patient may be inexorably approaching the line of
nonviability. But the patient is still on the viable side of that
line, and consequently enjoys the full protection of the state's
interest in preserving life.

B. The protection of the interests of innocent third parties

The question of physician-assisted suicide raises many issues
involving the interests of innocent third parties. Constitutional
protection for a right to assisted suicide might spawn pressure on
the elderly and infirm--but still happily alive--to "die and get
out of the way."[FOOTNOTE 16] Also at risk are the poor and
minorities, who have been shown to suffer more pain (i.e. they
receive less treatment for their pain) than other groups. See Yale
Kamisar, "Against Assisted Suicide--Even a Very Limited Form," 72
U. Det. Mercy L. Rev. 735, 737-739 (1995). Further, like the
elderly and infirm, they, as well as the handicapped, are at risk
of being unwanted and subjected to pressure to choose
physician-assisted suicide rather than continued treatment.
Kamisar quotes the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law:

[I]t must be recognized that assisted suicide and euthanasia will
be practiced through the prism of social inequality and prejudice
that characterizes the delivery of services in all segments of
society, including health care. Those who will be most vulnerable
to abuse, error, or indifference are the poor, minorities, and
those who are least educated and least empowered. This risk does
not reflect a judgment that physicians are more prejudiced or
influenced by race and class than the rest of society--only that
they are not exempt from the prejudices manifest in other areas of
our collective life.


[Many patients] in large, overburdened facilities serving the
urban and rural poor . . . will not have the benefit of skilled
pain management and comfort care. Indeed, a recent study found
that patients treated for cancer at centers that care
predominantly for minority individuals were three times more
likely to receive inadequate therapy to relieve pain. Many
patients will also lack access to psychiatric services.
Furthermore, for most patients who are terminally or severely ill,
routine psychiatric consultation would be inadequate to diagnose
reliably whether the patient is suffering from depression.

Kamisar, Id. at 738 (quoting The New York State Task Force on Life
and the Law, When Death is Sought: Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia
in the Medical Context at 125, 143 (1994)). Pain and suffering are
directly related to the prevalence of requests for assisted
suicide. Kamisar reports that

Although pain is notoriously undertreated in this country,
"according to experts in the field of pain control, almost all
terminally ill patients can experience adequate relief with
currently available treatments." Thus, . . . suicidal ideation and
suicide requests "commonly . . . dissolve with adequate control of
pain and other symptoms."

Id. (quoting Judith Ahronheim & Doron Weber, Final Passages:
Positive Choices For the Dying and Their Loved Ones 102 (1992);
Kathleen Foley, "The Relationship of Pain and Symptom Management
to Patient Requests for Physician- assisted Suicide," J. Pain &
Symptom Management 289, 290 (1991)). Kamisar repeatedly suggests
the explanation for inadequate control of pain: lack of universal
access to adequate medical care. Id. at 738, 744 n.43. People
request physician-assisted suicide because they are in pain or are
otherwise suffering. If their suffering is alleviated, they will
likely withdraw their requests for physician-assisted suicide. We
the courts are asked, in a nation of inadequate and unequal access
to medical care for the alleviation of pain and suffering, to
create a constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide.
Surely this is a case of misplaced priorities.

Plaintiffs suggest that adequate procedural safeguards can be
implemented to protect the interests of innocent third parties.
This assertion is refuted by the experience of The Netherlands,
where physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia are nominally
legal.[FOOTNOTE 17] At the outset, The Netherlands had guidelines:
the patient must be incurably ill, the patient's suffering must be
subjectively unbearable, the request for termination should be in
writing, and there should be adequate consultation with other
physicians before euthanasia was carried out. Lagerway at 439.

In 1991, the Dutch Government released a report on the practice of
euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in The Netherlands.
Commissie Onderzoek Medische Praktijk Inzake Euthanasie, Medische
Beslissingen Rond Het Levenseinde (1991) (the "Remmelink Report").
According to the Remmelink Report, 2.1% of all deaths in The
Netherlands are due to physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia.
Another 7% are due to the alleviation of pain or symptoms where
the physician had the explicit (total or partial) purpose of
shortening life. In 1990: 2300 people were euthanized upon
request, 400 died as a result of physician-assisted suicide, 1000
died from involuntary euthanasia (patients were killed without
their knowledge or consent), and 8100 died as a result of doctors
deliberately giving them overdoses of pain medication (again, 61%
of this category were killed without their knowledge or
consent).[FOOTNOTE 18]

Critics of this data would respond that the Dutch experiment has
focused mainly on euthanasia, rather than physician-assisted
suicide. But even proponents of assisted suicide have begun to
abandon the distinction between physician-assisted suicide and
euthanasia:

To confine legalized physician-assisted death to assisted suicide
unfairly discriminates against patients with unbelievable
suffering who resolve to end their lives but are physically unable
to do so. The method chosen is less important than the careful
assessment that precedes assisted death.

Franklin G. Miller et al., "Sounding Board: Regulating
Physician-Assisted Death," 331 New England J. Med. 119, 120
(1994). Likewise, the AMA Code of Ethics section 2.211 uses
identical language to condemn both euthanasia and
physician-assisted suicide.

The poor, the elderly, the disabled and minorities are all at risk
from undue pressure to commit physician-assisted suicide, either
through direct pressure or through inadequate treatment of their
pain and suffering. They cannot be adequately protected by
procedural safeguards, if the Dutch experience is any indication.
The only way to achieve adequate protection for these groups is to
maintain a bright-line rule against physician-assisted suicide.

But it is not only people at the margins who are imperilled by the
threat of a constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide.
Such a right could disrupt the established legal order of wills,
trusts, life insurance, annuities, pensions, and other estate
planning tools employed by many Americans. Many life insurance
policies have suicide clauses in them, which negate the insurer's
liability if the insured commits suicide. Many states have
statutes like Washington's Slayer's Act, which preclude
participants in the unlawful killing of another person from
acquiring property or receiving benefits as the result of the
death.[FOOTNOTE 19] A sampling of cases demonstrates that these
and related concerns are real. In People v. Matlock, 336 P.2d 505
(Cal. (In Bank) 1959) and Godsparek v. State, 1993 WL 213854 (Ala.
Cr. App. 1993), the defendants were tried for killing people who
had hired or requested to be killed because they wanted to die,
but did not want to void their life insurance by committing
suicide. In Keddie v. Delaware Violent Crimes Compensation Board,
1991 WL 215655 (Del Super. 1991), Ms. Keddie was denied
compensation under the Compensation for Innocent Victims of Crime
Act for her husband's suicide. He committed suicide at the
encouragement of Anthony Sabbato, who was convicted of promoting a
suicide. The court reasoned that Ms. Keddie's husband was not an
innocent victim of crime, insofar as he contributed to his own
death. In Holmes v. Morgan, 899 P.2d 738 (Or. App. 1995), a
distraught young man changed the named beneficiary on his life
insurance policy from his parents to a friend, who may have
assisted him in a suicide attempt. He later committed suicide
without assistance. The Oregon Court of Appeals held that the
friend could receive the policy proceeds. Finally, in Wilmington
Trust Co. v. Clark, 424 A.2d 744 (Md. 1981), the Maryland Supreme
Court considered whether a woman could bring a contract or tort
action against her former husband's estate, on the ground that his
suicide deprived her of alimony.

The interests of many innocent third parties are implicated by a
putative right to physician-assisted suicide. Most obviously, the
poor, minorities and the disabled are at risk of suffering undue
indifference or pressure to commit physician-assisted suicide.
Less obviously, a right to physician-assisted suicide could
severely disrupt the economic interests of the relatives, partners
and associates of those who commit physician-assisted suicide.

C. The prevention of suicide

The state interest in preventing suicide runs directly contrary to
any claimed right to physician-assisted suicide. It is a
longstanding interest. In Washington, committing or attempting
suicide was punishable as a crime at least from 1909 to 1976. The
1976 repeal arguably represents a recognition that suicide is not
a criminal problem, but rather one of mental and public
health.[FOOTNOTE 20] Suicide is a leading cause of death in
Washington for all age groups, 15-54. Washington State Dep't of
Health, Washington State Annual Summary of Vital Statistics 1989
38-39 (1990). Suicide is the cause of 1.8% of all deaths in
Washington. Id. at 37. Aiding suicide has been codified as a crime
in Washington law since 1854, and continues to the present, in RCW
9A.36.060.

Plaintiffs imply that the prevention of suicide is merely a
derivative of the state's general interest in protecting life.
Even if this were the entire substance of the state interest in
preventing suicide, the state's interest in preserving life
remains at full strength in the case of terminally ill patients
seeking to commit physician-assisted suicide.

However, the history of state regulation of suicide and the modern
consensus on the regulation of suicide indicates that the state's
interest in preventing suicide goes deeper than just keeping
people alive. The state recognizes suicide as a manifestation of
medical and psychological anguish; people with suicidal tendencies
are suffering. The state's interest is in addressing and, where
possible, relieving that suffering.

Plaintiffs make a compelling argument that in some cases of
terminally ill patients, the suffering is due not to physical pain
or to psychological illness, but to the knowledge that their
terminal illness will slowly dissolve their physical and mental
faculties, stripping them of dignity in their last days. But also
compelling are the data indicating that a high percentage of
persons withdraw their suicide requests once they receive adequate
treatment for depression, pain, and the like. See, e.g., Kamisar,
72 U. Det. Mercy L. Rev. at 744.

The state's interest in preventing suicide is distinct from its
interest in preserving life, and it does not diminish with the
onset and advancement of terminal illness.

D. The maintenance of the ethical integrity of the medical
profession



It is sanctionable unprofessional medical conduct in Washington to
"possess[ ], use, prescri[be] for use, or distribut[e] . . .
controlled substances or legend drugs in any way other than for
legitimate or therapeutic purposes . . ." RCW 18.130.180(6).
Furthermore, "[t]he use of a nontraditional treatment by itself
shall not constitute unprofessional conduct, provided that it does
not result in injury to a patient or create an unreasonable risk
that a patient may be harmed." RCW 18.130.180(4). These statutory
provisions demonstrate that, in addition to the prohibitions of
RCW 9A.36.060, physicians are subject to professional sanctions
for prescribing drugs to their patients in order to assist those
patients to commit suicide.

While not legally binding, the AMA Code of Ethics provides clear
guidance on the current position of medical ethicists. Section
2.211 of the American Medical Association's Code of Medical Ethics
and Current Opinions of the Council on Ethical and Judicial
Affairs ("AMA Code of Ethics") prohibits physician participation
in physician assisted suicide. In virtually identical language to
its condemnation of euthanasia, section 2.211 provides:

Physician assisted suicide occurs when a physician facilitates a
patient's death by providing the necessary means and/or
information to enable the patient to perform the life-ending act
(e.g. the physician provides sleeping pills and information about
the lethal dose, while aware that the patient may commit suicide).

It is understandable, though tragic, that some patients in extreme
duress--such as those suffering from a terminal, painful,
debilitating illness--may come to decide that death is preferable
to life. However, allowing physicians to participate in assisted
suicide would cause more harm than good. Physician assisted
suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as
healer, would be difficult or impossible to control, and would
pose serious societal risks.

Instead of participating in assisted suicide, physicians must
aggressively respond to the needs of patients at the end of life.
Patients should not be abandoned once it is determined that cure
is impossible. Patients near the end of life must continue to
receive emotional support, comfort care, adequate pain control,
respect for patient autonomy, and good communication.

Because it is contrary to Washington statutory law, reinforced by
the AMA Code of Ethics, it would violate the state's interest in
maintaining the ethical integrity of the medical profession to
allow physicians to participate in physician assisted suicide.

VIII

In reviewing a statute's constitutionality under the substantive
due process clause, courts should apply one of two tests. If the
right asserted is fundamental, the statute is subjected to strict
scrutiny, under which it must be narrowly tailored to serve a
compelling state interest. If the liberty interest is not
fundamental, the statute is subjected only to the "unexacting"
inquiry of whether the statute rationally advances some legitimate
governmental purpose. Reno v. Flores, 113 S.Ct. at 1447-1449.

Because I would hold that the liberty interest of mentally
competent, terminally ill adults in committing physician-assisted
suicide is not a fundamental right, I would use the latter test,
which has sometimes been called the rational relationship test.

The nonfundamental liberty interest at stake here is the right of
mentally competent, terminally ill adults to commit
physician-assisted suicide. This interest is rooted in the liberty
to make intensely private choices that are central to personal
dignity and autonomy. The exercise of this nonfundamental liberty
interest is barred in Washington by RCW 9A.36.060, which states
that promoting a suicide attempt is a criminal offense. The
Washington statute rationally advances four legitimate state
interests: the preservation of life, the protection of the
interests of innocent third parties, the prevention of suicide,
and the maintenance of the ethical integrity of the medical
profession. Under the rational relationship test, RCW 9A.36.060 is
valid.[FOOTNOTE 21]

IX

The district court also holds that the Washington statute violates
the Equal Protection Clause. Its analysis is based upon two
premises, both of which are incorrect, and fall together. First,
it assumes that Cruzan-type patients are similarly situated to the
patients in this case. Second, it holds that the differentiation
between these types of patients is subject to, and does not
withstand, strict scrutiny. Compassion in Dying, 850 F. Supp. at
1466.

Cruzan-type patients are being subjected to unwanted life-saving
medical treatment, from which they have a constitutionally
protected right to be free. The patients in this case, though also
terminally ill, are not seeking any such freedom from treatment.
Rather, they are seeking medical assistance in ending their lives.
The district court rejected arguments that the distinction between
the two groups is one between "natural" and "artificial" deaths.
There are dozens of ways that the two groups of patients could be
distinguished or associated, not the least of which is the
dramatic difference in the nature of their constitutional rights.
One group has not just an interest but a right to be free from
unwanted medical treatment. The other group has an interest, but
not a protected right, in committing physician-assisted suicide.
Washington statutes clearly distinguish the two groups, as does
the AMA Code of Ethics. They are not similarly situated, and are
therefore not subject to an equal protection analysis.

Even though the physician plaintiffs argue that the two groups are
similarly situated, the patients in this case are neither a
suspect classification nor holders of fundamental rights. The
patients' position is entitled to no more than rational basis
review. Strict scrutiny is only used where people are categorized
into suspect classifications (e.g., race) or suffer the
infringement of a constitutionally protected fundamental right.
"[T]he pertinent inquiry is whether the [classification] advances
legitimate legislative goals in a rational fashion. The Court has
said that, although this rational basis standard is 'not a
toothless one,' it does not allow us to substitute our notions of
good public policy." Schweiker v. Wilson, 450 U.S. 221 (1981). See
also New York Transit Auth. v. Beazer, 440 U.S. 568 (1979);
Kadrmas v. Dickinson Public Schools, 487 U.S. 450 (1988). The
state's interests in protecting life, preventing suicide,
protecting the interests of third parties, and preserving the
ethical integrity of the medical profession are strong, perhaps
even compelling. Even if the two groups--patients refusing
unwanted medical treatment and mentally competent terminally ill
adults seeking to commit physician-assisted suicide--were
similarly situated, the distinction between them rests solidly on
a rational basis and is constitutionally valid under the Equal
Protection Clause.

X

The issue of whether mentally competent, terminally ill adults
have a constitutionally protected right to commit
physician-assisted suicide is one of the most difficult, divisive
and heart-wrenching issues facing the courts today. The
correlative issue of whether terminally ill loved ones ought to be
allowed to commit assisted suicide is likewise one of the most
difficult, divisive and heart-wrenching issues facing American
society. The former is a constitutional issue for the courts; the
latter is a moral question for society as a whole.

The two issues are not the same. The latter requires us--all of
us, not just judges--to engage in a soul-searching dialogue about
our collective morals. Given the tremendous advances in
twentieth-century medical technology and public health, it is now
possible to live much longer than at any time in recorded history.
We have controlled most of the swift and merciful diseases that
caused most deaths in the past. In their place are a host of
diseases that cause a slow deterioration of the human condition:
cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and AIDS are but a few. This change
has forced us to step back and reexamine the historic presumption
that all human lives are equally and intrinsically valuable.
Viewed most charitably, this reexamination may be interpreted as
our struggle with the question whether we as a society are willing
to excuse the terminally ill for deciding that their lives are no
longer worth living. Viewed less charitably, the reexamination may
be interpreted as a mere rationalization for housecleaning,
cost-cutting and burden-shifting--a way to get rid of those whose
lives we deem worthless. Whether the charitable or uncharitable
characterization ultimately prevails is a question that must be
resolved by the people through deliberative decisionmaking in the
voting booth, as in Washington in 1991, California in 1992 and
Oregon in 1994, or in the legislatures, as recently undertaken in
Michigan and New York. This issue we, the courts, need not--and
should not--decide.

Instead, we should restrict our decision to the former issue:
whether mentally competent, terminally ill adults have a
constitutionally protected liberty interest in committing
physician-assisted suicide. This is the first federal appellate
case in our nation's history to address the issue of
physician-assisted suicide. To declare a constitutional right to
physician-assisted suicide would be to impose upon the nation a
repeal of local laws. Such a declaration would also usurp states'
rights to regulate and further the practice of medicine, insofar
as a right to physician-assisted suicide flies in the face of
well-established state laws governing the medical profession.
Finally, the rationales under which we are asked to create this
right fail adequately to distinguish physician-assisted suicide as
a unique category. If physician-assisted suicide for mentally
competent, terminally ill adults is made a constitutional right,
voluntary euthanasia for weaker patients, unable to
self-terminate, will soon follow. After voluntary euthanasia, it
is but a short step to a "substituted judgment" or "best
interests" analysis for terminally ill patients who have not yet
expressed their constitutionally sanctioned desire to be
dispatched from this world. This is the sure and inevitable path,
as the Dutch experience has amply demonstrated. It is not a path I
would start down.

I would hold that the four state interests discussed above are
sufficiently strong to sustain the constitutionality of RCW
9A.36.060 as applied to plaintiffs' asserted liberty interest.

I dissent.

FERNANDEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting:

I join in Judge Beezer's dissenting opinion with one caveat.
Nothing in his opinion, or in that of the majority, convinces me
that there is any constitutional right whatever to commit suicide.
In my view, no one has an even nonfundamental constitutional right
to become what our legal ancestors pithily denominated a felo de
se. See e.g., Sir Edward Coke, Institutes of the Laws of England,
3d Institute, 54 (Brooke ed. 1797) (1644); 1 Sir Matthew Hale,
Pleas of the Crown 411 (Nutt ed. 1736) (1680); 4 Sir William
Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 189 (15th ed.
1809) (1765). The arguments for and against suicide raise an issue
which would elicit competing responses from even our most well
trained moral philosophers. Like so many other issues, it is one
"for the people to decide." Guadalupe Org., Inc. v. Tempe
Elementary Sch. Dist. No. 3, 587 F.2d 1022, 1027 (9th Cir. 1978).
Our Constitution leaves it to them; it is they and their
representatives who must grapple with the riddle and solve it.

KLEINFELD, Circuit Judge, dissenting:

I join in Judge Beezer's dissenting opinion, with two
qualifications.

First, I doubt that there is a constitutional right to commit
suicide. "[N]o 'substantive due process' claim can be maintained
unless the claimant demonstrates that the state has deprived him
of a right historically and traditionally protected against state
interference." Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dep't of Health, 110
S. Ct. 2841, 2860 (1990) (Scalia, J. concurring). Suicide has not
been traditionally or historically protected as a right:

American law has always accorded the State the power to prevent,
by force if necessary, suicide--including suicide by refusing to
take appropriate measures necessary to preserve one's life; the
point at which life becomes "worthless," and the point at which
the means necessary to preserve it become "extraordinary" or
"inappropriate" are neither set forth in the Constitution nor
known to the nine Justices of this Court any better than they are
known to nine people picked at random from the Kansas City
telephone directory; . . . It is quite impossible (because the
Constitution says nothing about the matter) that [Missouri's]
citizens will decide upon a line less lawful than the one we would
choose; and it is unlikely (because we know no more about
"life-and-death" than they do) that they will decide upon a line
less reasonable.

Cruzan, 110 S. Ct. at 2859 (Scalia. J. concurring).

That a question is important does not imply that it is
constitutional. The Founding Fathers did not establish the United
States as a democratic republic so that elected officials would
decide trivia, while all great questions would be decided by the
judiciary. The majority treats the remark in Planned Parenthood v.
Casey, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (1992), about "the most intimate and
personal choices a person may make . . . the right to define one's
own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the
mystery of human life," id. at 2807, as a basis for
constitutionalizing any really important personal decision. That
an issue is important does not mean that the people, through their
democratically elected representatives, do not have the power to
decide it. One might suppose that the general rule in a democratic
republic would be the opposite, with a few exceptions. Judge
Beezer's view, that the statement is made in the sui generis
context of abortion law, is sounder than the majority's. There is
a difficulty with expanding the quoted language from Casey beyond
abortion, in the face of Bowers v. Hardwick, 106 S. Ct. 2841,
2944-45 (1986), and we lack authority to overrule that decision of
a higher court.

We do not need, however, to decide whether suicide is a
constitutionally protected right. As Judge Beezer explains, even
if it is, the State of Washington has a rational basis for
preventing assisted suicide. It is not necessary to agree with
Judge Beezer, that there is a nonfundamental constitutionally
protected right to commit suicide, or with Judge Fernandez, that
there is not. Either way, the district court erred, for the
reasons stated by Judge Beezer.

Second, the majority says there is "little, if any, difference for
constitutional or ethical purposes" between providing pain killing
medication for the purpose of relieving pain, knowing that it will
at some dosage cause death, and providing medication for the sole
purpose of causing death. I would go further than Judge Beezer's
characterization of this as a "gray area." I think the majority's
proposition is exactly wrong. When General Eisenhower ordered
American soldiers onto the beaches of Normandy, he knew that he
was sending many American soldiers to certain death, despite his
best efforts to minimize casualties. His purpose, though, was to
liberate the beaches, liberate France, and liberate Europe from
the Nazis. The majority's theory of ethics would imply that this
purpose was legally and ethically indistinguishable from a purpose
of killing American soldiers. Knowledge of an undesired
consequence does not imply that the actor intends that
consequence. A physician who administers pain medication with the
purpose of relieving pain, doing his best to avert death, is no
murderer, despite his knowledge that as the necessary dosage
rises, it will produce the undesired consequence of death.

Justice Holmes was the leading advocate of his time for the
general proposition that "[a]cts should be judged by their
tendency under the known circumstances, not by the actual intent
which accompanies them." Holmes, The Common Law 54 (Harvard Univ.
Press 1967)(1881). When applying this general principle to a
specific case, however, Holmes qualified it, conceding that "when
words are used exactly, a deed is not done with intent to produce
a consequence unless that consequence is the aim of the deed."
Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616, 627 (1919)(Holmes J.
dissenting). There is no novelty to the distinction between
intended purpose and foreseen but undesired consequence. "It is
deliberate purpose that constitutes wickedness and criminal guilt,
and such names as 'outrage' and 'theft' imply deliberate purpose
as well as the mere action." Aristotle, Rhetoric, book I, chap.
13, at 79 (Roberts trans. 1954). Jurors can no longer be
instructed that "the law presumes that a person intends the
ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts," in a case requiring
purposeful conduct, because the instruction presumes away the
prosecution's burden of proving criminal intent. Sandstrom v.
Montana, 442 U.S. 510, 513 (1979).

It is very difficult to judge what ought to be allowed in the care
of terminally ill patients. The Constitution does not speak to the
issue. People of varying views, including people with terrible
illnesses and their relatives, physicians, and clergy, can,
through democratic institutions, obtain enlightened compromises of
the complex and conflicting considerations. They can do so at
least as well as we judges can, and nothing in the Constitution
prevents them from making the law.

121 S.E.2d 854 (N.C. 1961).

FN14. Research indicates that the last prosecution in the U.S. for
attempted suicide probably occurred in 1961. The North Carolina
Supreme Court relied on the English common law to determine that
attempted suicide was punishable as a misdemeanor. State v.
Willis, 121 S.E.2d 854 (N.C. 1961).

FN15. Washington subscribes to this view, and provides that
attempts or threats to commit suicide can constitute a "likelihood
of serious harm" to oneself sufficient to justify commitment. See
RCW 71.05.020(3), RCW 71.05.240.

FN16. A recent computer search revealed 83 news stories with this
phrase, including the famous 1984 statement by Colorado Governor
Lamm.

FN17. Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia are prohibited by
the Penal Code of the Netherlands, art. 293-294. See John Keown,
"Euthanasia in The Netherlands: Sliding Down the Slippery Slope?"
9 Notre Dame J. Law, Ethics & Pub. Pol. 407, 409-410 (1995). The
courts have allowed physicians who participate in euthanasia to go
unpunished since 1973. Nederlandse Jurisprudentie (1973), no. 183,
District Court of Leeuwarden, February 21, 1973; trans., Walter
Lagerway, 3 Issues in Law and Med. 429, 439-442 (1988).

FN18. Keown, supra note 17, at 419.

FN19. See RCW 11.84.010 et seq. The applicability of this statute
to cases of assisted suicide has not yet been decided in
Washington courts. However, RCW 11.84.900 provides: "This chapter
state that no person shall be allowed to profit by his own wrong,
wherever committed."

FN20. A review of the legislative history and the state archives
reveals that the repeal was enacted without comment from the
legislature.

FN21. The Supreme Court has occasionally appeared to employ a
straight balancing test instead of the strict
scrutiny-versus-rational relationship dichotomy. E.g., Cruzan, 497
U.S. at 278-279 ("whether [the individual's] constitutional rights
have been violated must be determined by balancing his liberty
interests against the relevant state interests"). Even under such
a balancing test, I would hold that the state's four interests--in
preserving life, protecting the interests of innocent third
parties, preventing suicide, and maintaining the ethical integrity
of the medical profession--outweigh the plaintiffs' autonomy-based
liberty interest in committing physician-assisted suicide.
