By Kevin Carmody and Randy Lee Loftis<P>

The anecdote has become the weapon of choice in the campaign to 
rewrite the nation's environmental laws, and lazy journalists are 
allowing themselves to be used as unwitting accomplices.
<P>

Imagine this:<P>

The mayor calls a press conference to announce that his 
administration has achieved a 93-percent public approval rating. 
Therefore, he says, the City Council has a duty to approve his 
proposed budget without debate or amendment.<P>

Journalists' response would be automatic: they would demand 
proof. Who did the poll? When? What was the margin of error? And 
most important, where's the documentation? If the mayor refused 
to back up his claim, reporters would rightly dismiss his 
announcement as a stunt and Hizzoner himself as a con man.<P> 

Now imagine this:<P>

The mayor tells those same reporters that some anonymous 
bureaucrat ordered his city to spend hard-earned tax dollars 
testing the local drinking water for a pesticide used only on 
pineapples -- a crop that has never grown anywhere near his 
Midwestern city. Foolishness and folly! Meddling by overpaid, 
underworked Washington officials! With this outrage exposed, the 
mayor says, Congress has a duty to pass regulatory relief with 
due haste.<P> 

What would the journalists do? This time they would take the 
mayor at his word and put his story on the air or in print 
without a second thought.<P> 

Right?<P>

Right. That second scenario is exactly what happened last year in 
Chicago (and many other cities). The mayor was a real one, 
Richard Daley. The pesticide is real, too -- dibromochloropropane 
(DBCP). Indeed it was used on pineapples, far off in tropical 
Hawaii. News coverage mirrored the mayor's spin, and Chicagoans 
may have been left with the impression that environmental 
"wackos" in the EPA had struck again.<P> 

There was only one problem with this story: It wasn't true. DBCP 
is not just a pineapple pesticide. Until about 1980, DBCP was 
registered for use on about 40 crops, including some widely 
farmed in the upper Midwest, such as soybeans. Pineapples simply 
were the final permitted use. More importantly, DBCP is a 
persistent pesticide that continues to show up in drinking water 
wells across the nation and the upper Midwest.<P> 

The mayor forgot to mention that part. So did the reporters. So 
did their editors and news directors. Although a reporter might 
be fired for reporting a mayor's bogus political poll as fact, it 
seems that a reporter who reports a bogus environmental anecdote 
as fact suffers no consequence at all.<P> 

Anecdotes are supposed to illustrate the truth, reflecting the 
findings of the thorough reportorial or investigative process. In 
authors' past lives as editors, each of us has seen how a 
compelling, tangible example can make an otherwise dry story come 
alive. However, there are two requirements for an honorable 
anecdote. First, it has to be true. Second, it has to reflect the 
greater reality. By itself, an anecdote proves nothing -- as 
every reputable scientist knows.<P> 

That standard, sadly, has fallen into disuse. Instead of picking 
apart the claims of partisans, many journalists are spreading 
them unchallenged. The politics of the day dictate that most of 
the current crop of whoppers comes from opponents of existing 
environmental laws -- partisans trying to turn public opinion.<P> 

In newsrooms throughout the country, it is trendy to ask whether 
environmental laws, not polluters, are the real public enemy. The 
hot story is the "high cost of environmental regulation,'' not 
the people or resources harmed by the violation or abandonment of 
those regulations. In times past, it might have been the 
proponents of environmental regulation who were using dubious or 
exaggerated stories to make political points. (Reporters need to 
be just as diligent about critically examining the claims of 
environmental advocates; their studies and claims are no less 
likely to contain flaws today, and might be more likely to suffer 
from hyperbole whenever the political pendulum swings back.)<P> 

It is good to ask whether public policy is working and how it 
might be flawed. Unfortunately, the process by which some 
journalists are answering this question is the problem.<P> 

Tim Noah, reporting from Washington for <EM>The Wall Street Journal,</EM> 
put it this way: "Five years ago, environmental issues were 
subjected to far too little skepticism in the press. Journalists 
were faddish and unthinking in their coverage of some stories," 
he said. "Now there is a faddish, unthinking, knee-jerk reaction 
in the other direction. The truth is in neither extreme.''<P> 

Here's another way to put it: No matter where a half-truth or an 
outright fib comes from, it's our job to stomp the life out of 
it. We are not always doing our job. Here are some ways in which 
environmental reporters can make amends -- good things for all of 
us to keep in mind:<P> 

<OL><LI><STRONG>All reporters should fact-check everything.</STRONG> Once in 
circulation, flawed anecdotes and bogus "facts" take on lives of 
their own (like ghost stories around campfires) and are likely to 
be lifted and used by other reporters without any fact-checking. 
(The world "factoid" was coined to describe such provably wrong 
but widely accepted assertions. Factoids are to facts as androids 
are to humans.)<P> 

Take the case of the so-called fire rat. Opponents of the 
Endangered Species Act (ESA) say that regulations protecting the 
Stephens kangaroo rat led to the destruction of 29 houses in the 
California wildfires. The tale took hold when a real estate-connected 
opponent of the ESA got a <EM>Los Angeles Times</EM> reporter to 
publish his claim that his neighbors lost their homes because the 
law prohibited their digging up grassland to create 
firebreaks.<P> 

The Stephens kangaroo rat claim then turned up in a <EM>20-20</EM> report 
by ABC's John Stossel. After the Stossel piece aired in late 
1993, the General Accounting Office investigated and torpedoed 
the rats-versus-houses tale, concluding that the wildfire, pushed 
by 80 mph winds, "moved with such ferocity that clearing hundreds 
of feet of ground would not have helped because firestorms of 
this magnitude can blow searing embers and ashes a mile away or 
even farther ... weed abatement techniques become moot.'' More than 
a year later, Connie Chung's now-defunct <EM>Eye to Eye</EM> did the same 
story, focusing on the same discredited allegations while giving 
the GAO conclusions brief mention. Philip Howard exaggerated the 
tale even further in his popular book, <EM>The Death of Common 
Sense.</EM><P> 

There is a little sunshine in this otherwise bleak area. <EM>Time</EM> 
magazine on April 10 detailed some the flawed anecdotes that 
plague Howard's book, including one that Senate Majority Leader 
Bob Dole borrowed to lead off an anti-regulatory op-ed piece in 
the <EM>Washington Post.</EM> (That hasn't kept Howard's book 
off the best-seller lists.) The <EM>Washington Post's</EM> Tom 
Kenworthy did a front page piece on March 13, exposing the use of bogus anecdotes 
by anti-regulation crusaders in Congress. CNN and NBC's <EM>Dateline</EM> 
have broadcast similar pieces.<P> 

And in July, National Public Radio skewered some of the juiciest 
horror stories -- including an alleged action by the government 
to require holes in the bottoms of buckets.<P> 

NPR also told the story of a woman who supposedly was prohibited 
from planting rose bushes in her front yard because they might 
endanger some protected species. Several members of Congress have 
claimed that the woman lived in their state or district, NPR 
noted, but she never seems to be identified.<P> 

That members of the greatest deliberative body on Earth would 
attempt to forge public policy using such shoddy tricks ought to 
be embarrassing. It's the journalist's job to examine, expose, 
and deflate them. The public has a right to be happy, sad, or mad 
about anything it chooses -- but it ought to have the option of 
doing so based on facts, not fantasies.<P> 

<LI><STRONG>In general, reporters should take care to delineate sources' 
facts from their assumptions, opinions, wishes, or fantasies.</STRONG> We 
must renew our allegiance to the facts. We have an obligation not 
only to report accurately what's being said, but to report things 
that are true.<P> 

Here's a widely reported example from the Southeast. Ben Cone, a 
North Carolina farmer, has said that he has cut down his trees 
rather than let some government scientist find nests of the 
endangered red-cockaded woodpecker there.<P> 

The story of that one farmer has now spun out of control. 
Opponents of the Endangered Species Act now use the anecdote to 
claim that the law itself is the biggest factor in habitat 
destruction -- because huge numbers of landowners are nuking 
their property preemptively rather than face federal 
restrictions. Members of Congress from Texas repeated the claim 
recently in an attempt to scuttle federal protection for that 
state's golden-cheeked warbler.<P> 

Journalists should have a simple solution when they hear people 
make a claim like that: Make them prove it.<P> 

Fred Smith of the Competitive Enterprise Institute repeated the 
habitat-destruction claim at SEJ's Southeastern regional 
conference in July. <A HREF="#backlasher">(See related story.)</A> He was immediately 
challenged to cite a single valid scientific study proving its 
truth. The only proof he could cite was the same anecdote that 
triggered the claim in the first place: Ben Cone in North 
Carolina. (The claim that private parties are intentionally 
destroying their own habitats also clashes with the oft-repeated 
assertion of free-market advocates that private owners are better 
stewards of the land than public agencies. That might make an 
interesting story.)<P> 

<LI><STRONG>The lost art of attribution should be rediscovered.</STRONG> Some 
things, of course, aren't provable. We should feel free to say 
so. But we can use that old standby, attribution, to narrow some 
of the factual gaps. Who said it, and what do they have to gain 
by saying it? That information is often as vital to readers as 
what was said.<P> 

Some people have noted that attribution seems to have fallen on 
hard times. The AP's Terry Anderson, who was held hostage in 
Beirut for seven years, said after his release that the 
disappearance of attribution was one of the most disturbing 
changes he noticed in American journalism during his captive 
years.<P> 

Attribution is perhaps the journalist's best insurance against 
attack -- and the best way to judge credibility. In a review of 
Gregg Easterbrook's book <EM>A Moment on the Earth</EM> which appeared in 
the July-August issue of <EM>Audubon</EM> magazine, T.H. Watkins hammers 
Easterbrook for not citing sources for most of his broad 
statements. The evidence shows that the biosphere is in pretty 
good shape, Easterbrook asserts. Watkins responds: "Who says? He 
(Easterbrook) says."<P> 

Even assuming that every word of Easterbrook's book is true, the 
lack of attribution in places makes it a much easier target. 
Watkins rightly demands scientific proof from a source more 
reliable than a mere reporter. Head back to the library in a 
spare moment and flip through a scientific journal. You'll find 
that every statement will be footnoted to a source. In reporting 
on scientific conflict, we should be no less rigorous.<P> 

Attribution can also make for spicier stories. When Mayor Daley's 
staff was eventually pushed to identify the source of the 
pineapple pesticide tale, they said he got it from the mayor of 
Columbus, Ohio.<P> 

<LI><STRONG>Editors, producers, and news directors should only assign 
reporters who know what they're doing to cover environmental 
stories.</STRONG> Those who don't are far more likely to be snookered. 
Don't let any reporter take an environmental assignment until he 
or she can accurately explain, in 45 words or fewer, the 
difference between ground-level ozone and stratospheric ozone. 
Let that be a litmus test before journalists are unleashed on an 
increasingly suspecting public.<P> 

<LI>And finally, all reporters should review the advice that hard-
bitten old city editors have been giving to rookie reporters for 
better than a century: <STRONG>Check, ask, demand, then check again.</STRONG> If a 
mayor tells you that a crazy eco-fascist effort to preserve some 
endangered species of hog has led the government to ban bologna 
and require children to eat stale peanut butter sandwiches for 
lunch -- well, you know.<P>

<H4><A NAME = "statistics">Statistics: advantage or potential minefield</A></H4>

By Robert J. Griffin<P>

<P>Like most folks, reporters sometimes cringe when they encounter 
statistical information, even that generated by their own news 
gathering efforts. For example, when the <EM>Milwaukee Journal</EM> 
discovered last fall that a graph accompanying their story on 
single-parent households had incorrectly presented some census 
data they had gathered, the editor involved observed that he 
approaches any story based on statistics, done under deadline 
pressure, as "a potential minefield."<P> 

If the data are provided by someone outside the news 
organization, the minefield can become truly explosive, as <EM>Time</EM> 
magazine discovered to its dismay after running the ill-fated 
cover story on "cyberporn" this past summer. <P> 

<EM>Time's</EM> July 3 piece on Internet pornography was based on a flawed 
and unrepresentative study which had not been peer-reviewed. This 
study grossly overestimated the amount of pornography available 
on the Internet. The cyberporn episode 
illustrates, reporters from any media who do not think critically 
about information -- be it verbal or numeric -- which they get 
from sources can find themselves and their audiences misled. <P> 

Since it seems so easy to misstep, wouldn't it be better just to 
avoid using statistics in stories? Given the use (and misuse) of 
data by all sorts of news sources, the advent of computer-
assisted reporting and ready access to statistical analysis 
packages, the need for journalists to deal competently with 
numbers and the scientific methods that generate them is 
certainly not going away. In fact, it seems that capable 
reporters with computer and statistical acumen might have a real 
advantage in the tight journalistic job market, according to a 
recent article in <EM>Quill</EM> (Christopher J. Feola, "Making the Cut," 
March, 1995, pp. 24-26).<P> 

Environmental journalists in particular can find some real news-
gathering advantages in the combined use of databases, surveys, 
and statistical analyses.<P> 

For example, hazardous chemicals are present quite commonly in 
communities of all sizes. Reporters can use the computerized 
Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) database to discern trends and 
make key comparisons about the release of these chemicals into 
the environment locally and nationally. (A fine guidebook, 
<EM>Chemicals, the Press, and the Public,</EM> discusses some of the 
strengths and weaknesses of TRI data and is available free to 
reporters from the National Safety Council's <A HREF="mailto:ehc@cais.com">Environmental Health 
Center</A> in Washington, D.C.) <P> 

Assessing public reactions to health risks from hazardous 
chemicals and other potential pollutants has become an 
increasingly important part of environmental policy debates. 
Often, those people most at risk from pollution have relatively 
little political or economic clout. Survey techniques could help 
shed light on a couple of key questions for just about any 
community: <P> 

<UL><LI>What risks are acceptable to the people who must, for 
example, live near the local plant which provides jobs but spews 
pollutants?

<LI>Given that people who live in the backyards of industries are 
typically lower-income and less educated, how aware are they of 
possible danger from chemicals and what to do about these 
dangers?</UL><P> 

If properly conducted, surveys can gather information which 
reflects the public's views on health risks and other 
environmental issues, views which are essential for the 
development of good public policy. Such views usually are not 
well-represented by the posturing of politicians, bureaucrats, 
special interest groups, public hearing testifiers, talk-show 
callers, petition signers, op-ed writers, and writers of letters 
to the editor. <P> 

Of course, gathering any information and assessing its value are 
only part of the journalist's job. Interpreting the meaning of 
information for audiences is yet another task. This task can be 
daunting, especially when the information is statistical and such 
a large portion of the general public seems to suffer from 
"innumeracy," (a term coined by Temple University mathematics 
professor John Allen Paulos to describe the widespread problem of 
mathematical illiteracy.)<P> 

Given that most reporters are much more likely to encounter data 
provided by others than to generate it themselves through 
techniques such as surveys, the ability to think critically about 
data encountered in the news can be a very valuable intellectual 
ability on any beat. Journalists who engage in such statistical 
reasoning instead of holding data at arm's length can do a lot to 
help audiences understand the news. <P> 

Statistical reasoning is the application of a basic set of 
logical rules of evidence based in the sciences. One of the most 
serious errors in statistical reasoning occurs when people jump 
to the conclusion that one thing causes another simply because 
the two correlate.<P> 

A case in point: this past summer an environmental activist group 
claimed that the large number of nuclear power plants surrounding 
the Great Lakes and the high incidence of breast cancer in the 
region demonstrate the danger from nuclear power plants. <P> 

Informal observation showed that some local media, at least in 
the Milwaukee area, covered the story in the point-counterpoint 
way usually applied to political coverage -- by conveying the 
group's allegations and then reporting that various experts 
disagreed with them. <P> 

However, other Milwaukee news media illustrated for their 
audiences right away the faulty statistical reasoning involved in 
simply assuming causality from correlation. One local television 
station, for example, quoted an epidemiologist who explained how 
urbanization around the Great Lakes lurks as the likely culprit, 
contributing separately to both the cancer rate and the demand 
for power met in the past by building nuclear plants.<P> 

In general, statistical reasoning usually involves much more 
"reasoning" than "statistics." For journalistic purposes, 
statistical reasoning commonly concerns: 

<UL><LI>The kinds of evidence required to show that one thing 
causes another (e.g., carefully ruling out other explanations 
lurking behind the scenes);  

<LI>The representativeness and generalizability of the 
findings of research (e.g., appropriately using some form of 
random sampling in surveys and, especially, not drawing 
conclusions about a group from one or two cases); 

<LI>Probability (e.g., carefully interpreting risk estimates, 
properly applying a margin of error to survey results);  

<LI>Basic statistical rules, especially rules for making fair 
comparisons (e.g., when comparing changes in the tons of trash 
produced in various cities, remembering the importance of the 
denominator by accounting for differences in the population 
growth of each community).</UL><P> 

To serve the needs of the audience probably will require the vast 
majority of journalists to become more skillful in using and 
analyzing the validity of statistical information and also to 
become more adept at translating the meaning of this information 
for audiences. <P> 

As educators and professionals, what can we do about it? Here are 
some suggestions:<P> 

<OL><LI>Journalism schools should assess how well statistical literacy 
is integrated into the professional curriculum at all levels. <P> 

If a good portion of journalists are having trouble dealing with 
statistics, as appears to be the case, much of the fault might 
lie in the traditional culture of the journalism academy. For 
decades, this culture has subtly written off journalism students 
as innumerate, often with encouragement from the students 
themselves, and has therefore failed to help them develop the 
necessary conceptual tools. <P> 

Journalism education, it seems, has been guided by what Lee 
Becker and Joseph Graf call "the myth [that] journalism is a 
career for those with math deficiencies" (<EM>Myths and Trends: What 
the Real Numbers Say About Journalism Education,</EM> The Freedom 
Forum, 1995, p. 11). This study shows that journalism students 
score well on the verbal portion of the Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
However, instead of being a bunch of math 
dummies, journalism students do, in fact, reflect the national 
average on the math portion of the SAT. So, they should be able 
to handle the basics of statistical methods and reasoning as 
applied to the work of journalism -- and probably have been able 
to do so for years.<P> 

The challenge to journalism education is to teach "numeracy" 
throughout the professional curriculum rather than just 
relegating statistics instruction to an isolated course the 
students might take over in the math or psychology department. (A 
stats course, however, does provide an essential base.) 
Statistical reasoning should be integrated thoroughly into 
reporting courses -- at least as well as law, ethics, and the 
other liberal arts drawn from the rest of the university -- so 
that students can learn how to apply it in the many everyday 
contexts of news reporting. <P> 

"It's time to let the secret out," as Paulos says in his book, <EM>A 
Mathematician Reads the Newspaper</EM> (p. 3). "Mathematics is not 
primarily a matter of plugging numbers into formulas and 
performing rote computations. It is a way of thinking and 
questioning that may be unfamiliar to many of us, but is 
available to almost all of us."<P> 

<LI>Journalists should consider refreshing their 
statistical reasoning skills and applying them more 
rigorously to the news.<P> 

Taking refresher courses in statistics, precision journalism, 
computer-assisted reporting and the like would be the fast track. 
There are, however, some other very good resources as well: 

<UL><LI>Read and keep nearby Victor Cohn's two books, <EM>News & 
Numbers</EM> (Iowa State University Press, 1989), and <EM>Reporting on 
Risk</EM> (The Media Institute, 1990), and also Philip Meyer's <EM>The New 
Precision Journalism</EM> (Indiana, 1991). Both Cohn and Meyer are 
former journalists (Cohn was a science writer) with a knack for 
statistics, clear writing, and good advice. 

<LI>For a quick read, try Arnold Barnett's article "How Numbers 
Can Trick You" in <EM>Technology Review</EM> (October 1994, pp. 38-45). 

<LI>For amplification, read John Allen Paulos' recent book <EM>A 
Mathematician Reads the Newspaper</EM> (Basic Books, 1995), his 
earlier <EM>Innumeracy</EM> (Vintage, 1988), and Cynthia Crossen's <EM>Tainted 
Truth: The Manipulation of Fact in America</EM> (Simon & Schuster, 
1994).  

<LI>To keep up-to-date, point your Internet web browser to the 
home page of math professor Laurie Snell's 
<A HREF="http://www.geom.umn.edu/locate/chance">"Chance" project</A> 
at Dartmouth College. The 
online <EM>Chance Newsletter,</EM> designed to help statistics 
instruction, contains a wealth of examples of the use of 
statistics in current news stories.</UL><P> 

In applying statistical reasoning skills, 
reporters should demand that statistical and other evidence 
presented in the news is enlightening, not misleading. Reporters 
also should insist that the evidence has been gathered 
in an ethical manner. These demands would apply to information 
provided by sources and that gathered by their own news 
organizations. That can be a big order, but there are some places 
to start.<P> 

Surveys are a very common -- and sometimes misused -- source of 
statistical information in the news. Various sources, such as 
Phil Meyer's <EM>The New Precision Journalism,</EM> provide guidelines for 
the kinds of information that reporters should gather about the 
method used in a survey to help them and their audiences assess 
its validity. <P> 

Similarly, journalists can also help audiences become more savvy 
about statistics and the scientific methods that generate them. 
The <EM>Minneapolis Star-Tribune,</EM> for example, ran an article by 
Sandra Y. Lee ("Untrue Facts," Nov. 28, 1994, p. 1E), reprinted 
from <EM>McCall's,</EM> about how people accept distorted statistics. The 
article included a guide with questions designed to help readers 
sort out what to believe in surveys and similar studies. 
Questions included: 

<UL><LI>Who was surveyed or studied?  

<LI>How many people were surveyed and how many responded?  

<LI>How were the questions worded? 

<LI>How was the problem defined?  

<LI>Who paid for the study?  

<LI>Was the study published in a peer-review journal such as the 
<EM>New England Journal of Medicine?</EM></UL><P> 

Answers to these and other essential questions (e.g., were the 
interviewees in a sample survey chosen in some random manner -- 
and, if so, what is the survey's margin of error?) should be 
readily available to reporters from the text of the study's 
report or from the organization which conducted the study. One 
very important way for reporters to apply statistical reasoning 
is to use a sample survey's margin of error directly to interpret 
the results for audiences (e.g., is the difference in support for 
the incumbent and the challenger greater than the sampling error 
would produce?) rather than simply reporting the margin of error 
at the end of the story and hoping audiences can figure out its 
application.<P> 

There are some unethical practices in survey research which 
reporters should be aware of. The most worrisome of these 
capitalize on others' innumeracy and borrow the scientific aura 
of good surveys to lend credibility to slipshod or self-serving 
efforts. Recently the Research Industry Coalition, which is 
comprised of 15 organizations including the American Association 
for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) and the National Association 
of Broadcasters, took a stand against the most salient abuses: 

<UL><LI>Soliciting contributions or payments, selling products, 
or using survey participants as means of generating sales leads 
under the guise of conducting a survey; 

<LI>Revealing the 
identity of individual participants in a study (e.g., survey 
interviewees) without prior, informed consent;  

<LI>Depicting "call-in" polls as representative of the views of 
the general public.</UL><P> 

It might be disconcerting to see a reference to what is an all-
too-common media practice, the call-in poll, in this kind of 
rogues gallery. A call-in poll will, for example, ask audience 
members to initiate phone calls to a central number to indicate 
their stance on a particular issue in the news. The problem is 
that the call-in poll, like any kind of study based on self-
selection and individual cases, is not itself generalizable to 
the big picture. Call-in polls may yield some individual examples 
(e.g., some quotes) but they provide poor evidence of trends. <P> 

Compounding the problem is that call-in polls probably seem quite 
legitimate and representative to the public unless those who 
report these polls go out of their way to counteract that 
misperception. For example, the Research Industry Coalition 
recommends that the following disclaimer accompany the reports of 
call-in polls: "These 'polls' represent the opinions of only 
those people who have called or written in, and not the general 
public." <P> 

As the primary professional and scholarly association in public 
opinion research, AAPOR has developed an entire set of voluntary 
standards of good practice for conducting surveys -- standards 
which the organization is currently reviewing.<P> 

<LI>Since much of the evidence about journalists' encounters with 
statistics is itself anecdotal, we still have much to learn. 
Intelligence on the current state of the art is still quite 
tentative. We certainly need to get more systematic information, 
from the journalist's point of view, about their experiences with 
statistical information in the news (e.g., what are the most 
common or vexing problems they face when dealing with data?). We 
need to explore how journalism schools can do a better job 
of teaching statistical reasoning and the other intellectual 
software which should accompany the news-gathering power brought 
about by the newsroom computer. <P> 

There is no doubt, however, that the need to apply statistical 
reasoning to data and other forms of evidence can occur on just 
about any reporter's beat. Environmental reporters in particular 
play an increasingly important role as interpreters of 
complicated statistical and technical information to audiences, 
information which can help to enlighten debates over some of the 
most vexing public policy issues.</OL><P>

<H4><A NAME = "peer">Sidebar: Peer-Review Pitfalls: Learning from <EM>Time's</EM> Mistakes</A></H4>

By Robert J. Griffin<P>

Peer-review is the standard mechanism by which science strives to 
ensure the validity of research. A peer-reviewed study is one 
that has been examined for the scientific soundness of its 
methods and conclusions by an independent group of experts 
knowledgeable in those areas. Checking for appropriate 
peer-review is one way that reporters can reduce the likelihood of 
reporting poor research. <P> 

The "cyberporn" study upon which <EM>Time</EM> based a cover feature 
earlier this year was scheduled for publication in the <EM>Georgetown 
Law Review</EM> when <EM>Time</EM> was assembling its article. However, some 
critics later objected that the law review did not subject the 
study by Marty Rimm (who was an engineering undergrad at 
Carnegie-Mellon University when he conducted the study) to 
scrutiny by experts in social science methods. Law review 
journals, unlike scientific journals, typically are not peer-reviewed. 
In addition, the study's author made a pre-publication, 
"keep this under wraps" agreement with both <EM>Time</EM> and the law 
review. That agreement effectively prohibited both publications 
from conducting peer-review of the cyberporn study. That 
should have signalled to <EM>Time</EM> that something was amiss with 
the study itself. However, this agreement was not mentioned in 
the <EM>Time</EM> feature.<P> 

Although peer-reviewing helps to verify the legitimacy of 
scientific research, not all peer-review processes are equal. Studies reported at 
scholarly and scientific conventions have usually been 
peer-reviewed in some way, but this sort of review is not always as 
rigorous as that given to studies submitted for publication in 
refereed journals. <P> 

Reporters wanting help determining the soundness of a research 
study (including, for example, those conducted by 
their own news organizations) might consult 
university experts. Some have suggested that <EM>Time</EM> should have 
done just that.<P> 

<EM>Time</EM> later acknowledged some deficiencies with the reporting for 
its cyberporn feature. Elmer DeWitt, the author of the story, 
later published another <EM>Time</EM> article which included some 
discussion of the secrecy agreement. This article also discussed 
some "credibility problems" of Rimm's which surfaced after the 
feature was published -- although it was noted that Rimm failed 
to answer questions about his life during interviews (perhaps 
a warning about an undependable source that
DeWitt ignored).<P> 

In his second article, DeWitt stopped short of apologizing for a 
lack of "due dilligence" in his cyberporn reporting. Rather, he 
dodged this issue. "Some clearly believe that <EM>Time,</EM> by 
publicizing the Rimm study, was contributing to a mood of popular 
hysteria . . . that might lead to a crackdown," he wrote. "It 
would be a shame, however, if the damaging flaws in Rimm's study 
obscured the larger and more important debate about hardcore porn 
on the Internet," he wrote.<P>

<H4><A NAME="backlasher">Backlasher lashes out during Atlanta regional conference</A>
</H4>By Ken Edelstein<P>

Rep. Charles Taylor, R-N.C., let environmental journalists know 
exactly what he thought of them as he began a July 22 speech at 
SEJ's southeastern regional conference in Atlanta. <P> 

"You have the power to do something very positive," said Taylor, 
a leader in the environmental backlash now sweeping Washington. 
"You also have the power to continue to screw up, because most of 
what has been written is absolutely trash."<P> 

A steering committee of SEJ members focused the conference 
program on issues of particular concern in the South and on 
developing the skills of this region's environmental 
journalists.<P> 

The forums on skills included panels on covering company towns, 
getting news from state and regional agencies, and tapping into 
online resources such as the <EM>Green Disk Journal.</EM> Issue-oriented 
panels explored property rights, endangered species, suburban 
sprawl, and the region's proliferating water disputes.<P> 

This meeting -- SEJ's largest since the Republican sweep of 
congressional elections last November -- drilled home the point 
that today even the most local environmental controversies are 
tightly wound around the bitter struggle over environmental laws 
and funding in Washington.<P> 

A panel discussion on "Swamps, Species, and Property Rights," 
provided the sharpest exchanges. From Louisiana's bayous to 
Georgia's tree farms to the South Carolina coast (where a real 
estate developer named David Lucas won a Supreme Court case over 
his plans to develop his land), issues such as property rights, 
wetlands, and the Endangered Species Act have flashed across the 
region like lightning strikes in an old-growth forest.<P> 

When one questioner's request for "common ground" drew more 
disagreement, moderator Jay Bookman of the <EM>Atlanta Constitution</EM> 
quipped, "I didn't hear a lot.."<P> 

Lucas, now a leading property rights spokesman, sharpened the 
debate with the kind of populist one-liners that have helped 
gain publicity for his movement. He insisted that property 
advocates aren't aligned with big business and that they have no 
designs on destroying the nation's environmental laws.<P> 

"The only thing the property rights movement is interested in is 
protecting private property," he said. "... All of the sudden when 
I say I want just compensation, I'm being assailed as this devil 
(against) the environment."<P> 

Lucas said landowners face intimidating foes in overbearing 
agencies, because "people are still losing their property every 
day in this country."<P> 

"The federal government, the state governments, and the local 
governments own 67 percent of this country," he said. " ... They 
want to control it all. That's what the National Biological 
(Service) is about -- control of that land."<P> 

The Sierra Club's Sam Collier countered that facts and anecdotes 
paraded by the property rights movement often are exaggerated or 
wrong.<P> 

Dan Ashe, assistant director for external affairs at the U.S. 
Fish & Wildlife Service, said the Clinton administration has done 
"more than any administration has ever done before" to work with 
small property owners on incentive programs and exemptions to the 
Endangered Species Act. However, he argued that takings bills now 
before Congress would place a multibillion-dollar burden on the 
government to compensate landowners for speculative projects.<P> 

"Property is like everything else," Ashe said. "It comes with 
responsibility, and people have a responsibility to use the land 
wisely ... and conservation of wildlife is one of those things that 
we value in this society." <P> 

While the act should be flexible, it also should be tough, he 
argued, because it often provides nature's final stand.<P> 

Although Ashe and other administration officials (including 
Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator John 
Hankinson Jr. and Fish & Wildlife regional director Noreen 
Clough) were forced to ward off criticism from the right, the 
most blistering attack on the White House came from a former 
Clinton appointee.<P> 

Jim Baca, who was fired as director of the Bureau of Land 
Management, blasted President Clinton for giving in to Western 
senators on efforts to reduce subsidies for mining and grazing on 
public lands.<P> 

"You never get things done in Washington, if you need to fix 
them, through a policy of appeasement," Baca said. <P> 

Baca said he still doesn't understand why the administration 
agreed to the senators' demands. But he said the only way to 
change Congress' behavior would be through campaign finance 
reform, so that "dying" special interests, like foreign mining 
companies, would hold less sway in Washington.<P> 

Election victories and Clinton's cave-in emboldened Western 
fringe organizations to try to force their own land-use ideas and 
policies on the rest of the country, Baca said.<P> 

"What we ended up with was a lot of Wise Use groups really being 
able to push their way around, militia groups being able to push 
their way around in the Western states, and I have to say ... that 
after listening to Mr. Lucas here this afternoon, you've got the 
same problem out here," he said. (Lucas said earlier in the day 
that he knows nobody in the Wise Use movement.)<P> 

Baca, a former TV reporter, urged reporters to dig deeper and 
follow the money trail on land-use issues. Taylor, the North 
Carolina congressman, offered a far broader critique of the 
press.<P> 

The two-term Republican, who represents a mountainous district 
around Asheville, led this year's successful push to accelerate 
National Forest logging by allowing regulation-skirting timber 
salvages. A tree farmer himself, Taylor started his critique of 
environmental journalists even before he got the obligatory 
opening joke out of the way. Then, he explained why his briefcase 
was bulging.<P> 

"I have to travel with a lot of evidence," Taylor said, "because 
while you accept the environmental movement's words for gospel 
and print it over and over again, I have to prove it jot and 
tittle."<P> 

He argued that during the timber-salvage debate, reporters 
swallowed whole the arguments of environmentalists, who distorted 
biology or simply were ignorant. Taylor said his side has 
introduced "reality in science" to environmental debates.<P> 

When Randy Lee Loftis of the <EM>Dallas Morning News</EM> asked Taylor 
about the future of the National Biological Service, Taylor said, 
"I would classify it somewhat as dead because we took a lot of 
the money, and I think we'll probably take more of the money."<P> 

Taylor contended that this move wasn't part of an attempt to 
reduce scientific research. Rather, he said it was prompted by 
"bad blood" between conservatives and the service over 
biologists' attempts to survey on private property.<P> 

There was one hint at the conference of possible common ground 
between environmentalists and conservatives. Zoo Atlanta director 
Terry Maple, a noted conservationist, kicked off the meeting with 
a discussion of his friendship with House Speaker Newt Gingrich. 
<P> 

He's convinced Gingrich has a real interest in the environment, 
particularly in the Endangered Species Act. This high-level 
interest offers hope that Republicans will come up with their own 
sincere, market-oriented approaches to environmental protection, 
Maple said.<P> 

He also warned that environmentalists threaten their own agenda 
by siding consistently with Democrats.<P> 

The conference was co-sponsored by Emory University's Human and 
Natural Ecology Program, and also by CNN, Turner Broadcasting, 
the <EM>Atlanta Journal-Constitution,</EM> the <EM>News & Observer</EM> of Raleigh, 
and the New York Times Newspaper Group. CNN's Peter Dykstra 
chaired the meeting.<P>

<H4><A NAME="directory">Directory of environmental journalists being compiled by recently formed IFEJ
</A>
</H4>By Jim Detjen

<P>

The International Federation of Environmental Journalists (IFEJ) 
is creating an international directory of environmental 
journalists to link together reporters, writers, producers, and 
educators from around the world.<P> 

SEJ members who are interested in being listed in this directory 
should fill out the <A HREF="ifej_dir.htm">directory form</A>                                                                                            
and fax or mail it back to IFEJ's North 
American office at Michigan State University. Please make sure 
that you also list what languages you can speak and read.<P> 

Anyone listed in the directory will be able to obtain a copy when 
it is compiled. This directory will be sent to you for either a 
small fee or possibly for free, if sufficient funds can be raised 
to print it and to distribute it. <P> 

The hope is that the IFEJ directory will be of value in much the 
way that SEJ's membership directory helps SEJ members. If you are 
working on a story about Brazilian rainforests and need 
assistance, you could check the IFEJ directory for environmental 
journalists in Brazil. Once you've identified the journalist you 
can send a list of questions to the Brazilian reporter by e-mail, 
fax, or a letter. Or you could call up the journalist directly by 
telephone.<P> 

Similarly, if you are traveling overseas the IFEJ directory will 
give you a list of contacts in the countries you are visiting. 
Since they are also environmental journalists, the likelihood is 
great that they will be willing to assist you, if they possibly 
can.<P> 

The IFEJ directory also will list the areas of specialty of 
environmental journalists so that if you are interested in 
finding journalists who specialize in ocean pollution or fishing 
issues, you should be able to do so. <P> 

The IFEJ directory is being compiled by my assistant Barb Miller, 
and Melinda Arbaugh (a senior journalism major at Michigan State 
University). Our hope is that a rough draft may be available 
before the end of this year, so it's important that you mail or 
fax the enclosed form as soon as possible.<P> 

If you need extra copies of the <A HREF="ifej_dir.htm">directory form,</A> simply make a 
copy and use it. Or, if you need many extra copies, call Barb or 
Melinda at (517) 432-1415. <P> 

The costs of creating this directory are being partially 
underwritten by Michigan State University, the Knight Foundation 
and the United Nations Environment Programme.<P>

<H4><A NAME="pressures">Pressures on business transcend regs</A></H4>

By Scott Fenn<P>

Recent news coverage of business and the environment is replete 
with stories about the assault on environmental regulation 
underway in Congress and the efforts of some within the business 
community to weaken environmental laws. <P> 

However, an interesting recent phenomenon calls into question the 
notion that environmental pressures on business are easing -- 
namely, growing private-sector and non-governmental pressures to 
improve environmental performance. Whether these forces can 
replace regulation as a mechanism for enforcing environmental 
accountability remains to be seen, but they are already 
influencing corporate behavior.<P> 

Enforcement activity by the EPA, the Department of Justice, and 
state regulators has been tightening since the Bush 
administration. Whether it will continue to do so is uncertain. 
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, for instance, recently blasted the 
EPA, saying it "may well be the biggest job-killing agency in the 
inner city in America today."<P> 

At the same time, however, the bipartisan U.S. Sentencing 
Commission has proposed new guidelines for environmental 
violations that include both stiffer penalties and a list of 
environmental management elements which will be used to determine 
penalties. Fines can be reduced if managers measure and monitor 
compliance; implement auditing, reporting, and tracking systems; 
and develop incentive programs for environmental excellence and 
processes for evaluating and improving performance.<P> 

Companies also face mounting pressure to improve environmental 
performance from shareholders and customers. During 1995's 
annual-meeting season, investors in 22 companies voted on 
shareholder proposals related to improving environmental 
performance and reporting. At a number of these companies, 
shareholder proposals requested companies to endorse a 10-point 
environmental code of conduct known as the CERES principles 
(CERES stands for the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible 
Economies). <P> 

The CERES effort, which is sponsored by a coalition of 
environment, religious and investment institutions, gained 
momentum over the last two years with the endorsement of its 
principles by several Fortune 500 companies (including Sun Co., 
General Motors Corp., Polaroid, Arizona Public Service Co., and 
H.B. Fuller).<P> 

Similarly, some institutional shareholders which supply capital 
for U.S. industry are displaying growing interest in corporate 
environmental performance. Several major financial institutions, 
including TIAA-CREF (the country's largest private pension fund 
with more than $120 billion in assets under management), have 
started investment funds which use environmental performance 
data, among other factors, as a criteria for selecting stocks. A 
survey by the Investor Responsibility Research Center of 
investment managers who use social criteria to screen portfolios 
found that the environment has become the single largest area of 
concern.<P> 

While most public institutions show no desire to see the 
environment become a political cause celebre, as disinvestment in 
South Africa became in the 1980s, some action is beginning to 
occur. In 1992, Dartmouth College divested its bond holdings in 
Hydro-Quebec, a major Canadian electric utility, following 
student protests and a petition drive on campus criticizing the 
environmental and social impacts of the utility's Great Whale 
hydroelectric project on native lands in northern Quebec. Tufts 
University and Williams College followed suit in 1994, each after 
enduring student pressure to divest for almost two years. 
Notably, the Quebec provincial government announced in late 1994 
that the project was being put "on ice for a good long while."<P> 

Even institutions with little interest in the social aspects of 
environmental performance are starting to pay attention to the 
issue for financial reasons. A survey published by the accounting 
firm Price Waterhouse in 1993 found that only 62 percent of 
companies with known environmental liabilities had reported them 
in their financial statements. Driven by concerns about such 
non-disclosure, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial 
Accounting Standards Board, and the American Institute of 
Certified Public Accountants have issued new rules requiring 
companies to disclose more detailed cost estimates for waste site 
cleanups and other environmental liabilities. Corporate 
liabilities for the cleanup of abandoned Superfund hazardous 
waste sites alone are estimated to range from $42 billion to $120 
billion in present-worth dollars, according to the Congressional 
Budget Office.<P> 

Procurement regulations are yet another new source of pressure on 
companies to improve environmental management. Many federal 
contracts now contain clauses requiring contractors to 
investigate and monitor the environmental performance of 
subcontractors and vendors. Some companies have also adopted 
procurement programs designed to favor environmentally sound 
suppliers. AT&T was a leader in this area. Its Policy for 
Environmental Protection instructs employees to "include 
environmental considerations among the criteria by which 
projects, products, processes, and purchases are made." Many 
other large manufacturers have followed suit and are developing 
criteria for selecting environmentally responsible suppliers and 
standards to which they must adhere.<P> 

Perhaps the greatest pressure on companies to improve future 
environmental performance comes not from any external pressure, 
however, but rather from straightforward economics -- it is often 
cheaper to prevent pollution at the source rather than clean it 
up at the end of the pipe -- and then litigate with victims of 
environmental hazards. <P> 

The 3M Corporation, which initiated its Pollution Prevention Pays 
(3P) program in 1975, claims this program has saved a whopping 
$646 million over the last 18 years. Corporations increasingly 
are turning to such voluntary measures as a way to leapfrog ahead 
of government regulations which focus on pollution problems at 
the back end of the product cycle.<P> 

Do all these pressures insure that business activity is becoming 
ecologically sustainable? Well, not exactly. In fact, a strong 
case can be made that the world economy is less sustainable 
today, from a purely ecological perspective, than at any point in 
human history. Many critical global ecological indicators -- 
including worldwide emissions of sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon 
from the burning of fossil fuels -- are still heading in the 
wrong direction. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and 
chlorine are rising, and tropical deforestation and species 
extinction also are continuing rapidly.<P> 

The environmental challenges to corporations and policy makers 
remain daunting. The business community's initial steps to treat 
pollution as an economic variable to be measured and managed are 
necessary, but not sufficient, to the task of achieving a 
sustainable world economy. Corporations must now move to close 
the loop in their production processes and product lifecycles, 
forming consortiums to turn wastes and used products into 
production inputs. <P> 

They also must integrate a much broader set of ecological 
indicators and goals (ranging from energy and water consumption 
to the impacts of their operations on biodiversity and the 
atmosphere) into business planning and corporate assessments of 
environmental performance. Meanwhile, investors -- whether in the 
private sector, at public institutions, or in multilateral 
lending institutions -- can play an important role by considering 
environmental sustainability as one criteria in selecting the 
projects and companies which they finance.<P>

<H4><A NAME="aejmc">AEJMC panel calls for myth busters
</A>
</H4>By John Palen

<P>

Journalists' obligation to separate myths from facts was a 
persistent theme in an environmental reporting panel at the 
annual convention of the Association for Education in Journalism 
and Mass Communication, held in Washington in mid-August.<P> 

Much criticism of environmental regulation, for example, is 
misdirected at an U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that has 
moved off in new directions, according to EPA deputy associate 
administrator Denise Graveline, who is responsible for 
communication, education and public affairs with the EPA in 
Washington, D.C. <P> 

Environmental journalists have a role to play as "myth busters" 
in helping improve public understanding of the situation, she 
said.<P> 

Formed in 1970 at a time of crisis, the EPA made incredible  
progress, but was already moving away from a crisis mode when 
the elections of 1994 turned Congress on its ear, according to 
Graveline.<P> 

In the upheaval in Congress, some criticism of EPA doesn't take 
into account the changes in the agency, and journalists need to 
check facts and know sources to avoid being manipulated, she 
said.<P> 

The old EPA was built to deal with crisis, using a "command-and-control 
approach to administer drastic, expensive solutions to 
extreme problems," Graveline said. She cited statistics showing that a quarter century later, 
chemical emissions are down 90 percent, and sewage and 
carcinogens have been cleaned up. The new EPA stresses 
prevention and a single rule for every industry rather than 
separate regulations for air, land and water, she said.<P> 

Graveline spoke at a panel on "Ferment and the 
Future: Where is Environmental Journalism Heading?"<P> 

Other speakers were Kevin Carmody, environmental reporter for the 
<EM>Daily Southtown</EM> in Chicago and an SEJ board member; Carolyn 
Cline, faculty member at University of Southern California; James 
Detjen, Knight Chair of Environmental Journalism at Michigan 
State University; and Sharon Friedman, media coordinator of the 
National Campaign for Pesticide Policy Reform in Washington, and professor and
chairperson of the Department of Journalism and Communication at Lehigh University
in Pennsylvania.<P> 

The panel was sponsored by the Science Communication Interest 
Group and moderated by Sharon M. Friedman of Lehigh 
University.<P> 

Carmody cautioned that attacks on environmentalism are a current 
fad just as blindly pro-environment pieces were common a few 
years ago, but that anecdotes are promoted by anti-environment 
groups are taking on a new and troubling role.<P> 

Anecdotes which are supposed to illustrate the truth too often 
are being used by reporters as the arbiters of truth, he said. If 
a tale fits the current conventional wisdom, few reporters seem 
to go to the trouble of checking its accuracy.<P> 

"Hammer on the difference between fact, assumption and opinion," 
Carmody urged journalism educators. "Attribution makes a big 
difference. Who says it, is important."<P> 

Friedman said a media trend to make every story hang on conflict 
leads to "formulaic reporting" of extreme positions. "There are 
crazy people on both sides," she warned.<P> 

Public relations people are as guilty as reporters, she said, 
because they often use a polarized, good-guys-vs.-bad-guys 
approach to gain a purchase on a  controversy.<P> 

Coverage of Alar has been mythicized as an example of 
irresponsible environmental reporting, she said. However, the 
National Academy of Science agreed that Alar was a cumulatively 
dangerous chemical, and industry subsequently removed it from the market.<P> 

"We need 'responsible spinning' by public relations people," she 
said.<P> 

Detjen presented findings of a Times Mirror survey of public 
views on environmental issues and journalism. In an age of lost 
faith in large institutions, including mass media, environmental 
journalism gets barely a passing grade, he said. Nearly 80 
percent rated coverage only fair or poor.<P> 

More than a third of the 1,003 adults surveyed said reporters 
make environmental problems appear worse than they are, while  
younger readers think the media paint too rosy a picture.<P> 

"Overwhelmingly, the public wants more coverage," Detjen 
reported. His hunch is that the amount of environmental coverage 
will continue to increase.<P> 

As it increases, more and more of it relies on cyberspace as a 
source of information, yet the Internet is a "library with all 
the books on the floor," said Cline. One way to end the confusion 
would be to establish a central administration for the Internet, 
but Cline rejected that idea.<P> 

Instead, she said, computer scientists should devise better ways 
of managing information. "A meta-state, multi-disciplinary group should be 
formed and seek funding for an ongoing effort to keep 
information sites updated and get useful listings online," she said.<P> 

The panel was one of two environmental sessions sponsored by the

<H4><A NAME="farm">Farm bill's environmental side often overlooked by reporters</A></H4>

By Duncan Murrell

<P>

The committee room was full of those swaggering, corn-fed 
reporters who always show up for fetes with the House Agriculture 
Committee chairman, rattling off acronyms and slang that Farm 
Bill cognoscenti use to confuse and confound the rest of us every 
five years.<P> 

Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., (Mr. Chairman, the Big Cheese, El Patron 
de Agricultura), rubbed his shiny head, shrugged, and seemed to 
look straight at me: "We've got no problem educating folks from 
the west, midwest, and the south about the Farm Bill," he sighed, 
"but those Northeast folks... well, let's just say they need a 
lot of work." Throaty heartland guffaws from everyone but me.<P> 

Guilty, I thought. Guilty of growing up in the Northeast. Guilty 
of covering the Farm Bill for the <EM>Great Falls</EM> (Mont.) <EM>Tribune</EM> on 
a sink-or-swim basis. Guilty of not knowing the difference 
between a sodbuster and a ghostbuster. A long summer stretched 
before me ...<P> 

In 1990, the last time the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and 
Trade Act (that's the Farm Bill to the rest of us) was 
authorized, it was the single largest piece of legislation ever 
to pass out of Congress. A daunting study in turgidity, I thought 
-- until I noticed that one word in the title: "conservation." 
Now that was something I could handle.<P> 

By my count, nine of the 25 sections of the Farm Bill deal in 
varying degrees with environmental issues. Some, like the feed 
grain title, deal with loans, payments, and acreage reduction 
programs for grain crops -- each with indirect but significant 
effects on soil and wetland conservation. Other titles address 
forest preservation and stewardship, water quality research, 
farmland protection, pesticides, and sustainable agriculture.<P> 

The part most often considered "environmental," Title XIV, pulls 
together some of the most far-reaching and popular environmental 
programs authorized by Congress.<P> 

The Conservation Reserve Program, one part of Title XIV, pays 
farmers up to $50,000 per year for 10 years to stop growing crops 
on highly erodible land or land which contributes to water 
quality problems. Nationwide, more than 375,000 farmers have 
signed up for the program since 1985, enrolling about 36 million 
acres and pulling in a total of almost $20 billion.<P> 

That's a chunk of land about 17 times the size of Yellowstone 
National Park, or roughly the size of Illinois.<P> 

The Wetlands Reserve Program, another Title XIV program, was 
established to pay farmers up to $50,000 per year for 10 years to 
create a wetlands restoration program for a million acres of farm 
land. The Agricultural Water Quality Protection Program gives 
incentives to farmers to establish water quality programs on 
their land, with a goal of protecting 10 million acres 
nationwide. The Agricultural Conservation Program gives farmers a 
cost-sharing incentive to carry out conservation and 
environmental protection practices on their land. And on and 
on ...<P> 

Despite its obvious environmental impacts, the Farm Bill often is 
overlooked by news organizations. Often farm stories are all shot 
over to the agriculture reporter -- who is already drowning in 
the minutiae of deficiency payments, marketing loan programs, and 
export policy, not to mention covering local crop yields and the 
yearly 4-H show.<P> 

A quick survey of environmental news stories collected from 150 
news sources by the daily environmental news service <EM>Greenwire</EM> 
showed that only 22 environmental stories published since Jan. 1 
mentioned the Farm Bill. In contrast, 121 stories mentioned the 
Clean Water Act and 166 mentioned the Endangered Species Act.<P> 

What's more, said Clark Williams of the Washington-based 
Environmental Working Group, stories which deal with the 
environment and the Farm Bill routinely ignore the less-obvious 
but equally important environmental effects of farm programs.<P> 

"When environmental reporters have done such stories, they've 
focused on the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and the 
Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP), rather than on commodity price 
programs, loan rates, and other Farm Bill programs which control 
the amount of land farmers put in production," Williams said.<P> 

There have been times, including the mid-1970s, when the 
government has sent clear signals to "produce, produce, produce, 
by raising loan rates and other things," said Williams, "leading 
to what was clearly a massive conversion of wetlands and highly 
erodible land into farm land."<P> 

If environmental reporters are to give the Farm Bill more than a 
once-over, they'll have to learn to be comfortable with the 
alphabet soup of bedrock farm programs like the EEP (Export 
Enhancement Program), the MPP (the Market Promotion Program), 
deficiency payments, flex acres, base acreages, and crop 
insurance. Oh, my.<P> 

"We know it's hard for reporters trained in environmental issues 
to get their hand on the Farm Bill," Williams said. "But we need 
more open, public debate on these programs. We need to see if we 
can find a better way of redirecting even more farm money into 
conservation."<P> 

Regardless of whether you agree with Williams, keep this in mind: 
in the downsizing, cost-cutting and privatizing spirit that has 
swept Congress since Nov. 8, proposals to convert environmental 
programs like the Endangered Species Act from regulation-based to 
incentive-based plans have begun to float around Washington. Like 
the incentive-based programs at the heart of the Farm Bill, such 
measures rely on the good intentions of landowners. Can we trust 
'em?<P> 

"Farmers are pretty good conservationists, if not the best. They 
don't like to see their land blowing all over the place," said 
Norman Sullivan, president of the Montana Farmer's Union. "We as 
an organization are in favor of any type of conservation that is 
good for the country."<P> 

Perhaps. But talking to farmers in Montana and elsewhere gives 
the impression that they'd just as soon keep that annual $1.8 
billion CRP payment rolling in.<P> 

"The economics are the most important part of the popularity of 
programs like the CRP," Sullivan said. "If it came down to a 
choice between keeping the commodity price supports or keeping 
the conservation programs, our membership would most likely vote 
for the commodity supports. It's their livelihood."<P>

<H4><A NAME="report">Report from the society's president: Strike sparks thoughts on 
journalism
</A>
</H4>By Emilia Askari

<P>

There's nothing like an old-fashioned newspaper strike to shake 
up an ink-stained environment reporter like me. One day, I was 
scrambling to write a masterpiece on nuclear waste. The next, I 
was packing up my Rolodex and walking away from my desk at the 
<EM>Detroit Free Press.</EM> My last glimpse of the building was from the 
middle of a crowd of thousands of angry Teamsters. Jimmy Hoffa 
Jr. was rasping into a megaphone, leading a chorus of union 
chants. A large truck driver peered down on me as I stood quietly 
listening to the people shouting around me. "I guess they didn't 
teach you the words in journalism school," he said.<P> 

No, they didn't.<P> 

In the months since mid-July, when six unions struck <EM>The Detroit 
News</EM> and <EM>Free Press,</EM> I have had some time to think about this 
profession we all have chosen. Despite the pain and disruption of 
this strike, I have not considered permanently seeking another 
career. On the contrary, I have concluded that as environmental 
journalists, we are doubly blessed.<P> 

The end of the 20th Century is unquestionably the age of 
information. With our fellow reporters and editors we are the 
gatherers, shapers and interpreters of the most important 
commodity of our time.<P> 

As environmental journalists, we have the added pleasure of 
specializing in some of the most interesting, complicated and 
explosive issues of the day.<P> 

My parents are of the World War II generation. They grew up in a 
time when technology was king and industrial growth was always 
considered to be a good thing. This growth was accomplished with 
little thought to impacts on the environment.<P> 

That time has passed. Assessing, containing and reducing the 
environmental impact of "progress" is now a billion dollar 
business. The effort touches every American  --  in factories, in 
schools, in offices and at home (where within the past five 
years, curbside recycling has become common practice).<P> 

As developing countries build economies more similar to ours, 
environmental issues can only become more important and 
contentious. That is why, during this strike, I have not followed 
some of my <EM>Free Press</EM> colleagues into temporary waitressing jobs. 
Instead, I have decided to practice my trade from home, 
freelancing environment news.<P> 

I am heartened by the results of a recent national survey by 
Roper-Starch. It found that 52 percent of the American public 
wants to hear more news of the environment. Only eight percent 
wants less. The demand for environmental news is particularly 
high among people 18 to 34, the survey showed. More than six in 10 
people in Generation X want the media to tell them more about 
environmental issues.<P> 

Our challenge as environmental journalists is to convince power 
brokers in our newsrooms to allocate precious time and space to 
trend-oriented environment news. One of SEJ's goals is to lead 
this campaign.<P> 

To that end, the first story I wrote after going on strike was 
for <EM>The American Editor,</EM> a publication of the American Society of 
Newspaper Editors. The article recaps recent poll results and 
quotes several newspaper marketing consultants, including Tim 
Holbein of the Dallas-based firm Belden and Associates. 
Environment news, he says, "warrants consistent, daily attention. 
It's where subjects like health, medicine and nutrition were 10, 
15 years ago."<P> 

Since then, many news organizations have added regular features 
on those topics. Others simply are devoting more attention to 
them.<P> 

Expect more poll results  --  and potential ammunition in the 
battle for more and better quality environment news  --  at the 
SEJ national conference during the last weekend in October in 
Cambridge, Massachusetts. As I look to the future, trying to 
picture the job of an environmental journalist 30 years from now, 
I realize how important such conferences are. They give us not 
only insights into a wide range of topics we are covering, not 
just access to top experts in many fields, but also a chance to 
learn how our colleagues in different media approach the same 
material.<P> 

I am certain that by the time I am nearing the end of my career, 
many professional journalists will not be pigeon-holed as print 
journalists or broadcast journalists. We will all have to know 
something about simultaneously using writtten and spoken words, 
sounds, images and computer technology to get our points across.<P> 

In the near future, those of us in the newspaper end of the 
business face especially tough times with a shrinking job market 
and ever-decreasing space in which to tell our stories. Still, I 
would not choose to be anything other than an environmental 
journalist.<P> 

Thanks to all of you who have shown support by calling or writing 
to me during the strike. Special thanks as well to the following 
funders who have generously given SEJ grants or other support 
since the last edition of the <EM>SEJournal:</EM><STRONG> The Charles Stewart Mott 
Foundation,</STRONG> for a new two-year challenge grant totalling 
$100,000; <STRONG>The Turner Family Foundation,</STRONG> for a $20,000 grant; the 
<STRONG>Henry P. Kendall Foundation</STRONG> for a $5,000 grant in support of the 
1995 national conference; the <STRONG>Bureau of National Affairs, Inc. </STRONG>
for a $2,500 conference grant; and the <STRONG>Swan Fund for the 
Environment</STRONG> for a $2500 conference grant.<P> 

Until I return to my desk at the <EM>Detroit Free Press,</EM> you can 
reach me via the internet at <A HREF="mailto:EmiliaA@aol.com">EmiliaA@aol.com</A> or through the SEJ 
office. <P>

If you noticed environmental coverage slacking off this summer, 
there's a darn good reason. For two weeks, <STRONG>Frank Allen,</STRONG> dean of 
the University of Montana School of Journalism had 16 of the 
nation's enviro reporters tooling around Montana. The High 
Country Institute literally was "a moving institute," according 
to Allen. The first session was conducted on a bus -- stops 
included an experimental forest and a working ranch. Allen says 
he wanted his students to learn more about the economics and 
science of western issues.<P> 

"It put a face on the people and the landscape of something I 
cover from my desk" reported <STRONG>Peter Thomson,</STRONG> producer of the 
National Public Radio program, <EM>Living On Earth</EM> and one of Allen's 
16 fellows. <STRONG>Rocky Barker</STRONG> of the <EM>Post-Register</EM> in Idaho Falls 
echoed those sentiments and added that "the power of this session 
was bringing together colleagues." <STRONG>Jennifer Schmidt</STRONG> of KPLU-FM in 
Tacoma, Washington was glad to be out from behind her desk. She 
said the Institute was hard work, but admitted to some relaxing 
nights in the hot tub.<P> 

The other graduates of the Institute's kickoff season were: 
<STRONG>William Allen,</STRONG> <EM>St. Louis Post-Dispatch;</EM> <STRONG>Teresa Bell,</STRONG> KPAX-TV in 
Missoula, Montana; <STRONG>Jonathan Brinckman,</STRONG> <EM>Idaho Statesman;</EM> <STRONG>Frank 
Clifford,</STRONG> <EM>Los Angeles Times;</EM> <STRONG>Linda Kanamine,</STRONG> <EM>USA Today;</EM> <STRONG>Woodrow 
Kipp,</STRONG> <EM>The Missoula</EM> (Montana) <EM>Independent;</EM> <STRONG>Joan Laatz,</STRONG> <EM>The 
Oregonian;</EM> <STRONG>Betsy Marston,</STRONG> <EM>High Country News;</EM> <STRONG>Scott McMillion,</STRONG> 
<EM>Bozeman</EM> (Montana) <EM>Daily Chronicle;</EM> <STRONG>Tom Meersman,</STRONG> <EM>Minneapolis 
Star-Tribune;</EM> <STRONG>Jim Morris,</STRONG> CNN; <STRONG>Natalie Pawelski,</STRONG> CNN; <STRONG>Nancy 
Vogel,</STRONG> <EM>The Sacramento</EM> (California) <EM>Bee.</EM><P> 

The role of a reporter is to learn and then pass on that 
information to others. Teaching is "reporting in another form" 
says <STRONG>Deborah Potter,</STRONG> who has joined the staff of the Poynter 
Institute in St. Petersburg, Florida. Potter, who spent last year 
teaching journalism at the American University in Washington, 
D.C., has 22 years of journalism experience to draw on for her 
classes. The veteran CNN reporter already has taught reporting, 
producing, ethics, and investigative techniques. <P> 

<EM>Greenwire,</EM> the on-line news service, has a new editor. The 
publishers predict <STRONG>Catherine Cooney</STRONG> will be a "steadying hand" at 
the daily electronic periodical. Cooney has almost a decade of 
experience on the environment in Washington, D.C. Her most recent 
post was as managing editor of <EM>Environment Today.</EM><P> 

<STRONG>Whitman Bassow</STRONG> has added a line to his already impressive CV. He 
is a new columnist for <EM>Tomorrow,</EM> the Swedish quarterly covering 
global environment management issues and business. Bassow's 
career in international environmental affairs spans more than two 
decades. He covered Moscow and Paris for <EM>Newsweek</EM> and UPI. In 
fact, budding foreign journalists should read his book, <EM>The 
Moscow Correspondents.</EM> It is a fascinating history of Western 
reporters in the Soviet Union. In honor of his achievements as a 
journalist, the Overseas Press Club in 1993 added a new category 
to its awards: The Whitman Bassow Award for Best Reporting on 
Environmental Issues. <P> 

"I'd had it with New York." Those simple and direct words 
describe the main reason <STRONG>Catherine Dold</STRONG> packed her bags and 
headed west to Boulder, Colorado. The move brings the full time 
freelancer closer to the wild flora and fauna she enjoys writing 
about for clients including <EM>Audubon</EM> magazine and the <EM>New York 
Times.</EM> Editors, don't fret if she doesn't return your calls right 
away. Most likely she's out hiking, perhaps with (SEJ board 
member) Amy Gahran, also a new Boulder resident.<P> 

For now, anchor/reporter <STRONG>David DeWitt</STRONG> works a general assignment 
beat for WUTR-TV in Uttica, New York. He came east from Salinas, 
California, but soon heads west again. Next year, he'll be at a 
new station in Green Bay, Wisconsin. <P> 

<STRONG>Rich Santalesa</STRONG> has moved on to take the Executive Editor office 
at <EM>NetGuide,</EM> a monthly magazine published in print as well as on 
the Internet. The environment is very much a part of <EM>NetGuide's</EM>
fare. The magazine's <A HREF="http://techweb.cmo.com/ng/current">web site</A> contains a roundup of 
environmental information resources. Rich is interested in 
hearing from SEJ members who know where good environmental 
information can be found online. E-mail him at <A HREF="mailto:rsantale@cmp.com">rsantale@cmp.com</A> 
to pass on your tips. <P> 

An awards addendum: <STRONG>National Public Radio's <EM>Living On Earth</EM></STRONG> took 
two awards since the last issue of the <EM>SEJournal.</EM> Reporter <STRONG>Bob 
Carty</STRONG> won an Edward R. Murrow Award for his news documentary "Who 
Owns Life?" about the patenting of human genes. As a series, 
<EM>Living On Earth</EM> was also a New York Radio Festival finalist in 
the environmental information category. The top award, a silver 
medal, went to <STRONG>Nancy Wilson</STRONG> of N.W. Bell, Inc. for "Big Blue 
Planet: Wetlands History/Egrets/ Wolves/Owls." No gold was 
given.<P> 

Finally (and he admits being a little embarassed at appearing in 
this space once again) <STRONG>Scott Bronstein</STRONG> is heading back to France 
as an associate producer in CBS' Sixty Minutes Paris bureau. 
Covering Europe, Asia, and Africa, Bronstein will report and 
field produce for veteran correspondent Mike Wallace. The job 
offer was "a total shocker" to Bronstein, who was happily 
settling in at CNN. "It reaffirms my idea that you never know 
when the seeds you sow will sprout," says Bronstein who met his 
future boss last year while on a fellowship. Bronstein sighs 
happily. "It's been a long-term dream of mine to work overseas. I 
always wanted to live in Paris." Bonne chance, Scott.<P>

<H4><A NAME="access">Access: Rifling the NRC's online database</A></H4>

By Dave Davis

<P>

Imagine having unlimited access to the file cabinets of the U.S. 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Imagine having the ability to 
peruse millions of documents kept in offices across the country 
-- everything from technical reports, to Congressional testimony, 
to licensee violation notices -- all without a bureaucrat 
standing over your shoulder.<P> 

That's exactly what you'll get if you get connected to NUDOCS, 
the NRC's online database of nearly 3 million records dating to 
1978. NUDOCS is agency lingo for Nuclear Document System.<P> 

This searchable database is an invaluable source of information 
for reporters who cover the environment, or who occasionally 
write about hospitals, universities, nuclear power, radioactive 
waste, or other related topics. <P> 

Within about a week of issuing inspection reports, technical 
studies, fines, and conducting special investigations, NRC 
officials have the information summarized and entered on the 
NUDOCS system. NUDOCS also is an excellent source for 
correspondence, reports, and  records generated by other federal 
and state agencies, as well as outsiders such as environmental 
groups, concerned citizens, and reporters.<P> 

For example, a search for records which mention "Ohio" brings up 
2,010 hits. Plug "death" or "killed" into the NUDOCS search menu 
and 426 records appear. NUDOCS has 10,141 records generated by 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 46 by the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation, and 19 by Vice President Al Gore.<P> 

I am listed as the author of 21 documents, all Freedom of 
Information Act requests. This may sound inconsequential. But if 
my FOIA happens to hit on something that interests you, you can 
get copies of everything I got by calling the NRC's Public 
Document Room (PDR) (202-634-3273) and giving them the FOIA 
response number listed in NUDOCS.<P> 

It was in this way that I happened across the worst-known 
radiation accident in medicine, the overexposure of hundreds 
patients undergoing cancer treatment at Riverside Methodist 
Hospitals in Columbus, Ohio, in the mid-1970s.<P> 

I had heard about the incident, caused when a hospital 
technologist used the wrong type of graph paper in calculating 
patient exposure times to a cobalt source, but I couldn't get any 
details about victims. NRC officials said they weren't sure who, 
or even how many, people died as a result of the mistake.<P> 

Then I came across a FOIA in NUDOCS. It was filed by a lawyer who 
represented an 11-year-old boy who had died from the radiation 
overdose. Among other things, he requested medical reports and 
autopsies for others known to have died.<P> 

The letter was dated 1978. I called the PDR, and, to my surprise, 
they had the hundreds of pages of records that were sent to the 
lawyer in response to his FOIA. In a series of stories that 
followed, we published the names of all 40 people known to have 
died in the Riverside mishap, along with interviews with families 
members who said they had been kept in the dark about what 
happened.<P> 

We've also used NUDOCS to track radioactive contamination in the 
nation's sewage treatment systems and the multi-million-dollar 
cleanups which follow. We've also used the system for daily 
stories, mostly about the Perry and Davis-Bessie nuclear power 
plants.<P> 

Because NUDOCS offers only summaries of documents -- ranging from 
a few sentences to dozens of pages in length -- it must be used 
in conjunction with the NRC's PDR, which holds the actual 
records. With the document accession number retrieved from 
NUDOCS, you can call the PDR and get the records by fax or by 
mail. The cost is just a few cents a page.<P>

By David Poulson

<P>

The woman was frustrated, angry, and obviously not buying the 
point I was making as a speaker at a retreat for the Michigan 
chapter of the Sierra Club.<P> 

"I don't care," she said, after I explained that the environment 
is getting less coverage due to shrinking newshole and a 
perception that it is lower on the public agenda than in the 
past.<P> 

"You are not giving me what I want as a reader," she insisted. The 
group quickly agreed.<P> 

I left feeling more than a little guilty about their gripe. But 
that experience and a series of lucky opportunities have led to 
an experiment on the Internet with tremendous potential for 
specialty reporting.<P> 

I cover the environment for a state capital bureau serving eight 
Michigan dailies owned by Booth Newspapers, a division of the 
Newhouse Newspaper Group.<P> 

Last March we launched the <A HREF="http://www.great-lakes.net/~glew">Great 
Lakes Environmental Wire (GLEW)</A>, 
an Internet publication that is, in my opinion, the single 
greatest source of Great Lakes environmental news and 
opinions.<P> 

The stories come from our eight papers, and our bureaus in 
Washington, Detroit, and Lansing.<P> 

These stories get decent play in the papers which generate them. 
But they may be considered too local or too special interest-oriented 
to get much play (or any play) elsewhere. Yet they are 
of profound interest to people concerned about the Great Lakes 
environment who are scattered across the region and the country. <P>

GLEW creates special reports which stitch together news 
stories, opinion columns, and other information on the Internet. 
Recently we covered the reorganization of Michigan's Department 
of Natural Resources with a news story, an analysis, two opinion 
columns, five editorials, and the actual executive orders which 
created a new agency.<P> 

A searchable archive quickly provides background on many 
environmental issues. Great Lakes policymakers who may get spotty 
coverage in general-interest newspapers are given electronic 
column space. We hope to soon provide forums for readers to 
discuss the issues they raise. <P> 

GLEW's greatest value is its use as a front door for the Great 
Lakes Information Network, a virtual crossroads of information 
provided by U.S., Canadian, and state governments, as well as by 
academic, environmental, and industrial organizations. <P> 

This network increases tremendously the value of stories which 
our newspapers already have produced. <P> 

For instance, the <EM>Muskegon Chronicle</EM> recently ran a story about 
the ruffe, a non-native fish which threatens the Great Lakes 
perch fishery with its voracious appetite. By tapping GLEW's 
other resources, this story was linked to a map of the ruffe's 
spread, strategies to control it, a scientific assessment of the 
threat, and an image of the fish. Each of these "cyber-sidebars" 
required more space than a general-interest newspaper would have 
been able to give to this issue. <P> 

Instead of becoming yesterday's fishwrap, the story will always 
be in our archive for anyone searching for information about the 
ruffe, or exotic species in general.<P> 

I am a different reporter now. I have to be aware of potential 
Internet links on my beat. I urge information providers to get 
their stuff online on the chance that someday I might want to 
read or link to it.<P> 

There are hurdles. I worry about overwhelming readers with too 
much information, too many choices. And there is a very real 
concern about creating revenue to support such a service. 
Currently, we don't charge users or support advertising.<P> 

But any reporter who has had a story killed or chopped (because 
of space constraints or its lack of widespread appeal) can't help 
but get excited about this stuff.<P> 

The cyberspace newshole is limitless.<P>

<H4><A NAME="green">The Green Right: <EM>"The Making of A Conservative Environmentalist"</EM></A></H4>

By Gordon Durnil
<BR>
Indiana University Press
<P>
<EM>Reviewed by George Homsy</EM>

<P>

Republicans always have been well-represented in the 
environmental movement. Some very strong conservationists in 
Congress today are members of America's conservative party. They 
usually believe smaller government is better, but often have no 
qualms backing strict environmental laws and regulations. <P> 

Gordon Durnil is trying to set a different course. In his book, 
<EM>The Making of A Conservative Environmentalist,</EM> Durnil tries to 
sketch out a framework for conservative environmental activism. 
The author, a leader of the Republican Party in Indiana, is 
pushing an agenda of education and cooperation over legislation 
and regulation. <P> 

Durnil, who served during the Bush Administration as U.S. 
Chairman of the International Joint Commission (IJC), uses the 
cleanup efforts of the Great Lakes as an example of what's wrong 
with environmental regulation, environmental groups, and 
especially industrial lobbying. Durnil abhors the 
irresponsibility of some industrial leaders who pollute and also 
that of the government regulators who issue the licenses to emit 
deadly chemicals. <P> 

Durnil, who admits to having thought little about the environment 
before his tenure at the IJC, is on a crusade to eliminate 
chlorine. Chlorinated chemicals (such as dioxin, DDT and many 
pesticide compounds in use today) may be responsible for a 
drastic decrease in human male sperm counts, increased incidents 
of endometriosis in women and other devastating reproductive 
disorders. <P> 

However, being a conservative, Durnil doesn't want to regulate 
such a ubiquitous chemical as chlorine. Instead, he advocates a 
more cooperative approach. Once industrial leaders are educated 
about the dangers of persistent toxics, he believes they will 
phase out the pollution. He says many high-level executives are 
blinded by their own lobbying organizations and don't know the 
truth about the damage they are causing. His comparison of 
chemical industry actions to the smoke-and-mirrors of tobacco PR 
flacks is especially hard-hitting today. <P> 

Durnil also does a commendable job outlining the debate over the 
issue of scientific certainty. How much evidence of danger is 
needed to act? In the case of chlorine, Durnil clearly thinks 
there is enough. <P> 

Sorely missing from the book is a solid argument in favor of the 
conservative way of doing things. There is no discussion of how 
free market mechanisms can reduce pollution. Durnil's analysis of 
burdensome regulations is nothing new. There is no sense of how a 
small-government, lower-taxes philosophy can translate into 
environmental protection. <P> 

Whether educated industrial leaders will stop their polluting 
ways, as Durnil predicts, is an open question. Unfortunately, his 
prediction has little bearing on how conservatives can become 
environmental leaders. That's too bad, because a reasoned, 
well-written discussion about conservative philosophy in the 
environmental movement would be invaluable -- especially given 
today's political climate.<P>

<H4><A NAME="wise">Wise Use Wars: <EM>"Let the People Judge"</EM></A></H4>

John Echeverria and Raymond Booth Eby, editors
<BR>
Island Press ($49.95 hardcover, $27.50 paperback)
<P>
<EM>Reviewed by Nancy Riggs</EM>

<P>

Readers of <EM>Let the People Judge</EM> will come away with a distinctly 
disturbed feeling, the kind that comes after sitting in on a 
volatile debate where emotions run high. In their preface, 
Echeverria and Eby lure us into the debate on Wise Use and 
private property rights movements with the benign statement that, 
as editors, they have attempted to "collect a wide range of 
different and sometimes sharply divergent thinking." This promise 
of different and divergent thinking is carried out.<P> 

Laid out in six sections, each containing essays representing the 
promised divergent viewpoints, the 369-page <EM>Let the People Judge</EM> 
informs the uninformed and stirs the unstirred. Jon Rouch 
explains the Wise Use movement in his introduction. "Because we 
live by incompatible values, we have created institutions that 
invite conflict." Expanding on this point, Rouch writes, ". . . 
love for the earth is not exclusive to any class, occupation, or 
political persuasion. The difficulties lie elsewhere."<P> 

The essays, which provide background on events and responses 
related to the Wise Use and private property rights, offer sound 
reasoning on both sides. Sometimes they are immediately 
identifiable as favoring or opposing the Wise Use movement, and 
sometimes they espouse less identifiable positions. We are told 
that the Wise Use movement is "a volatile mix of traditional 
conservative ideology blended with some revolutionary proposals 
to open public lands to greater private exploitation." We learn 
that the "takings," or property rights, movement, initially came, 
not out of the wide-open, rugged western states, but from the 
Heartland via a law professor at the University of Chicago.<P> 

Armed with an overview of the conflict, we listen to the debate, 
from Thomas Lewis' explanation in "Cloaked in a Wise Disguise," 
to Grant Ferrier's "Strategic Overview of the Environmental 
Industry." In an essay in the closing section entitled "Message 
and the Media", Sharon Collins notes, " ... you're dealing with 
emotion, and you're dealing with a right ... In trying to be fair 
to both sides, you sometimes get caught up in a lot of emotion." 
Keith Schneider sums up the key point of the Wise Use movement 
that journalists are concerned with: " ... it is one of the most 
compelling stories that I could cover."<P> 

Whether or not <EM>Let the People Judge</EM> will help the general public 
make decisions about Wise Use and property rights movements, this 
work of Echeverria and Eby, (both affiliated with the National 
Audubon Society) reminds journalists that both sides approach 
this debate with high emotions, and both are armed with strong 
arguments. Journalists new to this beat will be 
forewarned that artillery on both sides 
is aimed at managing media relations. The Appendices which describe various 
organizations, are excellent 
resources.<P>

<H4><A NAME="ad">Ad lib regulations: <EM>Tankers Full of Trouble</EM></A></H4>

Eric Nalder
<BR>
Grove Press, ($24 hardcover)
<BR>
<P><EM>Reviewed by Chris Rigel</EM>

<P>

<EM>Tankers Full of Trouble</EM> is a log of the sea-time Eric Nalder 
spent aboard the <EM>SS Arco Anchorage,</EM> traveling from Valdez, 
Alaska, where it takes on about 35 million gallons of cargo oil, 
to its drop-off point in Cherry Point, Washington, and back. A 
journalistic appraisal of the issues with all sides covered, 
<EM>Tankers</EM> explores such facets of the troubled oil-shipping 
industry as: 

<UL><LI>The human factor: as the profits go, so goes the crew. 
Now that the oil shipping industry doesn't carry the huge profits 
it once did, the size of the crew is shrinking, downsized from 45 
to 22 on an average U.S.-flagged ship over the past 30 years. The 
math is simple: the same amount of work, fewer people to do it. 
Repairs and maintenance jobs are sometimes left undone, and sleep 
is lost. It isn't unusual for captains and their crew to work two 
or even three days on six or seven hours of sleep.  

<LI>Safety regulations: with nobody in charge, safety has been 
nearly impossible to regulate. A ship may be captained by someone 
whose crew speaks a different language. It may be registered with 
a "flag state," (the nautical division of the world) of 
conspicuously low safety standards (cheaper). The ship may be 
owned by a Kansas City lawyer who is unknown to any of the above. 
The safety of the ship and crew seem dependent upon the goodwill 
of the owner (i.e., the year's profits) since there is no global 
maritime organization to enforce standards. Some precautions have 
been developed, like the IGS (inert gas system) which decreases 
the possibility of explosion when the cargo tank is at its most 
volatile. Industry, however, has been slow to respond; once the 
system was developed and proven effective, it became mandatory on 
all tankers, but it took fifteen years. 

<LI>The steel factor: tankers have mushroomed in size from 3,500 
tons to 50,000-70,000 tons with a vast increase in cargo 
capacity. Hull thickness, however, has <EM>decreased</EM> from one and 
three-eighths inch  to seven-eighths inch in a money-saving 
maneuver, with owners offering firm resistance to the proven 
safety measure of double hull design.</UL> 

Tankers Full of Trouble is written from the strategic location of 
the rolling deck, elbow to elbow with the <EM>Anchorage</EM> crew and 
officers. It's a quick read, peppered with anecdotes that break 
down the cliche image of the seaman who's had one too many, 
steering into icebergs. Tankers conveys a clear picture of the 
hazards, of profit's tendency to determine the future  and the ad 
lib regulations that follow catastrophe. The extensive 
bibliography and an index that allows for logical search is an 
added plus.<P>

<EM>To the Editor, SEJ:</EM>

<P>

I salute the <EM>SEJournal</EM> for its recent articles on opportunities 
for environmental journalists in fellowship programs at MIT and 
Harvard. Because the environmental field is so complex (and 
because those who cover it need not only current information but 
also some historical, philosophical, and scientific background) a 
fellowship experience can be truly enriching. A number of SEJ 
members have come to Stanford as Knight Fellows. Their 
opportunity to study and conduct research at a place with strong 
environmental programs, and the chance to come into direct 
contact with faculty members like Paul Ehrlich and Steve 
Schneider, have had a major impact on their lives and their 
careers. It's good to see a forward-thinking organization like 
SEJ extolling the virtues of fellowship programs at a time when 
so many employers, in a downsizing, cost-cutting mood, are 
discouraging employees from taking leave to better themselves.

Kathy Sagan and the editors of the <EM>SEJournal</EM> would like to 
acknowledge the following errors in Sagan's review of Gregg 
Easterbrook's book <EM>A Moment on the Earth,</EM> which appeared in the 
Summer 1995 issue:

<UL><LI>The review criticized Easterbrook for 
suggesting that areas downwind of Chernobyl received a radiation 
dose of one-fifth of a chest X-ray. Easterbrook's passage 
referred to a 1992 accident at a "Chernobyl-type reactor" near 
Saint Petersburg. 

<LI>The review referenced a <EM>Newsweek</EM> article by 
Easterbrook which according to Sagan was "called 'Rachel Carson 
Was Wrong.'" The article actually was headlined "Averting a Death 
Foretold" and ran with the subhead, "Environment: Rachel Carson 
warned that man was poisoning the earth. Because we listened, 
writes Gregg Easterbrook, the birds are still here."</UL> <P>

<DD><EM>San Francisco Examiner</EM> Outdoors Writer Tom Stienstra took a close 
look at Lake Tahoe in a three-part series Aug 20-22. Stienstra 
found one of the greatest lakes on Earth glutted with new housing 
and the tracks of 4 million tourists a year who flock to South 
Shore gambling caissons, golf courses and Squaw Valley skiing. 
Erosion, sewage and golf course fertilizers are turning blue 
water to green: clarity has drooped from 103 feet in 1968 to 67 
feet today. And the real threat of fire from dead trees drives a 
push for salvage logging of fir forests. Stienstra's number is 
(415) 777-6405. The <EM>Examiner</EM> can be found on Dialog. <P>

<DD>Increasingly frustrated with what they believed was a media 
blackout on the political right's "war on the environment," some 
Colorado environmental leaders considered in April targeting 
Denver metro area dailies for political demonstrations. The issue 
came to a head on April 17 when about 25 activists and two state 
legislators held an hour long rally on the steps of U.S. Post 
Office to protest pending "takings" legislation and were ignored 
by Denver newspapers. About two weeks earlier, 45 people picketed 
the Denver office of Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell after he 
changed his vote on a measure that would have made the salvage 
timber legislation comply with federal laws, which allowed the 
measure to fail.  Again they were ignored. Boulder 
environmentalists were also angered when a <EM>Daily Camera</EM> editor 
"wasn't willing to listen" when they made a plea for better 
coverage. But they were particularly angry at the <EM>Rocky Mountain 
News</EM> after an editor reportedly told one man "we've written one 
story about takings, and that's all we intend to write. The 
managing editor at the <EM>Post</EM> apologized and promised better 
coverage, and the executive editor at the <EM>Daily Camera</EM> offered to 
meet with the activists. The <EM>Rocky Mountain News</EM> never responded 
to the threats and did not return calls to the <EM>Colorado Daily, </EM>
which was writing a story. Since then, all three papers have 
improved their coverage of the issues with the <EM>Post</EM> leading the 
way with strong editorials opposing the anti-environment 
proposals in pending legislation and featuring front page news 
stories on the Republican proposals. However, when protesters 
recently created a mock "toxic waste spill" in front of the 
Denver mining company that owned the Omai mine in Guyana, which 
flushed nearly a million gallons of cyanide tainted water into 
the Essequibo River, there was no coverage, despite extensive 
publicity before hand. For more information, contact Ron Baird at

<DD>For more than two decades a solid waste landfill in Canterbury 
was operated in violated repeatedly of numerous state 
environmental guidelines. A former state environmental commission 
wrote in disgust that the company's past conduct reflected "a 
thorough disregard for legal requirements as well as the welfare" 
of the dump's neighbors. Yet for two decades the state allowed 
the landfill to remain open. The reason? Connecticut had so few 
other options available for getting rid of waste that the state 
felt compelled to keep the facility open. A May 29 story by 
<EM>Hartford Courant</EM> writer Dan Jones examines the costs that dump 
neighbors had to pay for society's inability to find options for 
getting rid of its waste. Further, the story show how governments 
can be unwilling or unable to enforce their own laws. For more

<DD>Companies increasingly are conducting environmental audits to 
asses their compliance with regulations and to check on the 
environmental efficiency of their operations. Business groups are 
lobbying state lawmakers to protect the results of these audits 
from public disclosure--and 34 states considered such legislation 
this year. So far, 14 states have adopted these laws, known as 
audit privilege statues. Many of these laws also provide immunity 
to any company that finds violations through an audit then 
voluntarily corrects them and reports them to state authorities. 
Public interest groups and press associations have fought against 
these bills, which run counter to the right-to know movement. 
Cheryl Hogue, a reporter for the Bureau of National Affairs Inc., 
examined the 1995 state legislation and prospects for these bill 
in 19996. Her work appeared in the Aug. 29 edition of <EM>Daily 
Environment Report</EM> and in other BNA publications dated Aug. 30 
and Sept. 1. These are available on LEXIS. Hogue can be contacted

<DD>George Washington University in the District pledged in a 
voluntary deal with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to 
become a model "green" university. GWU is holding contests to see 
which dormitory can recycle the greatest portion of its trash and 
its administration is trying to cut down on paper use. Meanwhile, 
faculty members are urged to incorporate environmental issues in 
their classes. Colleen Bradford, a summer inter from Iowa State 
University at the <EM>Washington Post's</EM> Metro section, outlined the 
steps that the university is taking to "green" nearly all part of 
campus life. Her story is available on NEXIS. <P>

<DD>The <EM>Tampa Tribune</EM> in August published a five-part series entitled 
"the Cost of Superfund" that outline the mismanagement, 
contractor abuse, inefficiency and scandal that plagued the early 
years of the hazardous waste cleanup program. The series showed 
how the early history set the stage for the massive problems 
later on. The <EM>Tribune</EM> detailed how thousands of small business 
are forced to pay for cleanups when, in many cases, they did 
little or nothing to cause the pollution. In Florida, for 
instances, businesses sent waste oil, car batteries and other 
wastes to recyclers- which was the right thing to do- only to 
discover later that sloppy recyclers had left toxic waste 
littering the landscape. The businesses that sent the waste in 
many cases were shared in expensive lawsuits that consume up to 
one third of all money spent on Superfund. <P>

<DD>The increasingly high cost of recyclable commodities made the 
front page of the <EM>Sunday Sun-Times</EM> (August 27, 1995). Business 
writer Janet Kidd Stewart profiled how rising demand is putting a 
premium on commodities such as paper and glass. The story's 
placement is significant since the Chicago Board of Trade 
commodities exchange is finalizing details on an electronic 
exchange for recyclable--the first in the country. <P> 


<DD>The <EM>Chicago Tribune,</EM> meanwhile, has been linking environmental 
with development issues in a series on the Chicago River "The 
River Reborn" (Aug. 27-30). <EM>Tribune</EM> writers charted the 
development of the property adjacent to the river and highlighted 
future growth as industrial properties are being converted into 
housing, recreation and retail projects. Although the water 
quality of the once-filthy river is improving marginally, the 
fight on the riverbanks is over whether residential real estate 
growth will supplant long industrial corridors that linked Chicago's 
commercial hub with the Mississippi River basin and 
beyond. <P>

designated in attainment with federal Clean Air Act provision, 
Kansas City recorded excess readings for ozone. Now, the city

<DD>The Northern Forest Forum took an exhaustive look in its Mid-
Summer issue at the planned Kenetech windpower project-639 
turbines on 26 miles of mountain peaks in western Maine that 
would generate 210 megawatts of power. The project won 
preliminary approval in August from Maine's Land Use Regulation 
commissions. But a stir arose when it appeared staffers of Maine 
Gov. Angus King pressured LURC for the approval. In two articles, 
accompanied by a project Q&A and excerpts from a LURC report, it 
appears the project has divided environmentalists. Conservation 
Law Foundation Senior Attorney Dan Sosland defended it as a 
clean, fully studied alternative to nuclear, coal and oil in 
meeting the region's energy needs. National Audubon Society 
activist Sam Hands detailed the alleged involvement of King's 
staffers, and criticized the project as unnecessary, inadequately 
studied and damaging, both to the environment and the credibility 
of renewable energy. Contact Jamie Sayen, The Northern Forest

<DD>Media up and down the Eastern Seaboard spent the summer tracking 
Chessie, a manatee that left his home at Florida's Merritt Island 
National Wildlife Refuge on June 13 and headed north, swimming 
further than any manatee had ever traveled. Along the way, the 
federally protected endangered species showed a predelection for 
tight spots, cruising New York Harbor and the Narrows to get to 
Long Island Sound, stopping at the mouth of Connecticut's 
Quinnepiac River to stock up on marsh grass, and surfing in and 
out of coastal coves in Rhode Island. At one point, federal 
biologists monitoring him by satellite telemetry feared he might 
shoot the Cape Cod Canal, at the height of tourist season. But he 
only made it as far as Rhode Island, and by late August, appeared 
to be headed home; the researchers lost him when his radio tag 
became loose in New Haven. No one knows why Chessie traveled over 
1,000 miles north of his range. But some say the warmer oceans 
this summer may have made the trek possible. Contact Robert 
Braile, <EM>The Boston Globe,</EM> (603) 772-6380. <P> 


<DD>State environmental regulators spend too much time and effort 
watching companies that rarely cause problems. further, thriving 
companies are often burdened with a seemingly endless stream of 
paperwork in order to meet state environmental regulations. That 
is the viewpoint of Massachusetts Environmental Affairs Secretary 
Trudy Coxe, who in July announced a regulatory reprieve for 
thousands of Massachusetts companies. By the end of 1996, 10,000 
companies, 60 percent of the total in the state, will be freed 
from the need to obtain detailed permits which limit the amount 
of pollution the companies can release into the environment. The 
firms must still comply with state pollution guidelines, but they 
will operate more on an honor system than in the past. Meanwhile, 
regulators will concentrate on the other 40 percent who have 
shown a greater history of problems. Massachusetts officials, in 
announcing this new policy, touted as one of the first in the 
nation to truly streamline environmental regulations and cut 
costs to both industry and taxpayers. The Massachusetts 
Environmental Affairs office can be reached at (617) 727-9800. A 
public relations spokesman is John Rodman. <P>

<DD>Governor Tom Ridge quickly followed through with his campaign 
promise to split Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental 
Resources into two agencies, one for environmental protection and 
the other to manage state lands and resources. Legislation 
approving the split and creating a Department of Environmental 
Protection and a Department of Conservation and Natural Resources 
passed the state legislature and was signed by the governor in 
June. John Oliver, Governor Tom Ridge's nominee to head the 
newly-created Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, 
has run into opposition in rural northwestern and northcentral 
Pennsylvania, according to reports in the <EM>Erie Times-News</EM> and 
<EM>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.</EM> Oliver, former head of the Western 
Pennsylvania Conservancy, has come under attack by property 
rights organizations and others for the conservancy's land 
purchases, its handling of home and cottage leases on property it 
has purchased and timbering practices on land it owns. Most land 
purchased by the conservancy is eventually transferred to 
government entities. State Senator John Peterson, R-25, a 
statewide spokesman for rural interests, said he has never known 
of a state cabinet nominee to attract so much opposition from his 
constituents. The Senate was expected to vote on the Oliver 
nomination in late September. <P>

<DD>The major energy issue in Rhode Island, in other New England 
states, as well as some states around the nation, this year has 
become the drive to restructure how electricity sold. Rhode 
Island wants to bring new competition to the sale of electricity, 
the way telephone customers can choose from several long distance 
companies. In the process, environmental issues have emerged as 
key issues, including: how does one continue energy conservation 
programs; encourage renewable energy; and close down dirty old 
plants that produce electricity so cheap that market forces may 
keep them open longer than planned. In Rhode Island, a 
collaborative of utility, consumer, environmental and 
governmental officials have been working on this issue. A Feb.,

hiking enthusiast Paul Miller to acquire for public use a 15,000-
acre tract of forest about 110 miles east of Nashville. 
Bridgestone-Firestone owns the property and is asking $12 million 
for it. Miller is trying to mobilize all available resources to 
get the land into public hands. For information, call Anne Paine

<DD>Tom Charlier of <EM>The Commercial Appeal</EM> also looked at cooperation 
between government agencies and nonprofit groups, with tow 
articles about wetlands preservation. The first, published July 
17, told of a "mitigation bank" being established in Middle 
Tennessee. Developers, to compensate for wetlands they destroyed 
during construction projects elsewhere in the state, will be able 
to pay a fee for restoring wetlands on this 1,600-acre site. And 
on Aug. 14, Charlier reported on a proposed $4 million project to 
enhance 161,000 acres of wetlands along the Mississippi River in 
West Tennessee, State and federal governments, environmental 
groups, farmers, and the timber company Anderson-Tully would all 
be involved in the project. Call Charlier at (901) 529-2572. <P>

<DD>A new risk-assessment prepared by a Toronto-based firm for Atlas 
Corporation says leaving 10-5 million tons of uranium mine 
tailings in place would be safer for public health than hauling 
them 19-miles away for burial. The report is the latest effort by 
Atlas to convince the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that it's $16 
million capping plan is the best alternative for dealing with the 
tailings. The state of Utah and residents of nearby Moab, Utah, 
want the tailings removed and buried from an abandoned mine site. 
The report says removal could cost upwards of $114 million 
dollars and would put workers and the public in general at five-
times the risk of capping project. Further information: Rod 
Jackson, KTVX-TV (801) 975-4418. <P> 


<DD>The Utah Geological Survey says previous estimates of the 
potential for coal-bed methane gas extraction in central Utah's 
"Ferron Fairway'" have been dramatically understate. In a report 
issued in late August UGS says the 80-mile by 10-mile long strip 
has the potential of becoming the third largest coal-bed methane 
gas field in the nation. UGS says as many as 34-hundred 
production wells, spaced at one-half mile intervals, could be 
developed in the region. The news stunned the Bureau of Land 
Management, which has since issued a moratorium on new drilling 
permit applications. The agency says it will have to conduct new 
EIS assessments for an existing resource management plan that 
calls for a fraction of that number of wells. Further 
information: John Hollenhorst, KSL-TV (801) 575-5500. <P> 


<DD>Operators of the new USPCI-Laidlaw hazardous-waste incinerator 
are asking Utah's Department of Environmental Quality to reduce 
operating standards for emissions of the plant form 99.9999 
percent to 99.99 percent destruction.The company says the 
reduction in standards would make them competitive with nearby 
incinerators. Environmental groups say the request is a direct

<DD>Vermont eco-icon Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream took a hit in a Sept. 
11 <EM>New Republic</EM> cover story, "The Evil Empire, " by associate 
editor Hannah Rosin. In a stinging critique, Rosin sheared away 
the social mission mandate of the $140 million company by 
detailing its "little white lies, mutual delusions that keep 
everyone happy." Among them: B&J announced on Feb. 1 that it had 
hired a new CEO, Bob Holland, who purportedly won the "Yo, I'm 
your CEO contest, explaining better than 20,000 others in a 100 
word piece why he is the best person for the job. Turns out 
Holland is a 13 year veteran at Mckinsey & Company and a 
consultant to several Fortune 100 companies who wrote his piece 
after B&J hired him having been discovered through a New York 
executive search firm, Rosin writes. Other such "lies" involve 
B&J's rainforest Crunch and Cherry Garcia ice creams, its capture 
of the Boston superpremium ice cream market, and its involvement 
in inner city initiatives, she writes. Yet B&J's followers remain 
loyal. "it's this kind of awestruck reverence, willfully ignorant

<H1>Internet Mailing Lists<br> on the Environment<br>and Journalism</H1>

<HR>
<H3>Listserv? What's a Listserv?</H3>
<p>A listserv is a type of software. But more to the point, it's 
one of several related types of software used to operate Internet 
mailing lists. These lists allow you to participate in e-mail 
discussions of wide-ranging topics, including journalism and the 
environment. </p>
<p>If you follow the instructions and send e-mail to 
any of the addresses below, you'll soon receive a note welcoming 
you to the list and telling you how to post messages and how to 
cancel your subscription -- which can be a good thing to know, 
since some of these lists produce as many as 50 messages per day. 
</p>
<p>There are separate sections below for <A HREF = 
"#environmental">environmental</A> and <A HREF = 
"#journalism">journalism</A> mailing lists. 
On the <A HREF = "env_epal.htm">next page</A> are listings of all
the mailing lists currently operated by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, plus environmentally oriented lists at Envirolink and the Institute 
for Global Communications. And if you can't find 
what you're looking for on these pages, then try this nifty<a HREF  
= "http://www.liszt.com"> search tool</a> 
for all of mailing lists on the Internet. Or you can read the <A 
HREF = "gopher://ecosys.drdr.Virginia.EDU:70/11/communication">archives</a> 
of many of these lists. </p>
<p>Here's <A HREF="http://www.webcom.com/impulse/list.html">a nice page</A> 
with lots of instructions on how to use these mailing
lists, if you need more help than you can find here.</P>
<p><em>Finally, a special note for overly 
literal readers:</em> In the "To join" instructions below, 
substitute your first name for "yourfirstname," your last name 
for "yourlastname," and your E-mail address for "yourE-mailaddress." We know, it's confusing. That's life. </p> <HR>

OK, so we're not exactly neutral on this subject. But we can't help pointing out 
that a membership in <A HREF = "ENV_SEJ.HTM">SEJ</A> gives you both the 
benefits of associating with our 1,100 other members (we have an <A HREF="sej_conf.htm">annual 
conference</A> in October -- this year it's in St. Louis) and a subscription to our 
quarterly <A HREF = "SEJOURN.HTM">SEJournal.</A> That's one reason 
we've listed ourselves first on this page. (Can you blame us?)

<H3>Cover Package: Is it Carma?</H3>
<A NAME = "cover1"><H4>Big Brother Might Be Reading You, Too</H4></A>

<STRONG>By PETER DYKSTRA</STRONG>
<P>
For just a tad over $46,000 of your tax dollars, Hazel O'Leary's 
Energy Department can continue its cleanup of the Hanford Nuclear 
Weapons Complex for another 13 minutes. Or, as proven in 
November, the DOE Secretary can buy a far more sustainable share 
of ill will for the same money. 
<P>
O'Leary's DOE "glasnost" had drawn praise from even the harshest 
agency critics, so what was she thinking when she allowed CARMA 
Associates to prepare a scorecard of energy-beat reporters? And 
why were reporters so shocked -- shocked -- to learn that a 
prominent story subject was hiring out to analyze their work? 
<P>
The furor began with a Nov. 9 page one <EM>Wall Street Journal</EM> 
revelation that the Department of Energy paid $46,500 for CARMA 
(a Washington, DC, firm that offers analysis of news coverage) to 
develop profiles of the work of print reporters who regularly 
cover DOE projects and sites. 
<P>
The purpose, said O'Leary, was to analyze how her made-over DOE 
message was playing in the national print press -- as well as in 
newspapers near key (read: besieged and controversial) DOE 
facilities. According to some reporters who were the subjects of 
this study, its purpose was to prepare a Nixonian "enemies list" 
of hostile sources -- and then to take the dreaded-but-undefined 
"appropriate action." 
<P>
Reactions came at a gallop as other print press and the networks 
followed the <EM>Journal's</EM> scoop. O'Leary assured everyone that the 
project was benign: no reporters had been harmed in the course of 
the research. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) was one of 69 lawmakers, 
including some Democrats, to call for O'Leary's resignation. (In 
a floor speech, Rep. Graham told his colleagues that the money 
paid to CARMA could be more wisely spent in renewed tritium 
production at his district's Savannah River Site.) Journalists 
and other "sources" who had earned low "unfavorable" rankings 
from CARMA delivered aggrieved soundbites. Had CARMA still been 
on the job (DOE ended the contract before the story broke), it 
certainly would have given a low grade to scalding editorials 
about this scandal that appeared in the <EM>New York Times</EM> and 
<EM>Washington Post.</EM> O'Leary endured Congressional hearings and a 
sharp rebuke from the White House. 
<P>
Fruit flies have longer lifespans than this sort of Washington 
story, however. It withered and fell off the front page within 48 
hours, bequeathing to journalists an intense, esoteric debate. 
How jerked around are we? How common are firms like CARMA? Should 
this have been even a fleeting furor? What does it all mean for 
the way we do our jobs? 
<P>
A subsequent <EM>Journal</EM> story detailed that CARMA is one of several 
firms drawing top dollars to analyze journalists' work. Their 0-to-100 scale ranks 
reporters "by degree of sycophancy," according 
to <EM>The Nation's</EM> Barbara Ehrenreich. CARMA President Al Barr put 
it more gently, saying "It's helped us help our clients be more 
far more effective with the media." 
<P>
How is this research conducted? Barr explained that CARMA's 
methodology involves intensive research "sometimes involving 
thousands of documents or stories," pored over by a small team of 
as few as two individuals, who rate the performance of individual 
journalists. Barr's talent pool includes some former journalists 
and academics, as well as people with less formal training. 
<P>
Most of CARMA's clients want to focus on inside-the-Beltway 
policy issues. However, CARMA's 130-name client list also 
includes MicroSoft (whose mega-rollout for Windows '95 used a 
CARMA analysis of the computer trade press, although Barr claims 
the <EM>Journal</EM> overstated his company's role); strike-torn major 
league baseball; McDonald's; and each side in the triangular 
phone war between AT&T, MCI, and Sprint. 
<P>
Closer to Capitol Hill, CARMA has analyzed coverage of gun issues 
for the National Rifle Association, and presumably a much wider 
range of issues for the U.S. Postal Service. CARMA has served the 
beer and tobacco empire of Phillip Morris, the T-men of the 
Internal Revenue Service, and the 1992 Bush-Quayle campaign. 
According to Barr, although his company also worked for several 
utilities, environmental issues don't represent a sizable portion 
of CARMA's business. 
<P>
Former <EM>Milwaukee Journal</EM> reporter Chuck Werle is one of CARMA's 
competitors. Environmentally oriented clients are rare for his 
Chicago-based firm, he says. The bull market for media analysis 
lies in more sprawling beats, such as business. In more rarefied 
beats like environment and energy, reporters (and the subjects of 
their stories) generally don't need detailed analysis -- they 
know each other better. When asked why DOE would need the kind of 
detail provided by CARMA's reports, Werle quipped, "If people are 
really paranoid, they're the ones that need services like CARMA." 
<P>
Should reporters be aghast at this new, apparently sinister 
development? Sinister is in the eye of the beholder -- but new 
this isn't. In my decade of experience as Media Director for 
Greenpeace, judging reporters' work, and receptiveness, was a 
routine and daily task. Absent CARMA-style analysis (or 
pseudo-analysis) and a high consulting fee, I don't know of a major 
environmental group, industry, or government agency that doesn't 
routinely use this strategy. 
<P>
During my tenure there, if a reporter unfamiliar to Greenpeace 
called us in pursuit of a major story, of course we'd look at 
that reporter's past work. If that reporter's news stories or 
opinion pieces seemed to be consistently hostile, of course we'd 
consider dealing with that reporter more defensively. 
<P>
While reporters increasingly benefit from an 
information-gathering revolution, the everyday wonders of Lexis and the 
universe of data on the World Wide Web work both ways: Reporting 
on reporters is easier now, too. Whether it's good press or bad, 
what reporters do is important to all factions in the 
environmental debate. Should it be a surprise that there's a 
market for more sophisticated data on how reporters do it? 
<P>
Dean Rotbart of TJFR publishes a newsletter featuring profiles of 
environmental journalists and news organizations. For a fee, 
clients can receive more detailed biographies of specific 
reporters. 
<P>
While he declined to name names, Rotbart said that "roughly five 
percent" of his sales are made to environmental groups in 
addition to his trove of corporate and environmental clients. He 
added that several national print and broadcast news 
organizations also buy his profiles so that they can monitor 
media-beat reporters and TV critics. While he does not dispute 
that journalists are targets of manipulation from all sides, 
Rotbart asserts that he's "an equal opportunity manipulator." 
<P>
Rotbart said he would not necessarily oppose, for example, hiring 
a private detective to surveil a journalist, "provided that 
detective obeyed the law," and that the detective did not pursue 
or reveal details of the journalist's private life. He added that 
he has never carried out such surveillance. 
<P>
John Beardsley, a Minneapolis public relations professional and 
President of the Public Relations Society of America, pronounced 
CARMA's DOE work "Defensible. It's simply good management to 
assess whether (a media strategy) is working," he said. Rotbart's 
suggestion of surveillance struck a nerve. "It's inappropriate. 
How can you draw the line between 'public' and 'private' 
surveillance?" 
<P>
Beardsley also said that some reporters' harsh reaction to the 
CARMA story may be traced to the "natural tension" that exists 
between reporters and the publicists who are among the most 
frequent consumers of content-analysis data. 
<P>
The PR trade publication <EM>PR News</EM> put the blame more directly on 
reporters in a November 20 editorial: "By now, most PR people are 
resigned to the fact that the mainstream media is unlikely to 
ever give the profession any thoughtful discussion." 
<P>
For many reporters, the tough call is whether CARMA's 
formalization of the rate-the-reporters game breaks unwritten 
rules. Phil Shabecoff, the former <EM>New York Times</EM> environment 
reporter, said the CARMA incident "gets too close to thought 
control." Nevertheless, he places such Carmic experiences low on 
the scale of threats to a vigorous press, citing November's Sixty 
Minutes retreat from an expose against litigious tobacco 
companies as a more ominous threat. 
<P>
Shabecoff said that during his contentious 1991 departure from 
the <EM>Times,</EM> editors labeled his work as "too sympathetic to 
environmental causes." However, he added that he knew of no 
CARMA-like performance studies of his work -- whether by the 
<EM>Times</EM> or by prospective story subjects. 
<P>
"It's entirely appropriate for news sources to informally 
evaluate reporters," says Bill Beecher, a former Pulitzer-winning 
reporter who is now Public Affairs Director for the U.S. Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission. "But some of this other activity may cross 
the line." Beecher says NRC has never commissioned a formal 
evaluation of its press coverage or reporters' individual 
performance. 
<P>
Josef Hebert, the Associated Press reporter who scored at the 
negative end of the CARMA/DOE scale, said "I'm not that bothered 
by it. I don't know what (clients) get out of it that's all that 
useful. Where I would get much more upset is if people were 
trying to dig into your personal views on things." Hebert, who 
has covered energy and environment for the AP for most of the 
last six years, added that his low marks won him "over a dozen" 
messages of congratulations from other journalists. 
<P>
For many reporters, what seems to be the source of the strong 
reaction to media monitoring is what they can't see -- but do 
suspect -- behind operations such as CARMA's. <EM>Toxic Sludge is 
Good for You,</EM> a book by John Stauber and Sheldon Rampton, 
documents a litany of what the authors present as ethical abuses 
in the environmental public relations domain. 
<P>
While some of what has become known as "greenwashing" is spread 
across the beat, some environment reporters say they've received 
a more direct assault. Kathie Durbin, formerly of the <EM>Oregonian,</EM> 
and Richard Manning of Montana's <EM>Missoulian</EM> have contended that 
they were removed from environment reporting due to pressure from 
the timber industry. 
<P>
When these reporters became statistics (like Shabecoff), media 
monitors with image-conscious clients may have looked to be 
scorekeepers. Albert Barr of CARMA and his competitors all say 
that their services draw the line at analysis. However, Barr adds 
"What they (clients) do with our data is their business." 
<P>
Just as the environment became a booming beat in the 1980's, 
stories on vanishing newspapers, libel suits, and mega-media 
buyouts have carved out a '90's media beat for reporters like the 
<EM>New Yorker's</EM> Ken Auletta, Howard Kurtz of the <EM>Washington Post,</EM> 
and Howard Rosenberg of the <EM>Los Angeles Times.</EM> Rotbart of TJFR 
says that several national print and broadcast companies are his 
clients. Have any news organizations wary of self-criticism 
availed themselves of CARMA's services? "Not yet," says Barr, 
"but they should." 
<P>
In December, Barr commissioned himself to do a detailed analysis 
of reporting on CARMA's DOE contract. He revealed that 77 percent 
of the published stories cast media monitoring in a negative 
light. Despite this, Rotbart, Werle, and Barr all say the 
spotlight on their businesses prompted inquiries from prospective 
new clients. 
<P>
Meanwhile, O'Leary's woes continued into mid-December with 
additional Congressional calls for her resignation. And for a 
Dec. 14 <EM>USA Today</EM> report on government travel costs, O'Leary 
broke from her record of openness, declining to be interviewed 
for the piece.

<A NAME = "cover2"><H4>Skipped beats on DOE story </H4></A>

When the <EM>Wall Street Journal's</EM> Michael Moss broke this story on 
November 9, the followup reporting made a few wrong 
journalism-school assumptions...... 
<P>
<UL><LI><EM>Consultant Bites Dog:</EM> 
What a great story! O'Leary had cut a dynamic figure by reversing 
DOE's reputation for Cold War secrecy. Did her reporter research 
prove that she was instead the second coming of Nixon? (She was, 
after all, a former utility executive at Minnesota's Northern 
States Power). Perceiving a supreme hypocrisy, reporters and 
editors reacted as if they'd caught Ralph Reed in a strip 
joint -- or Al Gore in a strip mine. 
<P>
<LI><EM>The Smoking Gun:</EM> 
"Hazel O'Leary wasn't bad," penned the <EM>New Republic.</EM> "She was 
dumb." Her gun was smoking, but was it ever used to commit a 
crime against journalists? There's no evidence of malevolence, 
even in subsequent revelations that she spent nearly $150,000 of 
federal funds on an image-building consultant. Many journalists, 
congressmen, and others have cited the use-of-public-funds issue. 
For journalists pondering their professional universe, that may 
be a valid story -- but it's a different one than the 
right-or-wrong morality play of Carma's work. In December, a <EM>Los Angeles 
Times</EM> report blasted O'Leary for what critics called 
"extravagant" overseas travel, prompting renewed calls for her 
resignation. 
<P>
<LI><EM>List History 101:</EM> 
Perhaps Nixon's notorious "enemies list" isn't the best precedent 
for why some journalists were alarmed by Hazel's list. A 1970 
memo from J. Edgar Hoover, declassified more than a decade later, 
reported a request by Nixon staffer H.R. Haldeman requesting the 
FBI's help in compiling a far more ominous Nixon list: 
"homosexuals known and suspected in the Washington press corps." 
(Hoover's memo promised the FBI's enthusiastic help on the 
project). During an era when homophobes were far more public than 
gays and lesbians, this list could have been a career-ender for 
any reporter who ended up on it -- and the White House knew it. 
</UL><P>
However, a few things that deserved scrutiny went largely 
unchallenged during the flap: 
<P>
<UL><LI><EM>The Swimsuit Competition:</EM> 
What exactly do these numbers mean, anyway? CARMA employs its own 
analysts to give a 1-to-100 score to reporters. A rival firm, 
Werle+Brimm Ltd., sends questionnaires to publicists who judge on 
a 1-to-10 scale on individual reporters' performance in 
categories such as "balanced reporting, interview skills, and 
personality." How objective can a statistical chart based on 
"personality" judgments be? Victor Cohn, longtime <EM>Washington Post</EM> 
science editor, fears that such categories are "too subjective to 
subject to a valid analysis." 
<P>
<LI><EM>Liberal Media:</EM>
Conservative Republicans -- including some of the harshest press 
critics in Congress -- became stalwart defenders of the press, 
however unintentionally: "Hazel O'Leary has hired a private 
investigating firm to poke into reporters who write about her," 
said Congressman Steve Chabot (R-OH), greatly embellishing the 
scope of CARMA's services. "She's then had the private eyes 
create an enemies' list of unfavorable reporters who report on 
her . . ." 
<P>
<LI><EM>Reinventing Government:</EM> 
O'Leary defended CARMA's hiring by saying that the same research 
done by CARMA for $46,500 would have cost $170,000 if done 
in-house by DOE. No one asked why it would cost four times as much 
for a government agency to replicate a private firm's work.

<A NAME = "cover3"><H4>The Business of Spinning Reporters</H4></A>

<STRONG>By MARY MANNING </STRONG>
<P>
When <EM>The Wall Street Journal</EM> put the Department of Energy's paid 
snoop, CARMA International into the spotlight for rating 
reporters, it seemed easy enough to brush aside the implications 
with a laugh and a shrug. 
<P>
The rankings produced by CARMA (Computer-Aided Research and Media 
Analysis) showed that the reporters were, for the most part, 
generating balanced pieces. 
<P>
Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary insisted her department, though it 
might have acted unwisely, had not drawn up any sort of "hit 
list" or "enemy's list." 
<P>
This is far from the first incident of its kind, however. Efforts 
at media manipulation have been taking many forms, some more 
troubling than others, according to several journalists who have 
written on the issue. 
<P>
Sometimes hired public relations firms try to spin the reporters 
instead of the information. Take the case of Tom Kenworthy of <EM>The 
Washington Post,</EM> a low scorer on another CARMA list compiled for 
the beef industry. 
<P>
Kenworthy ranked low on loving beef, so to convert him the 
industry introduced him to some real cattlemen. "I guess they 
thought I wasn't presenting their side well enough,'' he said. 
<P>
The meaty corporations later gave him a better rating, saying 
they were somewhat happier with his coverage, although Kenworthy 
claimed the industry-arranged meetings did not cause him to 
consciously change his coverage. 
<P>
Public relations companies have enormous resources to shape their 
messages, while the average reporter has to battle a budget (and 
often the boss) to get the story, said David Helvarg, author of 
<EM>The War Against the Greens</EM> (Sierra Club Books, 1994) "You've got 
the end of the Cold War with no peace dividend in sight," he 
said. 
<P>
Helvarg contends that PR firms are no longer going over the line 
to tell their stories -- rather, they are defining that line. He 
also believes there is too little investigation or analysis by 
major news organizations into serious, important environmental 
issues that warrant major coverage. 
<P>
The latest PR snoopers have a century-old tradition of carnival 
barkers and tobacco company hawkers behind them, say authors John 
Stauber and Sheldon Rampton in their book, <EM>Toxic Sludge is Good 
for You!</EM> (Common Courage Press, 1995). The subtitle of this book 
is <EM>Lies, Damn Lies and the Public Relations Industry.</EM> 
<P>
From the nuclear industry's media blitz (planned like a World War 
II battle to win the hearts and minds of Nevada residents so they 
would accept a high-level nuclear waste dump) to the Reagan 
administration's orchestrated attempt to gloss over the 
Iran-Contra scandal, Stauber and Rampton pull the covers off the PR 
industry. They are editor and associate editor, respectively, of 
<EM>PR Watch,</EM> a newsletter designed to dog the spin doctors. 
<P>
The book's title came from a "greenwash'' of sewer sludge. In the 
early 1990s a press release came to Stauber's attention saying, 
"Toxic sludge is good for you!" A group calling itself the Water 
Environmental Federation was campaigning to change the term 
sludge to biosolids. The organization turned out to be the old 
industrial-strength Federation of Sewage and Industrial Wastes 
Assoc. from the 1970s, Rampton said. 
<P>
Stauber became fascinated with the public relations methods used 
to promote the bovine growth hormone (BGH) developed by the 
chemical company, Monsanto. The biotechnology leader hired a 
"who's who" list of the top public relations firms and lobbyists 
to squelch negative reports, he discovered. 
<P>
PR firms also campaigned against activist Jeremy Rifkin's book 
<EM>Beyond Beef,</EM> which recommends that people stop eating beef for 
ethical, health, and environmental reasons. The book, denounced 
by the Beef Council and the National Dairy Board, drew the wrath 
of Ketchum and Morgan & Myers PR powers. 
<P>
A spy, Seymour "Bud" Vestermark, Jr., infiltrated Rifkin's staff. 
This spy-for-hire was caught when a reporter thought he 
recognized Vestermark from a former life as a McDonald's worker. 
A Beyond Beef campaign worker also followed Vestermark as he left 
a press conference to return to the public relations/public 
affairs firm of Mongoven, Biscoe, and Duchin (MBD). He turned out 
to be a former analyst for the Department of Defense who had 
written reports on social effects of nuclear attacks. 
<P>
MBD represents an array of clients including Monsanto, DuPont, 
Philip Morris, and Shell Oil. Its interests beyond food safety 
include acid rain, clean air, clean water, hazardous/toxic 
wastes, nuclear energy, recycling, South Africa, the United 
Nations, pesticides, biotechnology, and oil spills. 
<P>
<EM>USA Today's</EM> Rae Tyson has a running battle with Fenton 
Communications, a public relations corporation representing the 
Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). As a print journalist 
for the nation's largest circulation newspaper, Tyson said, 
Fenton gives reports to the major morning shows on network 
television with an embargo on any release by print media. 
<P>
"I have protested to Fenton Communications," he said. "They are 
not interested in us doing anything in depth with it. It just 
drives me crazy." 
<P>
Tyson's two concerns are PR firms delving into the lives of 
reporters and manipulating the newsgathering. 
<P>
"The thing that surprises me about the CARMA report is I didn't 
think Hazel O'Leary was getting bad press,'' he said. 
<P>
TJFR, a company that sells reporters' bios starting at $49, is on 
a smaller scale as troubling as CARMA, "but there is nothing we 
can do about it," Tyson said. "For $49 they will send you a copy 
of my bio. If you want to call me up and ask me, I'll give it to 
you for nothing."

<H3>National Conference Review</H3>
<A NAME = "conference1"><H4>SEJ at MIT: Sparks Fly</H4></A>


The challenge for about 500 journalists, writers, academics, and 
others who gathered on the M.I.T. campus in Boston for SEJ's 
fifth annual conference was to sort the science from the 
speculation, the rhetoric from the reality. 
<P>
There was plenty of all of the aforementioned to choose from. 
Here are some of the highlights: 
<P>
The unveiling of a new public opinion survey kicked off the 
conference's opening session. In this poll conducted by Roper 
Starch Worldwide in May for Times-Mirror Magazines, 43 percent of 
1,003 Americans said current environmental regulations do not go 
far enough. It was the first time in four years that less than a 
majority said so. (In 1994, it was 53 percent; in 1992, 63 
percent). In all, 29 percent said environmental regulation was 
about right, while 22 percent said such laws go too far. The poll 
has a margin of error of plus or minus three percent. 
<P>
In response to other questions, 27 percent said the media is 
doing a poor job of covering environmental issues, and 51 percent 
said the media's coverage is biased, making environmental issues 
seem either worse (35 percent) or better (16 percent) than they 
really are. 
<P>
Accompanied by an anecdotal video of person-on-the-street 
interviews, the poll served as the backdrop for a panel moderated 
by former Massachusetts governor and presidential candidate 
Michael Dukakis. He set the tone by telling the audience, "I 
don't think you're reporting the story." Noting that he had seen 
and read a lot about Medicare, but almost nothing about the 
congressional assault on the environment, Dukakis asked, "What 
the hell is going on?" 
<P>
For the next two hours, using the same witty, provocative 
approach he honed as moderator of a popular public television 
program called The Advocates, Dukakis lithely refereed a 
nonlinear discussion among the nine panelists. Several offered 
their interpretations of the poll results. 
<P>
Nationally syndicated columnist Ellen Goodman commented that 
public opinion polls are conducted "in an information-free zone" 
in which reporters provide the public with propaganda and opinion 
from both sides, but not the facts. People, she said, are left 
skeptical and confused. "They don't know what to do and when they 
don't know what to do, they recycle." she said. 
<P>
EPA Administrator Carol Browner said the change in views shows 
continued strong support for environmental laws, but "reflects 
the progress" that has been made in tackling many of the 
problems. Such topics as clean air, she said, now have so many 
nuances that it is much harder for the press to explain and the 
public to grasp. However, Malcolm Wallop, a former Republican 
senator from Wyoming and now a Heritage Foundation Distinguished 
Fellow, pulled no punches in blaming the media for sending 
one-sided messages to the public. As if to illustrate the zone where 
rhetoric substitutes for information, he referred to "Carol 
Browner's storm troops" going into Wyoming. 
<P>
In another conference plenary session titled "Environmental 
Journalism Ethics: Are We Scaring the World to Death?" ABC 20-20 
reporter John Stossel (whose special two years ago raised the 
scare question) offered no apologies for his message. After 
showing a video clip of the program's opening, Stossel argued his 
case with microphone in hand -- once shoving it into the face of 
fellow panelist Ellen Silbergeld in ambush-interview fashion -- 
while suggesting that he was one of few journalists gutsy enough 
to challenge conventional environmental wisdom. 
<P>
<EM>Washington Post</EM> reporter Gary Lee, another panelist, prompted 
some personal concessions from Stossel by asking about the tens 
of thousands of dollars in speaker's fees that Stossel has 
received from the chemical industry and others, and whether, 
considering his open advocacy, Stossel still considered himself 
to be a journalist. "Industry likes to hire me because they like 
what I have to say," Stossel responded. Stossel said that he 
might no longer be a journalist in the traditional sense, but is 
now a reporter with a perspective. 
<P>
A scientific counterpoint to the morning session was provided 
during a luncheon address by Edward O. Wilson, the Harvard 
biologist and acclaimed author of <EM>The Diversity of Life</EM> and other 
books. He pointed out that less than 20 percent of the estimated 
10 million species of the earth's flora and fauna have been 
identified. "This is a poorly known planet," he remarked. 
<P>
An evening speech by Vice President Al Gore drew a large crowd, 
but generated little news. MIT's Kresge auditorium was packed 
with SEJ conference attendees, MIT students, and members of the 
local media -- all of whom had waited in a long line outside the 
building for nearly an hour before the Secret Service allowed 
them in (two at a time, with polite but thorough searches). 
<P>
Gore demonstrated his concern for the environment by using 
recycled jokes about his stiffness, and by having the stage 
decorated with a rainforest. Most of his speech was devoted to an 
attack on the Republican budget, with emphasis on proposed cuts 
to the EPA, and attempts to weaken environmental legislation and 
regulations through budget riders. However, he proved fairly 
knowledgeable and articulate during the brief question-and-answer 
period that followed. 
<P>
The conference included panels on a wide range of topics. By and 
large, attendance of these panels was good, and members found 
them thought-provoking and useful. One example was the panel on 
fisheries, titled "International Sea Wars: Fighting for the Last 
Fish," which was moderated by <EM>Newsday's</EM> Dan Fagin. 
<P>
This panel included four fisheries experts. One of these, Michael 
Sutton of the World Wildlife Fund, said that since fish stocks 
are dwindling worldwide, coastal nations and fishing fleets are 
clashing "over smaller and smaller slices of a shrinking pie.'' 
The result: violent confrontations on the high seas, higher 
seafood prices, and disruptions of marine ecosystems. Two recent 
proposals -- a U.N. treaty and the reauthorization of the 
Magnuson Act -- could help fish stocks recover. However, 
prospects still are murky for the habitats in which fish live. 
Off the coast of Louisiana, nutrient pollution from the 
Mississippi river has helped create a "dead zone'' of 
oxygen-depleted water in the Gulf of Mexico, according to Paul Coriel, a 
wetlands specialist with Louisiana State University. 
<P>
Another well-received panel was devoted to conflicts between 
scientists and environmental journalists. "Why Does it Often Seem 
We're at War?" addressed a common goal of most scientists and 
journalists: trying to understand the planet. 
<P>
Some of the conflicts between these professions have to do with 
unprepared journalists, according to David Marks, director of 
M.I.T.'s Program of Environmental Engineering, Education and 
Research. Mentioning that he often had been "soundbitten," Marks 
said that some reporters want to be educated on complex subjects 
in 15 minutes or less. Many of the university's scientists refer 
to calls from journalists as "incoming," he said, alluding to 
artillery fire. 
<P>
Heidi Hammel, another M.I.T scientist, noted the two-way street 
of communications between scientists and journalists. She said 
that scientists worry that a reporter's use of quotes will make 
them "look stupid" to their peers, that scientists dwell on 
details and don't understand the content of news stories for 
laypeople, and that some scientists don't want to be understood. 
"Science is a very serious business, so you have to speak about 
it seriously," said Hammel, whose presentation was liberally 
sprinkled with humor. 
<P>
Both the scientists and journalists on the panel agreed that good 
information about environmental science depends on getting 
independent, unbiased judgments and studies from scientists. 
Reductions in federal financing of basic science and increasing 
dependence on industry dollars are of particular concern. "There 
does seem to be a strong correlation between who's paying the 
bill and what comes out," Marks said. 
<P>
Once again, sessions on computer-assisted reporting had much to 
offer SEJ members (most of whom have little if any experience in 
the online world) and other conference attendees. More than 100 
people took advantage of three tracks of sessions that provided 
training in computer-assisted reporting and the use of the 
Internet. Despite some scheduling errors and the usual 
telecommunications glitches, many of those who attended said the 
sessions were worthwhile. Similar sessions are planned for next 
year's national conference in St. Louis. 
<P>
In one of MIT's splendidly equipped computer labs, Russell 
Clemings of the <EM>Fresno Bee</EM> and Miguel Llanos of the <EM>Seattle Times</EM> 
took attendees on a guided tour of SEJ's Environmental Journalism 
Home Page (http://www.sej.org) on the World Wide Web. Meanwhile, 
in another room, Jennifer Lafleur and Brant Houston from the 
National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting (NICAR) set up 
laptop PCs and gave hands-on lessons in how to use database and 
spreadsheet software to analyze environmental data. Here, 
journalists learned about using these powerful tools to analyze 
reams of regulatory data, using a real-life database of Wisconsin 
hunting accidents. The duo from NICAR also made suggestions about 
what kinds of databases lend themselves to eye-popping 
environmental stories. 
<P>
Next door, SEJ board member Amy Gahran introduced Internet 
newbies to the mysteries of electronic mail, with an emphasis on 
SEJ's fledgling "listserv," where members can exchange tips and 
discuss environmental issues. She also gave tips on tasks that 
most Internetters only master after arduous trial-and-error, such 
as how to successfully transfer files over the 'Net. 
<P>
Amid all the sessions, panels, luncheons, tours, and schmoozing, 
one of SEJ's fundraising efforts netted $1,700 for the group: a 
silent auction, managed by Sara Thurin Rollin of BNA's <EM>Chemical 
Regulation Reporter.</EM> 
<P>
The hottest item of the auction (a Hard Rock Cafe tee shirt, 
autographed by Billy Joel, Don Henley, Elton John, Neil Young, 
and Sheryl Crow) drew 13 bids and sold for $130. An autographed 
copy of Mario Molina's paper describing his theory that CFCs 
would deplete the stratospheric ozone layer sold for $105. Molina 
and his co-authors recently won the Nobel Prize in chemistry for 
that paper. Three vacation trips also spawned a lot of bidding 
interest from conference goers. The same few people kept trying 
to out bid each other for the weekend at Sundance, Camping on 
Sapelo Island, and a 10-day geology trek. Those three items alone 
raised $760. 
<P>
Behind the scenes, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt was 
turned away from the luncheon and lecture by E.O. Wilson on 
Saturday because he didn't have his lunch ticket. Without a hint 
of indignation, Babbitt and his team made other arrangements for 
lunch, lauding the ticket-taker for doing her job well. 
<P>
The Heroic Panelist Award goes to Richard Rhodes, who was 
scheduled to appear on the Writers on Writing panel on Sunday at 
Thoreau Institute. He called SEJ board member Mike Mansur to say 
there'd been a glitch: his private plane had crashed. No one was 
hurt, but he'd be late, since he had to rent a car and drive. 
(Okay, he wasn't in the plane when it crashed, and he didn't 
climb out of the wreckage, crawl to the nearest phone booth, call 
for a rental car and point it toward Cambridge. But the 
conference staff said they really appreciated the extra effort he 
made to get there.

<P>
From Ants to ozone, sewage plants to politicians (and other forms 
of nutrient loading), the fifth annual SEJ Conference at MIT was 
perhaps the best in years in terms of scale, scope, and 
worry-free travel deductions (especially for those who toured the 
wastewater treatment plant). 
<P>
On my arrival, I was tempted to visit the Harvard Experimental 
Forest in order to see the autumn foliage matriculate. However, 
I opted instead for the Woods Hole tour where they gave out free 
Alvin pens (the submarine, not the endangered chipmunk). On this 
tour, I was told that, "da clams in da hahba will soon be ready 
for Harvard." "Brilliant bivalves," I commented, before our 
translator explained that "the clams in the harbor will soon be 
ready for harvest". 
<P>
That evening, we had our first reception -- with plastic plates, 
domestic beers and a buffet based on the principle that you can't 
objectively report on any animal you haven't eaten. 
<P>
I must have had a few too many Sam Adams, though. In the morning, 
I had this weird hallucination with Michael Dukakis on stage at 
MIT's Kresge Auditorium pretending to be Phil Donahue, while a 
CNN "people on the street" interview tape was drowned out by the 
marimba band on its soundtrack. 
<P>
The opening session finally settled down with the results of a 
Times-Mirror poll that found "69 percent of Americans say that 
environmental protection and economic development can go 
hand-in-hand," while 28 percent of Americans think these issues go 
hand-in-foot, and three percent insist they go hand-in-hoof (animal 
rights activists, no doubt). A surprising 81 percent of 
respondents said they were uncertain if the environment predated 
O.J., while 51 percent said they thought media coverage of the 
environment focused too much on animals, vegetables, and 
minerals. 
<P>
Such confusion was also reflected among the panelists. Former 
U.S. Senator Malcolm Wallop, for example, mixed up Carol 
Browner's EPA with the National Weather Service when he asked her 
about her "storm troopers." Thankfully no one asked Dukakis what 
he'd do if it was his planet that was being raped. 
<P>
Lunch was served in MIT's cavernous gym (site of some fiercely 
competitive robot wars), accompanied by a haunting, tonal 
performance piece by someone from the UN. 
<P>
I attended an afternoon panel on the oceans where the principles 
of modern fisheries practice were explained, "Sorry Charlie...Oh 
what the hell, we'll take you and that tumorous dogfish and, what 
is that -- a turtle? A radial tire? Hell, with enough tarter 
sauce, who's gonna notice." 
<P>
Small group meetings with fashionably jackbooted Carol Browner 
and Clean-Water Canoeist Bruce Babbitt reassured us that even 
though the 104th Congress has eliminated all funding for 
alternative energy, there's still plenty of conventionally heated 
air and old-fashioned boilerplate in Washington. 
<P>
Being a double winner of the Browner/Babbitt lottery, I missed 
out on a plenary session in which TV reporter and regulatory 
critic John Stossel demonstrated what happens when you eliminate 
all command and control. 
<P>
The annual SEJ business meeting involved some debate over whether 
freelance reporters who also worked for advocacy groups should 
hold full memberships. One side argued that people working for 
advocacy groups lack the professional objectivity of, for 
example, broadcast journalists working for GE, Westinghouse, 
Disney, or Rupert Murdoch. The other side argued that, given 
industry trends, freelancing was the wave of the future; many a 
good story can be found while collecting used cans and papers at 
three in the morning. 
<P>
Naturalist E.O. Wilson gave a blatantly insectocentric talk on 
biodiversity at lunch, failing to point out that no ant or 
termite ever prepared yellow tapioca for 500 -- or developed a 
family of chemicals that could protect tomatoes from infestations 
while simultaneously getting male alligators to reject 
patriarchy. He did say something about trying to educate a 
southern amphibian -- although I think he'd have a better chance 
working with a chimp than a Newt. 
<P>
That evening, the Clinton Administration, responding to three 
years of student protests to "Free Al Gore," sent the Vice 
President to speak to the conference (after a few security frisks 
to make sure nobody was packing any Freon). 
<P>
After a few warm-up jokes, Al gave a stem-winding campaign speech 
in which he accused the Republican congress of practicing 
"devastation with misrepresentation" (a bit of Jesse 
Jacksonization without accreditation). Gore also made a 
convincing case for saving the rainforest by exhibiting half of 
it on stage with him. 
<P>
Sunday's whale watch tour was moved to the New England aquarium 
when tour organizers figured that given the rough winds and waves 
the only spewing seen that day would have been the SEJers. 
<P>
I myself went to the Walden Pond state complex where Thoreau 
developed his theories on simplicity. First, we checked out the 
boulder pile remains of the cabin where he wrote <EM>Walden,</EM> and 
then adjourned to the grand-elegant Thoreau Center (which he must 
have bought after selling the movie rights). Standing by the edge 
of Walden Pond that afternoon -- with the leaves changing color, 
watching ducks and cormorants splashing about in the brisk, clear 
water -- I was reminded once again why I don't cover hazardous 
waste issues. 
<P>
Still, I have to admit that after last year's scenic Sundance 
conference, and this year's intellectually brawny MIT conference, 
I'm looking forward to next year's centrally redundant conference 
at Washington University in St. Louis, a site noted primarily for 
its centrality. Oh, St. Louis where the mighty Mississippi meets 
the Army Corp of Engineers under half a McDonald's Logo. Another 
easy travel deduction.

<STRONG>By BILL McKIBBEN</STRONG> 
<P>
I decided I would cast this in the form of a report some 50 years 
hence at a future meeting of SEJ. So imagine that the year is 
2045 -- The 50th convention of the Society of Environmental 
Journalists. Some of you may have already done the quick 
calculation in your heads -- this should be the 55th convention. 
But you're forgetting the five years of travel restriction in the 
early 21st century, the so-called "No Go" era. 
<P>
...As the oldest surviving (and still lucid) member of this 
organization, I have been called upon to give you a short history 
of our brotherhood, familiar in its outline to you all, of 
course. Perhaps I can also add a slight bit of nuance to this 
account -- some sense of what if felt like to live through it. 
<P>
Thinking back 50 years I am struck by the sense of antiquity that 
surrounds that earlier era. To give you just one small example, 
the majority of our colleagues at that time worked in the medium 
of print! Their work is preserved in SEJ's museum. 
<P>
You will be struck even more when I tell you that at the time, 
though our Society was a lively one, the environment was a 
largely peripheral concern. The world still viewed itself 
primarily through an economic prism, and decisions were made 
about issues of policy based on the answer to the question, "is 
this good for the growth of our economy or not?" Environmental 
specialists were concerned about what seemed at the time a large, 
but limited, set of problems. We reported on what we thought were 
mistakes in an otherwise reasonably sound system. 
<P>
In fact, in those early years we spent much of our time debating 
the question of whether people were making more progress than 
regress; whether the problems that the country was solving would 
outnumber the ones that would arise. The organization contented 
itself for the most part with uncovering these small threats and 
debating their significance. 
<P>
You must remember that among our audiences, and among most 
citizens at the time, on their list of priorities the environment 
ranked somewhere below basketball (but perhaps above bowling) as 
a cause of interest and concern. There was an occasional sense of 
foreboding that animated our work. Our first true environmental 
politician (Albert Gore) had urged, for instance, that 
environment needed to become the central organizing principle of 
the future. However, even he -- in his single term in office -- 
showed very little sign that he was organizing his own life in 
this way. 
<P>
There was an oft-repeated truism that some of those who spoke at 
those early conventions engaged in: that we had 10 years in which 
to solve our environmental problems (or else face some 
unspecified disaster). Since people had been saying this for 
perhaps 20 years, almost all of us were taken aback when it 
actually turned out to be true. 
<P>
Looking back at the archives, perhaps the year 1995 is as good as 
a starting point as any for the dawning of the new and darker era 
we've spent most of our professional lives in -- that was in fact 
the warmest year on record, to date. This meant that all 10 of 
the warmest years on record had occurred in a 15-year stretch of 
time. It was a year that saw the then-unprecedented list of 
hurricanes (extending well into the S's or T's of the alphabet). 
Today, we don't find uncommon -- but at that time it was strange, 
almost startling. 
<P>
Our stories were transformed. In retrospect, a key realization 
(the key realization), was that the most profound sorts of 
environmental damage came not from small mistakes around the 
margins and the edges, but (most powerfully and most importantly) 
from processes that seemed on their face to be the very stuff of 
normal society. They simply were occurring at such a high volume 
-- and so quickly -- that the earth could not sustain them. 
<P>
Of course, the warming -- the warming -- was the most obvious and 
the most profound. 
<P>
There was a regular sense of crisis to our work in those years, 
as it turned out that in fact we really had reached certain 
limits. Not all of the pinches came in the places where we 
expected. Food prices, for instance, increased swiftly at times 
after long periods of drought -- especially as growing 
populations turned surplus grain supplies into mere pipeline 
amounts exquisitely vulnerable to any disruption (even temporary 
ones). 
<P>
Of course, as always in history, those shifts and instabilities 
in food prices led to deep political instability. Extreme events, 
including extreme meteorological events, became more and more 
common. Eventually, every phenomenon was blamed on some 
environmental outrage. "It's the damn greenhouse effect!" 
replaced the older "We need the rain!" as an elevator greeting. 
<P>
The environmental movement was transformed too, of course, since 
everyone became an environmentalist in some way. There was no 
more real need for an Audubon Society than there had been for an 
Adam Smith Club in an earlier era. 
<P>
Of course there were many, many shades of opinion -- ranging from 
those who sought salvation through technology to those 
environmentalists of an earlier age (on the more radical fringe) 
who found themselves always pushing for decentralization, for 
smaller-scale solutions, for increased self sufficiency, for a 
retreat from the extreme globalization of trade (and of culture) 
that had marked the end of the 20th century. 
<P>
Simultaneously, of course, we were forced to take the rest of the 
world seriously for the first time. Environmentalism was forced 
to transform itself into an idea that dealt with the most 
profound issues of wealth and of poverty. The W.T.P. (Wealth 
Transfer Protocols) negotiated with China and India were at the 
heart of foreign policy concerns for more than a decade, once 
those countries realized that demographic power (not to mention 
concentrations of coal reserves) gave them un-trumpable 
bargaining chips. I won't bother you with the details, and as we 
get closer to the present day you know them anyway. 
<P>
Suffice it to say that by now we have come through the 
bottleneck, come through the 50 years that saw maximum 
population, maximum toxic loading, maximum loss of ozone, maximum 
levels of extinction, and maximum combustion of fossil fuels. 
<P>
The question we still have not answered, the question that now 
dominates our work as environmental journalists, is: how severely 
did that half century of stress degrade our physical resources? 
And how soon, if ever, will they bounce back to the levels we 
enjoyed when we first met as a professional organization. 
<P>
It has been a bruising 50 years, and we must content ourselves 
with the knowledge that we had front-row seats at the great 
historical epoch of our time, that we have been what the war 
correspondents were to an earlier age. A mixed blessing of 
course, because we've seen first hand the passing of many things 
we would like not to have seen pass away. But for journalists, it 
has been an exciting, powerful, and important time.

<A NAME = "conference4"><H4>1995 Conference: Members Talk Back</H4></A>

<STRONG>By JAY LETTO </STRONG>
<P>
Three main points are evident from compiling attendees' 
evaluations from the `95 conference. All of these points have 
also been true of previous SEJ conferences: 
<P>
<ul><li>In general, the 1995 conference garnered rave reviews -- as did 
past conferences. 
<P>
<LI>Networking continues to be cited as the most important and 
attractive aspect of our conferences. 
<P>
<LI>Reactions to particular speakers, panels and other sessions, 
and tours, are so varied that one simply cannot categorize the 
opinion of our membership -- it is much too diverse. 
</ul><P>
SEJ members just can't seem to get enough time to schmooze at our 
conferences. At '94's Utah conference, attendees reported over 
and over that they want more time to network. So, for '95, we 
built in half-hour breaks between the sessions (instead of the 
standard 15 minutes), we left Friday evening open (instead of 
talks or salons), we skipped speakers on some of the tour buses, 
and we scheduled two receptions for members to mingle. Still, in 
'95 attendees said that this was not enough! 
<P>
Here's a sampling of responses: "Connecting with renowned 
journalists and scientists the main attraction;" "Friday night 
free -- do that again;" "Need more time for socializing;" "Need 
more time to network;" and "Great, but SEJ board should make more 
effort to introduce themselves in special-event situations." 
<P>
So, for 1996 in St. Louis, we've decided to forgo all keynoters, 
cancel the plenaries, skip the concurrent sessions and tours, and 
simply have one big weekend party. (Just kidding, of course.) 
However, we will try to accommodate the continuing request for 
more networking opportunities -- while at the same time providing 
a full, diverse, and worthwhile program. 
<P>
The SEJ office received 31 evaluation forms (as of November 30) 
from attendees of the `95 annual conference (a more than five 
percent sampling of the total attendance). Nine of them said they 
filed stories from the conference on such topics as new board 
members, Browner talk, Gore challenge to GOP, E.O. Wilson 
comments on Gingrich, airborne particulates, Times-Mirror poll, 
electric cars, fisheries, and "scaring the world to death." If 
this can be extrapolated to the full attendance (which might be a 
reach), than perhaps as many as 150 stories were filed from the 
`95 conference. 
<P>
Of the 31 respondents, 26 wrote glowing comments under the basic 
evaluation question, including: "Array of speakers superb;" 
"Another well-planned, informative and dynamic conference;" 
"Session topics were a good balance between hard factual stuff 
and subjective, philosophical topics;" "As always, panels offered 
excellent overviews of the beat's major topics;" "Fantastic -- as 
an environmental reporter at a small daily newspaper, this 
conference was a wonderful opportunity to rub shoulders with the 
best in the biz;" and "A good mix of indoor and outdoor sessions, 
as well as topical and vocational discussions." 
<P>
Among the few complaints and many general suggestions were: 
"Somewhat disappointing compared  to previous years, as it was 
harder to  feel the conference coalesce;" "Impressed with caliber 
of speakers,  but want more practical workshops;" "Need stronger 
moderators to maintain speakers' time limits and cut off  
personal attacks;" "Skip large panels and spread out the smaller 
workshops;" "Republicans' views needed to be represented;" 
"Conference suffered from lack of Hill staff and members of 
Congress;" and "Far too heavily weighted with Democrats, need 
more conservative voices." 
<P>
The lack of political balance (missing GOP and/or Congressional 
representatives) was noted by several respondents. Conference 
organizers worked tirelessly in an effort to attract Republican 
Congressional leaders, Governors, and Presidential candidates to 
our event. Indeed, the Friday afternoon plenary "What's New in 
Washington?" was supposed to a platform for the candidates and/or 
Congressional leaders. The candidates, all of whom were invited, 
gave various excuses for not attending. Speaker of the House Newt 
Gingrich was seriously considering attending for several months, 
but eventually turned us down owing to a scheduling conflict. 
Finally, the countless Majority leaders and committee chairs we 
invited turned us down, they said, because of the impending 
budget debate. Their collective absence was probably the 
conference organizers biggest disappointment. 
<P>
In an effort to compensate for this hole, we pursued various 
conservative voices in the final days before the conference and 
managed (at considerable expense) to secure both LaVarr Webb, 
Deputy for Policy for Utah's Republican Governor Mike Leavitt, 
and former Republican Senator Malcolm Wallop. 
<P>
Attendees really liked E.O. Wilson -- several named him as their 
favorite speaker. Comments included: "An honor to hear him;" 
"Great brain food for lunch;" "I could listen to him for hours;" 
"The high point;" "Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful;" and 
"Pleasure to listen to the Darwin of our century." 
<P>
On the other hand attendees were really turned off by ABC's John 
Stossel, though most of them praised the session he participated 
in ("Environmental Journalism Ethics: Are We Scaring the World to 
Death?"). Stossel elicited some seemingly emotionally charged 
negative responses. In all, 21 respondents wrote about this 
session, 12 of them specifically blasting Stossel with comments 
such as, "I was almost `scared to death' by John Stossel -- a 
lively session on egos;" "Stossel's conduct was not appropriate;" 
"Stossel is an egomaniac with a pedestrian mind -- the topic was 
good, but he didn't deserve the stage;" "I could have done 
without Stossel's personal attacks on other panelists;" 
"Certainly lively, but I didn't like Stossel's attack on 
Silbergeld;" and "Stossel didn't seem like a nice man -- but the 
exchange was provocative." 
<P>
At least one attendee saw this session differently: "The 
treatment of John Stossel by the audience was the low point of 
the conference. It was a good move by David Ropeik to apologize 
on the scene." 
<P>
The opening plenary, "The Environment and the Mood of America," 
was well received -- with 19 generally saying it was good, while 
four thought it was bad. Most respondents liked the diversity of 
views and the exchange between Carol Browner and Malcolm Wallop, 
and thought Michael Dukakis was a terrific moderator. However, 
several felt there were too many panelists and a couple thought 
that the topic was not useful. 
<P>
As in previous conferences, the tours were popular -- although 
attendees would like to be outdoors more, and to have SEJ members 
and/or local reporters leading them (rather than PR people). The 
"Greenwashing" panel had the largest audience of all the 
concurrent sessions and received the most praise. We will likely 
do a follow-up session on this topic next year. The CEOs panel 
also was highly praised in the evaluations, though attendance was 
only about 50. 
<P>
Audience size was very well dispersed among concurrent sessions 
this year, with a high of about 100 in "Greenwashing," a low of 
25 in "New England Fisheries" and "Basic Reporting," and the rest 
of the sessions attracting 40 to 80 attendees. This is unlike 
past years, where some sessions would attract the bulk of 
attendees and other sessions were nearly empty. 
<P>
This year's expanded computer sessions were also very popular 
with attendees. Comments include: "Excellent, I got my money's 
worth attending these;" "Invite NICAR back;" "Good handouts;" 
"Amy Gahran really knows her stuff;" "What an eye-opener, give me 
more;" and "Useful and a good chance to explore what's 
available." 
<P>
All of the Walden Pond/Thoreau Institute sessions were also quite 
popular. We will probably have some similar sessions (authors' 
panel and environmental history) next year. 
<P>
Finally, we just can't seem to find the right time or format for 
the annual membership meeting. In past years we would save one of 
the late afternoons for the meeting, but found that many members 
were "meetinged-out" by that time. This year we tried early 
morning, but attracted possibly the worst attendance yet. Perhaps 
next year we'll offer free cocktails.

<P>
M'hammed Rebah writes a weekly environmental column for Le Matin 
in Alger, Algeria. What does he believe his major problem is? Is 
it getting enough column space, or editorial support, or even 
censorship? No. It is getting killed. In the last three years 
M'hammed says that 40 journalists in Algeria have been killed by 
religious extremists -- including four at his own paper. 
<P>
I was a Spanish and French translator for some of our 
international journalists at the annual SEJ conference. I 
attended two international panels workshops and had some 
enjoyable and informative conversations with our guests. However, 
it seemed I never had enough time at our annual SEJ meeting -- 
being surrounded by so many wonderful people and with such 
interesting panels happening simultaneously. 
<P>
In Romania, journalist Dan Stoica says that there is no 
equivalent of the Freedom of Information Act. Environmental 
journalists are censored and sued for reporting -- and they 
cannot legally obtain information to defend themselves. Other 
East European journalists said that just getting paid for their 
work is an accomplishment. When I asked Mike Anane of <EM>The Triumph</EM> 
(Ghana) what his most serious problems were, he did not mention 
the droughts, food shortages, migrations from the Sahel, or even 
population growth. He answered, "World Bank policies." 
<P>
Darryl D'Monte of India voiced strong opposition to the Montreal 
protocols on CFC reduction. He stated that the reduction schedule 
was weighted in favor of "already-industrialized" countries. 
Manuel Satorre of the Philippines spoke articulately of how the 
International Bank of Reconstruction and Development had financed 
ill-conceived projects during the Marcos era. He said that all 
that remains of many of these projects is environmental 
devastation and massive international debt. 
<P>
I often learned more from the international journalists after the 
panels were over. They too were having difficulty getting 
published. 
<P>
A woman from France said that she thought that news sources were 
eliminating full-time positions and using more freelancers 
instead. 
<P>
Valentin Thurn of Germany helps produce an environmental program 
for public TV in Germany. He said that with the advent of private 
television in Germany, his program time has been cut in half. 
There is pressure to compete with the "entertainment format" of 
private TV, and he must now sacrifice depth of coverage. Have we 
heard this before? 
<P>
Masud Khan of Bangladesh said that the same news organizations 
pay much less to Bangladesh citizens than they do to 
internationals for the same work in his country. 
<P>
Here are some informal impressions that I heard from our 
international guests. One, they universally loved the trip to 
Woods Hole. They were fascinated by the science and the 
international cooperation, and enjoyed the intellectual level of 
MIT and of Cambridge in general. Several complimented the quality 
and availability of the scientists on the panels. Many were 
honored that Vice-President Gore would show up. One was surprised 
that the visible security was not more intense. "And not a 
machine gun in sight!" she commented. The hors d'oeurvres were 
good, the alcohol bad (and expensive), and the meals 
satisfactory. Unfortunately, the Boston area was very expensive! 
<P>
What complaints did I hear? One was about how we spoke English. 
Rapidly, in slang, and with the common U.S. assumption that 
everyone speaks like us (or ought to). A more serious complaint 
was about how few U.S. journalists attended the international 
sessions. At the International Journalists Roundtable, I counted 
only five people from the United States. Several journalists 
commented that this was sad, but typical of the U.S. mentality of 
just paying attention to our own affairs and thinking that we are 
the center of the universe. European journalists added that they 
also had a bad habit of just covering local issues. 
<P>
Perhaps the most serious complaint that I heard from the 
international journalists came from those from what is called 
"the south." Many said that first-world environmental programs 
did not consider third-world human problems of poverty and 
environmental justice. Many felt that the journalists of the 
north were not acknowledging enough responsibility for the 
environmental damage inflicted upon them by multinationals and 
World Bank programs. They were saying that we "just didn't get 
it" when it came to their problems. Perhaps we have more to learn 
from our guests.

<A NAME = "conference6"><H4>Cautious Advice to U.S. Environmental Journalists</H4></A>

Based on my experience from living overseas for over six years, 
learning to speak several languages, and freelancing 
international environmental pieces, I have some thoughts on how 
American journalists can improve communications -- and relations 
-- with their colleagues from other parts of the world. 
<P>
<ul><li>We should speak English slowly and distinctly, without using 
slang, idiomatic expressions, or difficult words. It is enough to 
ask of our guests to speak basic English. We cannot expect them 
to speak like us. Always imagine yourself in a comparable 
situation. How would you be coping if everyone around you was 
speaking Spanish, or Russian? Also, keep in mind that it is 
embarrassing for someone to say that they do not understand what 
is being said to them. Therefore, do not assume that our 
international colleagues automatically understand what we are 
saying, even if they nod their heads and say that they do. I make 
a habit of periodically asking whomever I am with if they 
understand me. 
<P>
<LI>It is vital that we learn other languages, and that our 
children do too. International understanding is too important for 
us not to. I have found that when our guests discover a North 
American who actually speaks something other than English, they 
are pleasantly surprised. Taking the time to learn another 
language is a way of saying to others that they are important. 
International citizens often feel that we suffer from an extreme 
case of mono-cultural and mono-lingual disease. The good news is 
that, with some hard work, this is curable. 
<P>
<LI>We should be thoughtful when referring to nationalities. At the 
SEJ conference, I heard two things that I think we all should be 
aware of. One SEJ member continued referring to our guests as 
"foreign" journalists. "International" would have been a more 
appropriate term. I also heard our members referring to ourselves 
as "Americans" in front of Central and South American 
journalists. Are they not also Americans? Amongst international 
company, I refer to myself as a "North American" or a "citizen of 
the United States." Central and South Americans sometimes are 
offended at our expropriation of the term "American," although 
often they are too polite to mention it. 
<P>
<li>We should be aware of, and accepting of, cultural differences. 
Cultures vary immensely. For instance, when I speak Swahili to an 
African man, we often hold hands. In sub-Saharan Africa, this is 
a proper show of friendship and brotherhood -- it has none of the 
connotations that it would have in the U.S. However, to hold a 
woman's hand in public in rural Africa could be considered 
inappropriate. What universals can we apply for other cultures? 
Smiles, for one. Everyone recognizes a smile and feels 
comfortable with it. There is no substitute for genuine curiosity 
about another's culture and country. Asking questions about 
another's home does wonders. You may be surprised at how much you 
will learn. It is my impression that Europeans generally know 
about 10 times as much about the U.S. as we know about them. With 
Africans, Japanese, and Chinese, I would estimate this ratio to 
be one-hundred to one.

<A NAME = "conference7"><H4>Minutes of the Fifth Annual Meeting of the Membership of SEJ</H4></A>
<P>
October 28, 1995 
<P>
SEJ's FIFTH ANNUAL MEETING, held at Kresge Auditorium on the 
campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was called 
to order at 8:05 a.m. by Emilia Askari, SEJ president. 
<P>
After welcoming comments, Askari introduced SEJ Executive 
Director Beth Parke, who offered a briefing on the financial and 
organizational health of the society. Parke said the society was 
very healthy but not wealthy, having operating reserves of six to 
nine months. Many non-profit groups don't have the luxury of 
reserves, operating month-to-month. Of the society's $300,000 
annual budget, one half is dedicated to the annual conference. 
Parke noted that 60 percent of the society's funding comes from 
grants from nonprofit foundations, and she is courting media 
companies for support. SEJ does not accept money from special 
interest groups of any type. She said that the organization's 
monthly financial reports are available upon request to any 
member. 
<P>
Askari introduced Julie Edelson, one of SEJ's founders, who was 
departing the board. She also recognized outgoing board member 
Wevonneda Minis. Both chose not to seek re-election. 
<P>
Askari turned the floor over to Kevin Carmody, board secretary, 
to conduct the annual election. Because 80 active members had 
cast absentee ballots, an automatic quorum of 10 percent of the 
active membership (69 members) existed for the board election. In 
the event other matters requiring a quorum were brought to the 
floor at the Annual Meeting, there was an attempt to certify a 
quorum, but it was determined by a show of hands that only 59 
active members were present. Carmody said that a quorum could be 
established if, by a show of hands later in the meeting, 10 or 
more active members were among the latecomers. 
<P>
Candidates for the regular seats on the SEJ Board of Directors 
were introduced and given two minutes to make candidacy 
statements. The nine candidates were Russ Clemings of the <EM>Fresno 
Bee,</EM> Marla Cone of the <EM>Los Angeles Times,</EM> Bowman Cox of Pasha 
Publication's <EM>Defense Cleanup</EM> newsletter, Erin Hayes of ABC News, 
Gary Polakovic of the <EM>Riverside</EM> (Calif.) <EM>Press-Enterprise,</EM> Sara 
Thurin Rollin of BNA's <EM>Chemical Regulation Reporter</EM> and <EM>Daily 
Environment Report,</EM> David Ropeik of Boston's WCVB-TV, freelance 
reporter Nancy Shute and Angela Swafford of the <EM>Miami Herald's</EM> 
Spanish-language edition. 
<P>
For the first time, both academic and associate members were able 
to elect a non-voting board member to represent each membership 
category. Those candidates were also offered the opportunity to 
make a two-minute statement. The candidates for the ex-officio 
position representing academic members were JoAnn Valenti of the 
Brigham Young University faculty and Amy Seirer, a student at 
Drake University and former SEJ staff intern. The only candidate 
for the associate member position was Adlai Amor of the Center 
for Foreign Journalists. 
<P>
There were no bylaws amendments on the ballot. Ballots were 
distributed using lists of members who had not voted absentee. 
Each of the three membership classes voted only for their own 
representatives. A volunteer election committee including Chris 
Rigel of the SEJ staff, Perry Beeman of the <EM>Des Moines Register</EM> 
and Heather Dewar of Knight Ridder's Washington Bureau then 
retired to count the ballots. 
<P>
Vice President Rae Tyson opened a discussion about how the 
society determines membership eligibility and how it deals with 
members and applicants who do not clearly meet membership 
criteria. Tyson said that the society's bylaws and the board 
interpretation of them has not changed since SEJ's founding: that 
the board recently reaffirmed the founders' vision that SEJ is an 
organization of journalists and educators and that, under the 
bylaws, any involvement in public relations activities makes 
someone ineligible for any category of membership. The gray area, 
Tyson said, involves the associate category, which was created to 
allow membership by freelancers and others who might not derive 
the majority of their income from journalism, but whose 
contribution to the public discourse warrants their participation 
in SEJ. The criteria for associate membership was intentionally 
left somewhat vague, with decisions on applications to be made by 
the membership committee or its designee. Tyson said that a 
review of the membership has revealed some inconsistency in the 
way some of those decisions have been made, and a few cases in 
which people have intentionally or unintentionally misrepresented 
themselves to become members. Tyson said the board and staff are 
reviewing the matter to determine the best way to keep the 
process consistent and fair, while protecting the society's 
integrity. Tyson invited questions and comments. 
<P>
Kris Thoemke, who serves on the board of the Outdoor Writers 
Association, said his group requires a membership committee to 
act on each application and has a process in which current 
members can comment on the whether an applicant deserves 
membership. Tyson noted that SEJ bylaws offer due process, in 
which someone denied membership or switched to a different 
category can appeal the decision up to the Board of Directors. 
Removal of a member requires a vote of the board. A staff writer 
for <EM>South Carolina Sea Grant,</EM> who did not offer his name, said 
the line for Sea Grant staff and freelancers is fuzzy, and asked 
if SEJ could consider the quality of someone's writing to 
determine if someone was primarily a journalist. Tyson responded 
that judging quality of writing would take the society down a 
dangerous path. Will Nixon, former editor of <EM>E</EM> magazine, said 
that under current criteria, SEJ might be losing people who are 
very good journalists. Whitman Bassow of <EM>Tomorrow Magazine</EM> said 
1. Everyone needs to remember that SEJ is not an accrediting 
organization. 2. The world will little remember, once you're 
gone, whether you were an active or an associate member of SEJ. 
3. The SEJ board needs to be tough if it is to protect the 
integrity of the organization, and must make clear whatever it 
stands for. Stephen Wittman of the Sea Grant program at the 
University of Wisconsin said that as employees of a public 
university, Sea Grant staff are not allowed to take sides in a 
partisan debate, and for most, their public relations functions, 
like giving tours, are incidental to their journalistic work. 
Tyson concluded the discussion by stating that one of the reasons 
SEJ is reviewing the matter so carefully is the dilemma posed by 
the duties of the Sea Grant staff. 
<P>
Carmody conducted another show of hands to certify a quorum. It 
confirmed at least 10 of the latecomers to the meeting were 
active members, and a quorum was so certified. 
<P>
Askari opened to floor to member comments, other business and 
announcements. Paul MacClennan of the <EM>Buffalo News</EM> said the 
society had grown to the point that there is a need for a system 
of better overall accountability for society affairs. He said he 
would like to have the society distribute a list of board member 
attendance and information on when terms expire. He said he was 
pleased to hear about the availability of monthly financial 
statements, but was concerned by the use color-coded badges at 
the conference. Adam Glenn of Tufts University thanked the board 
for producing what Glenn termed a uniformly superb conference, 
but he expressed concern about the loss of social time on 
Saturday night Stewart Leavenworth of the <EM>Raleigh News & Observer</EM> 
praised the conference quality, but expressed concern about 
conferences being more expensive to attend each year. Carmody 
said that the 1996 conference at Washington University in St. 
Louis would offer low-cost air connections from many parts of the 
county and lodging at about half the cost in Boston. Gary Lee of 
the <EM>Washington Post</EM> complimented the organization for way the 
conference fosters camaraderie among journalists from across the 
nation and world. Board member Amy Gahran said the society owed a 
lot to Russ Clemings for his work in setting up some of SEJ's 
online services, including the web page, and for coordinating the 
computer-training programs at the conference. 
<P>
Carmody announced that the election committee had not completed 
its tabulations and the results of the elections would be 
announced during the luncheon featuring E.O. WIlson. As later 
announced, those elected as regular board members were: Russ 
Clemings, Marla Cone, Erin Hayes, David Ropeik and Angela 
Swafford. Because one person would fill an unexpired two-year 
term, the five electees would later draw straws to determine who 
would serve the shorter term. Academic members elected JoAnn 
Valenti to fill the three-year ex-officio seat, while Adlai Amor 
was elected by the associate membership to be its ex-officio 
representative. 
<P>
The meeting was adjourned at 9:50 a.m.

<H3>Report from the Society's President:</H3>
<A NAME="president"><H4>Banana Bills Sprout Threats: Some Question Constitutionality of 
Outlawing Fruit-Defaming</H4></A> 


<STRONG>By EMILIA ASKARI </STRONG>
<P>
I grew up during the long, tortuous end of the Vietnam War, when 
it was fashionable to denounce the U.S. government, burn flags, 
and wear bracelets engraved with the names of soldiers missing in 
action. 
<P>
I had one of the bracelets but I never burned a flag. I didn't 
even denounce our government -- at least not our entire 
government, at least not very loudly. 
<P>
I also had cousins in Iran who lived under a regime that cut off 
thieves' hands and jailed people for speaking against the king. 
Even as a child, I understood why my family chose this country. I 
was -- and am -- proud to be American. 
<P>
Nevertheless, I cringed in mid-December when the votes of just 
three senators prevented Congress from sending to the states a 
proposed new version of the First Amendment, one that would 
outlaw flag-burning. This margin was too close for my comfort. 
The next time around, the flag-burning measure may well pass. 
<P>
I oppose this because I fear any change to the Bill of Rights 
could open the door to more. Although I have no urge to torch Old 
Glory, I believe that our overstuffed court system should not be 
additionally burdened with the few people who do. 
<P>
The attempt to outlaw flag burning is just one of several recent 
legislative initiatives that threaten long-standing laws and 
traditions affecting journalists. 
<P>
Earlier in 1995, some government officials and members of 
Congress were seriously considering curtailing 
"government-in-the-sunshine" laws. Thanks in part to the vigorous response of 
organizations such as the Society of Professional Journalists and 
the American Society of Newspaper Editors, that effort seems to 
be on hold. 
<P>
Meanwhile, a dozen states since 1991 have passed laws that make 
it a crime to defame fruit and produce. Environmental journalists 
are partly to blame for this spate of laws known as "banana 
bills." They grew out of controversy caused by coverage of the 
apple fungicide, Alar. 
<P>
As many SEJ members recall, the Natural Resources Defense Council 
in 1989 issued a report called <EM>"Intolerable Risk: Pesticides in 
our Children's Food."</EM> According to the NRDC, Alar residue on 
apples exposed children to an intolerable cancer risk. 
<P>
Coverage of the NRDC report contributed to the banning of Alar's 
use on apples. It also caused a temporary but dramatic plunge in 
the apple market. In response, food producers throughout the land 
have attempted to protect their businesses by attempting to 
punish those who would say or write unkind things about their 
products. 
<P>
Louisiana was the first state to adopt such a law, which also 
forbids the defaming of seafood. By now, according to Paul 
McMasters of the Freedom Forum, the roster of states that have 
adopted some version of this law includes Alabama, Arizona, 
Colorado (where fruit defaming is a felony), Florida, Georgia, 
Idaho, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Texas. In 
addition, both houses of the Ohio legislature have passed the 
bill, which in late 1995 was in conference committee. 
<P>
"I predict there'll be a lot more of them," said McMasters, whose 
title is First Amendment Ombudsman. "They really need to be 
covered (in the media)." 
<P>
So far, no one has been charged under the bills. If and when that 
happens, it is likely that the state law in question will be 
challenged for constitutionality. Until then, the bills are 
likely to have a chilling impact on environmental reporters, 
especially those who work for smaller media outlets that can't 
afford a long and costly legal battle. 
<P>
As American journalists, we are trained to avoid taking sides, to 
cloak our opinions about the news we cover. As environmental 
journalists, many of us are doubly careful to avoid any 
appearance of partisanship. On this beat, like no other, our 
audience often assumes that we stand always with environmental 
activists and the Democratic party. So, many of us register to 
vote as independents. We avoid signing petitions, and we pay the 
higher, non-member subscription rates for magazines published by 
environmental groups. We search for neutral mutual funds in which 
to invest our savings. 
<P>
This is an obsession particular to American journalists. In other 
countries (including many with governments and economies similar 
to ours) journalists are assumed -- and allowed -- to be aligned 
with the commentators published or broadcast by their employers. 
Not so here, for the most part -- even though some environmental 
journalists consider themselves to be in favor of a healthy 
environment the way many political reporters support the 
democratic system. 
<P>
Environmental journalists who work for alternative media often 
state their partisanship for the planet in even stronger terms. 
Also, the rise of so-called "civic journalism" has muddied the 
waters still further recently -- with many news organizations now 
officially acknowledging that they care about their communities 
and want to see them improve. Critics worry that this caring 
embrace could lead to boosterish coverage of some issues. 
Proponents of so-called civic journalism say this approach simply 
makes reporting more relevant and human. 
<P>
Not surprisingly, media corporations that have championed civic 
journalism have applied their caring to issues such as voter 
registration (for it) and racism (against it). These positions 
are accepted by the vast majority of Americans. However, since 
there is less consensus on environmental issues, civic journalism 
appears to be more difficult to practice in this arena. 
<P>
Despite our many different approaches, I think there are some 
issues on which all U.S. journalists can agree to take a stand. 
The First Amendment is one of them. Government-in-the-sunshine 
laws and the so-called banana bills are another. 
<P>
We should stand against the passage of banana bills and against 
changes to the first amendment and sunshine laws. We should take 
these stands not because passing of banana bills and changing the 
first amendment and sunshine laws iconveniences us. Such legal 
actions also could decrease the quality, timliness and accuracy 
of information reaching the public. 
<P>
That's something we should denounce -- completely and loudly.

Who should manage public land, for what purpose? Controversy on 
these questions is as old as the United States itself, and the 
history of public land management is marked both with achievement 
and with scandal. 
<P>
Now the debate has been renewed.. House bill HR2032 (sponsored by 
Utah Republican James Hansen), and Senate bill S1031 (sponsored 
by Wyoming Republican Craig Thomas), propose transferring to the 
states the surface, water, and mineral rights in lands currently 
managed by the federal Bureau of Land Management.

<A NAME="viewpoints2"><H4>Federal Land Transfer: Why and How?</H4></A>

<STRONG>by ROBERT H. NELSON</STRONG> 
<P>
Asked at his confirmation hearing whether he favored a transfer 
of federal lands in the west to the states, former Interior 
Secretary James Watt said, in essence, no. Watt represented the 
traditional Western attitude toward the federal government, 
described by novelist Wallace Stegner as "get out, and give us 
more money." 
<P>
That approach will no longer work. The federal government's 
financial capabilities are likely to be restrained by budget 
considerations over the next decade, limiting its ability to pay 
for public land management. There is also a growing discontent in 
the west with the quality of federal land management, coupled 
with a general alienation from Washington. 
<P>
Consequently Congress is once again considering the idea of 
transferring some of its lands in the west to the states. In 
1930, the Hoover administration offered some lands to the western 
states but proposed to retain the minerals rights. This offer was 
rejected. In the so-called "Sagebrush Rebellion" of the late 
1970s, many western state legislatures passed resolutions asking 
for the transfer of federal lands. The Reagan administration and 
environmentalists, however discouraged the effort. 
<P>
Federal lands comprise a full 47 percent of the land areas of the 
11 westernmost lower-48 states (83 percent of Nevada, 68 percent 
of Alaska, 64 percent of Utah, 62 percent of Idaho, and 44 
percent of California). There is more federal land in California 
than the total area of Washington State. 
<P>
This huge federal presence is not based on any special 
relationship between the federal government and the states. In 
fact, most matters decided by federal administrators of this vast 
domain, like recreational or grazing use, would be state and 
local issues elsewhere in the United States. In the rural west, 
the federal government effectively functions as a local planning 
and zoning board. 
<P>
Today the political and economic forces supporting a transfer of 
federal lands to the states are much broader than during the 
Sagebrush Rebellion. In fact, this time, the possibility of 
transferring federal lands -- if the west decides this is what it 
really wants -- is greater than ever before. 
<P>
The leading candidates for transfer are the 268 million acres, 
mostly in the west, managed by the Bureau of Land Management 
(BLM). The BLM, established in 1946, combined the old General 
Land Office and the federal Grazing Service to manage lands like 
national parks never included in earlier systems. The BLM also 
manages energy and mineral resources on all federal lands, not 
just its own, giving it partial jurisdiction over 732 million 
acres. 
<P>
In any deliberations over transfer options, finances will play a 
prominent role. The additional revenues that would go to the 
states under a full transfer of BLM lands are substantial -- $575 
million in 1992. 
<P>
The states would incur costs, too. If the western states took 
over all the lands and minerals now managed by the BLM (and 
assuming the states' land management costs were about equal to 
BLM's, even though the states would no doubt act to cut the 
bloated BLM bureaucracy), a representative western state would 
receive about $20 to $30 million a year less in new revenues than 
its new management costs (based on 1992 figures). 
<P>
There is, however, considerable variation in costs from state to 
state. New Mexico and Wyoming would experience large positive 
fiscal impacts because of the federal oil, gas, or coal resources 
there. Alaska would experience a hefty negative fiscal impact 
(about $100 million a year) because of the large BLM presence 
there, high costs, and few revenues generated on federal lands. 
Most Alaskan oil production is on state lands. 
<P>
Overall, given that a typical western state would be taking 
possession of something like a quarter of its land, the added 
fiscal burdens do not seem unmanageable. They are not of such a 
magnitude that they would be the single determining factor. 
<P>
The more important consideration would be the confidence that 
westerners have in their own state governments and other 
political institutions to manage the land. And here is fear of 
the unknown. How would such a basic change alter land-tenure 
arrangements? Terms of grazing permits, mining exploration, 
hunting and fishing access, and other matters have been worked 
out over many years with various federal agencies. Turning these 
responsibilities over to state agencies would create giant 
uncertainties among historic users of the public lands. 
<P>
But if the states took possession of BLM lands, they would, in 
fact, have many options. They could manage all or some of the 
lands at the state level, transfer land to local governments, 
create public corporations, contract with nonprofit groups to 
manage lands, offer long-term leases, or privatize some lands 
outright. One of the major advantages of state control is that it 
would allow for much greater innovation and experimentation. The 
states, after all, have traditionally been "laboratories" of the 
federal system. 
<P>
Doubtlessly, any major change in land tenure would disrupt 
long-standing political, financial and legal networks, and other 
relationships. But in the long run, western states would very 
likely be better off, the lands more efficiently managed and more 
beneficially used in the service of future generations. Historic 
federal dominance has kept much of the west in a condition of 
political and economic adolescence. Now is the time for an 
informed national debate of the merits of ending federal 
ownership of such vast areas of the western states.

<A NAME="viewpoints3"><H4>Land Management: Can States Do Better?</H4></A>

<STRONG>By SALLY K. FAIRFAX</STRONG> 
<P>
The nation is wrangling again over the legitimacy of government 
ownership of land. While the dust-up seems familiar, it would be 
a mistake to paint the present conversation with the story lines 
of the past. The outcome is likely to be the same -- all the 
protagonists are so subsidized by present management that unless 
the budget cutters and market advocates gain considerable steam 
in Congress, federal ownership will survive. 
<P>
Nonetheless, the new debate is different in ways that reflect 
deep changes in both western and national politics. This should 
be instructive to journalists who take resource management 
seriously. The states emerge as important players in this altered 
context -- but could they do a better job of land management than 
federal agencies? 
<P>
The new debate is distinguished by an explicit concentration on 
the appropriate level of decision making. The emergence of a new 
kind of environmental interest group gives vitality to the 
western expression of this national phenomenon: grass-roots 
environmental groups are challenging both national preservation 
groups and commodity interests. These new local groups are 
defined by their incluslion of not only environmentalists, but 
also business people and workers who have recognized their mutual 
dependence on sustainable management of regional resources. The 
heart of the new emphasis is to build a public land politics 
based on community, place, and civic responsibility at a local 
(and arguably more ecologically appropriate and human) scale. 
<P>
Thus, debate over land title emerges as a part of a growing 
consensus that local democracy is vital in the decision-making 
process about federal public land. What mixture of title, 
process, and accountability would enhance local responsibility? 
<P>
States are enjoying unusual attention in this discussion, largely 
because the states' experience in land management differs 
significantly from that of federal agencies. Much state land was 
granted by Congress when states joined the union. This land is 
held in trust because it was intended for the benefit of public 
schools and public institutions. State land trustees presently 
manage about 155 million surface and subsurface acres -- almost 
twice the National Park Service's 80-plus million acres, and 
close to the Forest Service's 183 million acres. 
<P>
State trust land management is subject to a familiar mandate and 
a rich set of well-understood rules. Just like any trust for a 
grandchild's education (or similar goal), the beneficiary and the 
courts will hold the trustee accountable for making the trust 
corpus productive for the beneficiary. State programs appear to 
be a reasonable middle way to achieve cost-effectiveness while 
maintaining public control and benefit because of this mandate. 
<P>
The states' experience is suggestive for three reasons. First, it 
addresses the issues of inefficiency and improper incentives to 
bureaucrats that figure prominently in critiques of the current 
system. 
<P>
Second, this emphasis on containing costs actually can benefit 
the environment. Trust land managers are not tempted to invest in 
developments that will not return a profit. What they can spend 
on management is limited to a fraction of what they produce. 
Consequently there is no below-cost timber sale problem on trust 
lands. Similarly, grazing leases are offered at auction to the 
highest bidder. There is typically no requirement that bidders 
own land in the adjacent areas -- hence, it is possible for 
conservation buyers to bid on land that they want for hiking, 
hunting, or watershed protection. 
<P>
Finally, the school trust is perpetual. The trust resources can 
never be diminished, and the trustee is obligated to maintain the 
productive capacity of the trust in perpetuity. 
<P>
State trust lands offer a rich and diverse set of examples of how 
to institutionalize sustainable resource management. The states 
are major land owners and managers in the American West and, in 
many ways, already are doing a better job than the federal 
government. More importantly, the state trust concept is a 
familiar, flexible tool that can be applied in many situations to 
allow local groups to act responsibly in the management of public 
resources. It provides experience we can draw upon as we consider 
public lands programs and priorities for the next century.

<A NAME="toolbox"><H4>Particulate Air Pollution: A Primer</H4></A>

<STRONG>By DAVID BARON</STRONG> 
<P>
If you haven't written about particulate air pollution yet, 
chances are you will soon. 
<P>
Tiny particles of smoke and soot from steel mills, power plants, 
and motor vehicles could be responsible for tens of thousands of 
deaths each year in the U.S., according to recent studies. The 
research suggests that EPA standards aren't strict enough, 
because many of these deaths occur in areas with particulate 
levels that are well below current EPA limits. 
<P>
The EPA currently is under court order to review (and possibly 
revise) its particulate standards, as a result of a lawsuit filed 
by the American Lung Association. The EPA has until June 30, 1996 
to propose new standards or to propose keeping the old ones. A 
final decision is required by January 31, 1997. 
<P>
With these deadlines looming, environmental organizations, 
scientists, and industry representatives are locked in heated 
debate. There's a lot at stake: implementing stricter standards 
could cost industry billions of dollars. Not implementing new 
standards could cost lives. 
<P>
The following information should provide the background you'll 
need to cover this emerging public health issue. 
<P>
<EM>What are particulates? </EM>
 
Airborne particulates consist of a wide range of substances -- 
among them carbon soot from wood-burning stoves, dust from 
construction sites, and tiny acid particles that form when sulfur 
dioxide or nitrous oxide (combustion products) react with other 
chemicals in the atmosphere. 
<P>
When the EPA issued its first particulate standard (in 1970), it 
treated all particles the same. The regulations put a limit on 
total suspended particulates (TSP), regardless of size or 
composition. 
<P>
Further studies suggested that not all particles cause equal harm 
-- the tinier the particle, the more dangerous it is. So, in 
1987, the EPA revised its standards to regulate only particles 
small enough to penetrate the lungs. 
<P>
These particles, less than microns in size, are referred to as 
PM10. (By comparison, human hair is about 100 microns thick.) The 
current EPA standard for PM10 in the air is set at 150 micrograms 
per cubic meter for a 24-hour average, and 50 micrograms per 
cubic meter for an annual average. 
<P>
Not all PM10 particles are alike, either. They can include 
"coarse" particles (road dust, sea salt, pollen) and "fine" 
particles (produced primarily by the burning of coal, oil, and 
natural gas). The EPA is considering refining its standards 
further, to focus on the fine particles -- those less than 2.5 
microns (PM2.5). 
<P>
<EM>What is the evidence that particulates are harmful? </EM>

The case that particulate levels allowed under current EPA 
standards cause disease and death is compelling -- but 
circumstantial. 
<P>
The evidence comes almost entirely from epidemiological studies 
that examine the rates of death and disease within a community 
and attempt to correlate it with levels of particulates in the 
air. The fact that dozens of studies have been conducted on this 
topic (mostly by scientists at the Harvard School of Public 
Health) is impressive. 
<P>
In Philadelphia, Detroit, St. Louis, Birmingham, Cincinnati, Los 
Angeles, and other cities, when airborne particle levels 
(especially fine particles) go up, so do death rates. Similarly, 
studies show that when particle levels increase, the number of 
hospital admissions, emergency room visits, and asthma attacks 
increase. 
<P>
The key criticism of such studies is that particles may not be to 
blame, but rather a "confounding" pollutant. When the air is 
dirty with particles, it's often dirty with other pollutants as 
well -- such as ozone, sulfur dioxide, or carbon monoxide. These 
other substances in the air may be causing the health effects, 
say critics. If that is the case, clamping down on particles 
would be attacking the wrong problem. 
<P>
However, proponents of more stringent particle standards point to 
the consistency of the findings from city to city, in areas with 
very different compositions of air pollution. No matter what the 
other pollutants might be, studies generally find that with each 
10 micrograms per cubic meter increase in PM10, death rates rise 
by 1 -- 1.5 percent. This effect appears to exist even at the 
lowest measurable particulate concentrations. 
<P>
<EM>Key unanswered questions:</EM><P>

<UL><LI>How do particles cause harm? There are many theories as to how 
particles cause disease and death. When fine particles penetrate 
deep into the lungs, they may cause irritation and constriction 
of the airways, may trigger harmful immune system reactions, or 
may damage the alveoli (tiny sacs where gases are exchanged with 
the bloodstream). Unfortunately, no one really knows what makes 
particles dangerous. 
<P>
Confusing matters further, animal studies generally have not 
demonstrated that particles are harmful at the levels suggested 
by epidemiological reports. New animal studies, nearing 
completion, are expected soon to provide the first direct 
evidence that particles do pose a risk at relatively low levels. 
<P>
<LI>Who is dying? Is particulate pollution shaving a few days off 
the lives of people already terminally ill, or is it shortening 
lives considerably and causing years of disability? The answer 
could affect EPA's risk/benefit analysis for devising a new 
standard. 
<P>
<LI>Which particles are most dangerous? Is size the critical factor 
in determining the harmfulness of particles, or is it 
composition? What types of particles should the EPA focus on? 
These are important issues, because the type of particles 
addressed determines which industries will face tighter 
regulations. 
<P>
<LI>Is there a "safe" level for particulates? Data suggest that 
even at the lowest levels, particulates cause harm to some 
people. If so, how will the EPA choose a "safe" level for its 
standard? 
<P>

<EM>A Civil Action<BR></EM>
by Jonathan Harr<BR>
Random House, 1995, $25.00 (hard cover)<BR> 
<P>
Reviewed by George Homsy
<P>
On vacation, about a month before I read <EM>A Civil Action,</EM> I ripped 
my way through another lawyer book. That one was a thrilling 
account of an attorney prosecuting the toughest murder trial of 
his career. Despite its predictable ending, it was a page turner. 
Murder, treason, and high-level government corruption make for 
exciting reading. 
<P>
But that was fiction. In reality, lawyers (as most professionals) 
toil long hours for few moments of excitement. Could a writer 
make real-life law a thriller? 
<P>
Jonathan Harr did. The achievement is even more incredible given 
that his book focuses on a Superfund case in Woburn, 
Massachusetts. 
<P>
In the mid-1960s, the city of Woburn opened town wells G and H. 
At first, complaints by residents about the taste of the water 
were dismissed by city officials as due to high mineral 
concentrations. Then, in the early 1970s, neighborhood children 
started getting leukemia. 
<P>
A Civil Action opens with young Jimmy Anderson's heart-wrenching 
story of leukemia diagnosis. The Anderson family, who would play 
a prominent role in the infamy of the Woburn case, suffered the 
first of many losses in the working-class neighborhood. What many 
saw as an alarming number of cancers began occurring in adults as 
well as children. 
<P>
Eventually, the residents came to believe that hazardous waste 
from two nearby factories (owned by W.R. Grace and Beatrice 
Foods) had migrated into the drinking water wells. Scientists 
would later claim that even families that drank bottled water 
were susceptible to the carcinogens -- which could enter the body 
through pores in the skin during showers. 
<P>
However, proving that the companies were to blame was difficult. 
Toxic pollution is a complicated area of the law. As shown in <EM>A 
Civil Action,</EM> such cases drag on for years and breed scientific 
uncertainties -- which are quickly seized upon by lawyers eager 
to protect their clients. (Incidentally, one goal of rewriting 
the federal Superfund law is to limit the flow of money to 
lawyers who, many people say, eat up the lion's share of cleanup 
funds.) 
<P>
Nevertheless, a lawyer is the hero of <EM>A Civil Action.</EM> Jan 
Schlichtmann is portrayed as an attorney with a sense of justice. 
At the time he takes the Woburn case, he is undefeated in the 
courtroom and holds a record for the largest wrongful-death 
settlement in Massachusetts history. He believes the Woburn case 
can bring him fame and fortune, as well as send shock waves 
through the boardrooms of corporate polluters. 
<P>
But the Woburn case is unlike any Schlichtmann has ever tackled. 
In the end, his prophecy proves accurate as the case leaves 
Schlichtmann bankrupt -- both financially and emotionally. 
<P>
<EM>A Civil Action</EM> is more than a thriller. Harr sets out to indict 
the civil justice system. He believes the courts are lopsided in 
favor of the rich. The portrayal of that inequity is the main 
source of tension in the book, as Schlichtmann goes up against 
huge corporations whose lawyers are respected professionals with 
large staffs and seemingly unlimited resources. 
<P>
The author's emotional investment is obvious. In the closing 
notes of the book, Harr details the huge amount of time he spent 
with Schlichtmann and the Woburn families. He constructs a 
passionate case for the plaintiffs. That's not to say the 
companies' arguements are poorly presented. Harr, however, spends 
few words building the same kind of sympathy for the corporations 
or their employees. 
<P>
<EM>A Civil Action,</EM> an exemplary piece of literary nonfiction, is a 
fast read in a style more environmental authors should emulate. 
It weaves science and law into an educational (yet thrilling) 
narrative that will keep you hooked from beginning to end.

<A NAME="freelance"><H4>Freelancers Fight for Cyber-Rights</H4></A>

<STRONG>By CATHERINE DOLD</STRONG> 
<P>
Been thinking about making a side trip into the world of 
freelance writing? Maybe you've been thinking about writing a 
travel article based on your next vacation and selling it to a 
few newspapers, or expanding a news story into a larger magazine 
piece. Or maybe you've even been thinking about tossing out the 
whole salaried job and jumping into full-time freelancing. 
<P>
Think twice before you take the plunge. As many SEJ members who 
freelance regularly can attest, the publishing world is going 
through some radical changes. The result of these changes is that 
a writer's hold on his or her copyright often is slashed to the 
bone. 
<P>
In the era of the Internet, freelance writers are being asked to 
sign over every right short of handing over their first-born 
children. Only rarely are they offered additional money for those 
rights. Many writers also have found that their older articles, 
to which they clearly own the copyright, have been uploaded to 
various electronic sites or commercial ventures and are being 
used and sold without permission -- or compensation. 
<P>
Traditionally, freelance writers sold only "first North American 
serial rights" to their articles. That meant the publisher had 
the right to use the article once and only once. All other uses 
of the article -- such as in an anthology or as a reprint in 
another publication -- were negotiated separately, and usually 
resulted in additional money for the author. No longer. A typical 
magazine or newspaper contract today might say something like, 
"first world publication rights plus, for no additional 
compensation, the right to distribute the article in any form or 
by any means, including, but not limited to, print, electronic, 
CD-ROM, microfilm, microfiche, and any other form whether known 
now or developed hereafter, throughout the universe." 
<P>
If these contracts weren't such egregious rights grabs, they 
would almost be funny. These magazines want freelancers to hand 
over every single right to resell or reuse their work, including 
the right to publish their words on Mars or Venus in media that 
have not even been invented. Rarely is any additional 
compensation offered. Some magazines have said, "Gosh, we really 
wish we could pay writers some extra money, but hey, nobody's 
making any money on this Internet thing yet, so just trust us and 
give us all these additional rights for free now, and we'll be 
sure to remember you later." Sure. 
<P>
Many writers are fighting back. Organizations that represent 
primarily freelance writers, such as the National Writers Union 
(NWU) and the American Society of Journalists and Authors (ASJA) 
are monitoring the markets and urging their members to request 
specific changes in contracts. 
<P>
The ASJA advises writers to watch out for several common tactics 
and phrases in contracts. The worst type of contract is "work for 
hire," which means that the publisher owns all the work you do 
under that contract. Period. Just as bad is the "all rights" 
contract, in which you theoretically own the copyright, but you 
have sold all future uses of that material to the publisher. 
Selling all the rights is fine --  as long as you actually sell 
them, and they are not just taken as part of the fee you are paid 
for the first use of the work. All uses beyond the "first print 
publication" rights should be licensed separately and compensated 
separately, says the ASJA. 
<P>
The preferred means of compensation for additional rights is a 
share of revenue generated by your work. Just as in the case of 
traditional reprint rights, the publisher should be willing to 
split the revenue derived from electronic rights. Some may offer 
a flat fee -- often a percentage of the original fee -- for the 
electronic rights. In that case, says ASJA, it's best to limit 
the duration of the license and to secure separate payment for 
each online use. For example, a license could specify use of an 
article for one year on an America Online forum or World Wide Web 
site. 
<P>
In addition, make sure the contract clearly states that the 
additional fee, however it is calculated, is earmarked for 
electronic rights. It is not wise to simply take a higher overall 
fee to surrender electronic rights, because that just reinforces 
the idea that electronic rights are no different than other 
rights. 
<P>
Don't fall for the line from publishers that "we must have every 
article cleared for online use." Electronic publishing 
arrangements do allow publishers to include only selected 
articles. Many publishers also will claim that it is impossible 
at this time to track the number of electronic "hits" on your 
article or the number of reprints that are faxed out. That may be 
true in some cases, but the situation is changing fast. Two new 
systems for tracking and compensating writers for additional uses 
of their work recently were established by the NWU and ASJA. 
<P>
One of these systems, the Publication Rights Clearinghouse, was 
launched last June by NWU and the CARL Corporation. In recent 
months many writers had been shocked to find that CARL was 
selling their copyrighted work via their UnCover fax-on-demand 
service (accessible by telnet at <A HREF="telnet://database.carl.org">database.carl.org</A>). According to 
UnCover, it has a database of about 17 million articles, and 
usually collects about $11.50 per article (which included a $3 
"copyright fee"). Authors never saw that money, and even some 
publishers didn't know that their magazines were being offered on 
the service. 
<P>
The Clearinghouse aims to solve that problem. It will clear the 
copyrights and also distribute royalties to writers from the fax 
orders. Enrollment in the Clearinghouse is expected to be $20. It 
is not clear at this point whether non-enrolled writers would be 
able to collect fees through the Clearinghouse. (For more 
information about the Publication Rights Clearinghouse, contact 
the NWU's National Office at 212-254-0279.) 
<P>
The other clearinghouse is the Author's Registry, founded by the 
ASJA, the Authors Guild, and the Dramatists Guild. The Author's 
Registry was formed to centralize sublicensing of electronic 
rights and other uses, says the ASJA. At its core is a directory 
of authors. Companies that want to buy rightsto an article for 
electronic use, foreign resales, or any other use can contact the 
author of the article through the Registry. 
<P>
The Registry also will collect and distribute royalties for the 
use of some secondary rights, such as by large database companies 
that routinely resell articles. More than a dozen writers' 
organizations representing more than 50,000 writers already have 
signed up with the Registry. (For more information about the 
Authors Registry, contact the Authors Guild at 212-563-5904.) 
<P>
Remember that both of these services will be useless if you give 
away the electronic rights to your articles for nothing in the 
first place. Even if you don't plan to resell any of your 
articles, should others be profiting from your work, without 
giving you a cut? It pays to negotiate. Writers rarely get 
everything they want in their contracts these days -- but 
compared to even just a few months ago, progress has been made. 
<P>
Many magazines that once held a hard line on electronic rights 
are starting to back down, realizing that they will lose their 
best writers unless they start paying for additional uses. 
Writers who protest the terms of the offered contract often are 
finding that a publication actually has two or three "standard" 
contracts, and speaking up can result in a significantly better 
deal. Also, magazines that once tried to commandeer the right to 
upload all your old copyrighted material are finding that more 
than a few writers are saying, "Thanks, but no thanks. Call me 
when you are ready to pay for it." Remember, too, that even if 
you feel the need to sign a less-than-perfect contract, voicing 
your objections now just might help to change things in the 
future.

<A NAME="commentary"><H4>Corporations Reluctant to Comply?<BR> 
Some Companies Are Striving to Exceed Regulations</H4></A>

<STRONG>By WILLIAM D. RUCKELSHAUS</STRONG>
<P>
It has long been an assumption in the country that American 
corporations comply with regulations, environmental and 
otherwise, with great reluctance. We envision them being dragged, 
kicking and screaming, to the bar, doing only the minimum 
required under the law. 
<P>
That may have been the case decades ago, but it no longer 
accurately reflects corporate America. Sure, there are still 
corporate outlaws, but for companies such as the one I work for, 
Browning-Ferris Industries (BFI), basic compliance with 
environmental rules and regulations is just the starting point. 
Exceeding those regulations is now part of our environmental 
management system. In fact, we strongly believe that meeting 
society's rules and regulations is part of our license to do 
business. If we do not comply in a forthright manner, we lose the 
permission granted to us by society or by a community to operate. 
For us, it's as simple as that. 
<P>
When we enter a new market overseas, one of our first tasks is to 
determine exactly what the regulatory requirements are that the 
host country has established for companies to conduct business 
there. We then conform our business to meet those requirements 
precisely. Again, we understand that is what we must do to be 
permitted to operate in that country. 
<P>
We believe companies should take that same attitude when moving 
into a new market or business line in this country. At BFI, we 
try to instill that kind of attitude in all our managers to 
ensure they understand the rules and obey them completely. It's a 
simple, logical way of looking at the regulatory landscape -- and 
it saves us a lot of trouble. 
<P>
Critical to any environmental compliance program is the structure 
created to ensure that managers and employees are motivated to 
meet their compliance goals. We believe we have created the right 
incentives at BFI to do just that. It's not the only way, but it 
works for us. 
<P>
Managers at BFI receive a substantial part of their annual 
compensation in the form of a bonus. Each year, bonus objectives 
and their contribution to an overall bonus are agreed upon by 
senior management. They then are communicated to our managers in 
the field. There is a great deal of deliberation that goes into 
determining the weight of those components, and broad discussion 
with all managers takes place to ensure general agreement about 
the company's priorities. There is an environmental component to 
our bonus structure that serves as a multiplier of the other 
bonus components. 
<P>
In other words, if a manager does not achieve a certain level of 
compliance with our environmental goals (which include, of 
course, compliance with both state and federal regulations), the 
multiplier is zero, and the manager receives no bonus, no matter 
how well he or she may have done in achieving his or her other 
goals, including financial goals, for the year. This provides a 
powerful motivator, and ensures that our managers pay attention 
to our highest priorities at BFI. 
<P>
Another factor that keeps companies like BFI focused on their 
environmental responsibilities is the practice of many 
corporations not to do business with firms that have a weak 
record of environmental compliance. This practice stems from 
concern about a company's reputation or future liability. More 
and more, companies are reviewing the records of their suppliers 
before awarding them significant business. Compliance has become 
an important part of a company's ability to compete in today's 
marketplace. 
<P>
The environmental record of companies throughout this country is 
getting increased scrutiny in the 1990s. This is not likely to 
diminish in the years ahead. When I was first administrator of 
the EPA in 1970, one of my tasks was to convince American 
corporations that the environment was not a passing fad and that 
EPA was not going to fade away in a few short years if only 
companies dug in their heels and resisted change. As we have seen 
in the 25 years since, concern about the environment is one of 
the most enduring values in America and one which elected 
officials ignore at their peril. Concern about companies' 
environmental records has moved from regulatory agencies and the 
courts to the board rooms as corporations weigh the environment 
as an important factor in any business deal. Companies recognize 
environmental compliance is a key component of future financial 
success. 
<P>
The issue of environmental compliance at a corporation is one 
more critical factor in the conduct of business that cannot be 
ignored. Once environmental compliance is treated with the same 
care, concern and attention as other more traditional functions 
of a corporation, such as cost control, training, etc., we have 
succeeded.

<A NAME="online1"><H4>Listserv Aids Nonfiction Writers:<BR> 
Moderated list has over 500 subscribers in the first year</H4></A>

<STRONG>By JON FRANKLIN</STRONG> 
<P>
When I was a young writer, it seemed to me that the worst thing 
about my condition was the isolation. Lip service aside, few 
newspapers had more than one seriously committed writer, coaches 
generally were considered to be remedial, and writers' groups 
usually were composed of folks who wanted to talk art. Even when 
we had a serious writers' group, as we once did on <EM>The Evening 
Sun,</EM> we were all at about the same level and nobody knew the 
important secrets. 
<P>
So when the Internet evolved to the point that writers started to 
get online (and I wanted an excuse to play with the machinery), 
establishing a writer's discussion group seemed the natural thing 
to do. 
<P>
Quality nonfiction writing is a craft that requires serious study 
-- that's why few environmental journalists write as well as John 
McPhee. Professional chemists, astronomers, and other scientific 
specialties all have had serious discussion lists -- so why 
shouldn't nonfiction writers? 
<P>
The surprising thing about setting up an electronic discussion 
for nonfiction writers was how easy it was. I happened to mention 
my embryonic idea to the University of Oregon Journalism school's 
computer guy, Mick Westrick. The first thing I knew, I was 
explaining it to someone over in the university's computing 
department. I mentioned that I might name it something like 
"Writer-L", which at the time matched the conventional format for 
discussion lists. 
<P>
In hindsight, there must have been a thousand better names, but I 
thought all of this was theoretical. Then, suddenly, a message 
came from the computer center that Writer-L was up, running, and 
ready to do my bidding. Just like that, I was committed. 
<P>
Writer-L is different from most Internet discussion lists in that 
it is moderated. Most lists are totally automated; members send 
what they want to post to the list address, where it is 
duplicated and sent out to all subscribers. Writer-L, however, is 
moderated -- it has a "master of ceremonies" sitting at the 
middle of the system, keeping a finger (or a thumb) on things. 
All posts come to me, and I edit them and post them to the list. 
<P>
Our boilerplate welcome message explains that Writer-L is devoted 
to the discussion of feature writing, explanatory journalism, 
literary journalism, and the high-level reportage that generally 
is associated with such writing. The obvious advantage of a 
moderated list is that we don't get off the subject. We are 
probably the only list on the net -- and certainly the only 
journalistic list -- that has basically ignored the OJ trial, the 
Oklahoma City bombing, and the Unabomber. Very little of our 
discussion is about the Internet or computers. 
<P>
So far, Writer-L has about 520 subscribers. In first the year of 
its existence, the list has featured ongoing, in-depth, and 
sometimes heated discussions on subjects ranging from cleaning up 
quotes to the nature of journalistic accuracy and its 
relationship (if any) to truth. We have critiqued (and complained 
about) the current state of journalism, and have speculated about 
its future. We had one long, heated discussion over the 
legitimacy of sports writing and whether the concept of 
"literature" had anything to do with subject matter. 
<P>
Along the way we have posted a number of high-quality (and some 
not-so-high-quality) examples of newspaper journalism. One of 
these was a series from <EM>The Oregonian</EM> about the drunk-driving 
trial of a man who ran down and killed several people near 
Portland. These posts, and the critiques they provoke, make the 
various fragments of our profession stand out in sharp relief. To 
judge from personal e-mail I get, a lot of writers value the 
glimpse Writer-L provides into the minds of senior journalists. 
<P>
With the passage of time, I started getting compliments on the 
editorial quality of the list -- especially the general absence 
of messages that are childish, off topic, or recreationally 
argumentative. Such comments often are accompanied by questions 
about how much time I spend editing this stuff. 
<P>
The truth is, not much. The other truth is that no, in fact, I 
don't deny many people the use of the forum. Occasionally I cut 
off a thread that's gone on too long, or one that's off topic. 
Not long ago, I took the hook to a line of discussion that had 
gotten us off into Zen and New Age religion. 
<P>
For the most part, however, my presence here in the center of the 
web is all it takes to keep folks focused. If I refuse to post a 
message, I always explain my decision to the author. So far 
almost everyone has taken refusals in good grace. I only recall 
one situation in which my refusal to post an accusatory diatribe 
provoked real acrimony in the other party. 
<P>
Like the Internet itself, Writer-L is a new medium unlike any 
with which I'm familiar. It is like a magazine in some ways, and 
in other ways it is not. It is newspaperish, in that subscribers 
expect to get it in their electronic mailbox every morning -- but 
it's not a newspaper. 
<P>
I do wish there had been something like this for my generation. 
If nothing else, Writer-L makes it a lot less lonely out there.

<DD>Colorado's two major newspapers continue a Jekyll-and-Hyde 
approach to covering major environmental stories. <EM>Denver Post</EM>
reporter Mark Obmascik got wind of a proposal to sell off 
national forest lands that are currently leased to the ski areas 
before it hit the national news; consequently the story was given 
the top spot in page one coverage on September 18, another front 
page the next day, and two inside as the proposal was dropped on 
Sept. 22 due to public outrage. Congressional leaders revived the 
bill as a rider to an appropriations bill within days. But it was 
again killed in November. The <EM>Rocky Mountain News</EM> ran one article 
on Sept. 21 when the plan appeared headed for defeat. Likewise, 
the <EM>Post</EM> virtually ignored a story in late August when the <EM>Rocky 
Mountain News</EM> gave top placement to a wire service story on 
massive cyanide spill at a Guyana mine that was partially owned 
by a Denver mining company. The <EM>News</EM> ran several follow-up 
stories, pointing to both the company's involvement in the mine 
and its links to the former owner of the Summitville mine in 
southern Colorado, which suffered a similar disaster in 1990. The 
<EM>Post,</EM> however, continues to give major coverage to environmental 
changes being proposed in Congress, while the same stories barely 
rate a mention in the <EM>News.</EM> For more information, call Ron Baird

<P><DD>Add Connecticut to the states where concern is rising over the 
use of reformulated gasoline, and one fuel additive in particular 
-- methyl tertiary butyl ether (MBTE). Residents of Alaska, New 
Jersey, and Wisconsin have all complained of health problems 
which they say are linked to the cleaner burning fuel. Scientists 
and the EPA have not established a definite connection. The issue 
came to Connecticut in August, eight months after reformulated 
gasoline had been introduced, when a chapter of Oxy-Busters (an 
activist organization first begun in New Jersey) was created and 
began pressing for the elimination of MBTE in the fuel. For more

<DD>Despite efforts in Congress to eliminate the Toxic Release 
Inventory, the federal database remains a useful tool for

Troubles" series in November examining emission, statewide. The 
results of this three-month reporting project were not surprising 
-- phosphate mining and paper and pulp mills are the state's 
biggest polluters. But in a state where rampant development is 
the leading issue, toxic chemical pollution often doesn't get as 
much examination. The series examined issues involving the TRI 
and the industries that dominate the top polluters list. Contact

<DT>HAWAII 
<P>
<DD>Hawaii has only a few sheltered bays which provide shelter for 
many marine mammals, including spinner dauphins and their young. 
But the animals could be threatened by increasing numbers of 
people who want to swim with the wild creatures. "Sometimes we 
just love these animals to death," special agent Gene Proulx of 
the National Marine Fisheries Service was quoted as saying in a 
Sept. 14 article in the <EM>Honolulu Star-Bulletin.</EM> Staff writer Greg 
Ambrose reported that dolphins come into bays during the day to 
rest from predators, which is exactly when they are rushed by 
kayaks, bodyboarders, paddleboarders and swimmers. The activity 
could force the creatures away from the beaches to an uncertain 
fate. Those who violate federal laws against harassing marine 
mammals face a $10,000 fine, but agents are hoping education will 
be more effective in encouraging people to keep their distance. 
<P>
<DD>About 2 million acres of Hawaii's land -- roughly half the 
entire state -- falls within the conservation district. 
Designated in 1964, these public and private lands were intended 
to protect and preserve the state's natural resources, to be used 
and managed in a sustainable way. But increasingly frequent 
requests to develop huge homes, utility lines, radio towers, and 
even freeways within the district have prompted state officials 
to take another look at how to manage these vast holdings, 
reported staff writer Joan Conrow in the Oct. 16 edition of the 
<EM>Honolulu Star-Bulletin</EM> (808) 828-0620. The state's Department of 
Land and Natural Resources is developing a database of resources, 
so it can then identify sensitive lands that shouldn't be 
developed and appropriate uses for others. Public meetings are 
being held around the state. 
<P>
<DD>Hawaii has 207 plants on the federal Endangered Species List, 
far more than any other state. Both the <EM>Honolulu Star-Bulletin</EM> 
and <EM>Honolulu Advertiser</EM> report frequently on various issues 
associated with the native flora. The latter offered a Nov. 26 
report on the growing popularity of native plants among home 
gardeners and landscapers, and a profile of a woman who had 
fought back alien plants to make way for a native garden. Contact 
<EM>Advertiser</EM> Home Section Editor Mike Leidemann (808) 525-8000.
<P>
<DD>On another front, Joan Conrow of the <EM>Star-Bulletin</EM> reported 
that a quarter of the state's endangered nehe plant could be 
wiped out in a cinder mining operation permitted by the state 
Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. The agency, which administers 
lands for native Hawaiian beneficiaries, acted after receiving a 
draft opinion from the state Attorney General's office that it 
was exempt from the state's endangered species laws. 
Environmentalists and scientists are worried about the loophole 
in the law, and have criticized the involvement of a state 
Senator's family in the venture. Conrow also wrote a two-part 
series on efforts to propagate the state's rarest plants and 
return them to the wild. The paper's Washington correspondent, 
Pete Pichaske, also has written a number of reports in recent 
months on legislative action to protect Hawaii from invasive 
alien plants that damage native flora and crops. Some say the 
weeds are Hawaii's single greatest environmental threat. (202)

<P>
<DD>Both the <EM>Advertiser</EM> and <EM>Star-Bulletin</EM> have given extensive 
coverage to a proposal to greatly expand the marine sanctuary 
for humpback whales in Hawaii. The huge animals breed and calve 
in the warm bays around the state, and are especially common in 
waters off Maui, Molokai, and Lanai. These areas included in 
current sanctuary boundaries, which the federal government has 
proposed extending to include the Big Island and portions of Oahu 
and Kauai. Advocates say the designation would attract federal 
for education and research. But opponents fear new restrictions 
on fishing and commercial boating.

<DD>The <EM>New York Times</EM> featured Chicago "brownfields" in a December 
4 front-page story by John Holusha. "Brownfield" is an urban 
planning euphemism for an abandoned industrial site that usually 
has environmental contaminants, but is ripe for sale because of 
its proximity in an urban setting. The EPA estimates that there 
are more than 2,000 brownfields in Chicago alone. 
<P>
<DD>The normally pro-development <EM>Chicago Tribune</EM> raised the spectre 
of environmental degradation in a series of articles in late 
November concerning the proposed move of the Chicago Bears to an 
industrial site near blighted Gary, Indiana. The front-page 
articles co-written by <EM>Tribune</EM> environmental writer Stevenson 
Swanson warned of endangered wetlands that would be threatened by 
the proposed development of a football stadium and entertainment 
complex called "planet" park. 
<P>
<DD>The biggest environmental event in Chicago in early December 
garnered scant notice in the city's two largest dailies. The 
city's "blue bag" recycling program -- nearly five years in 
development -- will impact some 750,000 households in the city 
and be one of the largest urban recycling efforts to date. On 
December 4, <EM>Chicago Sun-Times</EM> environmental writer Jim Ritter 
covered the story on page 18. "Poverty may prove to be one of the 
biggest obstacles to blue-bag recycling," Ritter observed, noting 
that affluent suburbanites typically recycle at a higher rate 
than inner-city residents. The <EM>Daily Southtown,</EM> meanwhile, gave 
stories on the controversial program page-one play on Nov. 28 and 
Dec. 12.

<DD>The use of electric vehicles to help clean up air pollution 
remains a major story in Massachusetts. The latest twist is that 
California's anticipated decision to back off its requirement 
that automakers begin selling electric cars in the west coast 
state by next year will have an impact in both Massachusetts and 
New York. Both states adopted the California car plan, which 
calls for the sale of increasingly cleaner burning vehicles. They 
have both also come under heavy pressure from car manufacturers 
to drop those schedules. If the California Air Resources Board 
pushes back the 1996 electric vehicle deadline, by law both 
Massachusetts and New York must do the same. For more details,

<DD>The siting of a low-level radioactive waste dump somewhere in 
Massachusetts was expected to be one of the biggest environmental 
issues of the year. But the issue is rapidly fading. The sense of 
urgency to site a dump, held by both state officials and the 
nuclear industry, began to falter after South Carolina reopened 
its dump site to other states in order to raise more revenue. 
Utilities, faced with paying both disposal fees as well as for 
the planning and building of a Massachusetts site, began wavering 
in their support. With environmentalists vowing to fight the 
plan, support within the Weld administration also began to 
falter. For more information, contact Tim Sandler, <EM>Boston

<P>
<DD>Minnesota officials have given Potlatch Corp. permission to 
double the size of a large board manufacturing plant in 
northeastern Minnesota. The project is the latest in a series of 
pulp, paper, and wood board expansions that have more than 
doubled the amount of annual logging in the state during the past 
two decades. The pressure for more wood has outraged some 
environmental leaders, who say that additional cutting should not 
be allowed without stronger measures to protect biodiversity, 
water, and soils. The risks and benefits of the proposed 
expansion have also deeply divided wildlife experts and foresters 
within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. The large 
mill owners contend there is plenty of wood available for more 
logging, but smaller for there businesses. A coalition of the 
environmental groups is almost certain to challenge the Potlatch 
project in court. Contact Tom Meersman, <EM>Minneapolis Star

<P>
<DD>An increasing amount of garbage is being shipped from Minnesota 
to its neighboring states, especially to Iowa. the shipments have 
angered small-town Towns who live near two landfills, and have 
alarmed Minnesota officials who committed millions of dollars to 
building composting plants, garbage shredding facilities, and 
waste-to-energy incinerators in the late 1980's. The Minnesota 
solid waste system was based on the assumption that county 
ordinances could require that a community's garbage be sent to 
local solid waste facilities. but a 1994 U.S. Supreme Court 
decision ruled that local ordinances that try to control the flow 
of trash are unconstitutional because they violate the interstate 
commerce clause. Waste hauling firms and landfill owners say that 
well-managed, modern landfills are cheaper and in many cases 
environmentally superior to incinerators and composting plants.

Industry folks say big-time hog farms are the wave of the future 
and will provide low-cost, high-quality food. But critics say the 
immense scale of these operations is causing a host of 
environmental problem, and is changing the economics of livestock 
production in ways that will drive more family farms out of 
business. The issue is provoking considerable debate throughout 
the country, especially in Midwestern states. Contact James

<P>
<DD>Test burns began in December to determine whether an incinerator 
in Times Beach will destroy dioxin. The incinerator's job is to 
take 100,000 cubic yards of contaminated material -- everything 
from mattresses and furniture to rocks and tree stumps -- and 
turn it into sterile soil, carbon dioxide, and water vapor. The 
material will be excavated from Missouri's 27-year-old dioxin 
site. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, backed by the 
state Department of Natural Resources, says incineration is the 
best method for ending Missouri's 20-year dioxin legacy. The 
Times Beach Action Group, which has about 100 supporters, has led 
opposition to the burn. If the incinerator passes muster, the 
burn could begin January, and take about seven months. The 
incinerator then would be dismantled; the state plans to turn 
Times Beach into a park. Contact environment writer Tom

sustained yield capacity at 94.5 MMBF annually. The reduction in 
the sustained yield capability was blamed on poor regeneration of 
many tree species. A reduction in timber harvests on the forest 
could have widespread economic impacts in a four-county region of 
northwestern Pennsylvania. The Allegheny is the only national 
forest in Pennsylvania.

which looks at an ecosystem by writing stories about the people, 
wildlife, and habitat of that area. The series centers on the 
state-owned Great Swamp Management Area, a 3,350-acre preserve. 
Stories so far have focused on: the comeback of the osprey (which 
each summer nest at the Swamp); a bush pilot based for many years 
at Great Swamp; and how hunting, which is in a rapid decline in 
New England, is still popular each fall at Great Swamp. For more

<DD>For years concern has been growing about the rising levels of 
bacteria in Greenwich Cove, in Warwick, R.I. Once this estuary 
could be counted on for a bountiful harvest of shellfish as well 
as to be a playground for boaters and swimmers. It was assumed 
the prime source was either from the local marinas or failed 
septic system in the suburban communities around the saltwater 
cover. But after a four-year search, researchers found that the 
prime source was a farm several miles up a tributary. It was a 
surprise, especially since local and state officials had been 
striving to keep the farm open to prevent further development in 
this highly suburban area. For further information, contact Peter

an environmental makeover, and has drafted a long-range plan to 
become a model for how industry and clean air can co-exist. 
Chattanooga hosted the January 1995 meeting of the President's 
Council on Sustainable Development; it has been recognized by the 
United Nations for its environmental progress; and it now has the 
second-largest fleet of non-polluting electric buses in the 
nation. Admittedly, there are still problems -- Chattanooga Creek

<P>

On the eve of the Democratic national convention,
President Bill Clinton pledged to make environmental protection
an even bigger White House issue in his second term than it had
been in his first. In a speech on the final stop of his train
journey to the Chicago gathering, Clinton outlined his environmental
agenda, including plans to accelerate the pace of toxic waste
clean-ups, crack down against flagrant corporate polluters, and
expand the brownfields redevelopment program.

<P>

&quot;I want an America in the year 2000
where no child should live near a toxic waste dump, where no parent
would have to worry about a child's glass of water,&quot; he told
a cheering crowd in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

<P>

Republican presidential candidate Robert Dole
has also used campaign appearances to stake out his positions
on some key environmental issues. Dismissing mounting evidence
of the link between industrial air emissions and global warming
as &quot;inconclusive,&quot; Dole has told audiences that he would
favor more study of the &quot;greenhouse gas&quot; issue before
further actions are taken to control emissions. Efforts to pass
new legislation to limit the powers of agencies to regulate industry
and to compensate landowners for any effect federal regulations
might have on property values also would be revived in a Dole
administration. As Senate majority leader, Dole pushed for new
statutes along these lines and has signaled that he would continue
to do so if he is elected President. Both measures were bitterly
opposed by environmentalists but strongly backed by corporate
lobbyists and major western landholders.

<P>

With those very different stances on the environment,
the two leading presidential contenders are offering voters what
they say they want most: a choice of approaches to a fundamental
issue. &quot;We have candidates who would lead the country in
very different directions in the area of environmental protection,&quot;
said Betsy Loyless, political director of the League of Conservation
Voters (LCV). &quot;In Clinton we have someone who has pinpointed
some of the country's most pressing environmental problems and
outlined plans to address them,&quot; she explained. &quot;In
Dole we have a candidate who would significantly diminish the
role of the federal government in protecting the public against
pollution. Here is one case where voters can say they have a choice
between black and white.&quot;

<P>

In several dozen congressional contests, too,
clearly pro-environmental candidates are pitted against contenders
with weaker environmental records, according to analyses by the
Sierra Club and other major environmental groups. In all, there
are about 100 House seats and 20 Senate seats up for grabs, and
half of them are between candidates with starkly different records
on the environment, said Dan Weiss, chief political analyst for
the Sierra Club. Although some GOP lawmakers have moderated the
harshly anti-environmental positions they took in the early months
of the 104th Congress, many of the congressional battles are between
Republicans with low green ratings and Democrats with higher ones,
Weiss added.

<P>

One example is a House fight over Michigan's
eighth district between incumbent Dick Chrysler, a Republican
who received only an 8 percent on the LCV's latest scorecard and
Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat who has pushed for stronger environmental
laws on the state level. &quot;The direction that Congress takes
next year on the environment depends on the outcome of these key
races,&quot; Weiss said, &quot;At the moment, it's a real jump
ball.&quot;

<P>

Whichever party wins the jump could determine
the direction the nation takes on a number of key environmental
issues, including the reshaping of the 1972 Endangered Species
Act, the overhaul of the 1974 Clean Water Act, and the updating
of the 1980 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act, better known as the Superfund statute. All
three are major pieces of legislation which are long overdue for
reauthorization and must be addressed by the 105th Congress.

<P>

Buoyed by the strong endorsement the public
has given their environmental stances in polls, some of the more
progressive democrats are likely to push for bolder reforms of
the statutes. In the end, however, it is unlikely that either
party will have a strong enough majority to push through legislation
without some support from the other party. The most likely shape
that the three statutes take will probably be a matter of bipartisan
compromise.

<P>

Conservative GOP lawmakers forged bids to
scale back all three statutes during the 104th Congress, but faltered
due to a lack of broad support for their efforts. &quot;A few
new conservative members could revive those campaigns and could
very well try to push those bills through,&quot; said LCV's Loyless.
For example, a bid to scale back protections against pollution
of lakes and rivers outlined in the Clean Water Act, originally
mounted by Rep. Bud Schuster (R-PA) fizzled when environmentalists
began pointing out the benefits the legislation had wrought for
lakes and rivers across the country over the past two decades.
With a few new House allies, however, Schuster could attempt to
reintroduce the bill and lobby it through.

<P>

If the GOP recaptures the House, Rep. Tom
Delay (R-Tex.), a harsh critic of the role of the federal government
in environmental protection, is likely to return as majority whip
and continue his efforts to push through legislation that would
give industry a stronger voice in shaping the regulations issued
by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other federal
agencies. If Republicans hold on to their majority in the Senate,
Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) could take over the powerful Appropriations
Committee and use it to push for control over the Tongass and
other Alaska-related environmental issues.

<P>

The races where the environment is expected
to be a big issue include the battle for the open Senate seat
in Oregon. There Republican Gordon Smith is already running ads
supportive of salvage timber legislation while Democrat Tom Bruggere
is mounting a strong pro-environmental campaign. In Minnesota,
where jurisdiction over the headwaters is a big campaign issue,
former GOP Sen. Rudy Boschwitz is staging a grudge match against
the more pro-environmental candidate Paul Wellstone. In his contest
against GOP candidate Ronna Romney in Michigan, Democratic Senator
Carl Levin is already citing the role he has played in combating
pollution in the Great Lakes. In the fight over Ohio's tenth House
district, pro-environmental Democrat Dennis Kucinich is challenging
incumbent Republican Martin Hoke, who received a low LCV rating
of 8 percent. 

<P>

In his Kalamazoo speech, Clinton promised
to seek an additional $2 billion in federal funds for the clean-up
of Superfund sites and other environmental programs. Included
in the agenda he announced were plans to speed up the clean-up
of the Great Lakes and dramatically broaden the right-to-know
program, making information about air and water emissions releases
more accessible to people who live in communities which are affected
by them.

<P>

&quot;With this speech the President was saying
that he wants to make environmental protection one of the main
areas in which his administration leaves a strong mark,&quot;
said EPA administrator Carol M. Browner. 

<P>

Beyond the modest measures that he outlined,
if Clinton is re-elected he is likely to use a second term to
push harder on some of the environmental initiatives his administration
has already introduced. Such projects include Project Excel, a
pilot program allowing a handful of companies to develop their
own ways of combating pollution, and the Common Sense initiative,
an EPA program in which industry officials, environmentalists,
and other stakeholders seek to devise better ways of regulating
particular industries. &quot;A second term would give Clinton
the chance to push harder on some of the moderate environmental
concepts he has favored in the first term,&quot; said a political
analyst for a major environmental group.

<P>

One environmental issue that is likely to
receive top billing under a new Clinton administration is global
warming. If they are re-elected, both Clinton and Vice President
Al Gore are expected to continue to assume greater leadership
of the international campaign to reduce industrial emissions of
&quot;greenhouse gasses&quot; as a means of mitigating the gradual
effects of global warming.

<P>

Speculation has also loomed that a post election
cabinet shake-up could bring in replacements for Browner and Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt. Thomas Grumbley, currently undersecretary
of the Department of Energy, has been mentioned as a possible
replacement for Browner. In an interview, Browner said she was
unaware that a change was being planned for the leadership of
the EPA. &quot;I would be very pleased if the President invites
me to continue in the administration for a second term,&quot;
she added.

<P>

Tim Wirth, currently undersecretary of state
for environmental programs, has been mentioned as a possible replacement
for Babbitt, who is a top contender for a seat on the Supreme
Court.

<P>

<STRONG>By KATHERINE STIMMEL
</STRONG>

<P>

Despite an ambitious agenda, the 104th Congress
passed few comprehensive environmental reform measures. 

<P>

Two key environment and health-related bills -- a
Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) and the Food Quality Protection
Act -- passed late in the session following significant compromises
between congressional Republicans and Democrats. Other reform
measures, including an overhaul of the Superfund program and a
Clean Water Act Authorization, stalled. Other statutes such as
the Endangered Species Act are not likely to be addressed during
the remainder of the legislative session.

<P>

The SDWA rewrite, first major overhaul of
the act in a decade, repealed a requirement that the Environmental
Protection Agency regulate 25 new contaminants every three years.
The new law established a process through which EPA will collect
and regulate contaminants that pose the greatest risk to public
health, using risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis to do
so. 

<P>

The measure also authorized a new $1-billion-per-year state revolving loan fund for grants and low-interest loans
to communities. These funds would be used for such purposes as
drinking water system upgrades, compliance activities, operator
certification, and protection of drinking water sources.

<P>

Final passage of the drinking water bill occurred
after House and Senate conferees reached a compromise on several
key issues, including consumers' right-to-know about contaminants
in their drinking water systems, variances from certain monitoring
and treatment requirements for small systems, and setting a standard
for radon levels in drinking water.

<P>

The Food Quality Protection Act, like the
SDWA, was the result of compromise among congressional Republicans
and Democrats, plus agricultural and food processing interests.
Signed into law Aug. 3, the comprehensive package changes regulation
of the safety of food from pesticide residues and the registration
of pesticide products.

<P>

The law repeals the Delaney Clause that barred
the government from setting maximum pesticide residue levels for
processed food if the pesticide was linked to cancer. Until the
change, the Clause applied regardless of the level of risk of
cancer posed by a chemical. Before, if a tolerance level was not
set, the pesticide could not be used on food that was sold in
the U.S. 

<P>

A number of provisions were added to the compromise
bill. One deals with a new screening program for estrogenic effects.
Others called for additional safety standards for infants and
children, and expanded citizens' right-to-know about contaminants
in their food. The new law included a mandate for review of all
existing pesticide residue tolerances within 10 years to ensure
they meet the new safety standard.

<P>

Legislation that revised existing hazardous
waste laws was signed into law March 26. It allows certain hazardous
wastes headed for disposal in facilities regulated under the Clean
Water Act (CWA) and the Safe Drinking Water Act to escape stringent
treatment standards established under the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act.

<P>

A second provision of the law lifted ground
water monitoring requirements for small municipal landfills located
in dry or remote areas. Like the other bills, the hazardous waste
measure had widespread, bipartisan support.

<P>

To date, Congress has been unable to achieve
similar compromise on CWA reauthorization or Superfund reform.
The House passed its version of a CWA rewrite bill (HR961) by
a 240-185 vote May 16, 1995. The measure would have made broad
changes to existing law. Among other things, the bill would:

<UL>
<LI>Replace the existing storm water permitting
program with a management program modeled after polluted runoff
control provisions of the existing CWA.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Ease federal regulation of wetlands.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Require compensation of landowners whose
property values have been diminished by 20 per cent or more as
a result of federal wetlands regulation.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Authorize $2.3 billion annually for a
waste-water state revolving loan, for fiscal years 1997 through
2000.
</UL>

<P>

Clinton threatened to veto the measure. The
Senate has failed to draft or consider its own version of a reauthorization
package.

<P>

On Superfund reform, Republican sponsors of
legislation and congressional staff have said that passage of
a comprehensive reform bill is unlikely in 1996 because consensus
cannot be achieved on key titles of legislation in the House and
Senate. Key differences over House and Senate versions of the
bill center on two provisions: one dealing with assessment of
natural resource damages, and the other addressing retroactive

Aides to key House Republicans say that passage
of a comprehensive Endangered Species Act reauthorization bill
is unlikely. They indicate, however, that a narrowly targeted
bill could still move in the remainder of the legislative session.
Several regulatory reform bills enacted during the 104th Congress
have had an impact on environmental programs.

<P>

A bill signed March 24 required federal agencies
to consider the impact that regulations have on small businesses.
The measure, included in legislation that raised the debt ceiling,
provided small businesses the authority to challenge agency actions
in court. The statute also gave Congress 60 days to review regulations
and possibly disapprove them before they take effect.

Clinton signed a bill March 22, 1995, designed
to curb Congress' ability to pass laws that require spending by
state, local, and tribal governments without federal financial
support. Congress must either identify specific funding sources
to cover the costs of the spending requirement or vote to waive
the requirement.

<A NAME = "sej1"><H4>Letter from the President: Awards program still elusive</H4></A>

<P>

<STRONG>By EMILIA ASKARI
</STRONG>

<P>

Every journalist knows that awards burnish
a r&eacute;sum&eacute;. They can help land a coveted promotion
or plum assignment.

<P>

Every board member of the Society of Environmental
Journalists knows that a popular awards program also enhances
the reputation of an organization such as ours. Awards programs
can help attract new members, satisfy long-time members, and foster
greater respect for a beat.

<P>

For years, SEJ's board has struggled to find
the financial backing and staff time to launch a first-class awards
program. This summer, we came close. Ultimately, hesitancy over
the source of the funding and concern about the peripheral involvement
of a public relations firm, Edelman Associates, lead the board
to back away from a tantalizing proposal. Many SEJ members have
urged the organization to start an awards program. For them, especially,
I offer this discussion of our recent decision.

<P>

The proposal for an awards program came from
the Puerto Rico-based Baccardi Foundation, affiliated with the
liquor company of the same name. The foundation, which has sponsored
several projects related to the environment, hired Edelman to
find partners willing to run a series of awards for environmental
journalists. Baccardi promised to endow the awards and step back,
so long as the awards were named after the founder of the Baccardi
rum dynasty. 

<P>

The University of Missouri journalism school
was and is eager to administer such an awards program. SEJ was
asked to co-sponsor the awards, selecting some judges and allowing
the awards to be presented at our annual conference.

<P>

SEJ board member David Ropeik of WCVB-TV in
Boston took the lead in evaluating the proposal. For months, he
worked tirelessly with representatives of Edelman and the University
of Missouri to shape the proposal in a way that would give journalists
the fewest possible qualms about applying for and winning the
awards. Other board members on the awards committee who also reviewed
the Baccardi proposal are Mike Mansur of the <EM>Kansas City Star</EM>
and Jim Detjen of Michigan State University.

<P>

In the end, the board decided not to embrace
the proposal for a variety of reasons. Some board members were
worried about the involvement of Edelman, which is hired by many
corporations seeking to promote an environmentally friendly image.
In addition, some board members were uncomfortable with the fact
that Baccardi, a multinational company, could be involved in an
embarrassing environmental problem now or in the future. We are
unaware of any such problems at this time.

<P>

Of course, we are aware that other awards
programs have grown quite prestigious despite their corporate-sounding
names. The Dupont-Columbia awards, for example, are the most sought-after
prizes in broadcast journalism. The AAAS-Whitacker Foundation
awards are famed for recognizing good science journalism.

<P>

The Oakes awards, administered by the Natural
Resources Defense Council's <EM>Amicus Journal,</EM> are funded by the
family, friends, and colleagues of a famous journalist, and judged
by an independent panel of other famous journalists. The involvement
of an advocacy group has barely dented the Oakes awards' popularity.


<P>

The Oakes are a rather new addition to the
modest list of awards designed specifically to honor environmental
journalism. Like the long-established Meeman awards, funded by
Scripps-Howard, the Oakes allow only print journalists to apply.


<P>

The SEJ board long has sought a way to regularly
honor and encourage fine environmental journalism in other media
such as radio, television and newsletters. We also like the idea
of honoring award winners at the SEJ national conference, where
they would be surrounded by colleagues who could really appreciate
their work. SEJ Executive Director Beth Parke has floated the
idea with several journalism foundations and other potential funders.
Several have expressed interest, though that interest has not
lead to concrete financial support.

<P>

About three years ago, Ropeik also developed
a detailed plan for a more modest SEJ awards program modeled after
the one run by Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE). 

<P>

Parke recommended against the plan, saying
it would take too much staff time and prevent SEJ from conducting
good regional programs. In addition, the board was reluctant to
launch an awards program that did not have on going endowed support
such as the kind offered this summer by Baccardi.

<P>

Although the SEJ board decided not to attach
the organization's name to the Baccardi awards, we expect that
the program will proceed and flourish. We have no intention of
discouraging it. In fact, several board members may serve as advisors
or judges to the Baccardi awards program. For now, we have decided
to put SEJ's awards ambitions on hold. 

<P>

The board welcomes questions or suggestions
about awards or anything else. On the topic of awards, please
contact David Ropeik, our awards committee chair. The SEJ staff
can tell you which board members are taking the lead on other
issues such as regional events or student outreach. 

<P>

The SEJ annual board meeting will take place
during SEJ's sixth national conference, Friday, Oct. 18, at the
Hyatt Regency in St. Louis. Elections will be held for five available
board seats.

<STRONG>By MIKE MANSUR
</STRONG>

<P>

The sixth national conference of the Society
of Environmental Journalists, set for October 17-20 at Washington
University in St. Louis, promises to be the most ambitious yet
of this annual event. The program includes more panels than in
previous years, an information-gathering &quot;network lunch&quot;
in place of a featured speaker, the first SEJ play, and receptions
at the Missouri Botanical Garden and the St. Louis Science Center.


<P>

Two months before the conference, sign-ups
were around 140; in past years, registrants at that point have
reflected a third or less of actual conference attendance.

<P>

Highlights of the packed agenda include the
following:

<UL>
<LI>Panels on some of the nation's hottest
topics, such as recycling, mining, urban sprawl, and the new air
pollution standards that will affect every urban area.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Tours to sites of the Midwest's top environment
stories, including a prairie restoration area; an uncommon effort
in floodplain management at Vallmeyer, Ill.; Cahokia Indian Mounds;
clean-up of atomic wastes; Monsanto's genetic engineering lab;
and of course, Times Beach, the town that put dioxin on the environment
writer's map.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>An expanded program on writing and reporting
that features top writers and writing coaches such as Don Fry,
Jeff Klinkenberg, Deborah Potter, William Least Heat-Moon, and
David Quammen.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Plenary sessions that will look at the
the political battle over the environment, with workshops on using
computers to produce environmental stories, using database managers,
and creating your own home page on the world wide web; a debate
Saturday between &quot;doomsayers&quot; and &quot;naysayers&quot;
on the fate of the planet; and an unusual replacement for a luncheon
speaker -- a &quot;network lunch,&quot; in which you will dine with
leading experts and discuss a variety of topics.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The first SEJ play, A Sense of Wonder,
featuring an established actresses' portrayal of Rachel Carson,
arguably the first environmental journalist.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>A long list of mini-tours at Washington
University with topics including the NASA geoscience node, use
of rootfuels in Third World countries to combat deforestation
and health problems, ethnobotany, noise pollution, floods and
mold, and health in the workplace. Participants will be able to
question leading scientists about their work on a number of issues.
</UL>

<P>

Judging from past conferences, those attending
the sixth will find time to mingle with colleagues, question cabinet
members (including EPA's Carol Browner), and return home with
a briefcase full of new story ideas and insights. 

<P>

Hotel availability may be tight if the St.
Louis Cardinals make it into the baseball playoffs, so those attending
the conference are urged to make early room reservations. The
Hyatt Regency at Union Station can be reached at (314) 231-1234,
or call the nearby Hampton Inn at (314) 241-3200. Discount airfare

<A NAME = "sej4"><H4>D.C. reporters dredge Baltimore Harbor for stories</H4></A>

<P>

A tour of Baltimore harbor to observe water
quality July 20 yielded story ideas and a better understanding
of pollution problems for 20 journalists who boarded a research
boat. Sponsored by the Washington, D.C. region of SEJ, with contributions
from <EM>Environmental Science and Technology</EM> magazine, the five hours
on historic waters connected to the Chesapeake Bay were shared
with scientists from EPA and the Maryland Department of the Environment.


<P>

Industrial pollution in the harbor has been
cut by 90 percent since the mid-1980s according to Gould Charshee
of the Maryland DOE. &quot;The biggest contributors now are non-point
sources from surface runoff and air deposition,&quot; he said.
&quot;How can you measure what comes out of a storm sewer?&quot;
Silt inflow was observed at Jones Falls and the Patapsco River.


<P>

&quot;We can't return the harbor waters to
the purity of 1720,&quot; added Mary Jo Garrets, also of DOE,
&quot;but by regulating urban and rural development we can keep
it from getting worse.&quot; 

<P>

A superfund site at a former Allied Chemical
chromium plant was pointed out, with explanations of what the
corporation's $100 million bought for the public (reduced pollution,
but some 60 lbs. of toxic chromium continues to leak each day
below a 50-foot restraining wall).

<P>

Pole fishing was observed along the shore,
and Garrets said both EPA and the Maryland DOE are now looking
at the possibility of altering advisories about eating fish. &quot;Allowing
lower-income people an alternative diet of eating polluted fish
occasionally may be better for them over a 70-year-period than
substituting highly fatty foods such as ham hocks, which can lead
to heart disease,&quot; Garrets stated.

<P>

Elsewhere, research crab pots were hauled
ashore and an oyster bed was dredged so participants could see
and handle commercial species at risk. 

<P>

Participants each paid $25 to defray costs.
A buffet lunch was served on board. Journalists found the day
worthwhile.

<P>

&quot;I may do a story on the 'alternative
diet' discussion,&quot; said Pat Phibbs, editor of the <EM>Environmental
Health Letter.</EM> 

<P>

&quot;I was surprised to hear that science
doesn't know how long a blue-fin crab lives,&quot; said Cheryl
Hogue, reporter for the Bureau of National Affair's <EM>Daily Environment
Report.</EM> &quot;That's pretty scary.&quot; 

<P>

&quot;The place came alive for me,&quot; said
trip organizer Jeff Johnson of <EM>Environmental Science and Technology</EM>
magazine. &quot;It's one thing to read or hear about problems,
and another to see them first hand.&quot;

<P>

&quot;We have asked you to come here not because
we are weak, but because we are strong,&quot; said SEJ vice president
Tom Meersman to a group of SEJ enthusiasts at the leadership workshop
in Boulder in late July. &quot;So much is happening in the organization
that we need people to help out.&quot;

<P>

Over the weekend on the University of Colorado
campus, 32 participants, half of them board members and SEJ employees
and the other half members active in SEJ activities, discussed
ways to make the organization responsive to its membership. Held
on the University of Colorado campus, the conference was sponsored
by SEJ and hosted by the university's Center for Environmental
Journalism.

<P>

High among priorities were calls for more
regional activities such as technical conferences on computer
work and backgrounding on regional issues. &quot;Think little
at first,&quot; suggested board member Rae Tyson, co-coordinator
for regional events. &quot;An event may be as small as a get-together
at a local eatery or as large as a thematic conference, with registration.&quot;
Tyson distributed a four-page document authored by Scott Powers
of the <EM>Columbus (Ohio) Dispatch</EM> entitled &quot;Tips on Throwing
a Regional SEJ Event.&quot;

<P>

Outreach to a wider audience was discussed,
including small and medium-sized newspapers and broadcast stations.
Suggestions included inviting staff from small media to nearby
regional events, and establishing short-course training sessions
at local universities. JoAnn Valenti, board representative for
academic membership, suggested more on-campus events to attract
student membership. 

<P>

Possibilities for revising and expanding current
SEJ online services were proposed by board member Russ Clemings
of <EM>The Fresno Bee.</EM> Participants supported his idea of creating
&quot;EnviroFAQs,&quot; files of Frequently Asked Questions about
environmental topics that could be accessed by reporters. SEJ
might also create an online archive of great environmental journalism,
he said. He suggested revamping the Web site to add search capabilities,
and establishing new and specialized listservs (forums for idea
exchanges among interested parties). Specialized listservs in
addition to the one for general members that now exists might
include one for board business, one for conference planning, or
one for leadership groups such as the group invited to Boulder.

<P>

The <EM>SEJournal</EM> came under scrutiny in a session
headed by new editor Noel Grove. He proposed including more, but
shorter, stories in the publication, with more photographs, and
setting apart the different sections of the magazine more clearly
with the help of distinctive logos. To lighten up the beat he
announced the beginning of a humor column in the fall issue, made
up of contributions from SEJ members who have had amusing encounters
during coverage. Suggestions from the floor included putting the
&quot;SEJ News&quot; section of the journal in a different type
face to set it apart from other stories, and installing a box
of the journal's copy deadlines for the benefit of contributors.
Several participants urged publishing more profiles of SEJ members
who have completed effective environmental reports, along the
lines of &quot;how I did my story.&quot;

He will direct the Journal's volunteer staff

publication. Previously those duties were split between volunteer
co-editors.

<P>

&quot;Noel's journalistic skills and his dedication
to SEJ's mission made this an easy decision,&quot; said SEJ executive
director Beth Parke. &quot;The <em>SEJournal's</em> co-editors and the
SEJ board agreed it was time to take the journal to the next level
of excellence and supported the decision to make the top editorship
a paid position.&quot;

<P>

Under the new management structure, former
co-editor Kevin Carmody becomes chairman of the newly created
<EM>SEJournal</EM> Editorial Board, which was established by the SEJ board
to guarantee the Journal's editorial independence. The editorial
board, which will have responsibility for selecting and advising
the editor, will be announced after its membership is complete.


<P>

&quot;Although the editor reports to the editorial
board, with Noel Grove in this position I have little doubt the
board will function more as a sounding board than in a supervisory
role,&quot; Carmody said. &quot;Noel has some exciting ideas for
improving the publication's content and design.&quot;

The <EM>SEJournal</EM> debuted in the summer of 1990,
six months after SEJ was incorporated. The first co-editors, Bowman

<A NAME = "features1"><H4>Covering Miami's Green Vice:<BR>
Indifference is the enemy among new Hispanics</H4></A>

<P>
<STRONG>By ANGELA SWAFFORD</STRONG>

<P>

Writing about the environment in Miami, in
Spanish, is a solitary job. Pushing this beat with certain editors
over the past nine years has practically cost 
me my position as a feature writer with <EM>El
Nuevo Herald,</EM> the <EM>Miami Herald's</EM> Spanish supplement. The persistence
required in bringing environmental awareness to readers might
apply to any community where indifference to the environment runs
rampant.

<P>

The Spanish media in this city, and I dare
say in the whole U.S., gives priority to practically every other
issue. Except for the occasional story or TV special on a topic
so glaring it cannot be avoided -- a toxic outbreak, for example -- the
non-English speaking communities especially live in an information
desert with respect to environmental problems that affect their
neighborhoods. This problem has several explanations.

<P>

First, the immigrants come to the U.S. with
the firmly ingrained priorities of getting a job, a home, and
sending their kids to school. In their minds, learning about or
caring for the environment is a nice idea but can come after the
attainment of their main goals.

<P>

Secondly, culture stands in the way. Educated
Latinos are fully aware of environmental issues and the mainstream
newspapers do a decent job of covering them, but the attitude
of the masses has traditionally been indifference. They fail to
see how littering the parks after Sunday picnics can have an effect
on the quality of their lives. They do not get the connection
between the dumping of automobile oil on the ground and their
water quality.

<P>

Third, Hispanic media, like all media, is
out to make money. If their audiences prefer to read, watch, or
listen to news about Castro, narco-traffickers, or Hialeah's mayor,
this is mostly what they will get. Channel 23, Univision's network
local station and the largest Hispanic TV network in the nation,
has decided that what Hispanics want are soap operas.

<P>

&quot;You can forget about a weekly page devoted
to the environment,&quot; answered Alberto Ibarguen, <EM>El Nuevo's</EM>
publisher, to my pleas. In the meantime local reporters have to
write two stories a day on certain Miami neighborhoods where the
paper needs penetration. These stories must go on page 1A, even
if they do not merit such play, so readers get the message their
paper is reaching out to them. Use a week to research a story
on the environment? You must be out of your mind.

<P>

Fourth, editors are simply not knowledgeable
enough to understand that environment goes beyond manatees and
alligators in the Everglades. &quot;You are the reporter who covers
the little animals,&quot; one of them said to me after I wrote
an article about the effect of big sugar farming on the Everglades.
&quot;How cute.&quot;

<P>

All this said, persistence has resulted in
some progress. Nine years after trying to make up for this need
by stealing time from my former features beat -- which did not include
the environment -- I became the sole green voice of Florida's Hispanic
community. Radio Caracol, the largest Spanish radio station in
Miami has shown some interest and has agreed to a weekly small
program, with no compensation. 

<P>

I have felt the stir of curiosity in the Hispanic
community about the environment. Readers have responded positively
to my opinion columns on the subject, and some now write letters.
&quot;My kid just emptied his aquarium into our backyard canal.
Is that bad?&quot; Or, &quot;Why are the palm trees in my block
dying and not those three blocks down the road?&quot; Some have
even called with tips for future stories.

<P>

At <EM>El Nuevo,</EM> those few editors who are beginning
to understand the importance of covering science and the environment
have at least declared a willingness to help place my freelance
work. It is not easy to open a path in a stubborn jungle. It is
going to happen, however, not just in Florida but also in New
York, Texas, and California, because we can't afford not to let
it happen. SEJ is a powerful tool in this effort. It makes my
job less solitary.

<STRONG>By CLARK THOMAS</STRONG>

<P>

&quot;I have a question for you,&quot; said
the capable-looking young Siberian newswoman in the audience at
Vladivostok, at a seminar on environmental reporting sponsored
by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

<P>

I had been speaking to the 40 journalists
about the need for objectivity in environmental reporting, talking
to all parties whether they be commercial loggers or green advocates
in Russia's new free-market economy. &quot;I receive only a small
base salary from my newspaper in Khabarovak,&quot; said the newswoman,
&quot;so my income largely depends on the number of articles that
I write. How can I spend hours and hours checking out all sides
of a matter in a single story?&quot;

<P>

I rather lamely replied that her conscience
would have to be her guide. But her situation made me realize
the challenges these journalists face in writing about a region
that is vast not only in size but in ecological importance.

<P>

Present at the seminar were virtually all
the print and broadcast media people covering environmental matters
in two territories on the Pacific Rim of vast Siberia, an area
the size of California, Oregon, and Washington combined. It includes
the far eastern portion of the Russian taiga, the vast forest
that is 20 per cent of the wooded area of the globe. 

<P>

With the breakdown of Communist authority,
the region now faces serious wildlife and timber poaching. Siberian
tigers, hunted for skins and body parts for folk medicines, have
declined to some 200. Valuable but exhaustible Korean pine is
being shipped illegally to Japan and nearby China. Another concern
is the disposal of radioactive waste from nuclear submarines being
decommissioned because of the end of the Cold War. 

<P>

The seminar where I spoke in early summer
was part of a 33-month, $16.5 million &quot;sustainable development&quot;
pilot project to help the far eastern Siberians fashion an environmental
and natural resource management system in the midst of economic
change. In the poor state of governmental finances, many game
wardens and forest rangers have not been paid for months. USAID
has provided some equipment, including uniforms.

<P>

Many of the journalists came out of the Green
movement that proliferated during the Communist era, so I felt
it imperative to stress the importance of objectivity if their
work was to be believable. Time constraints such as those the
young newswoman's mentioned, and a journalistic history in which
questioning of any official policy was unwelcome, are two hurdles
they have to overcome. 

<P>

They also spoke of the same lessened public
interest in environmental matters that one hears from their counterparts
in the United States. It was enough to humble any advice-giving
journalist from abroad.

<P>

I passed out issues of the SEJournal and application
forms for the International Federation for Environmental Journalists.
The bonds of journalism need to be strengthened with this faithful
few of hard-pressed reporters, helping oversee the future of an
important area undergoing ecological assault.

&quot;Border muck needs good raking&quot;

sustainable development are all newsworthy issues. But very few
are topical enough for a daily paper or national news broadcast.
In addition, the collapse of the Mexican peso and the decline
of the Mexican environmental business market led to the demise
of various industry magazines and newsletters.

<P>

So if the wire agencies and specialized newsletters
don't adequately cover the border, who will? I'm frustrated with
the Udall Center's elitist position of information distribution
and transparency. During a recent conference, the session was
opened to the public &quot;by invitation only.&quot; Other NGOs,
notably the Texas Center for Policy Studies, have similar positions.
I'm heartened by the recent SEJ-Udall collaboration, but it is
the exception, rather than the rule.

<P>

Fortunately, there are a few bright spots.
Kudos to the Interhemispheric Resource Center in Silver City,
New Mexico for its activist yet consistent coverage of this region
in the monthly magazine <EM>BorderLines.</EM>

A story with bite...En route to the Earth
Summit in Rio de Janeiro SEJ President Emilia Askari was asked
by her editor at the <EM>Detroit Free Press</EM> to cover a demonstration
project in sustainable agriculture in Brazil, funded by a Michigan
firm. Getting to the little town of Saubinha in the Amazon basin
was a scene reminiscent of <EM>The African Queen.</EM> &quot;I flew to
Manaus, and then it was several days by small plane and boat up
a tributary of the Amazon to this tiny village,&quot; says Emilia.


<P>

At one point, working through an interpreter
from Spanish to Portuguese to local dialects, she asked her hosts
for the meaning of the town's name, Saubinha. Struggling for an
interpretation, they said it was a tiny animal, they did not know
the name in English. But, they assurred her, she would figure
it out.

<P>

A day later, lying in a hammock on the small
return boat, she reached down to rub an itchy spot on her leg.
Then another. And another, until both legs were covered with red,
itchy welts that required her to wear throughout the Earth Summit
the one pants suit she'd brought. And, she says, she learned the
English name for the village.

<P>

&quot;I'd been to Chiggerville!&quot;

<STRONG>Sniffing out strangers ...</STRONG> Brainy scientists
make astounding technological discoveries, but some very basic
sensory perceptions remain with them. Jeri Lynn Smith, director
of news services for SUNY-Syracuse, says some years ago her predecessor
interviewed a world-class chemist on the SUNY faculty about his
pioneering work in polymer chemistry. As she walked in the door
he looked up, sniffed, and said, &quot;You're not in chemistry...I
can smell it.&quot;

<P>

<STRONG>From the tabloids ...</STRONG> When Mary Landers of the
University of Missouri was reporting for a group of medical newspapers,
a colleague attended a meeting of allergists. One physician presented
research about a type of dust mite that commonly inhabits furniture,
and he indicated that at least one person had died from an allergic
reaction to the mites.

<P>

&quot;It wasn't much of a story for our papers,&quot;
says Mary, &quot;but the woman seated next to my colleague was
a tabloid reporter and she was thrilled. As she scribbled her
notes she turned to him with excitement and said, 'I can see the
headline now -- Living dust kills!'

<P>

<STRONG>Too much news ...</STRONG> While newspapering in South
America board member Angela Swafford traveled with a group of
journalists to a prisoner's island far off the coast in an education
program for  inmates. One particularly bright and eager prisoner
became fascinated with Angela's maritime knowledge, and asked
numerous questions about ocean currents and prevailing winds in
their area. &quot;He was absolutely charming, so interested in
learning about the sea, and I thought how nice that he has retained
such an inquiring mind,&quot; says Angela. 

<P>

And she found out why. Some weeks later she
opened the newspaper to see a photograph of the inquisitive prisoner
alongside a story saying that he had escaped the island on a homemade
raft.

<H4>Green grenade: Is environment linked with national security?</H4>

<P>

<STRONG>By P.J. SIMMONS</STRONG>

<P>

&quot;As we move into the 21st century, the
nexus between security and the environment will become even more
apparent.&quot; So said Secretary of State Warren Christopher
following his April 1996 announcement of the State Department's
initiative to put environmental issues near the top of the foreign
policy agenda.

<P>

Coming from a veteran foreign policy maker
with little environmental background, Christopher's speech raised
hopes that U.S. foreign policy was finally embracing a principle
long espoused by scholars such as Jessica Matthews, Thomas Homer-Dixon,
and Lester Brown: namely, that the unprecedented scales of population
growth, resource depletion and global environmental change demand
a redefinition of security.

<P>

The speech also prompted a predictable reaction
among many traditional foreign policy thinkers. To them, raising
the profile of international environmental issues seems a dangerous
distraction at a time of diminishing budgets and declining public
interest in foreign affairs.

<P>

The internal State Department deliberations
on environment reflect the larger debate over how and whether
environmental issues relate to foreign policy and security priorities.
Most analyses of these questions address three core ideas. 

<P>

First, environmental problems may adversely
affect human security and/or economic security interests. This
is a holistic view of security that extends beyond protecting
the state. Its proponents argue that environmental problems can
threaten human health and well-being in any number of ways. At
the global level, for example, ozone layer depletion will expose
humans to more cancer-causing ultraviolet radiation. Similarly,
global warming may create conditions more conducive to the spread
of infectious diseases. At the local level, the depletion or pollution
of resources critical to individuals' survival -- arable land, fresh
water, and forests -- can lead to greater incidences of sickness,
malnutrition, and mortality.

<P>

Proponents also argue that environmental problems
can threaten nations' economic security. Destruction of forest
areas, for example, can lead to changes in local climate, flooding,
and the destruction of irrigation systems and waterways; the resulting
siltation can destroy arable land, decimate fisheries, and severely
restrict the navigability of strategic waterways like the Panama
Canal. Economies may also face burdensome and sometimes crippling
retroactive costs connected to inadequate handling of hazardous
waste disposal. Furthermore, countries adapting to climate change
may be saddled with enormous costs associated with more frequent
catastrophic weather events and fundamental changes in agricultural
systems.

<P>

Critics charge that this line of thinking
employs the honorific term &quot;security&quot; solely to win
more attention and funding. They oppose categorizing environmentally
related health and well-being issues as security threats, since
they are fundamentally different from military threats. Defining
security so broadly, they say, renders the term meaningless. 

<P>

Second, environmental problems may adversely
affect traditional military security interests. Proponents maintain
that local environmental degradation and/or resource scarcity
will become an increasingly important factor in political instability
and violent conflict. The number of regional conflicts in developing
countries may proliferate in the coming decades, leading to a
more unstable and chaotic international system.

<P>
In case studies, scholars show that many sub-national
conflicts are induced in part by environmental factors that affect
economic productivity, elite interests, and states' capacity to
provide citizens with basic needs. These internal conflicts could
lead to a fragmentation of the state or, conversely, to a more
authoritarian hardening of the state.

<P>

Because of the increasing rate and scale of
environmental change, the past can only partly be a guide to future
trends. Nevertheless, compelling examples of environmentally related
strife exist. In the Philippines and Peru, for example, the rise
of the Shining Path and New People's Army can be attributed in
part to resource destruction. In both cases, environmental stresses
deepened poverty and made peasants more supportive of insurgency.

<P>

Critics argue that environmental problems
only merit attention if they contribute to interstate wars -- which
they are unlikely to do. Others claim that even in the examples
of environmentally driven intra-state conflict, the relationship
between environmental scarcity and conflict is spurious. For
these observers, antecedent political and economic variables
are the necessary and sufficient conditions for conflict. Finally,
some argue that environmental problems are more likely to defuse
tensions and prompt collective action among states than to generate
conflict.

<P>

Third, security institutions can affect the
environment both adversely and positively.This proposition turns
the usual &quot;environment and security&quot; causal links around,
focusing on how security affects the environment. On one side
are those who argue that security institutions such as armies
and air bases should be excluded from environmental solutions
altogether because their activities inherently cause environmental
damage. Others believe that the conflict orientation of national
security makes military institutions' tools inappropriate for
addressing transnational environmental problems that require cooperative
and transparent responses. Finally, some argue that the armed
forces cannot sacrifice operational readiness for involvement
in non-traditional activities like environmental protection.

<P>

The counter argument is that the military
and intelligence communities have powerful capacities to help
analyze, predict and ameliorate international environmental problems.
The intelligence community offers environmental monitoring capabilities
and multidisciplinary analytical tools to weave environmental
factors into complex political and economic assessments. Similarly,
the United States military has specialized knowledge and experience
to share with other nations' militaries about resource management
and pollution cleanup and prevention. The military is already
engaged in numerous ventures -- some in conjunction with the Energy
Department and the Environmental Protection Agency under an &quot;Environmental
Security Plan&quot; -- to cooperate with foreign partners on environmental
matters. These activities aim to build trust, forge new partnerships
and thereby enhance bilateral relationships and promote international
peace and security.

<P>

As the debate on environment and security
continues, environmentalists' arguments will be strengthened if
they resist the temptation to lump all priorities under the attention-grabbing
security rubric -- and instead research and articulate precisely
how environmental changes relate to specific U.S. national interests
(including, but not limited to, security interests). Meanwhile,
skeptical foreign policy experts would benefit from keeping an
open mind about the complexity of environmental systems and their
relevance to some security issues. If both sides are guided by
honest intellectual inquiry, they will advance U.S. interests
in areas of mutual concern.

In the past year intelligence officials at
the U.S. State Department and elsewhere have begun to ask whether
some of this decade's hot wars, in Somalia, Rwanda and elsewhere,
aren't just outbreaks of ethnic or clan violence, but might be
linked to environmental factors that lead to drought, hunger and
dramatic population shifts.

<P>

In April, Secretary of State Warren Christopher
announced a new environmental initiative as part of U.S. foreign
policy. The State Department's action was influenced by scholarly
work in this field, particularly that of Thomas Homer-Dixon and
his colleagues at the University of Toronto's Project on Environment,
Population and Security. Another research effort in the field
is now underway at Stanford, led by Donald Kennedy; and the Woodrow
Wilson Center, in Washington, D.C., has launched the Environmental
Change and Security Project. P.J. Simmons, director of the Wilson
Center project, offers an overview of the environment and security
debate in this issue's &quot;Viewpoints&quot; essay.

<H3>Reporter's Toolbox</H3>

<A NAME = "toolbox"><H4>Some corporations greening up:<BR>
Big industry, local companies are finding that ecology pays</H4></A>

<P>
<STRONG>By JOHN WASIK</STRONG>

<P>

It's easy to think of multinational and even
local corporations and institutions as &quot;the enemy&quot; when
covering the environment. They command large facilities, devour
natural resources, and are visibly scarring the planet. But what
if the thinking behind their pattern of consumption were to change?


<P>

In a quiet and potentially powerful shift
in institutional thinking, many large organizations are realizing
the relationship between ecology and economics. Those that do
are not only reducing their operations costs, they are improving
productivity and increasing their profits as well. This new paradigm
has been largely ignored in the mainstream media and can yield
a number of interesting environmental stories. It could represent
a positive trend as we enter a new millenia, but it is an area
that requires skillful reporting.

<P>
The more responsive corporations are realizing
that they, too, are part of a larger web of ecosystems. In the
new discipline known as &quot;design for environment&quot; and
ecological economics, which had its genesis in Europe, products
are manufactured, distributed, sold, and disposed of in an economic
scheme whereby waste is equated to needless expenditures of energy,
labor, and corporate profit. This &quot;new&quot; scheme focuses
on some old but often-ignored maxims of corporation operations.
While it's no secret that corporations can reduce their bottom
lines by cutting the amount of raw materials and energy they consume,
they are now seeing it in an environmental light. In the process
they are discovering that good ecology is marketable.

<P>

Companies such as General Motors and Poloroid,
for example, have adopted the CERES (Coalition for Environmentally
Responsible Economics) Principles which grew out of the Exxon
oil spill near Valdez, Alaska. That means they include such practices
as recycling, materials reduction, and pollution prevention into
their operations. Their overall marketing reflects this shift.
Hundreds of other corporations have adopted the less stringent
Business Charter for Sustainable Development (BCSD).

<P>

The bean-counters are finding that ecology
begun for public relations purposes is also good business. A recent
University of Michigan study found that several companies saw
improvements in operating performance within the first year. By
the second year they reaped enhanced returns on equity, a gauge
of the value of an investment. Xerox invested $10 million in recycling
toner cartridges for copiers and the move resulted in a $200 million
profit. Dow's &quot;Waste Reduction Always Pays&quot; program
saved the company more than $110 million annual savings over 10
years with a return on investment of 204 percent.

<P>

Involving themselves even more directly in
environmental affairs are some 100 firms who manage their corporate
lands for wildlife as members of the Wildlife Habitat Council
(WHC) in Silver Spring, MD. Programs ranging from setting out
bluebird boxes to restoring wetlands on corporate land holdings
not only play well with employees, says WHC communications director
Jana Goldman, they also market well with the general public. Corporations
are now managing for wildlife some 400 sites totaling 327,000
acres in the U.S.

<P>

Following international standards is another
marketing strategy that could propel many corporations into green
practices. Standard-setting, again popular in Europe because of
European Economic Community activities and the influence of green
political parties, is vastly under-reported and ignored in the
U.S. An obscure group to most Americans is ISO, an international
standards organization based in Switzerland that standardizes
everything from film speeds to quality control. The organization's
recent 14000 series of standards will set guidelines for everything
from environmental audits in factories to labeling of environmentally
sound products. Companies in the global market may find they have
to publicize their environmentally conscious public.

<P>

What does all this mean to the environmental
beat? A number of compelling angles can be pursued in writing
or broadcasting stories that please your editors, your readers
or listeners, and even the corporations accustomed to being harangued
by the media.

<UL>
<LI>Check out what local companies are doing
to reduce their resource use. Public relations or environmental
officers will be happy to talk about it.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Inquire about whether local companies
produce annual environmental reports. Either a yes or no answer
may produce news. If the answer is yes, the report may lead to
stories about environmental management.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Has environmental management made the
company more competitive? Many companies such as 3M, Patagonia,
and others claim that it has created jobs, reduced costs of production,
and lowered waste.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>What are companies doing to preserve or
restore habitat? Many have found that restoring prairies, wetlands,
or meadows saves on maintenance costs. To find out if local companies
are among the 400 sites listed by the Wildlife Habitat Council,
contact Jana Goldman at (301) 588-8994.
</UL>

<P>

Of course, the new wave of corporate greening
is tinged with efforts to &quot;greenwash&quot; the records of
some major-league polluters. An entire &quot;good-news industry&quot;
combines aggressive public relations, corporate donations, and
phony environmental groups that are fronting corporate interests.
Good reporting skills still apply. Ask for specifics, figures
on savings in productions costs, and make sure they add up. Ask
to see habitat being managed for wildlife.

<P>

The trend is real, and growing. Improved economics
and international standards mean that companies seeking to compete
may have to green their operations or lose something more dear
to them than rain forests and air quality-market share.

<H4><A NAME = "science">Closing in on mercury guidelines</H4></A>

<P>

<STRONG>By SARA THURIN ROLLIN</STRONG>

<P>

Epidemiologists are studying two groups of
fish-eating islanders that may in the foreseeable future yield
information about the safe dose of methylmercury for children
and women of child-bearing age.

<P>

On a separate but related track, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency is trying to finish work on what
some people have called the most comprehensive report to date
on mercury. EPA released a draft of the multi-year research report
June 28 without fanfare or a press release.

<P>

The report and forthcoming epidemiology data
will interest government officials who are trying to determine
if ongoing exposure to low levels of methyl-mercury in fish poses
a health hazard to humans and/or wildlife. The only populations
of concern are children, women of child-bearing years, and subsistence
fishing communities, an EPA official said.

<P>

The data may support tightening of the reference
dose, which is a safe-dose level on which pollution controls for
non-cancer hazards are based. States also consult EPA's reference
dose when deciding whether to issue fish advisories warning about
contamination.

<P>

Scientists and government officials have known
for decades that high doses of mercury make people and animals
sick, impair vision, and can cause death. No study has yet identified
the lowest, safe dose. &quot;Mercury is one of the most important
environmental contaminants,&quot; said Howard Fox, the lead Sierra
Club Legal Defense Fund attorney that sued EPA to force the release
of its mercury report. 

<P>

Mercury as a chemical element cannot be created
or destroyed. The same amount has existed on the planet since
the earth was created, according to EPA's draft report. Most environmental
mercury is from human activity, said Hillary Carpenter, a scientist
from the Minnesota Department of Health. &quot;Man-made releases
speed up what would have taken nature a long time to circulate.&quot;

<P>

When final, the report may aid federal agencies
and states that have been contemplating action to control mercury,
Fox said. The report is one of several mandated in the Clean Air
Act amendments of 1990 aimed at helping to determine whether controls
were needed on coal-fired utilities, including new mercury emissions
controls. Most water sources of mercury releases have been controlled,
an official from EPA's water office said.

<P>

The draft EPA report has an &quot;incredible
emissions inventory&quot; that shows most controllable mercury
is emitted by combustion facilities from contaminants in their
fuel, said Joann Held, a meteorologist from the New Jersey Department
of Environmental Protection. Mercury emissions travel around the
globe, she noted.

<P>

While mercury exists in many forms, it is
methylmercury that accumulates in the food chain, said Joy Taylor,
Great Lakes Air Toxics coordinator for Michigan. The conversion
between chemical forms occurs in aquatic systems, and therefore
humans are most likely to be exposed to methylmercury through
fish consumption, according to EPA's draft report.

<P>

The scope of the &quot;National Mercury Problem&quot;
is seen in the fish advisories issued by 35 states, according
to EPA's draft report. The advisories warn against consumption
of certain amounts of species of freshwater fish that are contaminated
with mercury, according to the draft report. Taylor said Michigan
has a statewide mercury advisory for all of its 11,000 inland
lakes.

<P>

&quot;The pressing public policy question
is to decide if we can do something to try to prevent the build-up
of mercury in fish,&quot; said Tom Gentile, chief toxics assessment
section in the New York Department of Environmental Conservation.
Because the body can eliminate mercury over time, a couple months
after a fishing vacation a person would not be expected to carry
mercury residue, Minnesota's Carpenter explained.

<P>

An electric power industry official, Leonard
Levin, said the question is: &quot;Are current standards for mercury
exposure protective enough for people who, in the normal way,
are eating fish that may have mercury in it?&quot;

<P>

In the unfinished epidemiology studies of
the two groups of fish-eating islanders, &quot;we hope to find
out what is the safe limit of methylmercury in fish,&quot; said
Tom Clarkson, one of the lead researchers in the Seychelles Island
study. Notable about these studies, scientists said, is the observation
of populations where the exposure to methylmercury is at or just
below EPA's reference dose.

<P>

The data may show whether there is a link
between methylmercury in mothers and any health effects in their
children, said Clarkson, a toxicologist at the University Rochester
School of Medicine. &quot;We might find some effect and might
find nothing.&quot;

<P>
The focus of mercury health research shifted
to children and women of child-bearing years in the 1960s. Food
contamination incidents in Iraq and Minimatta, Japan showed that
pregnant women passed mercury to their offspring. Some of the
children suffered long-term effects, such as an inability to walk,
while others showed signs of impaired development, such as delayed
walking.

<P>

In May 1995, EPA tightened its reference dose
for methylmercury based on health effects observed in the Iraqi
children, an agency official said. In 1997, the agency will review
the reference dose in light of the data received from the two
island-based studies.

<P>

The Seychelles Island and Faeroe Island studies
are important according to Clarkson because both populations have
a diet where contaminated fish are a staple. The continuous exposure
to low levels of methyl mercury does not allow adequate time for
the body to rid itself of mercury.

<P>

So far, he added, most of the data from the
Seychelles Island study suggests, &quot;the children seem to be
developing along normal lines ... at the present moment.&quot;
Clarkson and his colleagues plan to continue their study for several
years. They are looking for subtle changes, he said, such as delayed
walking.

<P>

The Faeroe Island researchers, whose data
have not yet been released publicly, report a small change in
the children's developmental abilities, Clarkson said.

<P>

However, he cautioned, the Faeroe Island population
eats a variety of marine mammals having other contaminants; the
Faeroe Island scientists must try to tease out whether the effects
are from methylmercury or something else.

How to weave through bytes without being bytten</H4></A>

<P>

<STRONG>By MIGUEL LLANOS</STRONG>

<P>

Are you trapped on the Internet, not knowing
where to go for information? If so, here are some tips for making
the most of those billions of bytes of data.

<P>

<STRONG>Navigation:</STRONG> The World Wide Web, the part
of the Internet that includes text, audio, and image files, is
immense. It's a challenge to find the useful resources among the
unreliable, biased or useless sites. With new resources appearing
daily, you'd be wise to learn how to use tools that let you explore
categories or search for specific sites and topics. There are
two basic types of search tools: directories, which work like
the <EM>Yellow Pages;</EM> and search engines, which use keywords to search
deep into the Web. All of the tools listed below are free, with
most supported by advertising.

<P>

<STRONG>Directories:</STRONG> My favorite starting point
for any search, <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo,</A> makes exploring
by topic easy. You can look under categories like environment
(listed under &quot;Society and Culture&quot;), or a country,
or a U.S. state, and then link directly to the listed sites. You
can search the Yahoo directory with keywords. That's not the same
as searching the entire contents of a site, but that can be an
advantage, since it means you won't to be overwhelmed by the number
of &quot;hits&quot; your search produces. 

<P>

Along with your search results, Yahoo also
provides links to much more comprehensive &quot;search engines&quot;
where you can continue your search if your initial query doesn't
produce the results you need. One warning about keyword searching,
though: Whether on Yahoo or another search engine, avoid using
a single broad keyword like &quot;environment&quot; or &quot;politics&quot;
or even &quot;energy&quot; or you'll be buried in an avalanche
of information.

<P>

Whereas Yahoo's &quot;Yellow Pages&quot; style
means it lists only basic details about a site, <A HREF="http://www.mckinley.com">Mckinley</A>
reviews and grades thousands of Web sites. Like Yahoo,
Mckinley lets you search by keywords or explore by categories,
but I still prefer Yahoo because of its cleaner organization and
links to search engines.

<P>

At <A HREF="http://www.clearinghouse.net">Argus Clearinghouse,</A> academic librarians and other experts have stored
dozens of Internet resource guides. The site allows keyword searching
and often turning up leads not found in Yahoo or McKinley.

<P>

<STRONG>Search Engines:</STRONG> Say your search on Yahoo
for &quot;New York nuclear&quot; turns up nothing. Don't panic.
Along with your search result, Yahoo lists several full-text search
engines that you can use to search the entire contents of thousands
of web sites. And with a single mouse click, Yahoo will feed your
keywords directly to any of those search engines. Here are the
two best full-text search engines:

<P>

<A HREF="http://www.altavista.digital.com">Altavista:</A>
I usually go here first after a Yahoo search because
my experience tells me it's a bit more rewarding than Lycos. 


<P>

My second choice, <A HREF="http://www.lycos.com">Lycos,</A>
also lists resources by category.

<P>

<STRONG>Finding e-mail listservs:</STRONG> With its ability
to show images and transmit audio, the Web gets most of the attention
these days. But electronic mailing lists, or listservs -- the majority
of them free -- can be valuable for asking questions or following
expert discussions. Many Web sites are static, simply listing
data. But e-mail lists are alive with debate and ideas. Using
the Web you can search descriptions of some 20,000 lists. Some
sites not only let you search by keyword, they also let you automatically
join a list that looks interesting. The warning about overly broad
search terms applies here too.

<P>

At <A HREF="http://www.webcom.com/impulse/list.html">http://www.webcom.com/impulse/list.html</A>
you'll find a site that explains the various types of software
used to create e-mail lists, such as listserv and majordomo, and
includes links to the leading databases of e-mail list descriptions.


<P>

<STRONG>Finding usefulness on Usenet:</STRONG> Another often-overlooked
area accessible via the Internet is the Usenet, a network akin
to a bulletin board where any user can post or respond to messages.
If you have an Internet account, you're likely to have Usenet
access as well.

<P>

Usenet is structured by broad categories,
the largest and least controlled of which are the &quot;alt.&quot;
groups, as in alternative. But for environmental resources, try
the &quot;sci.&quot; groups first, especially sci.environment.
If you have Usenet access you can search the 20,000 or so group
names for a keyword like &quot;environment.&quot; Try the following
to search Usenet postings and their archives.

<P>

<UL><LI>Besides allowing you to search Web sites,
<A HREF="http://www.altavista.digital.com"> AltaVista</A> also gives
you the option of searching recent Usenet postings. The default
search is for Web sites; you have to change it to search the Usenet.
</UL>
<P>
<UL><LI>Not only can you search by keywords at <A HREF="http://www.dejanews.com">Dejanews,</A>
you can also search by name
or e-mail address. If you want to know whether Marvin Minsky
has been posting, just type his name. 
</UL>
<P>

<STRONG>Finding what's new:</STRONG> With so much to explore,
it's hard to keep up with what's new. Here's my strategy:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Each day, Yahoo adds some 2,000 sites. Check
<A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/new/">Yahoo's What's New</A> to explore
what was added yesterday, or earlier in the week, either by category -- you
can quickly go to environment and see if anything has been added -- or
as a full file. 

<P>

Many Web sites have a &quot;what's new&quot;
section that tells you what's been added in recent months. Less
used, but with great potential, are e-mail notices from Web sites
that tell you what's new. PBS, for one, does a great job of advising
its visitors about web resources that provide background for PBS
programs. You can sign up for this service at the 
<A HREF="http://www.pbs.org">PBS web site.</A>

<EM>Mirage: The False Promise of Desert Agriculture</EM><BR>
by Russell Clemings<BR>
Sierra Club Books, 1996, $28.00 (hardcover)<BR>

<P>

Desert agriculture is a delicate balancing
act, and, according to Clemings, reporter for the <EM>Fresno Bee,</EM>
one that on at least a quarter of the world's 600 million acres
of irrigated land has tipped in favor of salinity, toxic poisoning,
and devastation.

<P>

<EM>Mirage</EM> details the most dramatic
of those failures. These are stories we have heard before: wildlife
massacres in California's Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge;
the reduction of the mighty Colorado to a poisonous trickle; the
death of Australian orchards. Clemings tries to illuminate the
bad science or bad politics behind these irrigation projects.

<P>

The only hope, presented in the last chapter,
is drip irrigation, which allows farmers to precisely water crops.
Although it has been perfected in the Israeli desert, ignorance
and high start-up costs keep it from gaining wider acceptance.
After reading about devastated fields for over 200 pages, that
does not seem like much.  What's left un-argued (at least explicitly)
is the case for not trying to grow crops where nature has provided
no water.

<EM>A New Name for Peace:<BR>International Environmentalism,
Sustainable Development, and Democracy</EM><BR>
By Philip Shabecoff<BR>
University Press of New England, 1996,
$24.95 (hardcover)<BR>

<P>

A number of books have been published recently
on the connection between international development and the environment.
Shabecoff, former New York Times reporter and author of A Fierce
Green Fire, approaches it in the context of attempts at international
cooperation -- mostly the UN's efforts to promote sustainable development.

<P>

The book recounts the history of the UN's
environmental programs and events such as the 1992 Rio conference,
from the perspective of someone who has been immersed in these
issues for years.  Although this book is a wealth of information
based on painstaking research, it's not recreational reading.
However, the reader is left with a sense of a whole issue, rather
than bewildered by a barrage of facts. Shabecoff makes his points
successfully, if slowly and carefully.

<P>

He began this project after being invited
to be a historian of the Earth Summit, which seems to have tied
Shabecoff to a UN focus. For all the book's underlying optimism,
one can't help noticing that the UN has generally been an ineffective
protector of the environment, with an entangled bureaucracy and
no real power to enforce its resolutions. This book might be stronger
if it didn't revolve so completely around the UN.

<EM>The Forgotten Pollinators</EM><BR>
Stephen L. Buchmann and Gary Paul Nabhan<BR>
Island Press, 1996, $25 (hardcover)<BR>

<P>

Aptly named, The Forgotten Pollinators points
out a fallacy in our eagerness to protect individual endangered
species: plants, animals and invertebrates have mutual dependencies.
No amount of government protection of a dwarf bearclaw poppy will
succeed without the bee responsible for its pollination. Conversely,
if the poppy dies out, what happens to the bee? 

<P>

Alternate nectar and pollen sources can be
found, but competition will increase. One will grow stronger;
another will diminish. Only protecting habitat, not species, will
allow those dependencies to survive.

<P>

In addition to supporting habitat protection
on general principles, Buchmann, an authority on pollination,
and Nabhan, a nature writer and ecologist, state the consequences
to humans -- many of our food, fiber, and beverage crops depend on
bees, beetles, and a host of other pollinators. The authors include
guidance in habitat restoration, resources, lists of pesticides
most or least toxic to pollinators, and a good dose of hope that
restoration is possible.

<EM>The Complete Idiot's Guide to Trouble-Free
Home Repair</EM><BR>
by David J. Tenenbaum<BR>
Alpha Books, 1996, $16.95 (softcover)<BR>

<P>

What environment affects us more than those
four sheet-rock walls we call home? Tenenbaum, when he's not freelancing
magazine articles, clearly spends a lot of time pounding nails.


<P>

In 325 pages, the author takes us non-professionals
from assembling a tool kit and evaluating our domicile with the
paranoid eye of a professional inspector to regrouting tile, rewiring
switches and replacing the guts of a toilet. Included are &quot;Don't
Screw Up!&quot; tips and &quot;The Least You Need to Know &quot;
summaries, ideal for those of us with MTV-length attention spans.


<P>

The whole effort is jaunty without being cloying,
and crammed with good advice. It might not supplant my <EM>Reader's
Digest Complete Do-It-Yourself Manual,</EM> but it's earned a
permanent place on the shelf.

<EM>Whose Backyard, Whose Risk:<BR> Fear and Fairness
in Toxic and Nuclear Waste Siting</EM><BR>
by Michael B. Gerrard<BR>
MIT Press, 1996, $17.50 (softcover)<BR>

<P>

This is the ideal crib book for anyone who
needs to become an instant expert on waste siting.  Gerrard, an
environmental lawyer and Columbia University professor, lays out
the whole sorry history of our attempts to make the worst of our
garbage go away: the unfairness of site selection by &quot;decide,
announce, defend&quot; (and usually, surrender); the huge costs
of current federal programs and private-sector disposal; and communities'
ineradicable fears of damage to health.

<P>

In the last three chapters, Gerrard suggests
reforming the siting process by reducing the amount of waste through
price incentives and removing hidden subsidies; allocating waste
to each of the 50 states based on their production, existing facilities
and geography; and asking communities to volunteer to host new
sites, with appropriate compensation.  Gerrard's approach is appropriately
lawyerly; no storytelling or drama, just solid information from
a reliable source.

<DD>Drinking water in Litchfield, Ct. has been
found to contain radon at levels that carry a cancer risk level
of one extra death in every 500 people consuming the water. That
is 10 times greater than what federal health policy generally
says is an acceptable environmental risk. However, there are no
federal or state standards involving radon in drinking water that
local water agencies such as Litchfield must meet. There is a
1990 state law directing Connecticut health officials to adopt
radon standards for drinking water. The health department, however,
has never established such standards because of concerns that
it could pose a financial hardship for small, local water companies.
Health officials also said they were waiting for more guidance
from federal officials on an acceptable level. For further information

Yankee, faces so many obstacles that it may never reopen even

<DD>In what may be the first such ruling in the
nation, Florida's Governor and cabinet has ruled that airborne
nitrogen deposited into surface waters may be regulated as a water
pollutant. The ruling came in Florida Power &amp; Light's failed
bid to permit the burning of a tar-like fuel called orimulsion
at one of its central Florida power plants. While the proposal
had received all necessary state regulatory blessings, the Governor
and cabinet bowed to citizen outcry and voted 4-3 to deny the
permit because of, among other things, possible adverse consequences
to Tampa Bay's ecosystem from airborne NOx deposition into that
designated national estuary's waters. The ruling is currently
under appeal but most observers hold that the court will sustain
the ruling. Many national studies have linked airborne NOx with
nitrogen deposition in surface waters hundreds of miles from the
source. Power plants in Ohio are linked with increased nitrogen
deposition in Chesapeake Bay, for instance. Currently, no national
or state laws or rules regulate such discharges. For more information,

<DD>At the <EM>Spokesman Review,</EM> staff writers Ken
Olsen and Eric Torbenson penned a two-day series detailing the
shrinking role of the timber industry in the economies of Eastern
Washington, North Idaho, and Western Montana. The Inland Northwest
timber industry has long been one of the region's economic heavyweights,
and has the political clout to prove it. Transfer payments, pensions,
and retirement income, however, are now much more substantial
contributors to the area's cash flow. In North Idaho, for example,
timber has gone from providing 14 percent of personal income in
1969 to less than four percent. Meanwhile, the large timber companies
are shifting their resources to the Southeast, South America,
British Columbia, and Asia. While the perception is that environmental
regulation has taken out several sawmills, economics and modernization
are the true culprits. For more information, contact Torbenson

<DD>Chicago newspapers have been giving extra
attention to the issue of the foreign aquatic species that have
invaded the Great Lakes, specifically Lake Michigan. Most recently,
<EM>Chicago Sun-Times</EM> environment writer Jim Ritter explained why
zebra mussles are producing an odor problem in  Chicago's drinking
water supply. It seems the mussles are filtering the water so
well that sunlight is reaching the lake bottom near the city's
water intake in the lake. That has allowed algae to grow where
it never has before, and it is entering the water supply with
smelly results but no health danger.  In late September, the <EM>Chicago
Tribune's</EM> new environment writer, Peter Kendall, offered an extensive
review of the many invading species that are affecting the lake's
ecological ballance. Those of greatest concern include the goby,
a small fish that may be preying on young yellow perch. <EM>The Daily
Southtown</EM> reported in late August that perch, a valuable sport
and commercial fish, may have suffered a near complete reproductive
failure for the seventh consecutive year. Although state biologists
on the Michigan side of the lake see evidence of some young perch,
their Wisconsin and Illinois counterparts had found just one juvenile
perch in their initial fall count,  reported environment writer
Kevin Carmody. More complete data are due in mid-October.

<DD>Iowa geologists have discovered that shallow
waterways in an area densely populated with large hog confinements
are much more well-connected than previously thought. This has
raised new concerns over possible pollution of groundwater, the
source of 80 percent of Iowa's drinking water. What amounts to
an aquifer just 5 to 15 feet below the surface was left by the
most recent glacier. Drainage wells meant to keep farm fields
dry would send pollutants straight into aquifers in case of a
spill or leak from a hog-waste lagoon, too. Other states with
geology affected by glaciers could face similar questions, though
the study by the Geological Survey Bureau of the Iowa Department
of Natural Resources focused only on Iowa. Call Perry Beeman,

<DD>Maryland environmental officials are considering
&quot;capping&quot; portions of Baltimore Harbor's contaminated
bottom with a thick layer of cleaner sediments dredged from Chesapeake
Bay. Though industrial pollution has been reduced through regulatory
actions in the last 20 years, the lower Patapsco River that forms
Baltimore's harbor is still assaulted by inadequately treated
sewage and industrial waste, tainted runoff from city streets
and suburban lawns, and by fallout of noxious chemicals from auto
exhaust, power plants, and smokestacks. So badly contaminated
is the harbor that it is widely recognized as one of three toxic
&quot;hot spots&quot; in Chesapeake Bay, along with the rivers
flowing by two of the bay's other major urban areas: Norfolk,
Va., and Washington, D.C. Environmentalists criticize the state's
plan for the harbor, questioning the efficacy of capping contaminated
sediments and urging even tighter regulation of sewage plants
and industries still discharging to the waters. The article on
the harbor cleanup appeared in the <EM>Baltimore Sun</EM> Aug. 6, 1996.

<DD>Enforcement of Maryland's environmental laws
has declined, sharply in some categories, over the past two years
as state officials seek to encourage voluntary compliance rather
than punish polluters. The dollar amount of penalties collected
by the Maryland Department of the Environment has dropped 61 percent
since fiscal 1993, as state inspectors issued 50 percent fewer
citations for water, wastewater, and wetlands violations. Violation
notices for air pollution actually increased during that same
time period, the number of penalty actions resulting in fines
levied against polluters fell by nearly two thirds. State officials
attribute the decline in penalty actions to budget and staffing
cuts and to an increased emphasis on seeking voluntary compliance.
They insist that flagrant violations are still being pursued aggressively.
The Environmental Protection Agency, however, is not so sure,
and has asked state officials to furnish further information on
its enforcement activity.  One area of particular concern: politically
sensitive wetlands regulations,  where the number of enforcement
actions fell by 90 percent in the past year alone. In a few recent
cases, EPA officials have actually taken taken the unusual step
of launching federal enforcement actions when state efforts seemed
slow or weak. For instance, EPA levied a $50,000 fine against
Campbell Soup for chronic water pollution violations at an Eastern
Shore poultry plant it operated after state officials decided
not to penalize the company. An article on Maryland's environmental
enforcement decline appeared in the Baltimore Sun on Aug. 11,
1996.  For more informaiton, contact Tim Wheeler (tbwheeler@aol.com)

<DD>Maryland Gov. Parris N. Glendening has pledged
to seek new legislation to curb suburban sprawl in the state,
which he has made one of his administration's top priorities.
The governor has said he would not try to usurp traditional local
control over zoning, but would try redirecting state funding to
rebuild older existing communities, which have lost population
and jobs to outlying counties. Local officials, however, are skeptical
of any new state initiatives dealing with development and especially
reluctant to see any changes in funding for schools, roads, and
other infrastructure.  Environmentalists, meanwhile, question
whether sprawl can really be curtailed without a more aggressive
state role in directing where development occurs. Articles on
the subject have appeared in the <EM>Baltimore Sun</EM> on Aug. 8 and 18

development is leading to increased degradation of water quality
in the state's major streams. The new law further restricts development
for up to 250 feet on each side of streams, as well as a more

barges of oil into state waters. The new rules were in response
to the grounding of a tub and barge last January that spilled
828,000 gallons of oil onto Rhode Island's beaches. A subsequent
investigation showed that the barge's anchor was lashed so securely
to the deck it couldn't be released. Furthermore, there was no
suppression system to put out the fire that swept the tug's engine
room and triggered the accident. The new law requires that oil
barges have crews and operable anchors. It also mandates that
barges have double-hull construction, or be accompanied by an
escort tug when conditions limit visibility. For more information,

industry in West Virginia. An eight-month investigation by reporter
Ken Ward Jr. found that timber harvests in the state have doubled
since 1987 and should double again in the next few years. The
Gazette found that much of that increased cut is to feed three
new chip board mills. Even more trees would be cut for pulpwood
if a new pulp and paper mill proposed for along the Ohio River
is built. The series also reports that loggers in West Virginia
remain unregulated and that no one has done serious studies of
whether the logging increase is harming the environment. The series

coverage of it. WCHS-TV in Charleston broadcast a story in late
August which declared the project dead because of an adverse ruling
on the mill's water permit by the state environmental quality
board. The station based the story, however, on a copy of a letter
to the state from the company which the station had not obtained.
The <EM>Charleston Gazette</EM> obtained the letter, which actually did
not say the $1 billion project was off, but simply expressed concern
about some parts of the state's air pollution permit for the mill.
The WCHS story, however, was widely quoted by other news media.
It was reported initially by longtime West Virginia television
personality Bob Brunner. Brunner gave the story more credibility
because he was press spokesman for Gov. Gaston Caperton before
returning to television news several years ago. The WCHS story
has since been denied by state economic development agents and
by Parsons &amp; Whittemore, which has mostly refused to comment
on the project since it was first proposed in 1988. For more information,

<DD>The <EM>Milwaukee Journal/Sentinel</EM> used an open
records request to secure seven hundred pages of e-mail about
a controversial golf course being build along Lake Michigan. <EM>The
Journal/Sentinel's</EM> Steve Schultze discovered that front-line staff
at two state agencies were concerned about approving wetlands
permits for the course being developed by wealthy industrialists
Herbert Kohler. As Schultze noted in his August 5 story, &quot;Those
objections were overridden by their superiors.&quot; Democratic
state lawmakers later called for a public hearing on the matter.

<DD>For the second time in three years, the Wisconsin
Mining Association invited journalists to visit the Kennecott
Corporation's copper mine at Ladysmith. About four reporters attended
the early Sept. event. The Wisconsin Mining Association is part
of the Wisconsin Association of Manufacturers and Commerce, which
has been lobbying for approval of a much larger mine the Exxon
Corporation wants to develop near Crandon. Environmental groups
oppose the project. Contact Gil Halsted of Wisconsin Public Radio
at (715) 848-3036.

<DD>Sierra Club members were among the Bob Dole
critics who demonstrated prior to a Dole rally in Madison in September.
Democrats alerted reporters who were scheduled to cover the Dole
speech. At least one television station interviewed Sierra Club
official Carl Zichella. Zichella can be reached at (608) 257-4994.

<P>By Jim Detjen

</P><P>A few dozen ants began showing up on the dining room 
table at breakfast. By lunch (in a sprawling conference center 
outside of Kiev, Ukraine) hundreds of ants were out in force, 
conducting military maneuvers on the table. 

</P><P>Now, nobody has ever accused me of being Mr. Cleanliness, 
but I must admit that I found these roving bands of insects a bit 
disconcerting. 

</P><P>By dinner thousands of ants were swarming across the 
table, which appeared not to have been cleaned all day. The ants 
marched across forks and spoons, scurrying up glasses, building 
nests inside the sugar bowl. 

</P><P>I found this a bit disgusting. But the Russian 
journalists and environmental leaders at my table treated it as 
if nothing were unusual. They occasionally cupped a hand and 
brushed a regiment or two off the table. But most of the time it 
was as if nothing were unusual. 

</P><P>This was but just one of the cultural differences I 
experienced during a trip to Russia and Ukraine in late May and 
early June. The purpose of my trip -- my first to the former Soviet 
Union (FSU) -- was to build bridges with environmental journalists 
and educators in the vast area of Eurasia. 

</P><P>The EcoForum conference I attended was a 
horizon-expanding trip in many ways. More than 150 journalists, 
scientists, academics, and activists from the FSU met with about 
40 American counterparts. The purpose was to learn about each 
other's countries, establish linkages, and assist each other. The 
trip was sponsored by a nonprofit group, the Institute for 
Soviet-American Relations (ISAR). 

</P><P>I spoke throughout the conference about efforts by 
American journalists to build the Society of Environmental 
Journalists during the past five years, and described SEJ's 
programs. I was assisted in this effort by Christine Maugans Hoch 
of the Environmental Health Center, which publishes <A HREF="ew.htm"><EM>Environment 
Writer.</EM></A> Our efforts were at least partly successful. By the end 
of the week, environmental writers from throughout the FSU 
decided to create a fledgling organization that will exchange 
information about environmental journalism and ecological 
developments throughout the FSU (a land that is increasingly 
called Eurasia), a vast region spanning 6,000 miles and 10 time  
zones. The new group is headed by Ilya Belov, a bright, young 
editor of the Moscow-based <EM>Russian Conservation News.</EM>

</P><P>I couldn't help but think back to the meeting in 
Washington, D.C. in December 1989 when about 20 American 
environmental journalists got together and decided to form SEJ. 

</P><P>Obviously, it's too early to know how successful the 
Eurasian effort will be and what shape that organization will 
take. SEJ will provide support in the form of information and 
advice. Ultimately, it will be up to the FSU journalists whether  
or not their effort succeeds. 

</P><P>There certainly is a vast need for environmental media 
and an effective organization of environmental journalists in the 
FSU. It's hard to overstate the seriousness of environmental 
degradation there. Safe drinking water is virtually unheard of 
throughout the FSU. Even in Moscow and Kiev we were advised to 
drink bottled water or to boil water taken from the tap. 

</P><P>Vast areas of the FSU are radioactive. During more than 
half a century of secrecy, the leaders of the former Soviet Union 
haphazardly dumped radioactive debris from nuclear weapons and 
nuclear submarines and conducted atomic weapons tests with little 
regard to their impact on the environment. In Kiev, many people 
are still traumatized from the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl 
nuclear plant and there is widespread suspicion that significant 
amounts of the produce eaten in Ukraine are still laced with 
radioactive poisons. 

</P><P>"Nobody knows how much of the food being eaten is still 
radioactive," said Jonathan Spaulding, director of ISAR's office 
in Kiev. "Much of the regulatory system has broken down and it's 
common knowledge that it's easy to bribe an official if you want 
to sell a truckload of radioactive beets on the market." 

</P><P>Pollution belches from the smokestacks of Russian 
factories and a gray haze blankets the city of Moscow. Misguided 
irrigation practices have reduced the size of the Aral Sea, once 
the world's fourth largest inland sea, to one-third its original 
size -- and killed many of its fish and other organisms. Severe soil 
erosion abounds in many places, and the threat of deforestation 
of its vast forests by multi-national corporations is growing. 

</P><P>The list goes on and on. According to <EM>The New State of 
the Earth Atlas,</EM> written by Joni Seager (Touchstone Books), a 
quarter of the population of the FSU lives in regions of 
"critical or catastrophic environmental degradation." 

</P><P>Even in a region of thriving economy and well-developed 
free press, the restoration of the region's ecology would be a 
challenge. But in Russia, Ukraine, and much of the FSU the 
economy is in shambles and the idea of a free press is just 
starting to take root. 

</P><P>When I asked a young Ukrainian interpreter to tell me how 
life has changed since Ukraine became independent in 1991, he 
painted a bleak picture. His parents had lost their jobs. The 
inflation rate is about 1,000 percent a year. Severe gasoline 
shortages abound. Serious crime is increasing. The health system 
is deteriorating and the incidence of hepatitis, diptheria, 
polio, cholera, and AIDS is increasing. 

</P><P>Surely something must be better these days, I asked. The 
only improvement he could think of is Ukraine's political 
independence. "In the old days Ukrainian soldiers would have been 
sent to Chechnya to put down the insurrection," he said. "Now, at 
least we don't have to fight wars we don't believe in." 

</P><P>The conditions under which FSU journalists work is 
primitive and often dangerous. In Armenia, which is at war with 
Azerbaijan, environmental filmmaker Vartan Hochannisyan said he 
can count on only one hour of electricity a day. The mail system 
throughout the FSU is unreliable and the telephone system in many 
countries is antiquated. 

</P><P>Some of the FSU countries are repressive to a free press. 
In Tajikistan (in Central Asia) all independent publications and 
broadcast outlets have been banned or forced out of business. 
Since May, 1992, at least 27 reporters and editors in Tajikistan 
have been murdered, according to the nonprofit organization 
Committee to Protect Journalists. The situation is so bad that 
most Tajik journalists are either in hiding or in exile abroad. 

</P><P>Compared to the United States, few of the FSU's 
newspapers or television stations have environmental journalists. 
But in recent years a great number of environmental publications 
have sprung up to document the serious ecological problems in the 
FSU. Some are published by environmental organizations or 
nonprofit scientific groups. Many of the articles are written by 
freelance writers. 

</P><P>Other environmental journalism efforts are ingenious. 

</P><P>In Tbilisi, Georgia, an energetic young woman, Manana 
Jakhua, has helped set up a radio station (known as Radio Green 
Wave) with grants from ISAR and the Soros Foundation. Fifteen 
nonpaid staff members donate their time and skills to produce 12 
hours of environmental programming a day. They are negotiating 
arrangements with the BBC and several European radio stations to 
expand their broadcasting and are even discussing the possibility 
of creating a television program dedicated to environmental news 
in Georgia. 

</P><P>I found similar experiments going on all across the FSU. 
In Tomsk, Russia, Boris Nekrasov edits the <EM>Green Manuscript Pages</EM> 
in a special ecological section for the <EM>Tomsk Regional 
Newspapers.</EM> In other parts of the FSU, unemployed scientists and 
teachers are documenting environmental degradation with articles, 
photo essays, and documentaries. 

</P><P>I also found many of the Americans who participated in 
the Ecoforum conference to be fascinating. 

</P><P>Bill Pfeiffer, a computer-savvy environmental activist 
from Petersham, Massachusetts, has helped create an e-mail 
network for environmental organizations throughout the FSU. In 
some countries, he has had to literally smuggle in computers and 
set up the computer network by himself. 

</P><P>Another interesting e-mail project has been set up by 
Malcolm Campbell of Boulder, Colo. Campbell has created a 
nonprofit organization called Global Response. If an 
environmental activist is jailed in Haiti or a governmental body 
is poised to vote on a critical piece of environmental 
legislation, Campbell notifies a network of environmental 
activists electronically and urges them to respond to appropriate 
officials immediately. 

</P><P>"It certainly could be utilized by environmental 
journalists," he said. "If a journalist is jailed or fired 
because of articles he writes, we can mobilize a network of 
concerned citizens to come to his assistance." 

</P><P>But it was the journalists, scientists, educators, and 
activists in the FSU who impressed me the most during my stay in 
Ukraine and Russia. I couldn't help but be moved by their 
dedication and commitment. 

</P><P>And I couldn't help but think of the irony of our meeting 
at a conference center outside of Kiev where, once, only  
Communist Party leaders could gather. It was here that the 
Communist elite adopted strategies and plans that severely 
degraded the environment. Now, environmental journalists, 
educators, scientists, and activists from the United States and 
the FSU are meeting together to find remedies to the problems 
created during the Communist era.

<P>By Jim Detjen

</P><P>Be careful of crime. During my stay in Moscow I was 
jumped in broad daylight by seven or eight teenage boys who 
attempted to steal my passport and wallet. I started shouting and 
they soon ran away. I was shaken, but not injured, and I wasn't 
robbed. But I could have been and I was wary during the rest of 
my stay in Russia's largest city. The crime rate has soared in 
the FSU since the breakup and attacks on tourists are not 
uncommon. Keep your camera hidden (a sign that you are a 
tourist), and consider wearing a money belt. 

</P><P>Bring plenty of cash. Merchants nearly all expect cash 
and almost none accept credit cards or traveler's checks. Most 
will gladly accept American dollars because the high inflation 
rate (1,000 percent annually in Russia) causes rubles to rapidly 
lose their value. But you will need some money in rubles to buy 
subway tokens, stamps, and other items. 

</P><P>Don't drink the water. Even in large cities such as Kiev 
and Moscow there is no guarantee that the water is safe. In rural 
areas you can bet that it is not. Drink only bottled water, 
canned soft drinks, or beverages made with boiled water. 

</P><P>Take the subway. The subways in Moscow and Kiev are 
inexpensive (for about 12 cents in Moscow you can travel anywhere 
in the city), clean and highly efficient. In many areas they are 
filled with sculpture, murals and art. You'll enjoy the 
experience. 

</P><P>Expect delays and shortages. Compared to the United 
States, the former Soviet Union is not geared up for tourists. 
Flights are sometimes overbooked and frequently delayed. Gasoline 
shortages often occur. The telephone system is antiquated.</P>

<H4><A NAME = "shute">Kamchatka students taste press freedoms</A></H4>

<P>By Nancy Shute

</P><P>The things I remember most about my year on the Kamchatka 
outpost on a Fulbright aren't the Kodak moments, like climbing 
into the crater of a live volcano, bobbing in a hot springs or 
seeing 54 brown bears in one afternoon. 

</P><P>No, I remember being awakened night after night at 4 a.m. 
by "Fernando" rocketing from the car stereos of the minor Mafiosi 
leaving the bar beneath my apartment. I remember shrieking with 
frustration over the days it took to do the simplest tasks: Xerox 
a quiz, pay my e-mail bill, or find cabbage. 

</P><P>And I remember the look on my students' faces when they 
saw their words in print for the first time, even if those words 
were greasily Xeroxed onto paper so rough it was hard to tell an 
"r" from a "t." 

</P><P>I had come to Kamchatka seeking a sabbatical from 
journalism's daily grind, a chance for more than a few days in a 
place on a story. Not that I'd had anything to complain about. I 
had spent the past decade in one of the greatest jobs in 
journalism, traveling the world on assignment for magazines 
including <EM>Outside</EM> and <EM>National Geographic.</EM>

</P><P>One of those assignments, for <EM>Smithsonian,</EM> had taken me 
to Kamchatka (an outpost north of Japan) to cover the arrival of 
the first American delegation in 1991. This California-sized 
peninsula had been closed to outsiders, even most Russians, for 
most of the 20th century, leaving it relatively unspoiled and 
wholly isolated. 

</P><P>First Glasnost, and later the fall of Communism, finally 
opened the gates. I wanted to find out what would happen to 
Kamchatka and the people of that land as they returned to the 
world. 

</P><P>A fellow journalist who had written his third novel while 
on a Fulbright to England suggested I apply. In fact, the 
Fulbright program welcomes journalists and other non-academic 
professionals, although the application process would lead you to 
believe that only professors with a drawer full of course 
outlines need apply. I had never taught anything more challenging 
than a guest appearance at somebody else's feature writing class, 
but in July 1992 I invented a course outline and syllabus and 
waited. The following June, the Fulbright people announced that 
they'd be sending me off to Kamchatka in the fall to further 
world understanding of democracy. 

</P><P>I sublet my Washington, D.C., apartment, bought overseas 
health insurance, packed up eight boxes of books and a year's 
supply of tampons and headed west, traveling via Anchorage and 
Magadan (former gateway to the gulag). In Magadan I nearly had to 
load the eight boxes of books on the plane myself. I had managed 
to drag them through the terminal and onto the tarmac, but was 
defeated by that last 10 feet. A New Russian in black Vuarnets 
and a trench coat saw me sobbing under the Yak-40, said "You poor 
woman" in perfect English and loaded them himself. 

</P><P>What I found in 11 months of living on the Russian 
frontier was not what I expected, even after having been there 
twice before. The biggest shock was not the earthquakes that 
shook the Communist "pre-shab" flats or the seven-month-long 
winter, but the recognition that our former Cold War adversary is 
a Third World country -- albeit one where the citizens read 
Shakespeare and fly into space. 

</P><P>When you hit age 50 in Russia, you get a big birthday 
party; men's life expectancy is 58. Environmental pollution, 
abysmal health care, and inadequate food supplies are the main 
culprits. Since the fall of Communism things have gotten worse. 
My colleagues at the Kamchatka State Pedagogical Institute, a 
university-level school, worked for months without pay. The local 
government often cut off the electricity, telephone, and hot 
water to save cash. Biologists estimate that in the past five 
years half of Kamchatka's magnificent brown bears have been 
killed by poachers and foreign trophy hunters. 

</P><P>Although Russia's journalists are now officially 
independent, they still labor under heavy censorship while 
struggling to become financially independent. Kamchatka has two 
presses, one an ancient linotype owned by the government, another 
an offset owned by the Mafia (a term virtually synonymous with 
government). There is a dearth of information on just about 
anything besides horoscopes and the doings of Julia Roberts. 
Non-Russian publications are almost impossible to find. 

</P><P>I didn't expect much from my students from the 
PedInstitute. Most took my classes to study English, not 
journalism, and there is no tradition of independent student 
newspapers as we have in the states. So I was surprised when they 
decided their class project was going to be a newspaper. They had 
no problem with story ideas: an interview with the prosecutor 
about increased crime, a profile of Kamchatka's most renowned 
artist, a funny feature about the origins of the name Kamchatka, 
a series on the plight of Kamchatka's indigenous people, and a 
business story on a firm's introduction of new legal software. 

</P><P>They also had no problem using leads, news hooks, and 
quotes. Sources were another matter. In a country where five 
years ago a slip of the tongue meant your relatives disappeared, 
"source" was considered synonymous with "anonymous." My students 
were aghast at the notion of asking government officials for 
information and amused by my assertions that government data 
would be at all useful. They grudgingly attributed sources and 
managed to dig up a surprisingly large amount of good data. But 
their prose style still reverted from tidy AP style to the 
byzantine, not surprising in a place where a page one news story 
on a local oil spill ran: "The perpetrators of this barbarity 
must be punished!" 

</P><P>The students typed stories on two aging laptops I had 
brought, and cadged desktop publishing from computer nerds around 
town. We extracted information from the Internet. The first 
edition of <EM>New Generation</EM> rolled off the Xerox in the midst of 
January's blizzards -- all eight pages of it. I was completely 
unprepared for the town's reaction: the first printing of 500 
sold out almost immediately, snapped up by people eager to read 
anything new written in English. The students were feted at the 
library and featured on TV. And I received a true Soviet-style 
signifier of importance: my phone was tapped. 

</P><P><EM>New Generation</EM> published five editions during my tenure, 
growing in pages and circulation each time. We became adept at 
finding Xerox operators without serious drinking problems willing 
to do a little work on the side. When I left in August, the staff 
insisted that they couldn't publish without me. Since then they 
have published three more editions, the last a lavishly 
illustrated extravaganza on the underground music scene. 

</P><P>When I returned to Kamchatka on a visit in June, my 
former students were plotting how to get their own 
desktop-publishing computer and laser printer. "Our mission must 
continue!" said Alyosha, an 18-year-old Tom Petty look-alike who 
in the past had greeted my attempts to get things done with a 
sigh and the words: "Nancy, this is Russia." 

</P><P>I was surprised to realize, when I returned, that I had 
inadvertently done what I'd told the Fulbright people I would: 
use local resources to encourage small-scale independent 
journalism. And I certainly got my sabbatical, although learning 
100 ways to cook cabbage hadn't been on my agenda. And I was 
powerfully reminded of the power of words and information,  
easily forgotten in the flood of data that greets us each day in 
the U.S. 

</P><P>I learned, too, that we have a lot to offer to our 
colleagues in  countries like Russia, where trying to get 
accurate information and disseminate it is a daily struggle. As 
members of SEJ, we can make that struggle a little easier by 
trading our skills and information with Russian journalists.

<H4><A NAME = "askari">Strategic plan defines SEJ's mission</A></H4>

<P>By Emilia Askari

</P><P>Try getting more than a dozen journalists to agree on the 
wording of one paragraph. Every time you think you're done, 
someone makes a good suggestion. Then someone makes a better one. 

</P><P>Last March, SEJ's board spent more than an hour 
developing the organization's new, four-sentence mission 
statement. It states: 

</P><P>The mission of the Society of Environmental Journalists 
is to advance public understanding of environmental issues by 
improving the quality, accuracy and visibility of environmental 
reporting. 

</P><P>Towards that end, SEJ provides critical support to 
journalists of all media on the basic importance of environmental 
reporting. Through combined efforts of board, staff, membership 
and appropriate partners, SEJ offers unique educational programs 
and services. 

</P><P>So begins a 23-page draft of SEJ's strategic and 
operating plan for 1995 to 1998. It was written by executive 
director Beth Parke based on notes from a marathon, two-day board 
meeting at the University of Michigan. 

</P><P>This kind of document may sound a little fancy for 
journalists. It smacks of corporate-speak and consultants. 

</P><P>But SEJ's board feels that this plan will help the 
organization run smoothly and grow effectively. In addition, we 
hope the plan will impress potential funders and other partners 
who provide the support we need to make SEJ work. 

</P><P>The plan identifies six "strategic issues" that SEJ is 
facing. At the top of the list is funding stability, followed by 
membership development; development of staff, board and other 
volunteers; improvement of programs and services; protecting the 
journalistic integrity of our membership and image; and building 
SEJ's visibility and influence. 

</P><P>We have set specific goals for each year in each of these 
categories. 

</P><P>In funding, for example, by the middle of 1996 we plan to 
investigate completely new funding sources such as bequests, new 
publications, and advertising in the <EM>SEJournal.</EM> We plan to 
implement at least two of these ideas by June 1997. 

</P><P>In the area of membership development, we plan to 
increase SEJ's membership from the current 1,100 or so to 1,500 
by the end of 1998. Next year, we will emphasize recruiting among 
editors and colleagues who work for specialized newsletters, 
electronic media and academic institutions. 

</P><P>To continuously hone the skills of SEJ's staff, board and 
other volunteers, we will do some training for board members in 
1996. We will seek funding for a leadership development retreat 
for active SEJ volunteers, planned for 1997. 

</P><P>In preparation for testing new programs and services, SEJ 
will survey the membership in 1996 to see how members would like 
SEJ to help them. Ideas under consideration include publishing 
new guidebooks or tip sheets and providing training in 
computer-assisted environmental reporting. 

</P><P>To protect SEJ's identity as a journalistic organization, 
the board will establish written guidelines on potential funding 
sources. In addition, the membership committee will annually 
review our membership list, screening for possible eligibility 
changes. 

</P><P>To build SEJ's stature and influence, we hope to launch 
an awards program in 1996. We are in discussion now with a 
potential funder. 

</P><P>This is just a small taste of the plans we have made for 
the next three years. 

</P><P>We invite any and all members of SEJ to contact the 
office if they are interested in learning more. Copies of the 
draft plan are available for all members. The plan may be revised 
before the board adopts a final version at our next meeting, 
scheduled for August 5 in Missoula, Mont. As always, the 
meeting is open to interested members. 

</P><P>If you have suggestions about the plan and can't attend 
the meeting, please call me, SEJ's executive director Beth 
Parke, or any board member. We look forward to hearing from you. 

</P><P>Please keep in mind that board elections are coming up in 
the fall. Several current board members have said that they do 
not plan to run for re-election. 

</P><P>Being a member of SEJ's board is a lot of work. But it is 
also very rewarding, thanks to the many other journalists around 
the country who also are working so hard to improve our 
profession. 

</P><P>This spring, special kudos go to those who organized 
regional events in Los Angeles and Atlanta. They include Gary 
Polakovic of the <EM>Riverside Press-Enterprise,</EM> Marla Cone of the 
<EM>Los Angeles Times,</EM> David Marshall of San Jose State University, 
Peter Dykstra of CNN, Stuart Leavenworth of the <EM>Raleigh News and 
Observer,</EM> Ken Edelstein of the <EM>Columbus Ledger-Enquirer,</EM> Jay 
Bookman of the <EM>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</EM> and Bruce Ritchie of 
the <EM>Gainesville Sun.</EM>

</P><P>SEJ also would like to extend thanks to the following: 

<P><UL><LI>The Knight Foundation, for a three-year $50,000 grant.

<P><LI>The W. Alton Jones Foundation, for a $50,000 grant for 1995-96.

<P><LI>The <EM>Los Angeles Times,</EM> the <EM>San Bernardino Sun,</EM> the 
<EM>Riverside Press-Enterprise,</EM> the <EM>Victorville Daily Press,</EM> City 
News Service of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Chapter of SPJ 
for support of SEJ's regional conference in California.

<P><LI>The <EM>Atlanta Journal-Constitution,</EM> the Raleigh News and 
Observer Foundation, CNN-Turner Broadcasting and The New York 
Times Regional Newspapers Group for support of SEJ's regional 
conference in Atlanta.

<P><LI>The <EM>Boston Globe,</EM> the <EM>Providence Journal</EM> and the <EM>Quincy 
Patriot-Ledger</EM> for support of October's national conference in 
Boston.<P>

<H4><A NAME = "boston">Agenda firming up for SEJ's 1995 national conference at MIT in Boston</A></H4>

<P>By David Ropeik and Jay Letto

</P><P>Planning is in full swing for SEJ's national conference 
at Massachusetts Institute of Technology October 26-29. Here's an 
update of the activities which promise to make this one of SEJ's 
strongest gatherings to date. 

</P><P>A diverse slate of tours is planned for Thursday the 
26th. There's an all-day trip to the Woods Hole Oceanographic 
Institute where we'll learn about ocean pollution, marine 
biodiversity, and underwater robotic research vehicles. Another 
tour will visit sites in Boston that exemplify urban 
environmental issues. Another boats across Boston Harbor to the 
new sewage plant built to clean up the infamous dirty water, 
where we'll explore issues involved in major (read: expensive) 
environmental infrastructure programs. 

</P><P>Another all-day tour will head into the gorgeous New 
England fall foliage at Harvard's experimental forest to discuss 
forestry issues and the northern forests proposal. We've also 
added a tour to a major American manufacturer of electric cars, 
where each attendee will take a test ride and hear panels on 
battery technology and the political/regulatory atmosphere 
'driving' alternative fuel vehicle markets. (Watch your mail for 
details.) 

</P><P>As space is limited for each tour, be sure to sign up 
soon. (Priority will be given to SEJ members and working 
journalists.) The Woods Hole and forestry tours are all-day, so 
out-of-towners would need to get into Boston by Wednesday evening 
to attend these. The Boston Harbor and Urban Environment tours 
are half-day (afternoon), so attendees would need to arrive in 
Boston by Thursday morning if they wish to attend. 

</P><P>Networking, which was cited in previous evaluations as 
perhaps the most valued item at SEJ conferences, just got better. 
There will be the usual social moments: Thursday evening's buffet 
reception, the official opening of the conference, and Saturday 
evening at Boston's Museum of Science promise opportunities for 
socializing.  We've also plugged in more time between panels and 
speakers, and fewer talking heads at evening events. In addition, 
joining us this year will be an estimated 100 or more 
environmental reporters from around the globe, as the 
International Federation of Environmental Journalists (IFEJ) 
convenes its annual gathering in conjunction with our event. 
We'll organize formal and informal get-togethers, where you can 
learn the latest environmental news from the folks actually out 
there covering stories in Africa, Asia, South America and Europe. 

</P><P>Our Friday opening plenary is looking good. "The 
Environment and The Mood of America" discussion will, we hope, 
feature top members of Congress, executives from the news media 
industry, Clinton administration environmental officials, and a 
couple of nice and saucy commentators, both liberal and 
conservative. The discussion will be moderated by former 
Presidential candidate Michael Dukakis. We'll open that session 
with a major national poll done for SEJ by Times-Mirror Magazines 
and Roper/Starch on how the American public thinks Congress -- and 
the media -- are handling environmental issues. 

</P><P>At lunch on Friday we'll hear from Elizabeth Dowdeswell, 
head of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). 

</P><P>We're still pursuing the Presidential candidates, and are 
working with other Boston and New Hampshire-area media groups and 
academic institutions to lure them to our conference. In the 
event we can't attract enough of them to have a true candidates' 
forum we'll offer a platter of small-group sessions during this 
Friday afternoon time slot, featuring agency heads, Congressional 
leaders, and other newsmakers. 

</P><P>Saturday morning we'll enjoy a lecture and Q. and A. 
session with renowned eco-thinker Edward O. Wilson. We hope to 
hear from Gro Harlem Bruntland of Norway at lunch. Concurrent 
panels on Friday and Saturday afternoons include fisheries, 
what's new in climate change, endocrine disrupters, 
enviro-journalism ethics ("Are We Scaring The World to Death?"), 
greenwash, the environment and spirituality, the basics of 
enviro-reporting, and freelancing. Also, international 
journalists will talk about covering the environment in their 
countries, award winners will tell how they did it, and there 
will be hands-on sessions about computer-assisted reporting. We 
have added a visit to MIT's famed Media Lab for a look at future 
media technologies. 

</P><P>Time to socialize continues Saturday night at a reception 
at Boston's wonderful Museum of Science, open for our exploration 
all evening. And we're adding a new event this year at the 
Saturday reception ... an auction! We hope to include items like 
time-share weekends at different resorts, something neat being 
donated by Don Henley of the Eagles, pottery made by your 
friendly conference chairman, and 20-30 other items. We strongly 
encourage your suggestions and/or donations! Wevonneda Minis of 
the SEJ board is the guru on the auction. Send ideas to her. at 
the <EM>Post & Courier,</EM> 134 Columbus St., Charleston, S.C. 29403-4800; 
Ph. (803) 937-5705. 

</P><P>We close with a bang on Sunday when 300 of us will head 
to Walden Pond for a walk, and later travel to a nearby mansion 
(now the home of the Thoreau Institute) for panels on 
environmental history, environmental literature, covering the 
environment for TV, and a session with a writing coach. Those who 
can't make the space-limited trip to Walden are hardly out of 
luck. They can take a boat trip to Boston's Outer Harbor with 
marine scientists from the New England Aquarium. Weather and 
animals permitting, that boat will head out to the Stellwagen 
Bank Marine Sanctuary for a whale watch. 

</P><P>There will be a display of a UNEP environmental 
photograph exhibit ... a reading room with samples of award-winning 
work ... lots of follow-up literature provided by panel speakers. 
Newsmaking events, story-generating panels and tours, time to 
network and socialize ... and we want to see you there! 

</P><P><EM>David Ropeik has been the environment reporter at WCVB-

<H4><A NAME = "letters">Co-Editor Adam Glenn leaves SEJournal to be globetrotter</A></H4>

<P>By A. Adam Glenn

</P><P>I'll be stepping down as co-editor of the <EM>SEJournal</EM> after 
this issue. If you'll indulge me a moment to take care of another 
piece of business, I'll explain. But first, I want to give credit 
where credit it is due -- to the Journal's volunteer staff, for all 
you've accomplished in the last several years. 

</P><P>Since mid-1991 when I began with the Journal, and in the 
last two-and-a-half years as its premier editorial traffic cop, 
I've seen it grow in page count and story quality, as well as in 
the sweat equity of this growing group of volunteer editors. 

</P><P>Let me remind you what we've accomplished: 

<P><UL><LI><EM>SEJournal</EM> has grown in page count by more than 
one-third. It has averaged 36 pages per issue beginning in 1994, 
compared to 28 pages per issue in 1992. 

<P><LI>We've featured writings and interviews of renowned 
journalists. Among them: Gene Roberts, managing editor of the <EM>New 
York Times;</EM> Tom Winship, former <EM>Boston Globe</EM> editor, and Pulitzer 
Prize-winner Eileen Welsome of the <EM>Albuquerque Tribune.</EM> 
Controversial writers have had their say too, like the <EM>Times'</EM>
Keith Schneider and author Gregg Easterbrook. 

<P><LI>Special cover packages have mined subjects like the 
politics of environment, ethics in environmental journalism, 
"backlash" reporting, population and environment, the decline of 
environmental magazines, and environmental justice. 

<P><LI>The <EM>Journal</EM> has greatly expanded its coverage of SEJ's 
annual conference. The first time, in Boulder, we gave 10 
magazine columns. Last year, for Utah, we produced 37 columns. 

<P><LI>We've instituted a range of new features, including 
Science Survey, Online Bits & Bytes, Bookshelf, and Media on the 
Move, as well as occasional features like In Education and 
regional Essays. Our Viewpoints column has also expanded, and 
existing features -- Green Beat, Reporters' Toolbox, and 
Calendar -- have remained our rock-solid foundation. 

<P><LI>We've offered an array of news and features too 
numerous to mention, covering the vicissitudes of our profession, 
and the politics and science of the environmental beat. We've 
also kept up steady flow of SEJ news, including national, 
regional, and international developments. 
</UL>

<P>So, congratulations -- and a big thank you -- to all 
those who made these accomplishments possible. And to all SEJ 
members, please let the volunteers of the <EM>SEJournal</EM> know that 
you're proud of them and the publication. On second thought, how 
about joining them in all the fun? 

</P><P>Now, let me tell you why I'm leaving behind all the 
glory. After my name slips off the masthead, I plan to do two 
things. 

</P><P>First of all, I've come to believe that if we want our 
profession to be around for a long time to come, we've got to do 
a better job of making sure that the next generation of 
journalists is the most diverse possible. How else can our 
journalistic efforts accurately reflect the society in which we 
work? 

</P><P>In 1993, the SEJ membership passed a resolution asking 
that we explore ways in which environmental journalists could 
interact with disadvantaged, inner-city kids. The idea was not 
only to help build that pool of future minority journalists, but 
also to bring us into more direct contact with the environmental 
issues faced by these communities. My own personal commitment to 
this effort is long overdue. 

</P><P>Oh yes, and one other thing. By this time next year, I'll 
be on the other side of the globe. After I obtain my mid-career 
masters degree in international environmental policy next 
December from the Fletcher School in Boston, and after I marry my 
fiancee Mrnalini Rajwar next spring in Oklahoma, I'll get on an 
airplane and head off to live and work for a year in India and 
South Asia. Pretty hard to edit a journal from there, eh? 

</P><P>In parting, warm thanks and best wishes to my fellow 
editors and to all the many superb <EM>SEJournal</EM> issues to come.</P>

<H4><A NAME = "beattie">Beattie defends Endangered Species Act at SEJ's California regional conference</A></H4>

<P>By Gary Polakovic

</P><P>The future of the Endangered Species Act was the topic of 
an all-day conference held this spring for California 
journalists, the first SEJ-sponsored event on the West Coast. 
This conference, "Covering the Endangered Species Act in Your 
Backyard," attracted 50 attendees. 

</P><P>Keynoters were Mollie Beattie, head of the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service; and Rep. Richard Pombo, R-Calif., chairman of 
the House Resources Committee Endangered Species Act (ESA) Task 
Force. 

</P><P>Pombo, whose task force held hearings on the ESA across 
the nation in spring, said the law needs to be changed to give 
property owners incentives to save wildlife and compensation when 
protection devalues private land. He predicted the Senate would 
pass compensation provisions contained in Sen. Slade Gorton's 
(R-ID) reauthorization bill. Pombo recounted his boyhood experience 
of watching a bald eagle capture a rabbit and said "we need to 
preserve that for generations to come. I want my children to see 
that.'' 

</P><P>Beattie delivered a vigorous defense of the law, 
discredited myths surrounding the ESA, cited loss of biodiversity 
as one of the nation's foremost problems and chided politicians 
ignorant of the complexity involved in species protection. She 
likened their efforts to dismantle the ESA to silencing a noisy 
smoke alarm instead of dealing with the burning building. 
Formerly a journalist, Beattie challenged reporters to scrutinize 
claims made by competing interests and to inform readers of the 
stakes involved if protection for wildlife and habitat is 
weakened during ESA reauthorization. 

</P><P>Other distinguished speakers at the conference included 
Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope, California Resources 
Secretary Douglas Wheeler, and former Bureau of Land Management 
Director Jim Baca. 

</P><P>A morning panel focused on the fate of the law. One 
afternoon panel examined the property rights dispute and another 
featured veteran journalists expounding on tricks of the trade in 
a toolbox session. 

</P><P>California's burgeoning population, diversity of 
ecosystems, and abundance of endangered species make it one of 
the nation's most contested battlegrounds in the ESA debate. A 
survey of reporters across the state in January revealed intense 
interest in the ESA. 

</P><P>The conference was held at the University of Southern 
California in Los Angeles. It was sponsored by SEJ, seven 
California news organizations, the Bureau of National Affairs 
Inc. (BNA), and the Los Angeles Chapter of the Society of 
Professional Journalists. Reporters, students, professors, 
activists, government officials, and industry representatives 
attended. 

</P><P>I organized the event with assistance from Marla Cone of 
the <EM>Los Angeles Times,</EM> Lee Peterson of the <EM>Daily Breeze,</EM> Carolyn 
Whetzel of BNA, and Patricia Rice of the <EM>Imperial Valley Press.</EM>

</P><P><EM>Gary Polakovic has covered environment issues in 
Southern California for the past 10 years. He worked as 
environment reporter for</EM> The Sun <EM>in San Bernardino County before 
moving to </EM>The Press-Enterprise<EM> of Riverside County in 1987 to 
cover the environment.</P></EM>

<H4><A NAME = "southeast">Southeast regional conference: boom times and backlash</A></H4>

<P>By Stuart Leavenworth

</P><P>Ever since a Yankee named H. L. Mencken wrote that the 
South was as sterile "artistically, intellectually, culturally" 
as the Sahara desert, journalists below the Mason-Dixon line have 
suffered from an inferiority complex. 

</P><P>And so it goes for the region's environment reporters. In 
the last five years, southern environment journalists have won 
two Pulitzers and a slew of other awards. Yet Dixie is still 
viewed as a backwater for our profession. That may be starting to 
change. 

</P><P>On July 21-22, reporters and broadcasters will meet at 
Emory University in Atlanta for SEJ's first regional conference 
in the South. Entitled "New Realities," the conference will 
examine the region's booming growth and shifting political 
allegiances. 

</P><P>On Friday, July 21, the conference will include panels 
about urban sprawl; endangered species and property rights; 
covering "company towns" and digging stories out of EPA and state 
agencies. George Frampton, assistant secretary of the Interior 
and former president of the Wilderness Society, will be our 
keynote speaker. We'll finish up at Manuel's Tavern for an 
informal grousing session about the state of environment 
reporting. 

</P><P>On Saturday there will be panels on regional water wars 
and computer-assisted reporting, followed by small group sessions 
with Robert Bullard, author of <EM>Dumping on Dixie,</EM> EPA regional 
administrator John Hankinson Jr. and Noreen Clough, regional 
director of the Fish & Wildlife Service. U.S. Rep. Charles 
Taylor, an outspoken North Carolina lawmaker who sponsored this 
year's timber salvage legislation, will be our lunch speaker, 
then join a plenary panel to discuss how the Republican 
"Contract" will affect the South's environment. 

</P><P>Registration for the conference is $25 for SEJ members 
and students; $35 for journalists who are not SEJ members and $75 
for others. Fellowships are available for minority journalists 
and reporters from small news operations. For information, 
contact the SEJ office or conference chair Peter Dykstra at (404) 
827-3349.

<P>Compiled by George Homsy

</P><P>Keith Schneider says he will use his journalism skills in 
"an advocacy role in a community where it's really important." 
The former <EM>New York Times</EM> environmental reporter now heads the 
Michigan Land Use Institute, where he hopes to "foster a set of 
new ideas about how to develop without paving over every piece of 
landscape." The Institute first came together to help shape 
controversial natural gas development in the Great Lakes region 
and is now housed in a 127-year-old, one-room school house in 
Benzonia, Mich. But Schneider has big plans. He hopes to do 
for land use "what the Rocky Mountain Institute did for energy." 

</P><P>Congratulations to Karen Dorn Steele and her colleague, 
Jim Lynch, at Spokane's <EM>Spokesman-Review.</EM> The pair landed both a 
George Polk and a Gerald Loeb award for their coverage of 
financial mismanagement at the Hanford Nuclear Weapons plant in 
Washington state. The report, titled "River of Money," details 
how most of the $5 million per day spent by the federal 
government to clean up radioactive waste is, well, wasted. (See 
story, page 7) 

</P><P>Richard Stone is heading east ... way east. The 
environmental news writer for the journal <EM>Science</EM> will teach 
environmental journalism and science writing at Rostov University 
in southern Russia, near the Black Sea. Stone, who will be in 
Rostov for a year on a Fulbright scholarship, wants to prepare 
his students to freelance for Western publications. "In Russia, 
they have more of their own voice in stories. It's like reading 
the editorial page. I just want to give them a taste of the way 
we write here and the way we source stories." 

</P><P>This fall, Elliot Diringer will be batting around similar 
issues at Harvard University. Diringer is one of two SEJ members 
awarded a Nieman Fellowship. The former environmental reporter is 
now assistant city editor at the <EM>San Francisco Chronicle</EM> and 
hopes the fellowship will give him "a stronger perspective to 
assess stories and help reporters scope them out. Also, being 
part of a group of journalists, all doing course work 
simultaneously, will be productive." 

</P><P>Another member in that group is Jacques Rivard. But 
unlike Diringer, Rivard is already quite used to academic life. 
The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation television reporter has 
been teaching journalism at the University of Montreal for 13 
years. He plans to use the Nieman Fellowship to study global 
environmental economics and law. 

</P><P>Getting through the first few issues is the immediate 
goal of Bill Breen, who is the managing editor of a new business 
magazine, <EM>Fast Company.</EM> The former editor of <EM>Garbage</EM> describes 
the Boston-based startup as "a cross between <EM>Rolling Stone</EM> and 
<EM>Harvard Business Review."</EM> He says young executives in their 20s, 
30s, and 40s are interested in environmental issues, so he plans 
to make good use of his environmental writing background. 

</P><P>Preliminary reports indicate that Kim Motylewski is 
better equipped than the average journalist to handle lab work. 
Motylewski, associate producer for National Public Radio's Living 
On Earth, spent the month of June boning up on basic science at 
the Science Writing Fellowship Program in Wood's Hole, 
Massachusetts. A reliable source says she was the only reporter 
in the first lab class who knew "how to use a pipette to draw ten 
milliliters of fluid." Things will be getting tougher. By the 
time you read this, the journalists will have broken up and 
Motylewski will be immersed in biology research with real 
scientists. 

</P><P>Africa was David Baron's classroom. He was part of a 
six-nation agricultural tour sponsored by the Council for the 
Advancement of Science Writing. The science reporter for NPR's 
Boston affiliate WBUR-FM took advantage of the opportunity 
because "you don't hear much positive news about what Africa is 
doing to help itself." Baron says the stories should interest   
audiences here because there is much western farmers can learn 
from research like this in the developing world. 

</P><P>"Understanding the farmers as individuals" is what Paul 
Raeburn hopes his readers will get from stories he writes about 
the Africa trip. The Associated Press science editor, also part 
of the Council's agricultural tour, says African farmers have 
many of the same personality traits as farmers he's met in the 
midwestern United States. The trip was particularly interesting 
for Raeburn, because he's just finished a book about agriculture. 
<EM>The Last Harvest,</EM> published by Simon and Schuster, describes how 
the country's agricultural gene pool is growing dangerously 
smaller. Raeburn's book is in stores now. 

</P><P>Paul Rogers is the new environment reporter for the <EM>San 
Jose Mercury News.</EM> An avid outdoorsman, Rogers has followed 
environmental issues on his own for a while. Now the former 
regional reporter is happy to be paid to pursue his interests. 
Rogers replaces Scott Thurm, who was previously reported as 
switched to the business beat. Rogers says his colleague is now 
covering Pete Wilson's run for the White House. 

</P><P>She originally thought the assignment from her editor 
sounded "incredibly boring," but Katherine Bouma's investigations 
into the Alabama forest industry turned into an award-winning 
series. Writing 'The Big Tree Farm' for the <EM>Montgomery 
Advertiser,</EM> Bouma realized that "every aspect of Alabama's 
environment ... is dominated by that one industry." The series 
won an award for outstanding southern environmental writing from 
the Southern Environmental Law Center. Don't you just hate it 
when those editors are right? Bouma is currently a reporter for 
the <EM>Orlando Sentinel. </EM>

</P><P>Scott Bronstein is an incredibly busy man. Just as he 
settles into his new digs at CNN, Bronstein has pulled in another 
prize for his former employers at the <EM>Atlanta-Journal 
Constitution:</EM> a regional AP award for Public Service. He also 
shared in the Southern Environmental Law Center honors for his 
10-page feature about pollution in the South's second largest 
watershed. This is Scott's third straight appearance in this 
column, which has been renamed "Bronstein, et. al. On The Move."

<HR><H3><A NAME = "fellows">SEJ members experience academia <BR>as MIT Knight, Harvard Nieman 
journalism fellows</A></H3>

<H4><A NAME = "knight">Knight science fellowship at MIT rich in choices</A></H4>

<P>By David Ropeik

</P><P>So you're thinking about applying for that fellowship? Go 
for it. But beware! 

</P><P>I just spent nine months as a Knight Science Journalism 
Fellow at MIT. The learning and intellectual stimulation, were 
fabulous. Spending so much time in a world of ideas, new 
information, and discovery sure beats the heck out of  facing 
deadlines and battles with the boss. 

</P><P>The Knight program affords participants access to both 
MIT and Harvard. And if that isn't enough, Knights can fairly 
easily talk their way into other Boston-area schools. 
Environmental journalists can tap the rich resources of Tufts 
University, for example. 

</P><P>Therein lies my first warning. The depth of choice is so 
rich, and so tempting, that making choices is a challenge. It's 
like having a blank check in a candy store, but a limited time in 
which to spend it. I ended up taking classes in environmental 
geology, molecular biology, neuroscience, human physiology, 
evolutionary biology (from Edward Wilson), oceanography, a 
Harvard Business School course in environmental management -- and 
to make sure I was having fun, courses in jazz and pottery. 

</P><P>One nice feature of the Knight program is that you audit 
your classes, and you don't have to do any of the course work, 
i.e., readings, problem sets, or tests -- unless you choose to. I 
did some and learned more for doing so. But I chose to learn a 
little about a lot of things, rather than a lot about fewer 
things. You couldn't take that approach and sample so many 
things, if you had to do all the work for each class. 

</P><P>On top of the courses, I attended a  seminar on the issue 
of chlorine, two multiple-day sessions of MIT's Global Change 
Forum, and a long list of individual lectures. Oh yeah. Almost 
forgot the 10-day camping and hiking field trip to the 
Nevada-Southern California area with a geology class over Christmas 
break. 

</P><P>But there were lots of things that sounded great that I 
didn't get to do. That's not a complaint. Just a note of realism 
if you're thinking about the experience. Be prepared to make some 
tough choices. 

</P><P>Another warning: Be prepared to be very busy. I "worked" 
much longer days than I do when I'm at work. I expected it to be 
more of a vacation. But when you only have nine months in the 
candy store, you tend not to squander time. 

</P><P>You should also be prepared for some surprising ignorance 
in academe of "the real world." I heard a lecture from an expert 
on battery technology, who commented pessimistically about the 
future of electric cars without knowing anything about the 
"California Car" rules or how the auto industry was proposing the 
49-state car as an alternative, or how 90 percent of all daily 
auto use is within the mileage of the average lead-acid 
battery-fueled electric. A geology professor talking about radioactive 
waste contamination didn't know he had some in the very town 
where he lives. 

</P><P>This ignorance of the real world makes somebody from the 
real world (like a journalist) a special guest in most classes. 
Most professors also are glad to have an adult who could choose 
to be anywhere, in their class -- and they welcome participation and 
real world/adult perspective. 

</P><P>On the other hand, be warned that scientists and 
academicians don't much like the press. Be prepared occasionally 
to find yourself a whipping boy/girl for their complaints. I 
actually volunteered to speak at a few gatherings (one of 
oceanographers, one of climate change experts) about how we in 
the press do what we do, and how we and scientists could get 
along better. 

</P><P>Finally, two warnings about life after a fellowship, 
which I now face. A former curator of the Nieman program, Howard 
Simon, once said, "There are two problem periods for fellows. One 
is entry. The other is RE-entry." 

</P><P>As much fun as it is to pig out at the candy store, be 
prepared to have to go back to eating your broccoli! The freedom 
you experience while on fellowship is sweet and seductive. You 
don't want it to end. But of course it must. 

</P><P>Which leads to the strongest warning of all. Being away 
from work, out from under the deadlines and hassles and 
compromises, will allow you to see your professional reality more 
clearly. Be prepared. You may not like what you see. Facing that 
ultimate decision, whether to return to your job, or what kind of 
a change to make, will surely confront you at some point. It's 
just part of the price you'll pay for the freedom of sabbatical. 

</P><P>But remember what I said at the outset. GO FOR IT! 
Demands notwithstanding, I'm sure I will look back on this 
experience as one of the most stimulating, enriching, fun and 
exciting years in my professional life.

<H4><A NAME = "nieman">Nieman boosts enviro beat through fellowships</A></H4>

<P>By Chris Bowman

</P><P>At a time when many news organizations are sacrificing 
environmental coverage, one of the most respected promoters of 
journalistic quality and integrity is boosting the beat. 

</P><P>Next spring, for the third time, the Nieman Foundation at 
Harvard will be awarding annual fellowships to a U.S. and 
international journalist for the study of pollution and natural 
issues. 

</P><P>I was the first U.S. Environmental Nieman Fellow. My 
appointment ended in June. 

</P><P>Bill Kovach, Curator of the Nieman Foundation, 
established the specialized program at a time when I had given up 
on fellowships. I had been brought to the brink three times as a 
finalist for mid-career programs at Stanford and Michigan, and I 
didn't want to repeat the ordeal. Then, in a 1993 mailer to SEJ 
members, the Nieman Foundation announced the new fellowships. 

</P><P>I couldn't resist. The prestigious 57-year-old foundation 
was creating its first fellowship for specialized study -- not in 
the high-profile political or criminal justice arena -- but in my 
beat, the environment. I was impressed. So I applied from my post 
at the <EM>Sacramento Bee. </EM>

</P><P>Gregory Favre, the executive editor, granted me a leave 
of absence and agreed to cover the difference between my <EM>Bee </EM>
salary and the $25,000 fellowship stipend. 

</P><P>The official announcement of my appointment could only 
have come from Harvard: 

</P><P>"Sir, I beg to inform you on behalf of the University 
that you are appointed Environmental Nieman Fellow to serve from 
September 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995." The secretary to the 
Harvard Corporation signed the letter as "Your obedient servant." 

</P><P>Actually, we could have used a servant or two, obedience 
notwithstanding. The dirty laundry and dishes piled high in our 
dorm apartment as my wife and I indulged in the impossibly rich 
intellectual and cultural feast -- chamber music, fox-trot lessons, 
ice skating, kayaking, Red Sox games, museums, lectures and an 
endless parade of receptions and parties. 

</P><P>The Nieman Fellowship gave myself and my environmental 
lawyer-wife complete access to all of Harvard, MIT, Tufts, and 
Boston University. There was no right or wrong way to be a Nieman 
Fellow or Nieman spouse. We could spend the year as we wished. 

</P><P>Technically, Nieman fellows are auditors. We receive no 
course credits or degrees. I could work out any deal with 
professors to satisfy the gentle Nieman requirement of completing 
at least one course each semester as though it were for credit. 

</P><P>My international counterpart in the environmental 
fellowship was Barbara Cieszewska, who covers one of the most 
polluted corners of the industrialized world for the 
<EM>Rzeczpospolita</EM> newspaper in southern Poland. 

</P><P>Like the other 24 Niemans in our class, Barbara and I 
participated in twice-weekly seminars with guests from a variety 
of backgrounds. We were distinguished only by the requirement 
that we "concentrate" on environmental studies. 

</P><P>I examined the environment from multiple viewpoints -- 
economics, corporate strategy, design, law, and public health. I 
looked for ways to improve on traditional environmental 
journalism. Too often, I think, environmental stories exaggerate 
threats, rely largely on anecdotes from alleged victims, and 
juxtapose competing opinions under the pretense of balance. We 
skimp on information that people need most to judge the merits of 
proposed bans, restrictions and cleanups. 

</P><P>My goal was to learn the right questions to ask experts 
and to make sense of their answers. Are the claims of 
environmental peril scientifically justified? How do these 
threats compare to everyday risks? What are the health benefits 
and costs of protection? 

</P><P>The School of Public Health's classes on toxicology and 
epidemiology taught me how to critique scientific papers for 
myself rather than rely solely on "expert" opinion. Forest 
Reinhard's Business School class on environmental management gave 
me privileged insight into the thinking of soon-to-be corporate 
executives. 

</P><P>Robert Stavins, a professor at the Kennedy School of 
Government, had me analyze the causes and consequences of 
environmental problems from the view of an economist. 

</P><P>It was Stavins' idea to create an environmental study 
program at Harvard for journalists. The economist, who teaches 
nationwide at the Foundation for American Communications seminars 
for environmental journalists, believes better educated reporters 
and editors are key to sounder environmental policy. 

</P><P>Funding for the Environmental Nieman Fellowships is 
provided as part of a grant awarded to Harvard in 1993 by the V. 
Kann Rasmussen Foundation for environmental study and research. 
Villum Kann Rasmussen established a company in Denmark, in 1941, 
for making Velux roof windows and skylights. 

</P><P>The 1995-96 Environmental Nieman Fellows are Elliot 
Diringer, environmental writer and editor at the <EM>San Francisco 
Chronicle,</EM> and Jacques A. Rivard, environment reporter with the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in Montreal. 

</P><P>Anyone interested should apply in December and January. 
It may be the last chance. Funding for this program is assured 
only through the 1996-97 academic year.

<HR><H3><A NAME = "science">Science survey: Looking beyond the keystone species</A></H3>

<P>By Rich Stone

</P><P>The meek don't need to inherit the earth: they already 
own it. Ecologists are beginning to realize that communities of 
humble creatures, from soil microbes to sea algae, are just as 
critical to the health of many ecosystems as the beasts prowling 
the top of the food chain. 

</P><P>The result is a growing belief that the poster children 
of conservation -- the spotted owls and grizzly bears of the 
world  --  cannot thrive without efforts to preserve a teeming 
milieu of bugs, mites, slime molds, and other members of the 
conservation world's underclass. These organisms often operate 
out of sight and out of mind of environmental groups that aim to 
protect fur and feathers. 

</P><P>The consequence of elevating no one species above another 
does not come without a price. Ecologists must reassess the role 
of a cherished concept in their studies: Habitat often depends on 
one or more critical "keystone" species. 

</P><P>For years, ecologists assumed that protecting keystone 
species, such as the sea otter, would save a host of other 
organisms. This assumption is now being questioned. One of the 
first attacks came in an article in <EM>BioScience</EM> in 1993 (vol. 43, 
p. 219) from a team of University of California at Santa Cruz 
scientists, including prominent conservation biologist Michael 
Soule. The authors stated, "Both the complexity of ecological 
interactions and ignorance of them militates against the 
application of the keystone-species concept for practical 
management recommendations." 

</P><P>Not that ecologists want to junk the keystone concept. 
The idea took the field by storm in the late 1960s, when 
University of Washington marine ecologist Robert Paine described 
how removing a starfish species from a swathe of coast off 
Washington's Olympic Peninsula triggered a cascade of ecological 
change. 

</P><P>In his experiments, Paine found that mussels quickly 
filled the area vacated by the starfish. The mussel beds gave 
rise to a diversity of life that had not existed when starfish 
were present. Based on these observations, in 1969 Paine 
formulated the concept of keystone species: An organism that 
determines "the integrity of the community and its unaltered 
persistence through time.'' 

</P><P>But now ecologists are looking beyond keystone species to 
see how habitats are maintained. One area they're exploring: how 
to define groups of species, or attributes of disparate 
organisms, whose presence defines an ecosystem's health. 

</P><P>For instance, after studying communities of algae in 
three far-flung locations  --  in the Caribbean and off the coasts 
of Maine and Washington State  --  Robert Steneck of the University 
of Maine and Megan Dethier of the University of Washington found 
that many disparate algae species could be divided into seven 
functional groups that play specific ecological roles in the 
oceans (<EM>Oikos,</EM> vol. 69, p. 476, 1994). 

</P><P>Despite some species within a functional group being only 
distantly related to each other, each group has traits of size 
and anatomy that define how successful the group is within an 
ecosystem. The integrity of these habitats depends on the 
presence of these functional groups, with little premium on which 
species are actually carrying out the functions. 

</P><P>Other recent ideas render species truly anonymous when it 
comes to assessing habitat health. Take, for instance, University 
of Washington conservation biologist James Karr's Index of Biotic 
Integrity (IBI), a framework for assessing ecological health that 
transcends species boundaries. 

</P><P>Karr began developing the idea in the early 1970s, when 
he was consulting for an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
project to clean up Lake Erie. The EPA scientists, Karr recalls, 
focused in the beginning only on physical and chemical 
remediation. The experience spurred Karr to develop the IBI, a 
battery of some three dozen factors, among them salinity, soil 
composition, weather, disease, and competition, that can be used 
to measure ecosystem health. 

</P><P>Work on keystone species has tended to focus on one 
factor in particular: how species affect the flow of nutrients 
from detritus to top predator. Often left out of the food-web 
equation is how organisms engineer their environments. 

</P><P>In an article last year in <EM>Oikos</EM> (vol. 69, p. 373), 
ecologists Clive Jones (Institute of Ecosystem Studies, 
Millbrook, New York); John Lawton (Imperial College, Berks, 
London); and Moshe Shachak (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, 
Israel) argue that ecologists often neglect the role of organisms 
in fashioning their habitats. The emphasis on food web, the 
scientists say, has ignored activities such as beavers building 
dams, microalgae absorbing light and reducing the strength of sea 
ice, and blind mole rats digging and tunneling. 

</P><P>Rather than abandon the idea of the keystone species, 
scientists are refining it. A few dozen ecologists met last 
December to craft a better definition of keystone species that 
accounts for the diversity of organisms -- not just top 
predators -- crucial to ecosystem health. 

</P><P>The meeting spun off a paper, submitted to <EM>BioScience,</EM> 
that lays out a framework to determine quantitatively which 
species should be classified as keystones. One measure, for 
example, might be the ratio of the biomass of a species to its 
effect on the biomass of an entire ecosystem. 

</P><P>The bottom line, ecologists say, is not to cordon off 
research on keystone species, but to integrate it with studies on 
a range of factors affecting ecosystems. That should translate 
into a better understanding of how to preserve species: both the 
darlings of conservationists and the lowly creatures that hold 
habitats together. 

</P><P><EM>This is my last Science Survey before packing off for a 
year in Russia. I thank many SEJ members for the nice comments 
about the column since it first appeared in the Spring 1994 
issue.

<HR><H3><A NAME = "toolbox">Reporter's Toolbox: Part II: Overcoming science anxiety -- <BR>Homing in 
on the right journals to supplement sources </A></H3>

<P>By Janet Raloff

</P><P>Our last Toolbox <A HREF="sej_sp95.htm">(<EM>SEJournal</EM> volume 5, no.1, p. 20)</A>
pointed out why and how to tap scientific journals as resources 
for the environment beat. But there are thousands of journals 
that cover science -- and a large fraction of these at least 
periodically tackle environmental topics. How can reporters 
identify the particular journals best suited to their individual 
needs? Here are several strategies, depending on the resources at 
hand. 

</P><P>The easiest? If you live near a major research center  --  
regardless of its focus (medicine, physics, forestry, 
agriculture, industrial engineering)  --  check out its library. 
Allow yourself a minimum of three hours to scout the journals. 
Peruse anything that might be even tangentially related. For 
instance, the <EM>Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry</EM> 
regularly carries reports on the accumulation of metals and 
pesticides in crop plants. That can be interesting reading for 
anyone who eats. And the <EM>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</EM> 
has published a number of articles tying pesticides or industrial 
pollutants (such as PCBs) to malignancies. 

</P><P>Depending on your beat, one or more journals may feature 
something topical. If you hit pay dirt, thumb through the last 
three or four issues to see how frequently they published 
articles in your area of interest. If you see more than 
occasional articles, jot down the address and phone numbers for 
the journal's editorial office, along with citations of articles 
that caught your interest (volume and issue number, article 
title, lead author and page numbers). 

</P><P>When you get back to your office, call or write editors 
of each "pay dirt" journal and explain that you'd like to begin 
including their papers in your reporting. Then cite the articles 
that looked important, to demonstrate that you are indeed 
familiar with their publication. Explain that because you will 
need to know what's appearing on a timely basis, it would help if 
they could fax you the table of contents a week before they go to 
press. Then phone or fax a request to receive the actual article 
of anything that looks interesting. (In most cases, it helps if 
you promise not to run your article prior to the journal's 
mailing date.) 

</P><P>To build up rapport and good will with these people, send 
tear sheets of anything that develops. And, of course, cite the 
journal in your story. If your beat is narrowly focused, it might 
actually pay you or your employer to subscribe to one or more 
journals. (Though they typically cost $100 to $1,000 each, 
remember that as a business expense, these subscriptions are tax 
deductible.) 

</P><P>For instance, if there is a nuclear plant on your 
doorstep or if radon-emitting granite outcroppings dot your 
landscape, you might benefit from regularly scanning <EM>Health 
Physics</EM> (reporting the science of radiation effects). Similarly, 
<EM>Conservation Biology</EM> could prove a bonanza for reporters focusing 
on western land issues. It features relationships between 
predator species (such as wolves and lynxes) and their prey -- and 
how upsetting the balance between them can alter a region's plant 
cover, water-holding capacity, or soil structure. Or how 
introduced species -- from game fish to cattle -- have altered their 
new ecosystem. 

</P><P>If you don't have access to major research laboratories 
close to home, plan to visit ones whenever travel takes you to 
Chicago, New York, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Seattle, Dallas, Miami, 
or Boston (remember, this year's SEJ annual meeting will take 
place in a city with 55 colleges and universities in its 
surrounding communities). If traveling on business, allot at 
least a full half-day for the venture. Even if it's vacation 
travel, think of this research as an inexpensive investment in 
your career development. 

</P><P>No money to travel and working in the boonies? Consider a 
more indirect tack to identify useful journals. Whenever you 
interview a scientist or engineer -- even if it's just the manager 
of the local water-treatment plant -- conclude the exchange with a 
few queries about what he or she reads, and especially what 
journals have proven most useful over the years. The very fact 
that you're interviewing this person suggests your professional 
interests coincide. If anything comes particularly highly 
recommended, ask to view it and perhaps even borrow it over a 
weekend. If the interview is by phone and long distance, you 
might ask your source to fax you a photocopy of the table of 
contents and address of the journal's editorial office. Then 
contact the journal and request a sample back issue. 

</P><P>An even more indirect approach is to begin noting the 
journals cited in wire service and other news copy containing 
articles in your beat. If any journals pop up regularly over the 
months ahead, consider tracking down sample copies from their 
publishers. How do you find those publishers? Check whether your 
local library carries <EM>Ulrich's International Periodicals 
Directory</EM> (RR Bowker, New Providence, N.J.). This five-volume 
reference publishes every journal's address, phone, fax, and 
price. 

</P><P>If necessary, call the closest university library and ask 
them to conduct such a search for you. Warning: It may require 
faxing them the request and waiting a day or so for them to get 
back. But most are amenable to looking up what you need if you 
explain your plight. 

</P><P>You might also consider querying fellow SEJ members about 
the journals they use most. Because the directory lists several 
of our beats, you can home in on colleagues with similar 
interests. And focused queries may be no more than an e-mail 
away. 

</P><P>Once you identify potentially useful journals, find out

<HR><H3><A NAME = "blackwelder">Viewpoints: Changes needed in environmentalist outlook</A></H3>

<P>By Dr. Brent Blackwelder

</P><P>After 25 years of environmental work, my chief concern is 
that environmentalists spend the majority of their time on the 
defensive. We are fighting brushfires -- a toxic dump, a wetlands 
landfill, a refinery, an Army Corps dam, a subdivision destroying 
old forests. New federal and state legislatures have put us on 
the defensive now more than ever. 

</P><P>This is true not only of environmentalists, but also of 
citizens and (perhaps especially) journalists who cover the 
environment. To achieve lasting and sustainable progress we must 
all begin to get at the root cause of environmental problems; 
namely, the economic system under which we live. 

</P><P>Some of the basic economic levers are the taxing and 
spending powers of governments at the federal, state, and local 
levels. The tax code generally rewards anti-environmental 
behavior in every sector: fossil fuel use, transportation ($300 
billion annual subsidy to the automobile industry), pesticide 
use, and virgin rather than recycled materials -- to name a few. The 
tax code even rewards the mining of lead, mercury and uranium, 
and some of the biggest tax breaks go to the biggest polluters, 
which incidentally are the lowest job creators per dollar spent. 

</P><P>Similarly, the federal government spends only two percent 
of its budget on environmental protection and almost as much 
money on destructive activities such as various nuclear power 
programs, highways and dams. 

</P><P>Unless we take the offensive and change the economic 
system, the present pattern of taxing and spending will simply 
enrich and empower all the destructive forces at work today. Even 
efforts to protect park and wilderness areas are doomed unless we 
revise the economic system. Transboundary pollution is reaching 
the most remote parts of the planet: frogs are disappearing from 
mountain wilderness areas, Arctic haze chokes the Inuit people, 
new forms of DDT reach islands in the Great Lakes, Soviet oil and 
nuclear spills and disposal threaten the Arctic Ocean. And if 
major changes are not made in energy use, the specter of global 
warming could turn all the Nature Conservancy's preserves into 
wastelands, because their plants and animals won't remain with a 
significant shift in climate. 

</P><P>How can we take on an issue as large as the global 
economy? I can't speak for journalists, but I do have some ideas 
for environmentalists -- many of which deserve much more focused 
attention from the news media than they have yet received. Even 
within a narrow political focus, these issues are newsworthy. 

</P><P>First, environmentalists have many actual and potential 
allies with whom we should work. For example, most religious 
organizations now preach stewardship of creation, and they speak 
out against greed. As the son and grandson of Episcopal 
ministers, I urge all religions to join as allies in trying to 
get the economic system changed. The system should reward 
long-term stewardship rather than short-term speculation. 

</P><P>Second, organized labor is deeply concerned about the 
loss of jobs in the globalized economy. An environmentally 
sustainable economy should be creating and sustaining meaningful 
jobs in healthy workplaces. 

</P><P>Third, environmental organizations themselves need to put 
resources into the big levers at the federal and state levels. 
Unfortunately, there is only one full-time environmental advocate 
for dealing with federal tax code issues and only one for all the 
federal appropriations. This is not enough muscle power to match 
the hundreds of business lobbyists gathered outside the Ways and 
Means Committee. 

</P><P>The situation, however, is not hopeless. In the last 
Congress, for instance, Friends of the Earth worked with a group 
of 250 organizations across the country and succeeded in 
obtaining a seven percent increase in EPA's operating budget. The 
trial run of the Green Scissors Campaign to cut 
anti-environmental spending succeeded in canceling five wasteful 
programs (like nuclear reactors in space) saving taxpayers more 
than $7 billion. The Campaign, which involves both environmental 
groups and fiscally conservative organizations, has targeted 34 
federal programs this session. 

</P><P>Conservatives have opened the door to discussions of a 
total revision of the tax code. We support a shift away from 
taxing employment and income and onto taxing pollution, resource 
extraction, and energy. 

</P><P>The first 100 days of the new Congress have witnessed an 
unprecedented onslaught against environmental laws. What started 
as a quiet and somewhat indirect attack on environmental programs 
through the Republican Contract with America has mushroomed into 
a frontal assault on the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, 
Superfund, and the Endangered Species Act. During the opening 
three months, 61 freshman members scored zero on the League of 
Conservation Voters 100-day scorecard. 

</P><P>Although the most direct attacks on environmental 
statutes are likely to be stopped in the Senate or through a 
presidential veto, the greatest danger lies with the 13 
appropriations bills. House members like David McIntosh 
(R-Ind.), who headed vice president Quayle's Competitiveness 
Council, have vowed to accomplish their objectives with 
amendments to appropriations bills. While Clinton signaled that 
he would veto the House version of the Clean Water Act, a more 
likely scenario is that he will be confronted with miscellaneous 
weakening changes to this law as part of the VA-HUD 
appropriations bill. 

</P><P>To counter the backlash and get at another root cause, 
the most fundamental change which the environmental movement must 
make is in the area of elections to public office. It is 
difficult to make progress with decision-makers who don't take 
environmental problems seriously. The environmental movement 
spends less than one percent of its budget on electoral activity. 

</P><P>Friends of the Earth is suggesting that Earth Day 1996 be 
moved to Election Day, to be preceded by an Earth Week of 
activity talking about the views of candidates for office at all 
levels. A League of Conservation Voters' poll last November 
revealed that 40 percent of those voting said they would be more 
likely to support a pro-environment candidate and only 10 percent 
said they would be less likely. Furthermore, 65 percent said they 
wanted more discussion of environmental issues in the campaigns. 

</P><P>With such promising polling data, environmentalists 
should shed their fear or reluctance to get involved and start 
participating with vigor. Failure to do so will only lead to 
further entrenchment of anti-environmental legislators and will 
doom us to a decade of defense at the very time we must make the 
greatest progress.

<HR><H3><A NAME = "listserv">Online Bits & Bytes: Listserv expands SEJ's online universe</A></H3>

<P>By Amy Gahran

</P><P>So -- you don't have an America Online (AOL) account, but 
you're curious about what SEJ members are doing on our private 
forum on America Online. Now, if you have access to Internet e-
mail, you can get SEJ news and participate in online discussions 
through SEJ's members-only e-mail list. 
</P><P>E-mail lists (or "listservs") are lists of e-mail 
addresses maintained on university computers or Internet 
access providers. (SEJ's listserv, which began in May, is hosted 
by Indra's Net, a commercial Internet access company in Boulder, 
Colo.) Each listserv has an e-mail address, and mail sent to that 
address is distributed to all addresses on the list. Our listserv 
includes about 160 SEJ members. 

</P><P>What do we discuss on the listserv? Anything related to 
SEJ or to environment journalism can be covered. 
Computer-assisted reporting is discussed sometimes, too. Topics so far 
include Gregg Easterbrook's book, <EM>A Moment on the Earth;</EM> upcoming 
SEJ regional events; members' requests for information; bulletins 
about groups or publications useful to environment journalists; 
and a call for speakers for an upcoming computer-assisted 
reporting conference. 

</P><P>The SEJ listserv is meant to complement our existing 
forum on AOL, not to supplant it -- both venues have their strengths 
and weaknesses. I cross-post most messages from the listserv to 
the AOL forum, and vice-versa. Therefore, if you already have 
access to the forum, you won't miss anything significant by not 
subscribing to the listserv (although some members do belong to 
both). 

</P><P>Like our AOL forum, our listserv is for SEJ members only. 
Subscription requests must be approved by the list manager (me). 
New subscribers receive a welcome letter and information on SEJ 
mailing list policies. This takes just a day -- maybe two if you're 
trying this on the weekend. (I don't check e-mail when I'm 
climbing mountains.) 

</P><P>The SEJ listserv is unmoderated -- that is, any approved 
subscriber can post a message to the list, and that message will 
be circulated to all other subscribers by software on our host 
computer without being screened by the list manager. So far our 
subscribing members have adhered to the listserv's policies 
fairly well with no PR blitzes or idle chatter. (See sidebar.) 

</P><P>Here's how it works:

</P><UL><LI>An SEJ member posts a message to the listserv asking how to 
contact a certain environmental group. Each subscriber receives 
e-mail containing that request. 

<P><LI>The list manager copies that posting to the appropriate section 
of the AOL forum (in this case, the "info needed" folder). Now 
the original request will reach both listserv subscribers and 
members who participate only in our AOL forum. 

<P><LI>If someone on the listserv or the forum wants to reply 
privately to that request,  e-mail can be sent directly to the 
author of the original message. Or, if the person responding 
wants to make the response public, he or she can send that 
response to the listserv address <A HREF="mailto:sej@indra.com">(sej@indra.com)</A>. It will then be 
circulated to all listserv subscribers. However, for members who 
only have access to the AOL forum and not the listserv, public 
responses must be posted to the forum -- they will bounce back to 
the author if e-mailed to the listserv address. 

<P><LI>Public responses posted either to the listserv or the 
forum will be cross-posted. 
</UL>
</P><P>Traffic on the listserv runs about 5-10 messages per 
week. For some people this is just fine, others may feel it's 
slow, and still others may find it overwhelming. Members who want 
to read the SEJ list, but who would rather not get several 
individual pieces of e-mail each week from it, can subscribe to 
the digest for this list. The digest is a version of the listserv 
in which individual postings are compiled into a single text 
file. When 32K of posted text accumulates, a digest is sent out 
to everyone on the digest list. People who subscribe to the 
digest can still post messages to the listserv, so no 
interactivity is lost. 

</P><P>As I write this, when you subscribe to the listserv it's 
like stepping into a meeting in progress -- you get the current 
postings or digests, but you can't go back and retrieve old 
material. I'm setting up a way to archive our digests online 
so that subscribers can retrieve them at will -- either through e-mail 
commands or through an Internet function known as FTP (file transfer protocol). 

</P><P>When I first began this list, Chris Rigel, SEJ's systems 
manager, sent me a list of all the e-mail addresses for members 
on SEJ's main membership database. I then subscribed all of the 
SEJ members on that list. (Knowing that not everyone would want 
to be on the listserv, the welcome letter says right up front how 
to unsubscribe from the list.) We had about 40 bad e-mail 
addresses, of which I have been able to resolve only a handful. 
Also, I have since discovered that CompuServe charges its members 
a small fee for each piece of e-mail from a non-CompuServe 
sender, so several CompuServe members unsubscribed themselves. 
Altogether, only about 15 people have chosen to unsubscribe from 
the listserv so far. A few members who weren't on my initial 
contact list heard about the listserv by various means and have 
subscribed. 

</P><P>If you have Internet e-mail and were not notified about 
the listserv, it means that the SEJ office doesn't have your 
current e-mail address. Members should make sure the SEJ office 
has your e-mail address (e-mail <A HREF="mailto:chrisSEJ@aol.com">chrisSEJ@aol.com)</A> 
and we'll send you an invitation to subscribe. 

</P><P>So far, the listserv is working out very well. I've 
gotten much positive feedback, especially from members who 
couldn't access the AOL forum. I've also gotten some constructive 
criticism, which has been very helpful since this is the first 
listserv I've ever managed. The really good news is that the 
listserv doesn't cost SEJ one penny. I get to manage a listserv 
for $1 per month under the conditions of my personal account on

<HR><H3><A NAME = "features">Features</H3>
<H4><A NAME = "meeting">Meeting of scientists, officials and journalists spurs draft of 
environmental reporting principles</A></H4>

<P>By Jim Detjen

</P><P>Is it possible to develop a set of principles that 
environmental and science journalists can follow worldwide? 

</P><P>This was the challenge put forward by Professor Guido 
Perin at a meeting last April in Rovereto, Italy. The occasion 
was the 25th anniversary meeting of the Italian Water Pollution 
Control Association. Perin, a professor of environmental 
toxicology at the University of Venice, invited scientists, 
environmental officials and journalists from Europe and the 
United States to a conference in Italy to grapple with this and 
other environmental issues. 

</P><P>Admittedly, the task Perin asked a team of three 
Americans to carry out was ambitious. We were well aware that 
whatever principles we drew up could be endlessly debated. 
Nonetheless, we felt it worthwhile to draft a set of principles 
as a way to get the discussion going. 

</P><P>The following 15 principles were agreed upon by Gordon 
Chesters, an environmental scientist at the Water Resources 
Center at the University of Wisconsin in Madison; Joseph A. 
Cotruvo, of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; and myself. 
Yes, I admit they could probably use some tighter editing; they 
were written by a committee. But what do you think of the ideas? 
Do you agree with them? Did we forget anything important? Let us 
know. Give me a call at (517) 353-9479 or send me an e-mail 
message <A HREF="mailto:DETJEN@pilot.msu.edu">(detjen@pilot.msu.edu).</A>

<EM></P><P>Introduction:
</EM>
</P><P>The quality and effectiveness of environmental and 
science reporting is a function of a reporter's perspective, 
training, analytic abilities and persistence; the quality of the 
information that is available; the qualifications and credibility 
of sources; and the subject matter's relevance. This proposed set 
of principles provides guidance to environmental and science 
reporters. It is intended to enhance their credibility, 
consistency and effectiveness in reporting complex and 
controversial technical issues. These guiding principles, 
although obvious, may also be applicable in other areas of 
reporting. These guidelines are presented to stimulate discussion 
within the journalistic community and to encourage the adoption 
of an appropriate set of principles to enhance the quality of 
reporting throughout the profession. 

</P><P><OL><LI>Your knowledge, contacts and credibility are your 
principal assets in achieving fair and accurate reporting on 
environmental and science issues. Cultivate and expand all of 
them continuously. 

</P><P><LI>Act ethically. You carry a public trust and the 
concomitant responsibility. Your articles and reports are the 
public's principal source of information on complex and 
potentially significant environmental and science issues, and as 
such will be an important factor in determining the public's role 
in solving problems. 

</P><P><LI>Understand the limitations of science. Science does 
not have all the answers; usually it is much more adept at 
raising questions. Complicated real-world problems do not have 
simple solutions because each option generates new problems and 
affects different constituencies. The solutions to complex 
problems usually require factoring science, technology, law, 
economics, politics and public interests into the available 
options, and trying to find an acceptable course of action. 

</P><P><LI>Be prepared. Anticipate. Get help. Assemble a group of 
qualified credible sources to help you evaluate and explain 
issues and the statements of different parties. People are not 
necessarily qualified and credible just because they have titles 
and advanced degrees. Match specific expertise to subject matter. 
Beware of sources who are willing to pontificate outside of their 
area of expertise (e.g. having a PhD in chemistry or physics does 
not necessarily mean that a person is qualified to critique ozone 
depletion processes.) Also, being a physician does not 
necessarily mean that the person is qualified on public health 
issues. 

</P><P><LI>Use credible sources and good judgment. Don't be 
hypocritical. Avoid using information from incredible fringe 
elements that might make interesting copy but confuse the issue; 
at least, don't give them much weight. It is disingenuous to 
justify yourself by claiming you were merely presenting a range 
of options. 

</P><P><LI>Don't try to outdo the supermarket tabloids. Life is 
already tough enough for decision makers and the public. Avoid 
sensationalism that can confuse and panic the public, trigger bad 
decisions and misdirect action away from the real problems of our 
society. Since speculation and perceptions are often accepted as 
fact, avoid overstating cases -- especially with splashy headlines 
and appeals to emotion. 

</P><P><LI>Don't mislead with misinterpretations. Understand the 
differences between hazards, hypothetical risks, and actuarial 
risks. Just about everything is hazardous under some condition of 
use or misuse. The question is what is the likelihood that harm 
will occur in some particular situation. State the range of 
uncertainty whenever possible. Hypothetical risks are modeled 
projections that often go well beyond what has been observed in 
studies. Sometimes they are fairly credible, often they are not, 
or at least not very precise (e.g., extrapolations of human 
cancer risks are often made from chemicals tested in animals at 
high doses while humans are typically exposed to low doses). 
There may or may not be validity in a particular case, but 
quantifying risk is very imprecise and designed to be 
conservative (i.e., more likely to overstate the true risk). 
Epidemiological studies are also difficult to interpret -- as recent 
debate on the risks of coffee consumption illustrate. On the 
other hand, actuarial risks (like automobile death rates or coal 
mining accidents) can be measured with certainty. 

</P><P><LI>Beware of advocates on either side of an issue -- they 
all have biases, as does everybody else. Environmentalists are 
not necessarily right (no matter how dedicated they seem) and 
industry is not necessarily wrong (even though profit is a 
factor). Treat all information from parties at issue skeptically 
(i.e. requiring corroboration) and keep them all at arms length. 

</P><P><LI>Communicate in comprehensible terms. Do not toss 
around strange numbers (like one in a million risks) or terms 
(like parts per million or micrograms per liter) without 
providing a context. Educate your audience with apt analogies and 
explanations of unfamiliar terms and give perspective. For 
example, the U.S. cancer death rate has been about one in four 
deaths (0.25) for a long time. An excess cancer risk of one in 
one million would become 0.250001.  Use charts and illustrations 
whenever they can help improve communication. 

</P><P><LI>Aim for depth. Get past the surface. Describe 
plausible alternatives and solutions when you address important 
complex issues. Spell out advantages and disadvantages and the 
consequences of alternatives. 

</P><P><LI>Do your homework -- work. Be a skeptic. Check the biases 
and validity of the assertions you hear. Ask for documentation; 
contact your sources for assistance and corroboration. During 
interviews ask probing and specific questions. 

</P><P><LI>Be meticulous and honest. Be careful with the 
accuracy of quotes and facts, checking and double-checking before 
publishing or broadcasting. Work with editors to make sure that 
the headline reflects the tone and context of the story. 

</P><P><LI>Retain your objectivity. Do not take sides unless you 
make it clear you are editorializing. Why risk damaging your 
credibility? 

</P><P><LI>Background and training in science. When writing on 
technical issues, broad science training is invaluable. Keep and 
expand your expertise and breadth of knowledge by reading, and by 
taking classes and workshops in pertinent and newly emerging 
subjects throughout your journalistic career. 

</P><P><LI>Set the record straight. Be willing to admit errors 
of fact or changing interpretations openly and with as much 
visibility as in the original story. Science does change and 
people can make mistakes. If you do your homework, serious errors 
won't happen very often, but if they do, or if new information 
changes the original conclusion, being forthright will enhance 
your credibility.

<H4><A NAME = "chandler">The changing environment beat: an editor's view</A></H4>

<P>By Robert W. Chandler

</P><P>News changes. It waxes and wanes. Almost never is it cast 
in stone. Beats can develop slowly, and newspapers took a long 
time to discover the environment beat. In some ways, the 
environment beat evolved like the education beat, which gradually 
changed from covering local school board meetings to reporting on 
what took place in public schools, and on what the future of 
education might hold. 

</P><P>This transition was easier for newly named education 
writers than for environment writers. They covered school 
boards -- which were responsible only for certain levels of 
education in clearly defined geographic regions; institutions 
with fixed ways of getting and spending money. But the 
environment is not like that. It covers everything, everywhere. 

</P><P>As is the case with many reporters on newly expanded 
beats, some environmental reporters tend to adopt the protective 
coloration of the activists on their beats, those who furnish the 
strongest and most provocative copy. A few reporters become 
activists; they are advocates, not observers. 

</P><P>Once that stage is reached there is a danger -- the danger 
that a reporter suddenly will discover the "ultimate truth." This 
truth will be a finding that the reporter understands, but that 
neither his editors nor his readers will recognize without his 
help. Too often, reporters fail to provide that help. Rather, 
from an editor's viewpoint, the "ultimate truth" can only be 
described with lots of words, all accompanied by graphics in 
varying colors and color halftones to furnish variety. 

</P><P>Such projects are never small ones. They take much 
reporter time, seldom available in an unbroken mass sufficient to 
complete the blockbuster story and sidebars, or to complete a 
series all at once. Usually the reporter has to approach the job 
piecemeal or get an editor's approval to drop all else until this 
great truth is reported. 

</P><P>And then comes the toughest job of all: getting space. 
Space often is available for Sunday thumbsuckers on various 
topics, but it is difficult at best for most reporters to confine 
themselves to space which is readily available. 

</P><P>A major reason environmental stories have trouble 
competing for space is that these stories don't fit into the 
traditional definition of news. However, this problem is not 
insurmountable. Our small newspaper once reported a 
10,000-year-old story as the lead story of that day, a paleontological find 
of national importance. The reporter who discovered this story 
was able to write it succinctly, to make its importance apparent, 
and to persuade his editor that it was more important than any 
other story that particular day. 

</P><P>However, this kind of persuasion is hard to pull off when 
the story being pitched is a species in trouble, or global 
warming, or problems with the ozone layer. Reporters must weigh 
their interest in a story against what the editor thinks will 
interest readers. Editors have the upper hand, and they know, 
better than reporters, that newsrooms are not governed by popular 
vote. 

</P><P>It's easy for environmental reporters to blame lack of 
space for their stories on the bottom line -- the need for editors 
to produce newspapers capable of producing profits in an 
increasingly hostile business environment. At these times, 
reporters too often believe that editors simply don't understand 
long, complicated, difficult stories. However, this is not 
necessarily true. 

</P><P>The real problem may be that reporters become so 
interested in their stories that they think their editors 
understand these stories as well as they do. They don't. A good 
editor will listen and learn, and good reporters should be able 
to explain why their stories are important to readers. That's a 
reporter's job. 

</P><P>The answer is for reporters to cultivate patience. If 
editors are brought into the picture at the beginning, and if 
they value the time writers spend on environmental projects, they 
will find the time and space for the story. 

</P><P>News changes. What easily is today's top story may not be 
accorded much space tomorrow, simply for competitive reasons. 
However, no reporters worth their salt, working for equally 
worthy editors, need worry about the "ultimate truth" finally 
seeing the light of day -- in form and length sufficient to the 
needs of interested readers.

<HR><H3><A NAME = "easterbrook">Easterbrook's environmental optimism: "A Moment on the Earth" spurs criticism</A></H3>

<H4><A NAME = "sagan">Contradictions and spin doctoring abound</A></H4>

<P>By Kathy Sagan

</P><P>I first came across Gregg Easterbrook's work in a <EM>New 
York Times Magazine</EM> article a year or so ago about how the "Third 
World" is in a real crisis of poverty, sickness, and pollution, 
while environmentalists sit around preoccupied with "First World" 
concerns such as synthetic chemicals in food and the greenhouse 
effect. Like the author, I, too, have been to New Delhi, 
Bombay, Kathmandu, Nairobi, Quito. No one would argue that the 
people of developing countries have it much worse than we do. But 
why the dichotomy? Why the need to pit these concerns against one 
another? 

</P><P>Then I read an article by Easterbrook in <EM>Newsweek</EM> called 
"Rachel Carson Was Wrong," which posited that none of the 
"doomsday" scenarios Carson predicted have come to pass -- 
enumerating them one by one, only to end the piece with a short 
quip that they haven't materialized because society has, in fact, 
heeded Carson's warning. 

</P><P>Now, with the publication of his book, <EM>A Moment on the 
Earth</EM> (Viking, $27.95, 745 pp.), Easterbrook presents us with a 
wide canvas on which he spins his craft to new heights. Covering 
an impressive amount of material (unfortunately not all 
accurately) he seems compelled to process all this information 
through a funnel of forced optimism -- to fit into what he calls "a 
new view of ecological thought called 'eco-realism.'" 

</P><P>According to Easterbrook, "the founding concept of 
eco-realism is: Logic, not sentiment, best serves the interests of 
nature. The ecological impulse must become grounded in 
rationality ... Love nature? Learn science and speak logic. Many 
lesser creatures will thank you." 

</P><P>He then posits his manifesto. Among his credos:

</P><P>"In the Western world the Age of Pollution will end in 
our lifetime, with society almost painlessly adapting a 
zero-emissions philosophy." 

</P><P>"Most recoveries from pollution will happen faster than 
even optimists project." And others ... 

</P><P>This news sounds wonderful. Too bad Easterbrook doesn't 
heed his own advice and ground his own philosophy in 
well-researched and reasoned fact. Only by half-reporting some issues, 
and misreporting others, can he draw some of the conclusions he 
does. Naturally, anyone who questions his facts or 
interpretations is labeled an "enviro," and immediately diagnosed 
as a pathological pessimist with a seemingly genetic inability 
too see environmental issues in a positive light. How much easier 
it is to name-call, than to foster real debate. 

</P><P>Easterbrook's writing is full of contradictions and 
disingenuous lines of reasoning. He uses facts as "semiotic 
playthings;" mixes and confuses geological time and human time in 
ways that make little practical sense; he splits off information 
that doesn't support his point -- then backtracks later to cover 
himself, over and over again. 

</P><P>Here's one example of his "playful" logic and reasoning: 
It was predicted we would run out of coal, then new seams were 
found. An oil crisis was predicted, then prices dropped. From 
this he draws the conclusion of "The Law of Environmental 
Affairs: Whenever all respectable commentators believe a problem 
cannot be solved, it is about to be solved. Therefore global 
warming considered unstoppable means that the greenhouse effect 
is about to become old news." He, of course, covers himself 
several paragraphs later saying, "it may well be that 0.002 
percent of annual addition is sufficient to tip the scales in 
favor of warming." So what's the point? 

</P><P>The sheer scope of the material covered in <EM>A Moment on 
the Earth</EM> would be awesome enough, if current debate about these 
issues was summarized in an objective, trustworthy way, instead 
of filtered through this Panglossian world view. But then again, 
the climate is ripe for this kind of thinking. I was recently 
asked to write a magazine piece on food safety and was told by 
the editor, "We don't want anything scary." Readers are tired of 
bad news, scary facts and being held responsible for things. 
Regulation is out; blame it on the other guy is in. Better yet, 
just wish the problem away. A "shoot the messenger" mentality is 
prevalent in many circles, and I would argue that some of 
Easterbrook's construct is just a brilliant packaging job of 
salable ideas in the current journalism market. 

</P><P>Take the debate about synthetic chemicals, which is full 
of misinformation. Three separate times Easterbrook brings up 
Bruce Ames and his work on natural carcinogens in food. He argues 
that "it may eventually be shown that natural chemicals are a 
leading source of cancer." This is further than even Ames himself 
is willing to go. Ames' own report states, "Although the findings 
do not indicate that these natural dietary carcinogens are 
important in human cancer, they cast doubt on the relative 
importance for human cancer of low-dose exposure to synthetic 
chemicals." But Easterbrook goes one further, saying "if natural 
carcinogens are an important cancer cause (which they are not) 
the way to get rid of them is bioengineering." Even Ames, an 
extremist in this view, doesn't believe this to be the case. 

</P><P>Dismissing the long-term effects of insecticides, 
Easterbrook says, "Nature has made beetles that have lasted 200 
million years. Compared to that, what's a can of Raid?" 

</P><P>He blithely says most journalists only read summaries of 
studies and reports and not the reports themselves. This must be 
true in his own research on the Environmental Protection Agency 
reassessment of dioxin. However, even if he read only the 
executive summary, he would see that the EPA has not backpedaled 
on its position about dioxin toxicity one iota. In fact, the 
draft reassessment says that while it is a probable human 
carcinogen, cancer is not dioxin's most sensitive endpoint. At 
much lower doses one can see immunological, neurological, and 
reproductive problems. 

</P><P>Easterbrook praises 1990 EPA administrator William Reilly 
for initiating the reassessment of dioxin and says environmental 
groups opposed it. Reilly was pressured by the paper industry to 
revisit dioxin in light of a supposed consensus among scientists 
that a threshold existed below which dioxin is harmless. The 
paper industry was hoping a reassessment would allow the water 
standards to be weakened. The theory of a supposed threshold was 
in itself misreported as a consensus. Many environmental groups 
welcomed the study, even though Reilly himself initially told 
reporters as the reassessment was just under way, he expected 
that EPA would discover dioxin to be less toxic. This, of course, 
turned out to not be the case. One wonders why Easterbrook 
doesn't address lobbying in any consistent way. Certainly it 
plays an important role in any environmental discussion. 

</P><P>With regard to animal testing, Kenneth Olden, head of the 
National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) has 
publicly stated that Keith Schneider misrepresented his position 
on animal testing in an article in the <EM>New York Times.</EM> 
Nonetheless, Easterbrook continues the misinformation (or 
disinformation), obviously relying on secondhand material for 
some of his assertions. 

</P><P>Easterbrook does the same thing with information on Times 
Beach. Vernon Houk, an official of the Centers for Disease 
Control, was not the person who ordered the evacuation of Times 
Beach, as Keith Schneider has reported. Lee Thomas was. Some of 
Houk's lack of popularity in his later career may stem from the 
fact that he was brought before Senate hearings for copying 
industry water studies onto CDC letterhead and passing them off 
as agency findings. Another, albeit minor correction regarding 
Times Beach is that soil samples were measured before the flood, 
not after. He tends to get both large and small points wrong in 
various issues. 

</P><P>He says fat is "one of the most potent carcinogens." But 
isn't it the toxins stored in fat that are dangerous? 

</P><P>He says "this chapter asserts that water pollution is 
essentially over in the United States." Just like that. No, we 
don't have epidemics of cholera or typhoid. Yet the CDC and EPA 
just announced a nationwide warning for immune-compromised people 
to boil tap water because of the presence of Cryptosporidium in 
water. And the EPA says that in 1994, some 30 million Americans 
were served by drinking water systems that violated one or more 
public health standards. Easterbrook refers to the Milwaukee 
incident in which Cryptosporidium caused stomach cramps in 
300,000 people who drank municipal water. He doesn't mention the 
104 people who died from it. 

</P><P>He says that areas downwind of Chernobyl received a dose 
of radiation only one-fifth of what one would get in an X-ray. 
Later he says "the Ukrainian government estimates that long-term 
exposure from the accident will cause up to 8,000 additional 
premature deaths. Some estimates put the number at 17,000 or 
higher." These deaths are additional to the immediate deaths, 
figured at 31,400. Some X-ray! 

</P><P>He says there's no ozone hole over the North Pole. He 
confuses global, regional, and local temperatures when discussing 
global warming; confuses species when discussing endangered 
species. And on and on. Ultimately he claims a prominent role for 
man in nature, which tends to contradict his basic premise that 
whatever man does will ever make nature blink -- short of nuclear 
war, of course. 

</P><P>Clearly Easterbrook has pored over volumes of material 
and spent hours synthesizing it in preparing his thesis and 
writing this book. Yet he relies over again on the same studies 
and spokespeople rather than present differing points of view. 
Ongoing, honest debate would be welcome on any number of these 
issues. However, he does the issues a disservice by manipulating 
them just to support his viewpoint. After all, what's the point 
of eco-realism, if not a logical, science-based, objective 
perspective? 

</P><P>Rather than heralding in a new era of environmental 
optimism, Easterbrook merely markets a message to match the times 
and the pressure for good news and less government regulation. 
(Is this really his intent? It's hard to know.) It's easy to say 
there will be an end of pollution in our lifetime; in the next 
decade we'll have zero emissions; but where are the facts to back 
it up? 

</P><P>In these times spin has become the substitute for honest 
debate. This is an important book, if only in sheer scope. Too 
bad it is riddled with misinformation (in an age of 
disinformation). 

</P><P>Oddly enough, in Easterbrook's discussion of 
environmental optimism the issue of backlash rarely comes up.

<H4><A NAME = "shabecoff">Journalists role: to probe beneath the veneer of others' propaganda</A></H4>

<P>By Philip Shabecoff


</P><P>Gregg Easterbrook's article in the last <EM>SEJournal</EM>, "Up 
the Planet," and his book, <EM>A Moment On the Earth,</EM> send a 
jarringly wrong message to environmental journalists. 

</P><P>Reporters are the eyes and ears of civil society. We are 
not here to serve our readers, listeners or viewers fatuous, 
feel-good fluff about "the most glorious news that can be 
imagined" -- especially when the news is very far from glorious. Our 
role is to probe beneath the veneer placed over our continuing 
environmental ills by industrial, political and ideological 
propaganda. 

</P><P>Easterbrook's message, his "eco-realism," is that in the 
rich industrialized countries, the war to preserve the 
environment is basically over and we have won. "Pollution," he 
asserts, "will end within our lifetimes, with society almost 
painlessly adapting a zero-emissions philosophy." 

</P><P>The great irony, of course, is that this "don't worry, be 
happy" message comes just as the anti-environmental Republican 
right has taken power in Congress and is attempting (with some 
success) to roll back environmental gains made not only since the 
first Earth Day in 1970, but since the emergence of modern 
environmentalism a century ago. 

</P><P>Scientists such as Dr. Peter Raven, Director of the 
Missouri Botanical Garden, and environmental groups have pointed 
out the many errors with which <EM>Moment</EM> is riddled. The 
Environmental Defense Fund compiled more than 50 pages of 
scientific corrections from only four chapters of the book. 

</P><P>Easterbrook's most fundamental error, however, is his 
contention that environmentalism is founded on "pessimism" and a 
"doomsday" view of ecological problems. Anyone with a sense of 
the history, however, knows modern environmentalism sprang from 
the progressivism of the Theodore Roosevelt era and is firmly 
based on the idea of progress, not pessimism. 

</P><P>Yes, we have made progress in solving our environmental 
problems. But scientists and environmentalists and most 
environmental journalists know that we can and should do a lot 
better. 

</P><P>Actual reality (as opposed to Easterbrook's virtual 
ecoreality) is that environmental and public health goals are 
only reached when scientists, environmentalists, and citizens 
identify problems and abuses and suggest solutions -- and when 
journalists report about them.

<H4><A NAME = "montague">Easterbrook's case built on error, disinformation, even some distortion</A></H4>

<P>By Peter Montague

</P><P>Gregg Easterbrook's recent book, <EM>A Moment on the Earth,</EM> 
is remarkable for its "optimism." But careful examination reveals 
that his case for optimism is built on errors, distortions, and 
disinformation. Here are a few of Easterbrook's claims, compared 
to the facts. 

</P><P><UL><LI><EM>Easterbrook:</EM> Toxic waste isn't an important problem 
because the National Academy of Sciences in a 1991 report said 
there is "no clear relationship between proximity to toxic wastes 
and cancer" (p. 604). 

</P><P><EM>Fact:</EM> What the National Academy of Sciences said about 
toxic wastes and human health was this: "A limited number of 
epidemiologic studies indicate that increased rates of birth 
defects, spontaneous abortion, neurologic impairment, and cancer 
have occurred in some residential populations exposed to 
hazardous wastes. We are concerned that other populations at risk 
might not have been adequately identified." 

</P><P>The Academy further said, "Millions of tons of hazardous 
materials are slowly migrating into ground water in areas where 
they could pose problems in the future, even though current risks 
could be negligible." 

</P><P><LI><EM>Easterbrook:</EM> Radioactive waste disposal is not really a 
problem because even at the WIPP site in southern New Mexico 
(built to hold long-lived transuranic military wastes) most of 
the radioactivity will have disappeared within 300 years (p. 
514). 

</P><P><EM>Fact:</EM> The WIPP radioactive waste dump in New Mexico is 
slated to hold, at a minimum, one ton of plutonium-239 which has 
a half-life of 24,400 years. Plutonium is one of the two or three 
most potent carcinogens around. According to the government's 
environmental impact statement, WIPP may eventually hold up to 44 
tons of plutonium. It will take 10 half-lives, or 240,400 years 
(far longer than Homo sapiens have walked the earth), for this 
plutonium to decay away, not 300 years. 

</P><P><EM><LI>Easterbrook:</EM> Most forms of cancer are in decline (p. 
246). 

</P><P><EM>Fact:</EM> According to the National Cancer Institute, the 
incidence (occurrence) rates of 14 out of 16 types of cancer are 
increasing, not decreasing. The death rates for eight out of 16 
types of cancer also are increasing. 

</P><P><EM><LI>Easterbrook:</EM> Chemicals are, today, assumed to be 
dangerous, and the burden of proof is on the manufacturers of 
chemicals to prove safety before new chemicals can be introduced 
into commerce. 

</P><P><EM>Fact:</EM> Today in the U.S., new chemicals are introduced at 
the will of the manufacturer, and it is up to the public to prove 
harm before a chemical can even be regulated, much less banned. 

</P><P><EM><LI>Easterbrook:</EM> Dioxin is in the same chemical family as 
table salt (p. 414); the largest study of dioxin and human health 
found only a "slight" increase in cancer (p. 235); dioxin is 
natural, caused mainly by forest fires (p. 238); and new 
emissions of dioxin have already been "nearly eliminated" (p. 
238). 

</P><P><EM>Fact:</EM> According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA), which has been "reassessing" dioxin for the past four 
years, at least half of the dioxin sources in the U.S. have not 
been identified -- so Easterbrook cannot know that new sources of 
exposure have been eliminated. EPA says forest fires are a minor 
source of dioxin and even that minor source may be caused not by 
nature but by industrial releases of chlorine settling onto the 
leaves of trees. The largest study of dioxin and human health 
found a 46 percent increased hazard of cancer among workers whose 
exposure lasted at least a year and began at least 20 years ago 
(thus allowing the cancer latency period to run its course) -- 46 
percent is not a "slight" increase by anyone's reckoning. True, 
dioxin is a chlorinated chemical, as is table salt. However, 
dioxin is only in the "same family" as table salt in the sense 
that an AK-47 and a pea shooter are in the same family -- both can 
be used as weapons.

<DT>DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
<P>
<DD>What does a city in a severe financial crisis do to save money? 
It cuts its curbside recycling program. But just for a few weeks, 
until it gets hauled to court by the Sierra Club. Then it 
suspends the program again, arguing that collecting recyclables 
is costing too much. In mid-June, the District's curbside 
recycling program was underway again, with the contractor doing 
the job without costing the city a cent for the rest of the fiscal year. 
The curbside recycling program, which began in 1992, 
reportedly lost $2 million since its inception. The Sierra Club 
contends that if the program was run properly, it would produce 
badly needed revenues for the city coffers. Meanwhile, questions 
are arising over why the company that has the recycling contract 
with the District got it in the first place. Another recycling 
firm that initially got the highest marks in the contract 
selection process is suing the city saying it should have won the 
bid in 1992. This morass is journaled in a series of articles 
that appeared during April, May, and June in the <EM>Washington Post  </EM>
and in a Washington weekly alternative, <EM>City Paper.</EM> A number of 
<EM>Post</EM> reporters -- Hamil R. Harris, Michael A. Fletcher, and Linda 
Wheeler -- at different times have covered the day-to-day status of 
curbside recycling in the District. <EM>City Paper's</EM> anonymous "Loose 
Lips" column is tracking the political (and legal) arguments over 
the alleged contracting irregularities. Loose Lips has also 
reported that freelance recyclers are picking up some of the 
materials from curbside bins in the early mornings before the 
official contractor arrives. <EM>Post</EM> articles are available via 
Nexis. Contact the <EM>Post</EM> D.C. Metro department at (202) 334-7300.

<DD>Crime takes a bite out of the environment, according to an 
article by Paul Ruffins in the April 1995 <EM>Green Calendar and 
Environmental News Digest.</EM> Ruffins argues that fear of assault 
crimes such as rape, robbery and murder threaten the environment 
"by forcing people to make lifestyle choices that poison the 
Earth and consume more sources." Instead of walking or bicycling 
or even using public transit, people opt for private cars and 
taxis. Merchants overpackage goods to deter theft. He contends 
that the biggest environmental impact of crime is to drive people 
out of the city to suburbs and rural areas. There, people are 
often forced into dependence on automobiles. And flight from 
cities spurs development of woodlands and farmlands. Ruffins, an 
African American environmentalist, is writing a book about the 
black community's response to crime. He can be reached at (202) 
296-9626. Copies of the <EM>Green Calendar,</EM> a four-page monthly 
broadsheet which lists environmental events throughout the 
greater Washington area, are available by calling the Metro D.C. 
Environmental Network at (202) 544-5125.

<DD>The Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint navigational waterway is 
handling less than one-third its projected traffic and is among 
the nation's most subsidized river systems, the <EM>Columbus (Ga.) 
Ledger-Enquirer</EM> reported in April. Once projected to handle 1.8 
million tons a year by 1990, the waterway's cargo numbers topped 
off at 1.2 million tons in 1985 and dropped to less than half 
that amount by 1993. Taxpayers spent 225 times more per ton-mile 
on the waterway than they did on the Lower Mississippi. An internal 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers study found that  to handle barge 
traffic, such relatively small rivers must be dredged, dammed and 
otherwise manipulated, the <EM>Ledger-Enquirer's</EM> Ken Edelstein 
reported. With a budget squeeze at the Corps and new 
environmental restraints on river projects, small waterways could 
be targeted for cutbacks or privatization. But a coalition of 
farmers, agribusinesses and barge operators had fought off 
similar efforts in the past. The environmental issues aren't 
simple either: water releases for navigation help maintain the 
health of Apalachicola Bay, Fla., an important fishery. And a 
major Corps study on water supply, which could influence growth 
patterns from Atlanta to the Florida panhandle, assumes that 
navigation will continue indefinitely. For more information,

<DD>In the competition for complex environmental stories, the 
recovery of Snake River salmon ranks way at the top. The science

make the subject understandable, the <EM>Spokesman-Review</EM> (Spokane, 
WA) started by asking readers what they wanted to know about the 
issue. They were invited to call the newspaper and leave a 
recorded question. The response was enthusiastic. Readers wanted 
to know such things as why channels aren't just being built 
around the dams to help salmon downstream, and if it weren't true 
that ocean drift nets are killing most of the salmon. A 
question-and-answer story by Julie Titone was published March 26. An 
adjoining page produced by Titone and artist Warren Huskey 
carried a map, chronology and explanation of the newly released 
draft version of the federal recovery plan for the fish. For

Toronto-based Horsham, was recently hit with a 52-page lawsuit in 
which the Illinois attorney general alleges dozens of pollution 
violations at the refinery since early 1994, including some the

Packard and Betz, whose forte is restoring prairies and savannas. 
The Nature Conservancy alone has been active in recruiting 
several thousand volunteers throughout the state to restore sites 
in metropolitan corridors. Restoration -- as opposed to 
conservation -- is a carefully planned process that reduces 
non-native flora and encourages the growth of native plants and 
animal habitat. To date, the Illinois restoration sites have been 
a success and are models for restoration efforts across the 
continent. In a separate report, the Nature Conservancy found 
that northeastern Illinois -- Chicago and its "collar" counties -- is 
home to several endangered ecosystems (mostly wetlands and 
prairie/savannas) that are found nowhere else in the state. The 
report was in their most recent newsletter. Call (312) 346-8166.

the slow strangulation of some habitat, which environmentalist 
and biologists blame on the lock and dam system. Fruhling 
describes as a case study the huge fight over the Mel Price lock

have lived near the river and watched it change over the decades 
since the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers turned the Upper

<DD>A new requirement that took effect March 31 requiring 
inspections  of cesspool and septic systems before a home is sold 
is creating controversy in Massachusetts. Developed by the Mass. 
Department of Environmental Protection and called Title 5, the 
new regulation is designed to reduce the number of leaking septic 
systems which cause bacterial contamination to waterways and 
groundwater. The state says such pollution is fouling drinking 
water and causing people to become sick after swimming or eating 
contaminated clams. However, the rule has created a backlash of 
opposition because inspections can cost $1,000 and repairs can 
climb to $40,000. About 660,000 homes in the state have backyard 
septic systems and an estimated 21,000 are sold each year and 
must be inspected. A number of Massachusetts newspapers have been 
reporting on this issue. One excellent summary was written by 
Eric Niiler of the <EM>Patriot Ledger,</EM> (617) 786-7323.

<DD>You've heard of and probably written about some of the horror

stories and the <EM>Worcester Telegram & Gazette</EM> in May reported one. 
For years young children living in a group of rowhouses in 
Northbridge, Ma., were becoming lead poisoned, even though the 
state's tough lead law had forced landlords and homeowners to 
strip off paint inside many of the houses. The EPA in Boston did 
some testing and found soil levels up to 6,700 parts per million. 
Even though the site was never determined to be a Superfund site, 
EPA said that emergency Superfund money could be used. With very 
little red tape under the emergency status, testing, assessment 
and soil removal began and was expected to be finished in about 
two months. For more information, contact the writer, John 
Monahan, <EM>Worcester Telegram & Gazette,</EM> (508) 793-9172.

<P>
<DD>It has been a decade since the government embarked on a $19.5 
billion experiment: paying farmers across the country to set 
aside up to 40 million acres of their land for 10 to 15 years. 
Agriculture Department officials, who have enrolled 36.4 million 
acres of cropland in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), rave 
that it is one of their most successful efforts. They say it has 
saved fragile land and pleased both farmers and 
environmentalists. But critics, including several University of 
Minnesota researchers, say the CRP is another example of a 
federal program with noble aims that has been victimized by waste 
and abuse. They charge that the CRP has squandered billions of 
dollars by paying many farmers and land owners double or more the 
market rental rates to idle their land, hurt rural economies by 
limiting farming and undermined its own mission by giving farmers 
incentives to plow up new land. The <EM>Star Tribune</EM> of Minneapolis 
published a three-part series in late June. Contacts: Dean

<DT>NORTH DAKOTA
<P>
<DD>A North Dakota coal association says that Minnesota efforts to 
put a dollar value on various power plant air emissions "borders 
on the absurd" and threatens the future of a $1 billion industry. 
Minnesota is developing what are called "externality costs" that 
would place a price per ton on carbon dioxide, mercury and other 
pollutants from power plants. The costs would not be a tax, but 
rather a planning estimate that would be used to determined what 
kinds of power plants should be built in the future. The North 
Dakota Lignite Council opposes the costs, which they say will 
eventually raise consumer electric rates unnecessarily. But 
environmentalists say the pollutant prices will show the true

<DD>Cleveland <EM>Plain Dealer</EM> reporters T.C. Brown and Molly 
Kavanaugh broke a story in May that detailed the City of 
Cleveland's Division of Water's mishandling of mercury. Brown and 
Kavanaugh discovered that until August 1993, the Division didn't 
have a written policy for handling mercury spills and clean-ups. 
Mercury, used in manometers, was routinely transported in 
household containers in Division vans. Some spills, according to 
Division employees, were just washed into drains. Ultimately, 
four Division vans had to be destroyed due to mercury 
contamination. The price may have been much higher. The family of 
a deceased employee contends that his death was caused by 
exposure to mercury. He had worked with the manometers for years 
and had cleaned up a 50 to 70 pound spill that had occurred in 
his city van. Brown and Kavanaugh continue to cover developments 
as the deceased employee's home has tested positive for mercury 
contamination, his family has filed a suit against the City 
claiming negligence, and the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer 
District has found elevated levels of mercury in the sewers at 
the Division of Water's headquarters. Brown works out of the 
Columbus Bureau at (614) 228-8200. Kavanaugh, in the Lorain 
Bureau, can be reached at (800) 767-2821.

<DT>RHODE ISLAND
<P>
<DD>Five years ago the <EM>Providence Journal-Bulletin</EM> reported that 
environmentalists were so optimistic about their prospects for 
making change in the 1990s that they were calling this the Green 
Decade. This year, the <EM>Journal-Bulletin</EM> did a mid-decade report. 
In a broad survey of environmental trends in Rhode Island and to 
a lesser extent nationally and internationally, the newspaper 
concluded that there have been significant improvements in the 
environment. However, the mood for further change in the next 
five years is decidedly less upbeat. As the newspaper reported: 
"Environmental issues that remain to be solved are more 
complicated than originally perceived, money is becoming more 
difficult to find, there is greater distrust in government." The 
report was based on interviews with experts on a number of 
subjects -- air pollution, wildlife, waste -- along with summaries of 
what was found on each issue. Excerpts from three key interviews 
with U.S. Sen. John Chafee, the director of the state's 
environmental agency, and a Brown University scholar on the 
environment, were also included. The hope now is that the 
newspaper can do a similar report in another five years. For more 
information, contact Bob Wyss (401) 277-7364 or Peter Lord (401) 
737-3070 at the <EM>Journal-Bulletin.</EM>

<DD>In the May 28th edition of Memphis' <EM>Commercial Appeal,</EM> Tom 
Charlier reported that in many cases, state and federal agencies 
that destroy wetlands while developing public-works projects are 
not doing the mitigation required by the Clean Water Act, or the 
mitigation is improperly done and never corrected. Commercial 
developers appear to have a better track record than the 
government on wetlands compensation, perhaps because they hire 
private consultants to help them do it right. Contact Charlier at 
(901) 529-2572. 
<P>
<DD>At the 70-acre Hollywood Dump, a notorious Memphis Superfund 
site contaminated by pesticides from Velsicol Chemical Company, 
fish in a dredge pond were deliberately killed as part of an $8 
million cleanup effort. EPA had determined that the fish 
contained unacceptably high levels of pesticides, posing a threat 
to the low-income residents nearby who often fished in the pond. 
Cleanup officials were impressed with the healthy "size, 
abundance, and diversity" of the erstwhile fish population. 
Residents, disgruntled by the loss of their favorite fishing 
hole, hurled insults at cleanup workers and vandalized their 
equipment, as reported by Tom Charlier in the <EM>Commercial Appeal</EM> 
June 13th.

<DT>WEST VIRGINIA
<P>
<DD>Through a series of Freedom of Information Act requests, Ken 
Ward Jr. of the <EM>Charleston Gazette</EM> revealed that scientists from 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency believed Corridor H, a 
highway from Central West Virginia through national forest lands 
to Washington, D.C., would be an environmental disaster. The 
<EM>Gazette</EM> investigated after allegations that EPA Region III 
Administrator Peter Kostmayer was fired for his opposition to the 
highway project, which has the support of Sens. Robert C. Byrd 
and Jay Rockefeller. A series of stories published by the <EM>Gazette</EM> 
showed EPA reports on the road were watered down after complaints 
from Byrd and Rockefeller. For copies of the stories, call Ward 
at (304) 348-1702. 
<P>
<DD>Several West Virginia newspapers have reported extensively on 
efforts to clean up acid mine drainage problems on the Cheat 
River, a prime whitewater rafting stream in the northern part of 
the state. State and federal agencies are teaming up with private 
industry on the project, which gained momentum when the group 
American Rivers Inc. listed the Cheat as among the 10 most 
endangered rivers in the nation. For more information or copies 
of stories, call Lee Chotiner of the <EM>Morgantown Dominion Post</EM> at 
(304) 292-6301 or Rick Steelhammer of the <EM>Charleston Gazette</EM> at 
(304) 348-5169. 
<P>
<DD>Reports over the last two months have explored efforts by Gov. 
Gaston Caperton's administration to offer private industry 
lucrative leases on state public lands for oil and gas and timber 
purposes. The <EM>Dominion Post</EM> has reported on a now aborted plan to 
trade oil and gas drilling rights at Coopers Rock State Forest 
for a prime viewshed across from the forest. Chottiner reported 
about Caperton's reluctance to offer direct state support for 
buying the land across from Coopers Rock. The  first reported 
that Caperton's Division of Natural Resources refused to release 
its estimates of the value of oil and gas at the forest so the 
public could decide if the trade was a fair deal. Later, the 
Gazette also reported that Caperton wanted to trade $800,000 
worth of state-owned timber rights for a $300,000 piece of 
property that could be used as a National Guard shooting range. 
<P>
<DD>Paul Nyden, investigative report for the <EM>Charleston Gazette</EM>, 
has continued his series of stories showing that the West 
Virginia Tax Department's procedures for taxing coal and other 
natural resource properties are flawed. Call Nyden at (304) 
348-5164. 
<P>
<DD>Also, the <EM>Gazette</EM> and the <EM>Dominion Post</EM> have both profiled Eli 
McCoy, the new director of the West Virginia Division of 
Environmental Protection. McCoy succeeded David C. Callaghan, who 
retired this spring. Chottiner of the <EM>Dominion Post</EM> focused on 
McCoy's support for Corridor H, while the <EM>Gazette</EM> discussed 
environmental groups' misgivings about McCoy's willingness to 
stand up to industry. 
<P>
<DT>WISCONSIN
<P>
<DD>Environmental coverage has taken on a different look, as the 
<EM>Milwaukee Journal</EM> and <EM>Milwaukee Sentinel</EM> have merged news staffs 
to form the <EM>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.</EM> The new morning paper has 
an environment focus page each Tuesday, consisting of one lengthy 
feature from environment writer Don Behm and a round-up of 
environmental news from the past week. Behm and other staffers 
also cover breaking environmental stories on other days. For 
details, contact Behm at (414) 224-2000. 
<P>
<DD>News media in the Milwaukee area have generally cooperated with 
the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to publicize an air 
pollution reduction effort known as "Ozone Action Days." On days 
when the DNR believes conditions are right for the formation of 
high levels of harmful ozone, media are asked to help encourage 
local residents to use mass transit or carpool and reduce the use 
of gas and oil burning small engines. One conservative radio talk 
show host has questioned the value of the $180,000 effort. 
<P>
<DD>Environmental groups have asked the Wisconsin news media for 
"sound, reasoned reporting on the facts" about reformulated 
gasoline. That plea came after a Wisconsin telephone survey found 
the fuel is not causing health problems in the Milwaukee area. An 
earlier probe showed the fuel is not causing unexpected drops in 
gas mileage. Allegations of the new gas leading to dramatically 
lower mileage and poor health were the focus of many media 
stories earlier this year. Wisconsin is still looking at the 
complaints of about 1,400 people who told health officials the gas 
makes them ill.</P>

<EM>By Amy Gahran</EM>
<P>
When it comes to reporting environmental news, is bigger better -- or
badder? How will Disney's ownership of ABC, Westinghouse's ownership
of CBS, Time-Warner's eventual ownership of CNN, and the absorption
of local papers into large chains affect coverage of pesticides,
global warming, endangered species, or the nuclear industry? 
<P>
Could beats be eliminated, &quot;tamed,&quot; or cut back due
to conflicts with owners' interests? Might there be new editorial
directives to steer clear of certain topics, sources, or angles?
In practical terms, what could corporate consolidation mean to
environmental journalists? 
<P>
Most media professionals and scholars agree that it is too early
to predict the consequences of consolidation precisely. They add
that impacts probably would vary widely in form and scope from
one news outlet to the next.
<P>
According to several journalism scholars, direct interference
with the news process is highly unlikely. Also, several environmental
reporters interviewed for this story have not experienced anything
remotely like this. 
<P>
&quot;The common conflict that people think of is that stories
about the environment tend to challenge the freedom of corporations
to act in ways that maximize profits,&quot; said Phil Shabecoff,
publisher of Greenwire and former environment reporter for the
<EM>New York Times.</EM> &quot;Regulations that restrict pollution, access
to resources, or land use are often antithetical to corporate
interests. The catch is that these companies not only are advertisers-some
now also own the media. That reasoning has some merit. But could
I give you a specific example of this affecting my own work? No.&quot;
He noted that Greenwire has been owned by <EM>The National Journal</EM>
(a Times-Mirror publication) for a few months, and so far the
new owners have made no attempt to change what Greenwire does
or how it's done.
<P>
What seems most likely is that fallout to the environmental beat
from corporate consolidation (if it occurs at all) would be gradual,
subtle, indirect, and difficult to attribute specifically to media
ownership. As with covering creeping environmental stories, journalists
will have to watch the beat very closely over the next few years
to see if any ownership-related changes materialize. 
<P>
&quot;Changes will take time and will appear gradually. Most of
us are in the middle of this issue and can't really see it,&quot;
noted Bob Griffin, Director of Marquette University's Center for
Mass Media Research. &quot;That isn't to say that changes to environmental
reporting related to consolidation of ownership are or are not
happening. Those kinds of changes would be tough to see unless
they were dramatic.&quot;
<P>
Dire predictions from media critics about the threat of &quot;media
monopolization,&quot; and the flurry of business activity surrounding
the Telecommunications Deregulation Act have increased public
consciousness about media consolidation somewhat. On June 3 <EM>The
Nation</EM> ran a 10-page cover story (&quot;Free the Media,&quot;
by Mark Crispin Miller) which discussed the scope and possible
sinister consequences of corporate consolidation in the media.
This article included a four-page foldout &quot;who-owns-who&quot;
schematic for four major U.S. media corporations, with commentary
from nearly 20 media critics and practitioners (a few of whom
disputed the assertion that media consolidation is a problem).
Also, the November/December issue of <EM>EXTRA!</EM> (the magazine of Fairness
and Accuracy in Reporting) contained a nine-article special report,
&quot;Mating Season: Consummating the Media Monopoly.&quot;
<P>
Censorship due to conflicts of interest between news departments
and other corporate holdings (such as environmental cleanup divisions)
is the most vivid and ominous potential consequence. This possibility
has almost Orwellian implications, and these are the issues most
commonly raised by concerned members of the public in letters
to the editor, Internet discussions, and public meetings on this
topic (such as a panel at the Conference on World Affairs, April
1995, at the University of Colorado, Boulder). However, despite
public concern, at the moment there appears to be little actual
risk of this particular problem -- at least in terms of environmental
reporting.
<P>
In general, media professionals are not as concerned as the public
about direct conflicts between news ethics and corporate interests.
&quot;I think that people exaggerate the ability of corporations
to act in a cohesive, conspiratorial way. I don't see that,&quot;
said Peter Page, staff writer with the <EM>Trenton (NJ) Times.</EM> &quot;My
paper is one of many owned by the Newhouse family, but it has
no bearing on my work that I'm employed by this huge organization.
I think there's this kind of unspoken fear in many professions,
including journalism, that our relationship to corporations somehow
supplants our idea of being citizens, that who we work for is
more important than our normal civic roles.&quot;
<P>
Most journalism scholars, critics, and practitioners agree that
all media corporations are not equal. The extent that environmental
news could be affected by corporate takeovers may depend partly
on what kind of corporation is taking over. According to Ben Bagdikian,
media scholar and author of <EM>The Media Monopoly,</EM> whenever a news
organization is bought by or merged into a company that is not
primarily a news organization, there is a potential direct conflict
of interest. &quot;Some industrial corporations that own media
companies have other business units that may not be crazy about
getting environmental coverage,&quot; Bagdikian said. &quot;It's
conceivable that in those situations there could be a shift toward
backing off on coverage that involves divisions or subsidiaries
of the parent company, or on certain environmental issues altogether.&quot;
However, he noted that when media or communications companies
acquire news outlets, it's more likely that such conflicts would
arise with business or entertainment news than with environmental
news. (In fact, this is widely purported to be the case with <EM>TV
Guide</EM> since it was purchased by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.)
<P>
In reality, self-censorship is the most likely way that reporters
would begin to favor the interests of corporate owners, according
to Karl Grossman, professor of journalism at the State University
of New York. &quot;In the US, the central committee doesn't issue
a party line,&quot; he said. &quot;There are no in-house censors
actively manipulating news. The real issue for reporters will
be the sin of omission. Items that 'rock the boat' too much won't
make it into stories in the first place, so they won't have to
be edited out or toned down. A reporter for CBS (now owned by
Westinghouse) probably will just know -- without being told directly -- that
when doing nuclear stories, he or she should be especially careful.&quot;
<P>
The problem with proving or disproving such statements is that
hard evidence of self-censorship (or any other kind of censorship)
related to media ownership, is virtually impossible to find -- if
indeed it exists at all. This is especially true regarding the
recent spate of high-profile mergers and acquisitions of broadcast
and cable networks. Consolidation of media ownership is only one
of many current transformations in the news business, making it
difficult to attribute changes in the news specifically to changes
in ownership, even in part.
<P>
The organization of some media can be a complicating factor that
makes it difficult to isolate ownership issues. For instance,
reporter Carl Stevens of KEPR (the local CBS affiliate for the
region near the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Richland, WA) claims
that the 1995 Westinghouse takeover of CBS has had &quot;no effect
whatsoever&quot; on his station's continuing coverage of environmental
and other issues related to Hanford. (Westinghouse is the primary
contractor for the Hanford cleanup.) Stevens did note, though,
that KEPR is a CBS affiliate, and is not owned and operated by
CBS (unlike some CBS stations in major markets). &quot;Our local
news operation is almost entirely independent,&quot; he said,
&quot;but I can't say whether that's true for all CBS stations
and affiliates.&quot;
<P>
Some TV news professionals report that potential conflicts of
interest are less of a concern when the new parent company is
primarily an entertainment/communications firm with a good track
record for its other news operations. &quot;Am I particularly
worried about our environment beat as a result of this merger?
No,&quot; said Peter Dykstra head of CNN's Environment Unit, regarding
the impending purchase of Turner Broadcasting by Time-Warner.
&quot;Time-Warner has established its own reputation for environmental
coverage. That makes me worry less.&quot; 
<P>
However, his own situation aside, Dykstra is concerned about this
general issue. &quot;The concerns are getting bigger, and they
are much on everyone's mind. There is no guarantee that bigger
is better, and there certainly are reasons to be concerned that
(being owned by a larger corporation) would alter news coverage,&quot;
he said. &quot;I think the idea of autonomy and independence of
news operations is what's threatened, especially with increasing
bottom-line pressures. However, proof of this would be hard to
come by.&quot;
<P>
Since Disney bought ABC, &quot;We've continued to do a tremendous
amount of environmental coverage.&quot; said Bob Aglow, National
Editor for Environmental Coverage at ABC News. &quot;I understand
that at Disney's highest levels, there's a great deal of environmental
concern. At ABC we've certainly never gotten any signal that our
environmental coverage will diminish.&quot; Erin Hayes, a reporter
with ABC News, concurs but adds a note of caution. &quot;The environmental
stories I've pitched lately have been enthusiastically received,&quot;
she said. &quot;I suspect there won't be any changes from Disney,
but I could be proved wrong.&quot;
<P>
Among journalists, a far more immediate threat to environmental
coverage is simply increasing pressure to improve the corporate
bottom line. This factor sometimes comes into play during media
mergers and acquisitions -- although it has become a simple fact
of life throughout most of the news industry. Generally, bottom-line
pressures increase when there is some kind of a change in corporate
culture or priorities -- which may or may not coincide with a change
of ownership. 
<P>
Some environmental journalists claim the &quot;remoteness&quot;
of corporate management presents problems for the beat. &quot;I
do think there is an indirect-but very real-impact of conglomerating
ownership,&quot; said David Ropeik, a reporter with Boston TV
station WCVB, who claims he's doing less environmental reporting
lately. &quot;As I see it, the kinds of stories that I used to
do were mostly local, responsible kinds of stories -- which doesn't
fit the pattern of what consultants recommend for TV news content.
If you have local people running a local station, they're more
attuned to local stories. But to the degree that any news outlet
is steered in what it does by corporate bosses, I think that portends
poorly for the environment beat.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Remote management&quot; also may put in place policies that
fail to take into account differences among beats. At Knight-Ridder,
one policy designed to encourage more locally-oriented &quot;public
journalism&quot; backfired recently when it came to environment
reporting at the <EM>Columbus (GA) Ledger-Enquirer.</EM>
<P>
This paper introduced a new system of editorial &quot;expectations,&quot;
which effectively were weekly story quotas, according to Ken Edelstein,
former environment reporter for the <EM>Ledger-Enquirer</EM> (currently
senior writer with <EM>Creative Loafing,</EM> an Atlanta alternative weekly).
&quot;The number of stories (four per week) wasn't all that burdensome,&quot;
recounted Edelstein. &quot;The point was to get more local news
stories bylined by staff writers, to get us more involved with
the community. But the problem was having that expectation every
week, and never being able to drop below it. That meant more emphasis
on event-driven stories -- which are quicker hits, and which aren't
necessarily the best way to cover the environment. I think it
hampered true enterprise reporting. The fact is that if an environmental
reporter is doing his or her job right, that person won't put
out the same number of stories in a year as a police reporter.&quot;
<P>
Edelstein contends that, in general, the relative remoteness of
corporate media management can lead to the creation of editorial
policies with relevance problems. &quot;Once you start working
under what is essentially an echo of a corporate policy, a certain
unreality sets in,&quot; he said. &quot;While we were trying to
satisfy buzzwords, our essential work got pushed 
back behind those corporate buzzwords and platitudes.&quot;
<P>
Ultimately, the most basic bottom-line concern of any news organization
is how much it costs to fill the news hole. When, for a example,
a newspaper chain acquires a paper (or when a paper is trying
to improve its financial attractiveness before putting itself
up for sale), there often are new budgetary pressures and cutbacks.
This can mean that papers offer smaller raises or are slow to
fill vacancies -- factors that affect all beats, but especially &quot;specialty&quot;
beats like environment reporting. However, such problems also
can result from problems unrelated to ownership, such as a rapid
rise in newsprint costs.
<P>
Dykstra points out that environmental reporting is especially
cumbersome and expensive for TV journalists. &quot;If a reporter
from the <EM>New York Times</EM> wanted to cover an environment story in
the Rockies, he probably could do that by phone or fly out there
himself. I'd have to arrange to transport at least a three- or
four-person crew and a ton of equipment. Often that governs what
stories we end up doing.&quot;
<P>
A great deal of environmental reporting involves investigative
journalism -- which typically is one of the most expensive types
of journalism a news organization supports. Bagdikian believes
it is possible that, particularly at newspapers, environmental
reporting could be cut back due to the cost of investigative reporting.
<P>
Rae Tyson, environment editor for <EM>USA Today,</EM> believes that (at
least at some papers) economic decisions are driving a decrease
in investigative environmental reporting-but indirectly. &quot;At
some papers, litigation costs are a substantial expense. That
can end up affecting editorial policy,&quot; he said. &quot;The
way it happens is not that management says 'Gee, you shouldn't
do investigative projects,' but rather 'Gee, the paper didn't
make as much money last year, and look at what your litigation
costs were.' Then, some editors may start taking a closer look
at what kinds of stories lead to litigation.&quot;
<P>
However, Rosemary Armao, executive director of Investigative Reporters
and Editors (IRE), reports no evidence of a drop in investigative
journalism. &quot;We haven't looked at environmental reporting
in particular, but we have no objective measure that investigative
reporting in general has decreased,&quot; she said. &quot;In fact,
this year the number of entries in our investigative reporting
contest was very high -- and one of the big winners was an environmental
story.&quot;
<P>
Research shows that one significant, direct problem caused by
consolidation of ownership, at least for newspapers, is not whether
news is censored or &quot;spun,&quot; but rather who gets the
news at all. Phil Tichenor, professor emeritus of journalism and
mass communication at the University of Minnesota, and two of
his colleagues found that when locally-owned papers become part
of a chain, typically coverage of local controversy decreases,
and rural circulation is cut back. (This research was conducted
in the 1980s and involved rural newspapers in Minnesota.) 
<P>
&quot;We found that when papers became part of a chain, they usually
redefine their editorial commitment to focus on the larger metro
area -- especially on metro business news,&quot; Tichenor said. For
example, this happened with the <EM>Des Moines Register.</EM> &quot;It
had been the only paper that reached every corner of Iowa,&quot;
Tichenor recounted. &quot;When Gannett took over that paper, it
closed the eastern bureaus and made statements that it wanted
to concentrate on the Des Moines metro area. That left a lot of
people in the eastern part of Iowa without a major daily covering
local news.&quot;
<P>
Often, at the same time, &quot;Circulation in remote rural areas
papers gradually is cut back or abandoned,&quot; Tichenor continued.
&quot;Publishers have said they can't afford distribution way
out there in the boonies -- advertisers just aren't willing to pay
for that. As a result, many rural areas are left high and dry
in terms of availability of big-city papers. Rural stores get
very few copies.&quot;
<P>
However, Tichenor thinks it may be possible that in some ways
newspaper consolidation may nurture the environment beat. Earlier
research showed that specialized writers (like environment writers
or science writers) tend to exist mainly in bigger media, he said.
Unlike independent papers or small newspaper groups, larger chains
have sufficient capital resources to support specialized bureaus
or reporters that can serve more than one paper. &quot;One could
speculate that consolidation by itself would make it more likely
that there would be more specialized writers of any kind, including
environmental,&quot; Tichenor said. &quot;Whether that pans out,
though, is another proposition.&quot;
<P>
Tichenor's contentions could have some interesting implications.
&quot;There's the whole issue of ecology and environmental protection
being a major concern of people in metro and suburban areas -- but
not to most people in rural areas. Add to that the fact that,
in terms of newspaper circulation, metro vs. rural areas are a
classic example of information haves and have-nots.&quot; The
metro-rural &quot;information gap,&quot; coupled with a lack of
inclusion of rural issues and viewpoints in many major media,
could exacerbate conflicts and hostility between urban and rural
populations over issues such as grazing or use of recreational
areas, he observed.
<P>
Stepping back to look at the big picture, Griffin of Marquette
University speculated that over time, ownership-influenced changes
in the environment beat might occur in a way invisible to individual
reporters -- a matter of how the beat evolves in general, rather
than whether specific reporters' jobs are affected. 
<P>
&quot;This may be a trend that affects primarily less-established
journalists, or media outlets that don't have an established environment
beat,&quot; said Griffin. &quot;Where environmental reporters
already are in place, it probably would take a major shift of
some type to dis-establish the beat. That's not very likely. There
are all sorts of reasons why change would not come quickly for
reporters who have been on the beat for awhile. The most significant
long-term effects might surface in places where the environment
beat hasn't already been established -- like on smaller papers, where
it's covered by reporters who also cover other beats.&quot;
<P>
Griffin thinks it may be possible that over time assignments at
such organizations might focus less on the environment and more
on recreation. Or it could happen that gradually environment stories
may arise more by editorial assignment, rather than reporters'
enterprise work. &quot;It will be interesting to see what happens
with new hires over the next few years,&quot; he continued. &quot;What
are editors telling them with regard to environmental coverage?
What do they sense about directions they can take to get ahead
in the organization? That's where the uncertainty is. And unfortunately,
if this happens, the affected reporters probably would not be
aware of the change -- simply because they are new.&quot; This view
resonated strongly with many journalists interviewed for this
story.
<P>
What can be done by environmental journalists who are concerned
that corporate consolidation could impair the beat? At this point,
there appear to be few proactive options. Most journalists recommend
watching the beat closely over time, perhaps with some informal
benchmarking.
<P>
Awards for environmental reporting can help enhance the profile
of the beat with editors and management-though this is by no means
a given. This year, the <EM>Raleigh (NC) News and Observer</EM> won a Pulitzer
Prize for an investigative environmental story. &quot;That definitely
helped, but it should have helped more,&quot; said Stuart Leavenworth,
environmental reporter at that paper. &quot;So far, I'm still
the only full-time environment reporter at this paper. We could
use another one.&quot;
<P>
Joseph Turow, a professor at the Annenberg School of Communications
(University of Pennsylvania) strongly recommends independent benchmarking
studies of environmental journalism. &quot;It's almost impossible
to prove that coverage changes without good solid studies,&quot;
he said. Such data would be invaluable in examining the many factors
affecting environmental journalism, including corporate consolidation,
he said.
<P>
Griffin noted that the act of observation could affect what is
observed. &quot;As long as reporters and editors are alert to
this issue, that could help,&quot; he said.<BR>

<P>
<EM>By Bill Belleville</EM>
<P>
I am under 60 feet of frigid sea water, just off the rocky coast
of Isla Santiago in the Galapagos Islands, being buffeted by tricky
equatorial crosscurrents. A school of barracuda moves by, all
teeth and silvery fins, reflecting rays of sunlight like a prism
ball from a 70s disco movie. The barracuda disappear, replaced
by a massive hammerhead, primal and intent on things known only
to other hammerheads.
<P>
I drop down another 30 feet, to where Dr. John McCosker, a noted
Galapagos ichthyologist, is searching for yet another new species
of reef fish. As I settle next to him at the base of volcanic
rubble, he hands me a clear plastic collection bag, indicating
that I should hold it open. As I do, he herds into it a small
horn shark, a slender animal half the length of my forearm.
<P>
Welcome to a work day as an internet reporter in the Galapagos
Islands, where for one month I became -- quite literally -- immersed
in my assignment as a writer and photographer. I did so on behalf
of the Discovery Channel and their World Wide Web site, <A HREF="http://www.discovery.com/">Discovery
Channel Online (DCO).</A> My office was on board an oceanographic
ship, the Research Vessel (R/V) <EM>Seward Johnson,</EM> chartered from
Harbor Branch Oceanographic back in the U.S. My field work was
done in the briny deep.
<P>
The ship was serving as a platform for four weeks of scientific
exploration in the Galapagos, to help the four veteran scientists
aboard &quot;go where Darwin had never been.&quot; They would
do so via scuba gear and a 3,000-foot deep diving submersible.
A lone terrestrial biologist worked part-time on land, carefully
troweling up fossils imbedded in the sediment of isolated lava
tube caves and bringing them aboard ship for evaluation. Results
included the discovery of new species of fish and invertebrates,
and the development of new theories about evolutionary biology
in the cold waters 600 miles off the South American coast.
<P>
Hours of topside film and underwater videotape would be shot,
and edited into a two-hour documentary that would be first shown
on the Discovery Channel this summer as &quot;Galapagos: Beyond
Darwin.&quot; My assignment was to follow the expedition as closely
as possible, but not so close that I got in the way of filming
or interfered with the actual field science.
<P>
For a solid month I wrote daily essays and took digital photographs
that in some way evoked the experience. In addition, I helped
the scientists field questions that came in almost every day on
the Bulletin Board System (BBS) from users of the Web site. The
actual writing was done in a rabbit warren of a work station aboard
an ever-rocking ship, in a tight cubby behind a console of high-tech
gear where my laptop commandeered a few precious square feet of
counter space. Usually, it came at the end of an exciting but
fatiguingly long day, with hours spent hiking on land, inside
lava tube caves, underwater in dive gear, or bouncing about in
a small inflatable boat. Twice, I rode along in a shoe box compartment
aboard the Johnson SeaLink submersible as it descended some 3,000
feet into the unknown darkness of the sea floor.
<P>
Meanwhile, thousands of miles and one satellite-bounce away, my
daily uploaded package of essays, photos, and BBS answers were
posted. Laid out inside a fancy design on the Web site, they provided
ever-changing daily pages of an interactive electronic magazine.
<P>
If this sounds like cutting edge journalism, it was. The Net's
World Wide Web and its electronic journalism are still new to
most of us. Of the 26 million internet users (at this writing),
half signed on in 1995. At the end of 1995 there were 130,000
Web &quot;homepages&quot; and they are increasing at the rate
of 100 a day. As a result, there's lots of literary road kill
on this information superhighway. But there's excitement here,
too, and room for expression not found in conventional media.
<P>
On the Discovery site, for instance, a user can click on any of
several originally-produced themed stories in Nature, Science,
Exploration, History, etc. Except for longer &quot;Specials,&quot;
like the Galapagos, stories are changed every two weeks. Each
story leads to other hypertext links, which are screens with related
information, inside or outside of the Discovery site. Sometimes
snippets of audio and video can be downloaded, along with color
photos.
<P>
Despite the bucks the Discovery Channel was investing in its web
presence, and despite the acclaim its site was already earning
from 'net reviewers, this was the first time it had attempted
&quot;real time&quot; field reporting from a scientific expedition.
I was R&amp;D, pilot project, and commercial application all rolled
into one, equipped with technology I had just been introduced
to in a Cliff Notes version of a training session in a brief visit
to Discovery Channel offices. A veteran print media reporter and
writer who used to curse every time he tripped over a TV power
cable at a press conference, I found myself mortaring the bricks
of my very own paradigm of &quot;electronic&quot; journalism.
Suddenly I was as electronically wired as any writer's ever been.
<P>
When things went wrong at sea, I could get e-mail-borne advice.
But it was generally up to me to make it all better, jerryrigging
the electronics when necessary, working around brutal deadlines
and turning out daily copy that was supposed to be evocative,
educational, and accurate. All the while, I lived in close quarters
with a busy 35-man crew that included scientists, filmmakers,
ship technicians, Ecuadorian government observers, and other folks
I had never seen before in my life. Self-absorption, that malaise
of creative thinking, was a luxury none of us could afford. Virtually
overnight my mantra went from, &quot;I'm a private person who
likes my space,&quot; to &quot;Whatever happens, I'll learn from
it.&quot;
<P>
Foremost in my learning experiences was the realization that when
you travel with a film crew, you never travel light. Every movement,
from plane to tarmac to truck to dinghy to ship, required the
transfer of almost two tons of gear, about 70-odd cases. The most
fearful was a tiny breadbox-sized case labeled &quot;Danger.&quot;
Lead ballast for the camera boom, it could take even the most
fit of us by surprise if we approached it without respect.
<P>
But the physical aspect of the expedition was the least of my
concerns. Even the cramped four-man &quot;worker bee&quot; room
I shared with three of the film crew could be factored into my
new &quot;learning&quot; equation. More tricky were the relationships
with the scientists aboard. All eminent in their field, they had
already made peace with the notion of having their expedition
underwritten by a commercial television channel. (As Dr. Bruce
Robison of the Monterey Bay Aquarium told me: &quot;Financing
of science doesn't come easy these days, especially anything in
the field.&quot;) However, that bargain didn't include a last-minute
add-on from the Web site, a presence none of them was even aware
of until barely a week before the trip itself.
<P>
Although not a hard science reporter, I had spent enough time
with scientists -- mostly marine biologists -- in the field overseas
to feel comfortable. But on those trips the article or series
of articles were written after my return, when I had a chance
to research other sources and double-check facts. Here, on the
flash-point of exploration, far from the data bases each scientist
could use to confirm the taxonomy of daily encounters with the
deep, no one was eager to over-commit themselves to &quot;new
discoveries&quot;.
<P>
Even quotes, which could be later edited out from the post-production
film process, could take new and terrifying forms if removed from
context. That bizarre-looking Stylephoridae the sub just captured
from the sea bottom could be brand new to science, or it could
be old hat. Outside of a biomedical expedition, we were the first
to explore carefully the depths of these oceanic islands.
<P>
Also, answers to BBS questions posed by site users could be complex,
even time-consuming. This was not a floating press conference
where I could simply walk up to any scientist any time of the
day and fire a question at them. But the project worked because
the scientists took an interest in what I was doing. Indeed, if
I was included in the field expeditions off the ship at all, it
was not because of any perceived clout I had as a Discovery writer.
The interpersonal skills that any field journalist finds useful
were just as valuable as they've ever been, from the days when
Lowell Thomas reported from &quot;ships at sea&quot; and beyond.
For me, it was just as critical to know how to rig up my own dive
gear and handle myself in a small boat as it was to was to research,
write, and use computer technology.
<P>
In my daily &quot;Letters from the Galapagos,&quot; my task was
to keep my own point-of-view firmly intact, while remaining acutely
attuned to how my portrayal of others, and their science, would
play. I knew from the get-go that my closeness to the expedition
could quickly move me into the realm of advocacy. But I also couldn't
become a shill for either the science or the filmmaking.
<P>
So I approached the expedition from my perspective as a nature
writer, rather than a just-the-facts-ma'am reporter. Within that
context, I could evoke my own sense of awe while weaving descriptions
of natural history into the narrative of exploration. We all could
hint at scientific implications, and towards the end of the month-long
trip, even report the genesis of new theories. But the hard news
that historically marked field reporting wouldn't work here.
<P>
In addition to dive gear, my tools at sea were a MacIntosh Powerbook
laptop, a Apple-brand digital camera, a back-up hard drive (in
case the main drive crashed), and cables to connect the camera
to the computer. Thusly armed, at the end of each day I would
write my daily 900-word &quot;Letter,&quot; write and edit answers
to questions from users, write cutlines, and download each day's
photos from the digital camera into the laptop -- all using relevant
software for word processing and photo configuration.
<P>
When all was gathered into a neat electronic &quot;folder,&quot;
I would march with laptop to the captain's private office next
to the bridge. There, I plugged in the phone cord to the computer
modem, keyed in a special dial-up number back in the states, and
opened the software program that let me transfer the folder electronically
to that site. It was a system that worked well, if a bit sluggishly,
as long as the ship's stern didn't swing around to cut off the
satellite access.
<P>
Back in the U.S., a technical editor reviewed the folder data,
removed any bugs, and sent it along to the Discovery office. There,
early the next morning, the Nature editor gave it all a quick
review before shipping it to the art director. Sometime the next
morning, the entire package was posted on the Web site.
<P>
By then, of course, I was already underwater, writing hasty notes
on my dive slate about hammerheads and schools of barracuda and
little horn sharks being herded into a hand-held plastic bag.

<STRONG>Good reporting might curb U.S.-Mexican pollution<BR>
</STRONG>
<P>
<EM>By Karen Schmidt<BR>
</EM>
<P>
If there was an opening theme to the conference, &quot;Environmental
Health in the U.S.-Mexican Border Region,&quot; March 29-30, it
was that pollution and infectious diseases know no political boundaries.
If there was a closing lesson, it was that good journalism is
still an effective way of bringing social problems to public attention.
<P>
The two-day, bi-national meeting of epidemiologists, geographers,
community activists, government officials, and six SEJ fellows
in Tucson began with the understanding that environmental problems
along the 2,000-mile border affect both countries. After all,
water contamination created in Sonora spills into the Arizona
watershed, the people of El Paso and Ciudad Juarez breathe a mix
of air pollutants generated in both cities, and residents on both
sides of the border are exposed to the same infectious diseases.

<P>
Population in border cities is booming at a rate of 2.5 percent
per year, and the poorest neighborhoods -- the colonias -- grew by 34
per cent between 1992 and 1995. On the Mexican side, American-owned
manufacturers, known as maquiladoras, have provided jobs -- one reason
for the migration there. But the companies have not contributed
enough taxes to support the local infrastructure. Some conference
participants said the taxes are going straight to Mexico City,
rather than being used locally. The simplified scenario: lots
of people, lots of industrial pollution, and little investment
in public health measures, leading to serious environmental health
problems -- and little whistle-blowing. According to one conference
presenter, investigative journalism, particularly on the Mexican
side, is underdeveloped.
<P>
The biggest and most obvious threat to public health is sewage.
About 20 percent of residents on the U.S. side and about 40 percent
on the Mexican side have no sewer service. Many residents have
no source of clean drinking water. That raises the risk of oral-fecal
contamination of water and food, leading to easy transmission
of bacteria, viruses and parasites that cause diarrhea and other
diseases. James VanDerslice of the University of Texas at El Paso
reported on the increase in cases of hepatitis A. 
<P>
In 1995 he and his colleagues tested blood samples of El Paso
residents for hepatitis A antibodies and found that 65 percent
of teens 14 to 19 years old had been exposed, twice the exposure
rate when the same study was conducted in 1986. Today, they estimate,
89 percent of people 29 to 45 years old have been exposed to hepatitis
A. Linking other diseases with environmental exposures isn't as
easy. Although there are clusters of lupus and anencephalic births
and high rates of certain cancers in the region, many scientists
at the conference pointed out the difficulty of connecting these
health problems with any particular factor, such as chemical exposure.
In a transient population, they said, many factors conspire to
compromise health.
<P>
Better information about these problems will play a crucial role
in the border's future, said Susana Vidales, a Mexican journalist
and feminist with Grupo de Informacion en Reproduccion Elegida
in Hermosillo, Sonora. In her talk she voiced concern that there's
little or no investigative journalism in her country. 
<P>
Analyzing the Mexican press as a MacArthur Fellow for messages
about reproductive health and women, she found many health threats,
such as women's occupational exposures, were not addressed at
all. Top environmental problems cited, in order, were: contaminated
water, dust, and issues related to garbage (such as clandestine
burning). Women workers do face significant health risks in the
maquiladoras, but they only find out about them accidentally or
after-the-fact. The maquila industries do not properly educate
women employees about health risks, she said, although these women
have begun to publish their own newsletter.
<P>
Much of the reporting in the Mexican press, she found, contained
only the statements of government officials, with no follow-up
on their promises nor any discussion of what was occurring at
the grass-roots level. Vidales expressed great interest in bringing
together Mexican environmental journalists and SEJ members to
share information and learn from one another.
<P>
A Border Environmental Health Study by the Morris K. Udall Foundation,
sponsors of the conference through the University of Arizona's
Udall Center for Studies in Public Policy, reinforced the key
role that the media plays in informing the public on environmental
issues. The Foundation interviewed 800 adults on both sides of
the Arizona/Sonora border and found that 96 percent of the Sonorans
relied on mass media, primarily TV and radio, for environmental
information, compared with 53 percent of Arizonans. 
<P>
Despite the shortcomings of the Mexican press cited by Vidales,
Sonorans appear to be far more concerned than Arizonans about
environmental health issues, perhaps because of everyday experiences
with bad water, bad air, sewage, garbage, and illness. The Foundation's
study found that about 50 percent of the Sonorans interviewed
believed water pollution put their families at great risk, and
43 percent believed the same of air pollution. These rates were
half as high in Arizona.
<P>
Despite the tremendous public concern in Sonora, the Mexican legislature
appears to be moving toward relaxing the country's environmental
laws, according to Javier Diamant, Subdirector for Border Affairs
at SEMARNAP, Mexico's Ministry of the Environment. Of particular
concern, he said, is Mexico's lack of a right-to-know law requiring
companies to publicly reveal which hazardous materials they use
and how they dispose of them.
<P>
NAFTA could soon make life worse for border residents. According
to activist Domingo Gonzalez of the Texas Center for Policy Studies
in Brownsville, maquiladoras are beginning to move deeper into
Mexico, which means the border region may have to deal with its
massive pollution and weak infrastructure while losing its economic
base and grappling with high unemployment. It is crucial, he said,
that there be open discussion by government officials, scientists,
journalists, NGOs, and the public about what is happening along
the border. 
<P>
In the past, he said, poor communication led to suspicions of
cover-ups and conspiracies. Under NAFTA the Border Environment
Cooperation Commission (BECC) was created to foster exchange of
information with the public. So far, Gonzalez said, the BECC does
not appear to be up to the job.<BR>

When Fred Brown of the <EM>Denver Post</EM> commented &quot;Journalists

environmental journalist for the <EM>Salt Lake Tribune</EM> shot back,
&quot;My job is to respond to where the fires are burning, not
come up with solutions.&quot;
<P>
That was part of a lively discussion on how and why media cover
the environment, in a recent regional convention of the Society
of Professional Journalists at Utah State University in Logan.
Taking part in the proceedings was a panel of SEJ representatives,
organized by academic board member JoAnn Valenti of Brigham Young
University and including Woolf, John Hollenhorst (KSL-TV News,
Salt Lake City), and Jon Christensen (editor, <EM>Great Basin News</EM>).
The panel discussed the pros and cons of environmental coverage
to an audience of about 50 professionals and students. Utah State
University co-hosted the two-day conference with the theme &quot;Wilderness
Tomorrow? Covering the West.&quot;
<P>
Several natural resource experts set the tone in the opening presentation
by criticizing most media coverage in a panel entitled &quot;What
needs Covering.&quot; The SEJ panel then indulged in some introspection,
with Hollenhorst echoing Woolf's general call for more &quot;civility
and objectivity,&quot; but labeling wilderness issues &quot;the
Bosnia of BLM battles.&quot;
<P>
&quot;There are atrocities and war crimes on both sides,&quot;
Hollenhorst said, &quot;and the first casualty of war is truth.&quot;
<P>
Environment reporters need to slow down, calm down, ignore the
rhetoric, and talk to people, Christensen said.
<P>
Also at the conference, Rep. Jim Hansen (R-Utah) and David Simon
(Southwest Regional director for the National Parks and Conservation
Association) debated future park reforms, proposed entrance fee
increases, and the state of federal subsidies for park users.
<P>
&quot;We don't want to close any parks,&quot; Hansen said, &quot;but
not all parks are created equal.&quot; Recalling a Ross Perot-ism,
Hansen argued, &quot;the devil is in the details.&quot;
<P>
Hansen, now serving his eighth term in Congress, feels the media
have not treated him fairly. That's not the case, Hansen says,

<STRONG>SEJ board and believers meet to chart the future

<P>
<EM>By Emilia Askari, SEJ President
<P>
</EM>When the Society of Environmental Journalists held its first
conference in Boulder, Colorado, few could have imagined that
the group would grow so large so quickly. A charming gathering
of 200 scribblers met there nearly five years ago, out of a total
membership of some 600. From such modest beginnings an organization
of nearly 1,200 has blossomed.
<P>
This summer, the SEJ board is returning to Boulder for a July
26-29 meeting with a special twist. Along with elected members
of the board and staff, SEJ has invited members who want to be
among the Society's next generation of leaders. We envision this
meeting, hosted by the University of Colorado's Center for Environmental
Journalism, as both a training session for future board members
and a chance for current board members to get feedback and advice.
<P>
Any member is welcome to attend, and SEJ has extended partial
travel fellowships to more than a dozen who responded to an earlier
mailing. When that letter went out, we expected to hear from those
people who have invested a lot of effort in SEJ, perhaps by organizing
regional conferences or writing for the <EM>Journal.</EM> We heard from
some of those folks, but in addition we were delighted with the
response from other members who had not yet devoted major time
to the organization but who said they were eager to do so.
<P>
&quot;It's a great opportunity to get a lot of ideas on the table
to hear from people committed to SEJ and its future,&quot; said
SEJ vice president Tom Meersman of the <EM>Minneapolis Star Tribune,</EM>
who is chairing the leadership development retreat. &quot;I salute
them for taking the time to come and do this.&quot;

<P>
On the financial front, I am delighted to report that SEJ recently
won a two-year, $150,000 grant from the W. Alton Jones Foundation.
The amount was significantly higher than that requested by SEJ
Executive Director Beth Parke, an almost unheard-of phenomenon
in the competitive world of foundation funding.
<P>
SEJ has met a challenge grant from the Mott Foundation and soon
will receive another $25,000 installment from that foundation.
In addition, nearly 20 SEJ members have made personal donations
to the newly established endowment fund, which now has a balance
of over $1,000.
<P>
Because of these funding successes, SEJ's Philadelphia staff has
moved to a new, more spacious office this summer and will add
a new staff position: programs manager. If you are interested
in the job, please contact the SEJ office at (215) 836-9970 for

<P>
The last board meeting of the year will be during the annual conference

<P>
Amy Gahran's otherwise flattering review of our book, <EM>Toxic Sludge
Is Good For You: Lies, Damn Lies and the Public Relations Industry,</EM>
unfortunately repeats a false charge against us by journalist
Don Behm. We note that in 1982 Maryland banned sales of Milwaukee's
sewage sludge fertilizer 'Milorganite.' Behm claims that we and
a colleague of his at the <EM>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,</EM> Michael
Zahn, are &quot;wrong&quot; in reporting this fact.
<P>
In truth, Behm is wrong. Sales of Milorganite were banned in Maryland
from August 1982 until April 19, 1983, when Milwaukee legally
agreed to place special labels on its sludge sold there, and to
monitor its level of cadmium.
<P>
Behm first made his false charge last November. Since then we
have further buttressed the veracity of our claim through an extensive
open records investigation of Milwaukee's files. We will gladly
supply this documentation to interested parties who contact us
at (608) 233-3346, or at <A HREF="mailto:74250.735@compuserve.com">74250.735@compuserve.com.</A><BR>

<STRONG><A NAME = "sej1">Regional gigs on the upswing:</A></STRONG>
<BR>
<STRONG>SEJ members are meeting locally for work and play<BR>
</STRONG>
<P>
<EM>By Rae Tyson</EM>
<P>
Nam Viet is a restaurant in the heart of an ethnically diverse
neighborhood along the western edge of Arlington, Va. On any given
night, the can't-miss combination of good food, generous servings
and ice cold beer attracts an interesting blend of Vietnamese
families and young Washington, D.C., area professionals.
<P>
Yes, this is the <EM>SEJournal.</EM> By now, you are probably wondering
what a Vietnamese restaurant has to do with environmental journalism.
<P>
Quite a bit, actually. For several months, Washington, D.C.-area
SEJ members have gathered monthly at Nam Viet to talk shop, share
story ideas and socialize. They also use the informal gatherings
as an opportunity to plan other regional events, which have included
newsmaker dinners and breakfasts, seminars, and full-day conferences.
<P>
Though the Washington region may well be SEJ's most active, it
certainly isn't unique. As SEJ grows, the number and variety of
regional activities continues to increase. &quot;It's been very
encouraging,'' says Tom Meersman, a <EM>Minneapolis Star Tribune</EM> reporter
and SEJ vice president who helps coordinate regional events.
<P>
Indeed, at least eight of the 13 SEJ regions have had at least
one event in the past two years; some have hosted several. And
new volunteers with fresh ideas and energy are stepping forward
to help with future events. To underscore the importance of regional
activities, the SEJ board is holding a leadership conference this
summer at the University of Colorado. The seminar is designed
to help and encourage regional SEJ volunteers.
<P>
&quot;Organizing an event takes a lot of hard work but, in the
end, it is worth it,'' says Heather Conway, a reporter for 

<EM>The Madison Press</EM> in London, Ohio. Conway and <EM>Columbus Dispatch</EM>
reporter Scott Powers helped organize an innovative regional conference
on river issues June 29 in Marietta, Ohio. (See page 16.) The
region includes SEJ members in Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky.
<P>
Conway says she got involved after attending an earlier regional
workshop. &quot;I kept telling Scott, 'We need to do another regional
conference.' So he said, `When are you going to get started?'''
<P>
The river conference organized by Powers and Conway even included
an afternoon field trip so reporters could get a first-hand look
at trouble spots in the Marietta area. The program ended with
a dinner with guest speaker Peter Kostmeyer, a former EPA regional
administrator who now heads Zero Population Growth.
<P>
June also was a busy month in other SEJ regions.
<P>
SEJ's first New York-area regional event was held June 14-15 at
Rutgers University in Piscataway, N.J. (See sidebar.) The co-sponsor
and host was the Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences
Institute (EOHSI) at Rutgers. The conference, &quot;Reporting
on the True Environmental Risks of the 1990s,&quot; was organized
by former <EM>E Magazine</EM> editor Will Nixon, Candace Botnick of the
institute, Peter Page of the <EM>Trenton Times</EM> and chaired by Ed Rodgers
of New Jersey Network PAGE 2 News. Speakers included a number
of prominent scientists. Among them: Theo Coburn, a World Wildlife
Fund scientist and co-author of <EM>Our Stolen Future,</EM> a new and controversial
book on environmental estrogens.
<P>
In Rhode Island, Jackleen de La Harpe of <EM>Maritimes,</EM> Peter Lord
of the <EM>Providence Journal</EM> and Geoff Oxnam of <EM>Sailing World</EM> teamed
up with University of Rhode Island scientists to stage a June
21 conference on coastal water quality issues.
<P>
At Michigan State, 25 journalists attended a three-day symposium
on Great Lakes issues. Organized by former SEJ President (and
current Michigan faculty member) Jim Detjen, speakers at the early
June event included prominent scientists and journalists. The
symposium was not all science and journalism however. Detjen even
organized a night out (complete with hot dogs and beer) to see
the local Lansing Lugnuts play the Beloit Snappers in a minor
league baseball game.
<P>
The busiest region has been in and around Washington, D.C., where
SEJ has a heavy membership concentration and a cadre of hard-working
volunteers. Led by Sara Thurin Rollin of the Bureau of National
Affairs and Peter Fairley of <EM>Chemical Week,</EM> the D.C. region this
year has hosted conferences on nuclear waste, pesticide regulations
and the new farm bill.
<P>
In addition to the monthly social gatherings at a local restaurant,
the re-gion co-hosted a March conference in Annapolis, Md., with
the Society of Professional Journalists and, in late May, worked
with the World Resources Institute on a half-day conference for
reporters covering the United Nations Habitat II conference in
Turkey. Plans this summer include a tour of Baltimore Harbor aboard
the Chesapeake Bay Foundation's research ship the Snow Goose.
<P>
Plans are also in the works for regional conferences elsewhere.
California members will hold a series of workshops on 
computer-assisted
reporting this fall. And members in Montana, Idaho and Washington
state are hoping to join with the Associated Press for a series
of seminars on property rights and wilderness issues.
<P>
The events in the Pacific Northwest will be the first for a region
that is hampered in part by the distances between SEJ members.
Remoteness also has been a factor in several other regions with
more scattered populations west of the Mississippi where events
have yet to be held. SEJ members with ideas and energy should
contact their regional coordinators. Names and phone numbers are
in the front of the membership directory. &quot;Don't be bashful,&quot;
says the <EM>Madison Press's</EM> Conway.
<P>
Beyond the July leadership seminar, Meersman says the SEJ board
also approved Executive Director Beth Parke's plan to hire another
staff member to help coordinate regional events. &quot;I think
that is going to help a great deal,&quot; says Meersman.
<P>
Meanwhile, SEJ members in Washington, D.C. on the last Thursday
of the month are invited to join other members for dinner. Don't
look for the Nam Viet Restaurant, however. This summer, the group
is meeting at Zorba's Cafe, a Greek restaurant near Dupont Circle
in the heart of Washington, D.C.<BR>

<STRONG><A NAME = "sej2">Anatomy of a toxic barrage</A></STRONG>
<P>
<EM>By Will Nixon<BR>
<P>
Editor's Note: Since Rae Tyson took a nationwide look at regional
meetings, here's a close-up of one productive session. See more
below.<BR>
</EM>
<P>
New Jersey has had a toxic year. A leaked report from the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency found dioxin in the local lobsters.
The port authority has stopped dredging much of the New York/New
Jersey harbor because of contaminated sediments, threatening the
future of the shipping industry. A cancer cluster has emerged
in the town of Toms River, although no one can explain why. 
<P>
All of these subjects and many others were discussed at the Mid-Atlantic
Regional Conference of the Society of Environmental Journalists
June 14 and 15, held at the Environmental and Occupational Health
Sciences Institute (EOHSI) at Rutgers University in Piscataway,
New Jersey. As conference chair, Ed Rodgers of NJN News, told
the opening session, the aim of the gathering was to help journalists
understand &quot;the real environmental risks&quot; that are present
amid public fears and scientific uncertainties.
<P>
Dr. Bernard Goldstein, the director of EOHSI, discussed the President's
Commission on Risk Assessment and Risk Management, which had released
its final report on June 13. A member of the Commission, Goldstein
reviewed their recommendations, including the need for the government
to adopt a more systematic approach than the current 
chemical-by-chemical regulatory strategy. 
<P>
Keynote speaker Theo Colborn, a senior scientist at the World
Wildlife Fund, discussed some of the issues raised in the recent
book that she has co-authored, <EM>Our Stolen Future,</EM> about the disruptive
impacts that chemicals have in the sexual development of animals.
She replied to some of the criticisms of the book, such as recent
reports that human sperm counts have not declined in recent decades,
by stating that these new studies are based on highly selective
groups of sperm donors. 
<P>
On Saturday, Dr. Herbert Needleman, a professor of pediatrics
and psychology at the University of Pittsburgh, reviewed his research
linking low levels of lead contamination in children with lower
IQs and, most recently, aggressive behavior.
<P>
About 80 people attended the conference, including panelists and
journalists from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and several
other states. The panel sessions discussed summer ozone pollution,
the effectiveness of pollution prevention programs, urban and
suburban ecology, and other important issues in the region. EOHSI
sponsored the conference as part of its tenth anniversary celebration.

</STRONG>
<P>
A June 29 regional SEJ conference in Marietta, Ohio, entitled
&quot;Whose river is it?&quot; opened with a challenge from Mary
Stoertz, head of the Monday Creek restoration project in southeastern
Ohio: define, for waterways, a public value that can be sold in
a bar in Nelsonville, Ohio.
<P>
Seventeen SEJ members and other journalists attended the Region
7 conference for Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia. They heard
talks on a greenways development program in Louisville, Ky, a
rivertown preservation effort in Sisterville, W. Va, and the lack
of comprehensive river strategies in the Clean Water Act. They
visited a contaminated wellfield, a federally-funded farm waste
management project, a sewage treatment plant using ultraviolet
light treatment, and a CERCLA cleanup, all near river banks.
<P>
Keynoter Peter Kostmayer, former congressman and maverick U.S.
EPA Region III administrator, closed by reiterating Stoertz's
challenge: strive to define universally-accepted public values
for rivers and streams.<BR>

Understanding pollution and New England's coastal environment
was the theme of a regional SEJ meeting June 21 at the University
of Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay Campus. Co-sponsored by SEJ
and URI's Graduate School of Oceanography, the daylong meeting
featured speakers from state and federal agencies, environmental
groups, fishermen's organizations, and URI. The conference drew
30 SEJ members and other writers and journalists from around New
England.
<P>
A panel on the cost of environmental cleanups featured lively
disagreement between Save the Bay's Fred Massie and Brian Bishop
of the Rhode Island Wise Use Movement over a costly new stormwater
treatment system that would improve the health of the upper Narragansett
Bay.
<P>
Local marine experts gave an update on the North Cape barge disaster,
which spilled 828,000 gallons of heating oil on one of Rhode Island's
most pristine wildlife areas in January. Dennis Nixon of URI said
the oil barges have fewer safety measures than fishing boats and
that reforms are being blocked by the shipping industry.
<P>
Other panels focused on the basics of water pollution science
and future conflicts, including expansion of aquaculture, the
fishing industry and global climate change.
<P>
Margaret Leinen, dean of the URI Graduate School of Oceanography,
unveiled plans for URI's Institute for Marine and Environmental
Reporting, a new program in which reporters could attend a specialized
&quot;summer camp&quot; to pursue research projects in marine
science, technology, and policy. The institute is still under
development and is supported by <EM>The Providence Journal-Bulletin.</EM>
<P>
SEJ members Jackleen de La Harpe of URI, Geoff Oxnam of <EM>Sailing World</EM> magazine, and Peter Lord of the <EM>Providence Journal-Bulletin</EM> organized the June

<STRONG><A NAME = "sej5">Editors and reporters &quot;TipSheet&quot; to debut</A><BR>
</STRONG>
<P>
Three national organizations committed to excellence in environmental
journalism are teaming up to provide reporters and their editors
with a tipsheet to highlight emerging news on issues of environmental
health and natural resources.
<P>
The Society of Environmental Journalists (SEJ) will work in partnership
with the Radio and Television News Directors Foundation (RTNDF)
and the National Safety Council's Environmental Health Center
(EHC). SEJ, EHC and RTNDF have worked cooperatively on a number
of previous environmental journalism initiatives. Dubbed &quot;TipSheet,&quot;
the publication marks the groups' first official collaboration
on an ongoing level.
<P>
&quot;TipSheet,&quot; to be distributed electronically and by
fax nationwide, is designed to provide editors and reporters expanded
access to national and regional developments that could have news
value within regional circulation and broadcast areas. News of
an upcoming regulation or court decision, key scientific findings,
online developments, important hearings, international and financial
developments are among the kinds of material routinely provided
by &quot;TipSheet.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Our goal is to provide more reporters-whether they're located
in a major metropolitan area or in a remote tribal village-more
information on key environmental and natural resources activities
going on around the country and throughout the world,&quot; said
Paul Dolan of ABC-TV News in New York, a media member of RTNDF's
Journalism Advisory Committee and one of the original proponents
of such an effort. &quot;With the swirl of claims and counterclaims
by various interest groups and with a constant flood of newsworthy
developments, it's especially important that reporters and editors
have this kind of information from journalistic organizations
they know and can trust.&quot;
<P>
SEJ, RTNDF, and EHC editors say they hope that reporters receiving
the tipsheet will become the best source of ideas for the new
journalism service, recommending key upcoming activities that
they think journalists nationwide should be aware of. 
<P>
In addition to being available via SEJ's members &quot;listserv&quot;
and on home pages operated by the sponsoring organizations, &quot;TipSheet&quot;
will be available by fax to SEJ members and newsrooms unable to
access it electronically. Contact the SEJ office if you want to
register for the fax distribution list, or if you need instructions
on subscribing to the SEJ members listserv. 
<P>
&quot;TipSheet&quot; will be posted after a one-week delay and
archived on the publicly accessed Web pages of the three groups
involved. Initially, &quot;TipSheet&quot; will be posted at the
following home page addresses: 
<A HREF = "http://www.nsc.org/nsc/ehc/journ/tipsheet">http://www.nsc.org/nsc/ehc/journ/tipsheet</A>

<P>
Howard Chapnick, president of the Black Star photojournalism agency
and a co-founder of the Society of Environmental Journalists,
died May 27 at his Somers, N.Y., home after a heart attack.
<P>
Chapnick was one of the journalists who planned the creation of
SEJ at a series of meetings in Washington, D.C., in 1989, and
served as one of the 13 members of the organization's founding
board of directors. For years he had battled amyotophic lateral
sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and did not seek
election to the board at the first conference in Boulder, Colo.
<P>
He was well known for his nature photography and had served since
1964 as head of Black Star, one of the world's most respected
photographic agencies.
<P>
Chapnick received the National Press Photographers Association's
Kenneth P. McLaughlin Award for setting high standards of professionalism.
He also received the association's Sprague Award  for contributions
to photographic education and the documentation of the civil rights
movement by Black Star photographers under his direction.
<P>
Chapnick also lectured at universities, wrote a monthly column
for <EM>Popular Photography</EM> magazine and helped edit photo oriented books including <EM>To Do Justice,</EM> about the civil rights movement.

<STRONG><A NAME = "online1">Organizing with text retrieval</A></STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>New database software can speed article research<BR>
</STRONG>
<P>
<EM>By Robin Rowland<BR>
</EM>
<P>
It's the age of information overload, and the computer hasn't
helped. There are more and more stories every day. Not just from
the traditional wire services, but from an increasing number of
syndication or &quot;personal profile&quot; news services. There's
the data stored in commercial information databases such as Dialog
and Lexis/Nexis. On the Internet, there is the exponential increase
in e-mail and new World Wide Web sites every day. All that information
can be hypnotic and even addicting, so you can't give it up. How
do you handle it?
<P>
A new generation of database software now provides a kind of structure
that lets a reporter doing in-depth research organize material.
This software goes by several names-text management, text retrieval
or free-form database-but all three mean and do the same thing.
<P>
Text database software has two advantages for journalists. First,
you have a choice of creating when entering data. You can use
a formal structure or enter information the way you get it. Second,
the software allows you to search for information across an entire
database, or multiple databases, or an entire hard drive. 
<P>
If you search for the word &quot;environment&quot; in a text database,
the software will locate &quot;environment&quot; everywhere it
can, in a name, a keyword or typed notes. Here are some of the
most popular commercial and shareware text database packages:
<BR>

<P>
<EM><strong>AskSam for Windows 3.0</strong></EM>
<P>
AskSam for DOS made headlines when it was used to compile information gathered by the Iran-Contra Committee, but it has a dense
programming language that is almost impossible to use for people
who lack programming experience. AskSam for Windows uses dialog
boxes and tool bars to get around that problem.
<P>
I used AskSam for Windows for my last two books, <EM>Undercover: Cases
of the RCMP's Most Secret Operative</EM> and <EM>Researching on the Internet.</EM>
I tracked the career of Frank Zaneth, the first and perhaps best
undercover cop in the history of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
The project required collating several hundred names of crooks,
communists, and cops who kept appearing throughout Zaneth's 30-year
career.
<P>
AskSam for Windows also has excellent templates for importing
data from CompuServe, the Internet and Lexis/Nexis. While I was
working on <EM>Researching</EM> I was saving megabytes worth of e-mail,
Usenet messages, and Web pages. I also transcribed taped interviews
into an AskSam database. Eventually I had about 10 megabytes of
data in about 15 chapter-related AskSam databases. Finding something
in those databases was easy because of AskSam's search and retrieval
capability.
<P>
When it came to writing, AskSam also saved a lot of retyping because
I could cut and paste quotes into my word processor. I also use
AskSam as my contact manager. I have entered almost every contact
I've made in the last 10 years in journalism into a large AskSam
contact file. The free-form software allows me to include as many
notes as I want and search them all at once.<BR>

<P>
<EM><strong>InfoSelect 3.0<BR></EM></strong>

<P>
I've always liked InfoSelect. If you put it in your Windows 3.1
Startup Group or create a Windows 95 shortcut, it is on your screen
all the time and can be popped up any time you want.
<P>
I use InfoSelect as an ongoing idea file. InfoSelect organizes
material into a series of databases called &quot;topics.&quot;
Each topic has a device called a &quot;selector,&quot; which is
a sort of outline. You can start an outline and then create as
many notes as you want tied to that outline. It also works in
reverse, so that each time you start a note, the title can appear
automatically in the Selector. InfoSelect can search across topics
and go through all your different idea files or notepads at the
same time, if you can't remember exactly where you put something.
<P>
InfoSelect also has a calendar and to-do list, plus a name and
address database that is compatible with traditional flat-file
and relational database software.<BR>

<P>
<EM><strong>InfoSnatch<BR></EM></strong>

<P>
InfoSnatch is a computerized notepad that takes a different approach,
using powerful enhancements to improve the Windows clipboard.
You can cut and paste almost anything, text or graphics, directly
into an InfoSnatch notebook. Notes are organized into notebooks,
libraries, and projects for easy organization. InfoSnatch will
search across your hard drive for notes you've misplaced in a
word processor file or tucked away in a zipped archive file.
<P>
I used InfoSnatch for one of my current research projects, investigating
both traditional and alternative medical and health resources
on the Internet. I was checking out the controversy over the herbal
tea Essiac, which some groups promote as a cancer treatment. By
using the Alta Vista search engine, I found there were more than
two thousand references to Essiac on the World Wide Web. Anytime
I found something on a Web page that I thought was worth saving,
<P>
I highlighted the text. When I sent the information to the clipboard,
InfoSnatch automatically pasted each new reference into its own
InfoSnatch note, creating a complete notebook of Essiac references.
<BR>

<P>
<EM><strong>Ecco Pro 3.0<BR></EM></strong>

<P>
Ecco Pro is a contact manager, but is included here because it
has some features of a text database manager. Ecco is based on
an outliner. You start typing and use the arrow or tab keys to
change the hierarchy of the outline. The outline can stand alone,
or can be tied to the contact manager/organizer aspects of Ecco.
<P>
Let's say you are writing a book or major project and you create
it first on the outliner. You can then, if you wish, tie the outline
to the calendar for planning purposes, writing purposes, or to
remind yourself of your deadline. Thus it becomes a project manager
as well.
<P>
The address book with Ecco Pro is fairly standard but does have
some powerful search capabilities, especially if you customize
it by adding keywords.
<P>
Ecco Pro is produced by Netmanage and it is designed to work with
Netmanage's Chameleon Internet suite.
<P>
Using a text database-like a word processor-is a matter of personal
experience and taste, but there is enough choice that a journalist
will find the one that is right for the job. The best advice is
to check out company Web pages (see box) and decide for yourself.

<STRONG><A NAME = "online2">Listserv users ponder edges of journalism</A><BR>
</STRONG>
<P>
<EM>By Russell Clemings<BR>
</EM>
<P>
When does a journalist stop being a journalist? Where lies the
line between journalism and public relations? 
<P>
To what extent should journalists -- environmental journalists in
particular -- accept or even encourage criticism of their work? Also,
what can -- or should -- they do if they feel the results are biased?
<P>
There are among the questions that were tossed around on the SEJ
listserv in late March and early April as listserv users put the
TJFR publishing and consulting group -- and the fact that SEJ has
counted at least two TJFR employees among its members at various
times -- under the microscope. (A listserv is a discussion list of
Internet e-mail addresses. For more information on the SEJ members
listserv, see <EM><A HREF="sej_su95.htm">SEJournal</A></EM> vol. 5, no. 2, Summer, 1995.)
<P>
TJFR is a New Jersey-based cottage industry that reports on reporters,
mainly for business clients. Among its products are specialty
newsletters on various branches of journalism, profiles of individual
journalists, and seminars aimed at public relations people. It
also does consulting, also mainly for business clients. 
<P>
Earlier this year, SEJ's membership and online committees determined
that TJFR's newsletter employees were eligible for SEJ membership --and
access to the listserv -- as long as they were not involved in the
company's consulting work, or anything else that could be deemed
public relations. 
<P>
As a result, Rifka Rosenwein, an SEJ active member and editor
of TJFR's <EM>Environmental News Reporter,</EM> was given access to the
SEJ listserv. Also, the listserv's governing policies were changed
to bar subscribers, Rosenwein included, from sharing listserv
postings with non-members, such as other TJFR employees. (See&quot;Policy
protects listserv privacy,&quot; Spring 1996 <EM><A HREF="sej_sp96.htm">SEJournal,</A></EM>
for details.) 
<P>
That was that.
<P>
Then, in late March, a story in Rosenwein's newsletter touched
a nerve with SEJ member and listserv subscriber Peter Page of
the <EM>Trenton Times.</EM> Page was critical of what he termed 
pro-corporate
bias in the newsletter's review of SEJ's 1995 national conference.
<P>
&quot;The newsletter is worth reading, if only to get a chance
to see ourselves as others see us, and to get a candid look at
the biases of the corporate PR types,&quot; Page wrote in a listserv
posting. 
<P>
Page noted that TJFR's coverage &quot;dismissed (SEJ keynote speaker
and Harvard biologist) E.O. Wilson, without even mentioning his
name, as a 'long-winded luncheon speaker' who kept corporate CEOs
waiting for half an hour before a handful of reporters trickled
in to hear what the big men said in their panel discussion.&quot;
<P>
From there, however, discussions moved on to other, more prickly questions,
such as: What information does TJFR include in its profiles on
environmental reporters, and is it accurate? Also, notwithstanding
bylaws and membership committee rulings, is there any place in
the SEJ membership for those who make their living by reporting
on environmental reporters, especially when their main audience
is the corporate public relations industry?
<P>
Opinions varied.
<P>
On the journalist profiles: &quot;We collect information on people
all the time,&quot; said SEJ member Paul Raeburn of <EM>Business Week</EM>
magazine. &quot;I don't think we want to be in the position of
arguing that one can't keep a file on someone without getting
his or her permission.&quot;
<P>
However, Page maintained that the subject of those profiles should
be able to review them for accuracy: &quot;This is something like
a credit report, except that it is a credibility report, and it
is common knowledge that credit bureaus make all sorts of errors
that complicate the lives of innocent people.&quot;
<P>
Scott Powers of the <EM>Columbus Dispatch</EM> offered a lesson based on
personal experience. Powers was the subject of a major story in
TJFR's March newsletter in which his entire body of work for 1995
was reviewed. His first warning came one day before publication,
when the review's author faxed him a copy to check for errors.
<P>
&quot;While there were no substantial factual errors,&quot; Powers
said, &quot;the piece was chock-full of strange, misleading, and
unsubstantiated observations, assumptions and conclusions about
my work specifically and our profession in general. It was also
terribly condescending.&quot;
<P>
In a subsequent post, Powers elaborated: &quot;I'm not opposed
to careful, insightful criticism of journalists' work by PR groups.
I welcome it ... (but) poorly concocted criticism can only muddy
the waters, and that's why I took such strong exception to the
piece done on me.&quot; 
<P>
A day or two into these discussions, listserv manager Amy Gahran
invited Rosenwein, who was already subscribed to the listserv,
to respond. A few hours later (things happen fast in cyberspace)
she did:
<P>
&quot;I guess, as a journalist, one always likes to see one's
stories being talked about,&quot; she said. But, she continued,
&quot;I feel frustrated because many of you have probably never
seen our publications and are therefore talking somewhat in a
vacuum ...
<P>
&quot;Our newsletters ... are founded on the premise that journalists
and journalism can and should be covered with the same level of scrutiny
that journalists 

give to their own areas of coverage,&quot; Rosenwein said.
<P>
She concluded by offering a copy of the newsletter to anyone who
requested it.
<P>
One week later, noting he had received several requests, TJFR
chairman Dean Rotbart forwarded the March issue's stories to Gahran
with permission for her to send them on to interested listserv
subscribers. More than 40 SEJ members requested these articles.
<P>
Like most heated discussions on the listserv, this one dropped
to a simmer after a week or two, and then subsided -- but not without
a clarifying word or two from the SEJ board members responsible
for membership and the listserv.
<P>
SEJ vice president Rae Tyson, who chairs the membership committee,
reaffirmed that SEJ admits journalists, academics, and students
as members while excluding public relations professionals, lobbyists,
and all others. (Non-members are welcome, however, to subscribe
to SEJournal, attend SEJ's national conferences, or rent its membership
mailing list.)
<P>
Referring specifically to Rosenwein's newsletter, Tyson then added,
&quot;Some of you want us to exclude a publication because you
don't like what they write. We say acceptability of content has
never been a consideration for membership in SEJ.&quot;
<P>
Listserv manager Amy Gahran restated the basic policy governing
listserv subscribers, with a caveat. First the policy: Nothing
from the listserv may be shared with non-members without permission
of its author. Period. Now the caveat: No policy is perfect, so
think twice before posting something that could get you fired.

<P>
<EM>Russell Clemings is an SEJ board member and co-chair, with Amy
Gahran, of SEJ's online committee. It should also be noted that
he was a classmate of TJFR chairman Dean Rotbart at Northwestern
University, and the two worked together on their college paper.

<STRONG><A NAME = "science1">EPA takes a new look at cancer risks</A><BR>
</STRONG>
<P>
<EM>By Sara Thurin Rollin<BR>
</EM>
<P>
For the first time in 10 years the Environmental Protection Agency
is proposing new guidelines for its cancer risk assessments. The
overhaul of the assessment process, released April 17, includes
a new scheme for classifying the relative risks of cancer, a new
approach to analyzing test data, and methods of estimating low-dose
cancer risks.
<P>
Assuming all changes are implemented, the new guidelines should
be in force sometime in the summer of 1997, requiring reporters
and editors to learn a new language of cancer-causing potentials.
At times, digging into the guidelines will be needed to explain
why the federal government set a permit standard, ordered a high
level of chemical cleanup, or required a Toxic Release Inventory
report.
<P>
Among advances that spurred the new guidelines is the growth in
molecular biology and metabolism studies. Scientific inquiry over
the past decade has focused on tumors in laboratory animals caused
by long-term exposure to certain chemicals. The proposals encourage
using data from short-term toxicity studies to detect molecular
damage that could result in cancer.
<P>
Another major science-based change is EPA's recognition that there
may be threshold threats for some pollutants, meaning that doses
below that threshold may pose no danger of cancer.
<P>
The method of ranking materials for cancer-causing potential would
be changed as well. Under the proposal, EPA scientists would write
a two-page description of the cancer hazard, listing cancer-causing
potential as either &quot;known/likely,&quot; &quot;cannot be
determined,&quot; or &quot;not likely.&quot; This would replace
the complicated letter-number system of labeling a substance &quot;Class
A,&quot; (a known carcinogen), or Class &quot;B2,&quot; (probably
carcinogenic to humans but with little evidence to back it up).
<P>
EPA cancer risk assessment guidelines have wide application beyond
federal government policies. State governments may follow them
in formulating state regulation; a bank may refer to them in deciding
whether to issue a loan for food grown with pesticide application;
lawsuits over cancers possibly caused by exposure to chemicals
may pivot on EPA's assessment of the cancer risk. <BR>

</STRONG>
<P>
<EM>By Howard Ris Jr.<BR>
</EM>
<P>
Since last September, the House Science Subcommittee on Energy
and the Environment has held several hearings calling into question
the science behind environmental policies. The latest hearing,
which was billed as a balanced forum on the science of climate
change, was stacked with skeptical scientists, some of whom have
financial links to fossil fuel industries that fear future regulation.
Generally, these skeptics take the view that climate change cannot
yet be detected, is not a serious problem, and does not warrant
a policy response.
<P>
Contrast this with the announcement made in December by the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): climate change is already underway,
human activity is partly responsible, and programs must be put
in place to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. The IPCC is
sponsored by the UN Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Meteorological
Association and has conducted two major assessments of climate
change over the last six years, based on the research and/or review
of 2,500 scientists from more than 60 countries. 
<P>
Faced with the challenge of informing the public about the state
of the science and the stakes for society, how is a reporter to
discriminate between reputable and junk science? While it can
take many forms, we define &quot;junk science&quot; as work presented
as valid science that in fact falls outside the rigors of the
scientific method and the peer review process. This includes the
presentation of selective results, politically-motivated distortions
of scientifically sound papers, and the publishing of quasi-scientific
journals that are intended to appear as something they are not.
At its worst, junk science is opinion and speculation lent undeserved
respectability by scientists financially supported by self-interested
lobby groups trying to confound the real scientific debate. 
<P>
By attacking junk science, we do not mean to imply that we believe
that criticism of scientific orthodoxy is illegitimate or inappropriate.
In fact, the Union of Concerned Scientists has at times challenged
the scientific mainstream. Junk science does not include well-formulated,
testable hypotheses from honest researchers challenging the majority
viewpoint, nor peer-reviewed results that do not conform to that
consensus. Indeed, these normal scientific inquiries may advance,
even alter, the current paradigm and, ultimately, our understanding
of dangers posed to the environment.
<P>
As a source to reporters, I know the genuine difficulty journalists
face when covering issues related to environmental science. Many
environmental journalists are not scientists and often have very
large beats that make it difficult to develop in-depth knowledge
on any one subject. It can be very challenging to separate the
wheat from the chaff. 
<P>
Most reporters have been trained to assure balanced coverage.
But achieving balance is often more difficult when covering environmental
science issues than when reporting on, say, politics. In politics,
news sources express their own opinions or values, none of which
may have more validity than those of other individuals. With science,
however, some views are more valid than others because they meet
certain standards widely subscribed to by the scientific community.
<P>
Yet, I can understand why science and environmental reporters
feel obligated to provide opposing points of view. Many of you
are sincerely struggling with the challenge of how to accurately
describe a scientific debate and give the correct weight to different
scientific opinions. Also, you often face a daily deadline, which
makes it very difficult to gather additional information or verify
the validity of material you've been given. Unfortunately, you
may end up an unwitting accomplice to the further proliferation
of junk science.
<P>
This often shows up in coverage of climate change, which some
reporters have covered as if it were a debate between two equally
supported groups of scientists. In fact, climate change skeptics
represent a tiny minority in the scientific community. The results
generated by several of the world's most sophisticated research
centers, an extensive peer review process, and a growing body
of evidence which shows that the modeling results are beginning
to correlate quite well with historical data, all suggest that
the scientific community has moved toward consensus where climate
change is concerned.
<P>
Another important factor leading to confusion is the nature of
science itself and the ways that scientists reach a consensus
on complex issues. The accumulation of scientific understanding
is a slow and deliberate process. Controlled experiments require
many iterations and are not always feasible; simulation models
are sometimes the only tools available. Some scientific findings
evolve over time, and sometimes the new information seems to contradict
the old. 
<P>
This is particularly true of environmental science. The human
race is conducting a series of experiments on the planet's natural
systems, and scientists are racing to understand the implications
even as we keep tinkering with the variables. Given this uncertainty,
and their deeply held respect for the scientific method, many
scientists are reluctant to make the kind of unequivocal statements
typically sought by the media. 
<P>
Without the time or training to appreciate the subtleties of the
debate, or to closely track the dialogue among the scientists
themselves, some journalists, and ultimately the public, may end
up feeling confused and misled. 
<P>
Distinguishing legitimate attempts to refine the science from
questionable assertions is a difficult assignment. Your job is
made even harder when you are confronted with sophisticated, veiled
campaigns deliberately waged to confuse the issues. While I don't
envy your task of sorting all this out for your readers, listeners
or viewers, I offer a few tips:
<P>
<UL><LI>Avoid making generalizations about the conclusions of scientists
when only one is quoted.
<P>
<LI>Ask scientists whether their reports have been published in objective
journals or peer-reviewed.
<P>
<LI>Indicate the relative standing, affiliation, or track record of
the different scientists quoted in the story.
<P>
<LI>Ask scientists about the funding sources for their work and the
steps they have taken to assure the objectivity of their findings.
<P>
<LI>Consult a variety of scientists with relevant expertise to interpret
the scientific data on a given issue.
<P>
<LI>Identify, collect and use as references the major &quot;milestone&quot;
studies which point to current scientific consensus on a given
issue.</UL>
<P>
Of course, there is no sure way to smoke out junk science. However,
our country faces some tough decisions on how to deal with the
risks of climate change and other environmental challenges. Policy
makers and the public depend on you to keep them properly informed.
And we especially need you to weigh carefully how you choose and

<EM>Amazon Stranger: A Rainforest Chief Battles Big Oil</EM>
<BR>by Mike Tidwell
<BR>
Lyons and Burford, $22.95<BR>

<P>
<EM>Reviewed by George Homsy</EM>
<P>
Author Mike Tidwell's amazing adventure starts peacefully enough.
While researching a story on ecotourism, he hears about an odd
Indian chief. A son of American missionaries, born in the jungle,
had become the leader of a small community of Cofan Indians.
<P>
Perhaps the most tantalizing part of the tale is the chief's battle
against oil company incursions of the Amazon preserve which the
Cofan call home. First, he leads his people deeper into the jungle,
away from the destruction. Then he fights, sometimes with threats,
more often in the media, against the environmental devastation
brought by oil exploration. 
<P>
Unable to resist this story, seemingly ripped from the world of
Joseph Conrad, Tidwell travels into the Amazon seeking the blond
Indian chief. The more he hears, the more intrigued he becomes
with this man of two worlds. 
<P>
Not far into the book, Tidwell meets his quarry, Randy Borman.
Then the exploration really begins. Tidwell spends time with the
chief, his family and the people of the Cofan community. Detailed
and engrossing descriptions bring to life the daily hunting, fishing,
and gathering routine of the Cofan. 
<P>
But Tidwell's greatest energy is spent trying to understand chief
Borman. Despite his sympathy for the man, Tidwell recognizes the
leader's many contradictions. 
<P>
Randy Borman is inconsistent. He is moody. Smiles and frowns come
in streaks with him. All of which actually makes a strange world
of sense when one considers that nothing in his life is consistent.
Nothing. It is as if being half-Western and half-Cofan in his
personality left him predisposed to be on both sides of every
divide, constantly crossing back and forth, never content to act
the same, to hold the same views, to be the same person all the
time. 
<P>
In his battles, Borman says he wants to steer clear of violence,
yet he condones the burning of an oil drilling platform. He claims
to protect the ancient way of life he has adopted. Then he secures
solar panels to illuminate his village at night. Between the onslaught
of the oil company and the changes brought by their white chief,
Tidwell rightly wonders whether the jungle lifestyle Borman wants
to protect really exists anymore. 
<P>
Still, it is the oil explorers who are the real agents of destruction
in Tidwell's book and the author is vivid and vehement in his
disdain for them and the changes they have caused in the jungle.
<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
...we entered the outskirts of Lago Agrio, Texaco's once-small
jungle headquarters founded by those men from the sky twenty-five
years ago. The place was today a very bad hallucination of a city,
squalid and nearly treeless, jammed full in frontier slum fashion
with a population of 15,000 people, a good quarter of whose women
were prostitutes servicing the run of oil men passing through.
Merchants along the oil-splashed main street sold shotguns by
the discount dozen and dynamite by the quarter stick. Others offered
stuffed macaws with haunting marble eyes and giant tarantulas
pickled in the Colombian whiskey. <BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Tidwell's descriptions and storytelling skill make this a fast-paced
environmental adventure. More importantly, the gripping journey
detailed in Amazon Stranger puts a face on the grim scientific
and human rights stories we so often report on from afar.<BR>

<DD>A war between environmentalists and an Episcopal congregation
over one of the last tracts of old-growth forest in the Washington
area has ended peacefully. St. Barnabas Church was bequeathed
the wooded tract in Prince George's County, MD, from a parishioner
who died in 1959. His will stipulated that the trees never be
cut down. But the church and the Episcopal Diocese of Washington
tried to develop the land. When that plan failed, they tried to
log and sell the property. This enraged environmentalists within
and outside the denomination. <EM>Washington Post</EM> metro reporter Susan
Saulny wrote June 14 that state officials intervened and agreed
to buy the woodland for $2.5 million. Two conservation groups
also agreed to chip in $500,000 toward the purchase. The church
will funnel the money into an endowment for retired clergy. The
land will be used for recreation. Saulny may be reached at (301)

Growth Management Act of 1985 was little help. In Duval County,
165 square miles of land was zoned for housing under the plan.

<DD>Both the <EM>Chicago Tribune</EM> and the <EM>Chicago Daily Southtown</EM>
have been closely covering plans by Will County, Ill., to establish
a mega-landfill next to the nation's newest national park, the
Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie. The <EM>Southtown</EM> published a
five-day, 15-part series beginning April 14 that detailed apparent
misconduct by officials responsible for selecting an operator
for the proposed landfill, located near Joliet. The <EM>Southtown's</EM>
coverage, by former UPI Bosnian War correspondent Dan Yovich and
environment/health writer Kevin Carmody, has triggered a grand
jury investigation headed by the state attorney general and prompted
the firing of the assistant state's attorney overseeing the selection
process. Despite lingering questions about the environmental suitability
of the site and the criminal backgrounds of some bidders, as of
late June Detroit-based City Management Corp. was poised to win
the contract, which could be worth $1 billion over 36 years. <EM>The
Chicago Tribune's</EM> Bob Merifield has also broken significant stories,
revealing the role that U.S. Rep. Jerry Weller (R-Ill.) or his
staff played in the secret meetings that brought City Management
into the competition late in the process. Contact Kevin Carmody,

<P>
<DD>A loophole in an anti-ATV law is allowing off-road vehicle
enthusiasts from around the Midwest to jam one of the Missouri
Ozarks' best float streams. A 1990 law makes it illegal to drive
motorized vehicles for recreation in Missouri's streams and rivers.
Conservation Department research indicated vehicles tear up stream
banks and harm fish and other creatures that live and breed in
the gravel beds. The loophole allows off-road vehicles to cross
streams &quot;at such road crossings as are customary or part
of the highway system.&quot; Jamie Parks, owner of the Parks Bluff
Campground, got the county prosecutor to agree that since off-roaders
have been crossing the river at her campgrounds for years, those
crossings are &quot;customary.&quot; State officials counter that
there is no road and that the off-roaders are merely crossing
from one gravel bar to another. Thousands of people now jam the
river, making it nearly impossible for canoeists to get by. Contact
<EM>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</EM> environment writer Tom Uhlenbrock, at
(314) 340-8128.<BR>

<P>
<DD>Apparently trying to sidestep public concern, the Missouri
Conservation Department has taken the first step toward allowing
Doe Run Co., a lead mining firm, to do exploratory drilling for
lead, copper and zinc in state-owned forests in the southeast
Missouri Ozarks. Department commissioners voted in June to authorize
negotiations for a prospecting permit and lease with Doe Run.
The company has requested permits for tracts totaling 7,080 acres.
Much of the land is undeveloped and was purchased in 1991 by The
Nature Conservancy from Kerr-McGee Corp., then sold to the department.
At the time, both the Conservancy and the department described
the land as one of the richest ecosystems in the Midwest. The
vote to negotiate the permit was not included on the scheduled
agenda of the commissioners' meeting, and was not in a news release
on action taken. Contact environment writer Tom Uhlenbrock, at

<DD>In January, the <EM>Nashville Tennessean</EM> reported that foxes
brought into Tennessee from North Dakota for sport hunting are
carriers of Echinococcus multilocularis, a tapeworm that can be
passed to humans and is usually fatal. To prevent the parasite
from spreading, most other southeastern states have already banned
importation of foxes. Contact reporter Anne Paine at (615) 259-8071.

<DD>Because of logging restrictions in the Pacific Northwest,
timber harvesting in the South has accelerated. But Southern timber
companies are cutting trees faster than they're growing them.
The December 24th edition of <EM>The Commercial Appeal</EM> featured an
extensive article by reporter Tom Charlier on clearcutting in
Tennessee's Wayne County. Charlier can be reached at (901) 529-2572.

<DD>With the highest waterfall in the eastern United States
(256 feet), Fall Creek Falls is considered the jewel of Tennessee's
state park system. But plans by the Skyline Coal Co. to build
a mine less than 6 miles from the park have led environmentalists
to seek federal protection for the park's watershed and &quot;viewshed.&quot;
Acidic runoff from the mine could contaminate the park's network
of underground springs and caves. Tom Charlier reported this story
on January 15th.<BR>

<P>
<DD>In early February, leaks in an eight-inch-diameter pipeline
operated by Colonial Pipeline Company caused more than 60,000
gallons of fuel oil to spill down the side of Lookout Mountain,
a popular tourist attraction in East Tennessee. Van Henderson
reported in the <EM>Chattanooga Free Press</EM> that the cleanup may take
several years. Henderson's number is (423) 757-6408.<BR>

Karen Dorn Steele of <EM>The Spokane Spokesman-Review</EM> has been reporting
on the plans of Dawn Mining Co., a subsidiary of Newmont Mining
Co. of Denver, to import mildly contaminated uranium wastes from
the East Coast to a defunct uranium mill near Ford, Washington.
Washington state gave Dawn a permit for the long-haul plan, but
the U.S. Department of Energy is balking, uncertain it wants to
ship Cold War discards from Missouri and New York across the nation
for final burial in Eastern Washington. <BR>

<P>
<DD>Dorn Steele also reported on the fate of several Hanford
whistleblowers that Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary honored in
Washington D.C two years ago. All three have recently been fired
or laid off, and Dorn Steele's June 16 story questioned whether
O'Leary was keeping her commitment to whistleblowers.<BR>

<P>
<DD>In a copyright June 30 story, Dorn Steele reported on a
new study by a Russian scientist that challenges the conclusions
of a $27 million U.S. government study on Hanford's past radiation
releases. Dr. Alex Klementiev says airborne plutonium releases
from Hanford may be 1,000 times greater than the 1-ounce estimate
in the government's 1994 dose reconstruction study. His reassessment
is based on a recently-declassified 1961 study of Hanford's Plutonium
Finishing Plant by former University of Washington professor George
Brabb. Brabb found that double layers of filters in the Hanford
plant (also called Z Plant, which today houses 3.9 tons of finished
plutonium) were failing to contain fine plutonium particles. Some
of them -- including several pounds -- in 1961 may have gone up the
stack, Brabb said. Susan Drumheller, also of the 
<EM>Spokesman-Review,</EM>
has been covering the controversy over the toxic metals moving
from Idaho's Silver Valley mining district into Lake Coeur d'Alene
and on to Spokane via the Spokane River. During winter flooding,
20 years' worth of lead washed out of old mine tailings and into
the watershed in a single day. Much of the lead settles on the
bottom of the lake. A U.S. Geological Survey scientist who studies
the problem worries that if abundant nutrients are added to the
lake, the change in chemistry will allow the lead to become part
of the water column and it will move downstream to Spokane. The
mining industry, meanwhile, hired a British Columbia scientist
to refute that notion. For more information, call Dorn Steele
at (509) 459-5462.<BR>

<DD>Several conservative radio talk show hosts attempted to
blame some of this year's increase in gasoline prices on the mandate

<br>
The Early '90s</i></strong></font><font size=4> </font><font size=3><br>
During the early 1990s focus was on the CS-1 (Service Commercial) zones with emphasis on the auto-oriented 
stripmalls located on the Lougheed Highway and Dewdney Trunk Road. These services experienced a boom from 
1992-1993, while the town centre development made only a slight increase. During 1993 and 1994, however, 
concentration increased in the town centre area while the service commercial zone remained stable. </font></p>
<p><font size=3><strong><i>The Picture Today</i></strong></font><font size=4><strong> <br>
</strong></font><font size=3>The town centre area continues to see demand for retail space, particularly in the east end of Maple Ridge, between 
224th and 228th Streets. This may be due to the virtually fully leased area of 207th Street and Lougheed Highway, and 
the forecast of future residential growth in the east end of the District.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Recent developments in this area include a 6,300 square foot Red Robin Restaurant built in front of the Valley Fair 
Mall. Another development on the corner of 216th Street and Lougheed Highway is presently being leased by 
Blockbuster Video. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Two projects which have recently experienced significant leasing activity are Maple Ridge Square and Valley Fair Mall. 
Maple Ridge Square has several new additions including a Pharmasave outlet, an expansion of the Saan store, and Only 
Women's Fitness, leasing approximately 9,000 square feet. Valley Fair Mall has undergone significant renovations, 
bringing an up-to-date, attractive appearance to the mall. Additions include major retail outlets such as London Drugs, 
The Sony Store, Starbucks Coffee, and Bata Shoes / Athletes World. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Haney Place Mall, another mall within the district, has also undergone recent renovations. The addition of a food fair, 
offering a variety of foods to shoppers, and increased leasing activity have helped to enhance the shopping experience. </font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Zoning</b></font><font size=4> <br>
</font><font size=3>All commercial property in Maple Ridge falls into one of the following zoning designations</font><font size=4>:</font> </p>
<ul>
<li><font size=3>Core Commercial A - Concentration of retail, cultural, institutional, office, recreational, and entertainment uses in 
the downtown core creates a strong town centre.</font><font size=4> </font></li>
<li><font size=3>Village, Community, and Neighbourhood Commercial Centres - Centres ranging from a single small store to a 
small commercial centre provide day-to-day needs to the immediate area. Most of this zoning is concentrated in 
west Maple Ridge.</font><font size=4> </font></li>
<li><font size=3>Tourist Commercial - Two areas adjacent to the downtown core are intended to encourage hotel and motel 
facilities, which can take advantage of the town centre facilities.</font><font size=4> </font></li>
<li><font size=3>Service Commercial Areas - These areas are geared to auto-oriented commercial uses, such as car sales and 
service, and other commercial uses that are heavily dependent on automobile access. </font></li>

<p><font size=3><b>Commercial Land Requirements / Forecasts</b></font><font size=4> <br>
</font><font size=3>Future commercial land requirements can be forecast on the basis of expected population growth multiplied by the 
current commercial-space-per-capita figure. At a moderate population growth rate of 3 percent we can determine that 
the remaining service commercial (CS-1) zoned lands may be quickly absorbed. Figure 2 illustrates this point. This will 
increase pressure for some additional (CS-1) zoning, and provide more shopping centre development both east and 
west of the town centre.</font><font size=4> </font></p>

streetfront retail. Rates in anchored centres range between $18 and $25 per square foot (net) with tenant inducements 
between $10 and $20 per square foot and two to three months free rent. Streetfront buildings, on the other hand, 
demand rates between $10 and $12 per square foot (net) with inducements falling between $5 and $10 per square 
foot, including free rent.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>The vacancy rate is expected to continue on a downward trend in the near future, due to a lack of new spaces coming 
on stream. Figure 3 shows '93 and '94 vacancy rates in Maple Ridge compared with those of other Lower Mainland 
communities.</font><font size=4> </font></p>

<p align=left><strong>Maple Ridge... Land of Diversity<br>
</strong><font size=3>From pristine mountains to agricultural plains; from home businesses to lumber mills; from 
forest parkland to urban bustle - Maple Ridge presents a wealth of diversity while defying 
definition.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=3>We might attempt to define Maple Ridge by our location. Situated on the north shore of the 
Fraser River, we are an hour's drive from the heart of Vancouver, one of Canada's major 
commercial centres. Our climate is that of a temperate rain forest, with luxuriant vegetation 
and mild, moist winters. As a member community of the Greater Vancouver Regional 
District, we enjoy the advantages of proximity to a sophisticated urban centre, without the 
disadvantages of big-city life.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=3>But that's only part of the picture.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=3>We could also say that Maple Ridge is a wonderful place to enjoy nature. Our many parks 
and trails offer an unrivaled opportunity to enjoy the peaceful beauty of mountains, rivers 
and marshes - and it is all as close as the wind.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=3>And yet . . . .Maple Ridge is a fast-growing community. Like the Fraser River flowing 
swiftly past us to the south, there is a current of change urging us on, bringing new 
businesses to serve our expanding population, encouraging housing and commercial 
development to keep up with the needs of our residents.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=3>Anything else?</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=3>We could certainly call ourselves a family-oriented community. Our clean, modern schools 
offer quality education for children of all ages and abilities. Our many sports and recreation 
facilities provide opportunities for active, healthy fun. Annual community events such as 
First Night, Canada Day, Mountain Festival, and the Agricultural Fair give families and 
children a chance to grow, learn, and play.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=3>We might also say that Maple Ridge is the people who live here. Our recent population 
boom has brought a substantial skilled labour force to the community. Many of our 
residents commute to other areas of the Lower Mainland for employment, while enjoying 
the lifestyle advantages Maple Ridge offers. Businesses and industries locating in Maple 
Ridge find no shortage of qualified workers eager to fulfill their personnel requirements!</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=3>Or perhaps the ways in which we care for each other can help define Maple Ridge. 
Community social service agencies operate specialized programs and the Society for 
Friends in Need runs a food bank. With a modern hospital and extended care facilities, 
police, fire department, and other emergency and health care services, Maple Ridge is fully 
prepared to respond to people in need.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=3>In the end it seems that Maple Ridge can't be narrowly defined. A combination of many fine 
qualities, it is a dynamic community with history and heart, where there is room to grow, 
lots to do, and people who care. This web site will give you in-depth insight into the 
outstanding features of Maple Ridge. So read on . . . and enjoy!</font><font size=4> </font></p>

The Maple Ridge Municipal Parks system is divided into three park levels. 
Neighbourhood Parks which are located in residential areas and provide grassy areas and 
play equipment for the young and energetic. Municipal Parks are the largest segment of the 
Parks system, providing areas that make provision for a specific activity and often protect 
a natural feature. Community Parks are designed to meet overall community need. They 
offer large open spaces for sports activities. The Municipal Golf Course and the 
Fairgrounds round out the Municipal Parks system.<font size=3> For more information on our Parks

<strong>Haney House</strong> <br>
</font><a href="haney_house.html"><font size=3><img src="haney_house_small.gif" align=right border=0 hspace=0 width=100 height=70></font></a><font size=3>An historic site built in 1878 for Thomas and Anne Haney, this home remained 
the residence of Haney descendants until 1979 when it was willed to the 
Municipality by Thomas Haney's daughter, Elizabeth Hawley and three 
grandchildren, Mary Hawley-Issac, Joseph, and Bernard Hawley. In 1979, 
with a grant from the B.C. Heritage Trust, the house was restored for the display of the many 
furnishings and artifacts of three generations of the Haney family, to be maintained in perpetuity 
for the interest of visitors and future generations.<br>
<br>
<strong>Maple Ridge Museum </strong><br>
After being inadequately housed for ten years in the Haney Library, the Maple Ridge Museum 
was opened in August of 1984 in the Port Haney Brick Company Manager's home which had 
been constructed in 1907. This historic setting overlooks the Fraser River and the CPR main 
line near the original waterfront heart of Port Haney. Displays reflect the local history and 
geography of Maple Ridge, beginning with the stone tools and cedar baskets of the Katzie and 
Whonnock Indians. Pioneer artifacts show some of the occupations of our early settlers such as 
logging, farming, fishing, and brick-making. Household articles, period clothing, and handicrafts 
are another feature of the museum, along with Finnish and Japanese items from the varied ethnic 
groups that settled in Maple Ridge. An extensive photographic archive and historic books and 
papers are available to the public for study.<br>
<br>
<strong>Canadian Pacific Rail Diorama</strong><br>
The Dewdney-Alouette Railway Society is constructing a display on the lower floor of the 
Maple Ridge Museum showing the CPR lines along the Fraser River from Ruskin to Hammond 
in the 1920 era. With painstaking detail, using plaster rock casts to produce lifelike cliffs, and 
trees devised from a variety of materials, the modellers are shaping their miniature landscape. 
The 1920s were the heyday of the Abernethy and Lougheed Lumber Company, the largest 
logging outfit in British Columbia at the time. Their extensive network of regular gauge railway, 
with its spidery trestle bridges, is shown in the diorama. The only place in Canada where a 
logging train crossed the CPR main line, brought the huge logs to the booming grounds at the 
mouth of Kanaka Creek, with log dumps for high or low water on the Fraser River.<br>

<p><font size=3><b>Haney House</b></font><font size=4> <br>
</font><font size=3>Built in 1878 for Thomas and Anne Haney, this home remained the residence of Haney 
descendants until 1979, when it was willed to the Municipality by Thomas Haney's 
daughter, Elizabeth Hawley. With a grant from the B.C. Heritage Trust, the house was 
restored and now displays many furnishings and artifacts from three generations of the 
Haney family. Haney House is located at 11612-224th Street. Open hours are 1:00 p.m. to 
4:00 p.m. on Wednesdays and Sundays. Admission is $2 for adults and $1 for children and 
seniors. Guided group and school tours can be arranged by calling 463-1377.<br>
<br>
<b>Maple Ridge Museum</b><em><b><br>
</b></em>Housed in the historic home of the manager of the Haney Brick &amp; Tile Co.[1907 - 1974], 
the Maple Ridge Museum displays objects from our First Nations' heritage, our pioneer 
past and the history of local industry. In addition, the Museum also houses the Maple Ridge 
Community Archives which include several thousand photographs and primary documents 
relating to local people, organizations, and businesses.<br>
<br>
On the Museum's lower level, the Dewdney-Alouette Railway Society has created a 
diorama which shows Canadian Pacific Railway trains and tracks in the setting of circa 
1926 Port Haney. Outside the Museum, the Railway Society maintains a 1940's wooden 
Canadian Pacific Railway caboose which is open to the public.<br>
<br>
The Museum is located at 22520-116th Ave and is open to the general public for drop-in 
tours from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Wednesdays and Sundays. Admission is $2 for adults 
and $1 for children and seniors. On the last Sunday of every month, members of the 
Dewdney-Alouette Railway Society are present to &quot;talk trains&quot; and operate the Diorama. <br>
<br>
Tours for groups and school classes and appointments for research purposes can be 
arranged by calling the Museum at 463-5311 or by e-mail at vcp@mindlink.bc.ca.<br>
<br>
<b>St. Andrew's Heritage Church</b><em><b><br>
</b></em>Built as a Presbyterian Church in 1888 on land donated by Thomas Haney, St. Andrew's 
became a United Church in 1926 and continued to serve a congregation until 1956. In 
1984, with a grant from the B.C. Heritage Trust and the efforts of many Maple Ridge 
Historical Society volunteers, the exterior of the Church was restored.<br>
<br>
The heritage church is now used as a small community hall, operated by the Maple Ridge 
Historical Society. The premises are an excellent venue for meetings, musical events, and 
small weddings. For more information on renting the hall, please call Alice Clayton at 
467-4015.<br>
<br>
<b>Fraser River Heritage Walk<br>
</b>Follow a paved footpath from the Maple Ridge Museum to historic Haney House and on to 
Port Haney Wharf. The historic buildings of Port Haney, St. Andrew's Heritage Church, the 
Masonic Hall, the 1911 Bank of Montreal, and a 1930 Japanese kindergarten, identified by 
plaques and interpretive material, help bring history alive on this walk through the past.<br>
<br>
<b>Heritage Advisory Committee<br>
</b>This Committee advises the Municipal Council on matters relating to the heritage of Maple 
Ridge. Past and current projects include the Heritage Plaque program, Heritage 
&#147;Walkabouts,&#148; and the restoration of the Wharfingers' Office at Port Haney (in cooperation 
with the Historical Society). The Committee is appointed by Council and is composed of 
seven members who serve one or two-year terms.<br>
<br>
<b>Maple Ridge Historical Society</b><em><b><br>
</b></em>The Historical Society operates the Maple Ridge Museum, St. Andrew's Heritage Church, 
and the Old Post Office building. The mandate of the Society is to collect and preserve the 
history of Maple Ridge for future generations. Other activities include the recording of oral 
histories on videotape, research into early families, and conducting guided tours through 
historic parts of town. For more information or to join the Society, please call the Maple 
Ridge Museum at 463-5311 or e-mail to </font><a href="mailto:vcp@mindlink.bc.ca">vcp@mindlink.bc.ca</a> <font size=3><br>

<p><font size=3><b>Maple Ridge Art Gallery<br>
</b>This volunteer-run gallery in the heart of downtown Maple Ridge offers 13 different shows 
each year, with works by professional and amateur artists from Maple Ridge and beyond. 
The gallery strives to present excellence and diversity, with annual highlights including a 
special ethnic exhibit each Christmas and a display of the artwork of talented students from 
local schools. The gallery also sponsors workshops in Arts education, and holds a number 
of special events throughout the year.<br>
<br>
</font><b>The Peace Memorial Park Bandstand<br>
</b>The Maple Ridge Concert Band started discussing the bandstand project through the winter 
of 1991-1992. The Bandstand design work began in April of 1992 and through the course 
of the following year was refined and presented to the Parks and Recreation Commission 
before being presented to Council. By May of 1993 all the necessary approvals had been 
granted and Tom Walker, President of the Concert Band, had been introduced to the 
President of Legion Branch 88 (George Price) by Mayor Belle Morse. <br>
<br>
George was kind enough to offer his considerable talents for fund-raising. The Maple Ridge 
Concert Band had already approached many service groups, businesses, and individuals, 
so George immediately followed up the first contacts with a personal visit. He rapidly 
collected substantial donations and convinced the Legion to donate $20,000. Mrs. 
Sparrow heard of his efforts and gave $10,000 on the condition of anonymity. (She later 
agreed to let her name be known as she wished her donation to be a memorial to her late 
husband). <br>
<br>
As the preliminary budget goal started to come into view, the Maple Ridge Concert Band 
began the necessary pre-construction work. This included ordering the decorative columns 
from Oregon, letting the contracts for the structural steel work, renting a large warehouse 
for the assembly of the acoustically-engineered ceiling (the acoustic design was completed 
by the same firm that designed the acoustics for the Orpheum Theatre), painting the 
decorative railings and ironwork, painting the ceiling panels, and countless meetings with 
George Neeson, the general contractor. <br>
<br>
On-site construction began in March, 1994, and took a remarkably short 8-1/2 weeks to 
substantial completion.<br>
<br>
In the end, the final costs of the project (including donated materials) amounted to 
$192,000. This did not include more than 1,300 hours of volunteer time (176 person-days) 
and the value of the land donated by the Municipality. The Provincial Government donated 
$50,650 in the form of a BC21 Grant.<br>
<br>
The Concert Band presented the Bandstand as a gift to the people of Maple Ridge on May 
7, 1994.</p>

<p><strong>Municipal Administration </strong><br>
The District of Maple Ridge is governed by an elected Council consisting of a Mayor and 
six Councillors, all elected for a three year term. Council meetings are held in the Council 
Chambers at the Municipal Hall every second and fourth Tuesday of the month.<br>
<br>
Maple Ridge is in the provincial electoral district of Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows, and in the 
federal riding of Mission-Coquitlam. From these constituencies we send a representative to 
sit as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) in Victoria, and one to sit as a Member 
of Parliament (MP) in Ottawa. </p>

<p><font size=3>In July of 1995, the District of Maple Ridge became a member of the Greater Vancouver 
Regional District (GVRD). Comprising Lower Mainland communities from Vancouver east 
as far as Maple Ridge, and from North Vancouver down to White Rock, the GVRD is 
located at the southwest corner of the British Columbia mainland and is home to one half of 
the province's population.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Over the past decade Maple Ridge has been one of the fastest growing municipalities within 
the GVRD. Growth rates for the Greater Vancouver Regional District have averaged 2.7% 
annually, with growth rates for Maple Ridge averaging nearly 5% over the last ten years. 
The rate of population growth for Maple Ridge has been slower in the 1990's than during 
the boom years of the late 1980's. Average rates have declined from over 6% during the 
five years from 1986-1991, to less than 4% during 1991-1996. The current annual rate of 
growth is estimated at 3%.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Maple Ridge's 1996 population is estimated to be 58,088. This figure is based on 
projections from our 1991 census figures. Given an average growth rate that is slightly 
higher than the overall growth in GVRD communities, we anticipate an annual population 
growth rate of 3% over the next five years.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>The graph below illustrates population projections on the basis of growth rates of 1%, 3%, 
and 5%. By the year 2021, our population will reach 72,331 at a 1% growth rate; 122,815 
at a 3% rate; and 206,000 at a rate of 5%.</font><font size=4> </font></p>

<p align=left><strong>Garbage Disposal</strong><br>
Maple Ridge homeowners and tenants are responsible for their own residential waste 
removal. All acceptable solid waste not collected by commercial disposal companies may 
be taken to the transfer station located at 10092-236th Street. Only wastes originating in 
the District will be accepted, with a proof of residence. The transfer station is operated by 
S.S.G. Holdings Ltd. for the Greater Vancouver Regional District. <br>
<br>
Some restrictions of materials do apply, so individuals should check with the GVRD if they 
wish to dispose of questionable material. <br>
<br>
Hours of operation: Monday to Saturday 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. <br>
<br>
<strong>Recycling</strong> <br>
The Ridge-Meadows Recycling Society (RMRS) operates a recycling depot at 
10092-236th Street, close to the Albion Ferry. In addition to recycling services at the 
depot, the RMRS provides job training for adults with disabilities. <br>
<br>
Throughout the community the RMRS continues to encourage ethical choices about the 
creation and disposal of waste. It operates the popular Blue Box program, a tax-funded 
curbside pick-up of newspaper, tin, aluminum, glass, and cardboard recyclables. The 
Society also accepts fine paper, used oil, scrap metals, and lead acid batteries at the 
recycling site. <br>
<br>
By the year 2000, the District's goal is to reduce waste by at least 50 percent. <br>
<br>
<strong>Composting</strong><br>
Maple Ridge now has its own Compost Education Garden, located in the heart of historic 
Port Haney. A joint project of the Ridge-Meadows Recycling Society and the Fraser 
Information Society, the compost garden provides a terrific environment for learning about 
composting techniques. Conscientious composting results in reduced garbage disposal fees, 
less waste going to landfills, and the immense satisfaction of producing an organic soil 
enhancer for lawn and garden needs. Open from April through October, guided tours can 
be booked through the RMRS at 463-5545. <br>

<p align=left><font size=3>In the past, community growth has been restricted by ground transportation bottlenecks; 
however, these transportation problems are now receiving high priority attention from the 
Provincial Government. A counter-flow lane on the Pitt River Bridge is near completion; a 
third commuter lane has been added to the Lougheed Highway; and the widening of the 
Mary Hill bypass is also complete. Further, a high-speed commuter train to downtown 
Vancouver started operations in November of 1995.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>B.C. Transit operates regular bus services throughout Maple Ridge, and provides a 
transportation link to other Lower Mainland communities. HandyDart is available for 
commuters requiring additional support or wheelchair bus services. Travelers also have 
direct access to the south side of the Fraser River with the Albion Ferry. The CP rail line 
runs through the District, and air traffic is accommodated by the Pitt Meadows Municipal 
Airport. </font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>West Coast Express</b></font><font size=4> <br>
</font><font size=3>The West Coast Express made its inaugural run on November 1, 1995 along 65 kilometers 
of track linking North Fraser Valley communities with downtown Vancouver.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Five trains depart every 20 to 25 minutes during peak traffic periods, running westbound 
from Mission in the morning and eastbound from downtown Vancouver in the afternoon.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Each bi-level train consists of five roomy rail cars, designed to accommodate 148 seated 
and 155 standing riders, and a state-of-the-art locomotive. The cars are wheelchair 
accessible and are equipped with bicycle racks, computer plug-ins, cellular phones, work 
stations, and washrooms. The train also features tinted windows, air conditioning, and 
on-board cappuccino service.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>The Express runs on existing Canadian Pacific Rail Systems' track, which has been 
upgraded to accommodate passenger rail traffic, and provides significant time savings over 
traveling by car.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Passengers can purchase tickets from automated vending machines. Tickets are fully 
integrated with bus, SeaBus, and SkyTrain.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Annual ridership is projected to reach 2.4 to 2.9 million within 18 months of opening.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Public Transit</b></font><font size=4> <br>
</font><font size=3>In December 1991, Maple Ridge was integrated into the B.C. Transit System, providing 
efficient transportation on a scheduled basis to most areas within the Greater Vancouver 
Regional District. Fares paid locally are valid for boarding any bus, SkyTrain, or SeaBus 
for 90 minutes from the time issued. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Link is a community-oriented service. With a 24-passenger capacity the Link buses serve 
most of the local routes in Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Dial-a-Bus is a service providing flexible transit to rural areas, upon request.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>HandyDart Custom Transit<br>
</b>Equipped with two large and four small vans, HandyDart provides a door-to-door service 
for people who have difficulty using regular buses, particularly those with special needs. 
HandyDart now serves approximately 900 people.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>River Transport<br>
</b>Fort Langley and other municipalities south of the Fraser River are only a five minute ferry 
trip from Maple Ridge. The Albion Ferry, located on River Road at 240th Street, shuttles 
vehicles and walk-on passengers across the river seven days a week, from *5:00 a.m. to 
1:00 a.m., at no charge to its passengers. During daytime hours, two 24-vehicle ferries 
travel back and forth every 15 minutes; after 8:00 p.m. the ferries run every half hour.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>*Schedules are subject to change</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Railway Service<br>
</b>The main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway parallels the Fraser River through the District. 
This dual-track facility accommodates an average of 25 trains per day. The CPR is 
currently relocating its intermodal service yard from Port Coquitlam to the nearby District of 
Pitt Meadows. The new intermodal yard, under construction since October 1995, will 
occupy 200 acres of land between the airport and the Lougheed Highway.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Air Service<br>
</b>The Pitt Meadows Airport, located in the District of Pitt Meadows, is the only Fraser 
Valley aerodrome located on the Fraser River's north side. It is located 2.5 km east of the 
junction of the Pitt and Fraser Rivers, and serves the area north of the Fraser River from 
Mission up to and including Vancouver. The principal communities served by the airport are 
the TriCities (Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam &amp; Port Moody), Pitt Meadows, and Maple 
Ridge. The total population of these communities exceeds 220,000.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>The airport consists of one 1,310-metre and two 762-metre paved runways and a staffed 
control tower. It is the home base for three major rotary wing operations, provides a float 
aircraft dock and ramp, and serves approximately 225 locally based float and regular 
aircraft.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Businesses at the airport offer a variety of both aviation and non-aviation services. Aviation 
services include:</font> </p>
<ul>
<li><font size=3>aviation support services: fuel sales, hangarage, and engineering</font><font size=4> </font></li>
<li><font size=3>flight training</font><font size=4> </font></li>
<li><font size=3>scheduled passenger service</font><font size=4> </font></li>
<li><font size=3>charter service</font><font size=4> </font></li>
<li><font size=3>avionics sales and service</font><font size=4> </font></li>
<li><font size=3>aircraft painting</font><font size=4> </font></li>
<li><font size=3>aircraft sales and repair </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size=3>Non-aviation commerce includes a large horticulture nursery, a custom roof-truss 
manufacturer, a restaurant, and log storage. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>The last Pitt Meadows Airport Economic Activity Study, dated 1990, showed the airport 
as contributing $10.6 million dollars in total revenue with direct employment for 141 
persons and a total of 160 jobs sustained. With a new published instrument approach, and 
the completion of a key navigational aid project, Pitt Meadows Airport is in a strong 
position to compete for commercial aviation activity.</font><font size=2><br>

<p><font size=3>There are approximately 1,747 licensed businesses in Maple Ridge, 37 percent of which are home-based businesses. 
Home businesses increased from 350 in 1993 to approximately 700 in 1995; they now total 8 percent of our local 
jobs.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Future Employment in Maple Ridge<br>
</b>Future employment projections for Maple Ridge depend a great deal upon population growth, affordable housing, and 
services. Based on the 1991 population census figures at a 1%, 3%, and 5% population growth rate, the future 
employment projections are as follows:</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Low Population Growth: at an average 1% per annum population growth, employment will increase at 0.67% per 
annum. Over the period 1995 to 2021, employment would increase by 2,729 jobs or 18% over 1995 levels.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Moderate Population Growth: at an average 3% per annum population growth, employment will increase at 2% per 
annum. Over the period 1995 to 2021, employment would increase by 10,273 jobs or 64% over 1995 levels.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>High Population Growth: at an average 5% per annum population growth, employment will increase at 3.3% per 
annum. Over the period 1995 to 2021, employment would increase by 21,385 or 125% over current levels.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>In any one of these scenarios, Maple Ridge will continue to grow and develop because of our quality of life, medical, 
social, educational, recreational and community services, outdoor recreation activities, and affordable housing. These 
advantages will ensure the continued development of our community.</font><font size=4> </font></p>

<p align=left><font size=3><strong><img src="beast_big.jpg" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10 width=221 height=343></strong></font><font size=4><u>Legend of the Beast</u></font><font size=3><br>
<br>
In the valley of the Golden Ears Mountains in 
Maple Ridge, the <em>Beast</em> ran and frolicked from the 
beginning of time in perfect harmony with the 
environment. <br>
<br>
Mother Nature took many hours of pleasure just 
watching the beauty of the<em> Beast's</em> movement and 
the sheer joy of living the <em>Beast</em> projected as it ran 
and jumped in play with the other animals in the 
valley, without a mean bone in its body. Mother 
Nature found perfect solitude in the mountains and 
a place to rest from her ever increasing workload 
throughout the world when time would allow. <br>
<br>
Sadly, it came to pass one day that man became 
extremely proficient in the destruction of the earth. <br>
Man's technology in the production of toxic 
chemicals, nuclear waste, sewage, and larger machines to cut down the forests quicker had 
a devastating effect on the earth. The oceans were used as dumping grounds; drift nets, 
miles long, were set to kill anything living without regard; and oil was spilled as if to make 
sure everything else was destroyed. <br>
<br>
Mother Nature worked so hard trying to repair the damage that she was just about finished. 
Man in his greed was ready to put his final touch to the end of nature, but he had not 
reckoned on the appearance of the <em>Beast</em> who came thundering out of the Valley of the 
Golden Ears to help Mother Nature. <br>
<br>
The battle was fierce, but the<em> Beast</em> was not like Mother Nature who would not hurt 
anyone or anything. The Beast ran over people that were causing this destruction and gave 
battle in any way that was possible, and in the battle, man used chemicals, nuclear waste, 
fire and pollution of every sort to try and stop this thing from the Valley of the Golden Ears.<br>
 <br>
When the battle was over and Mother Nature had a chance to regain her strength, she 
found the <em>Beast</em> was just about done in with man's pollution of nuclear waste, chemicals, 
acid rain, smog, sewage, and smoke from what was left of the forests. There was no way 
she could save the <em>Beast</em> and restore it to what it was when it ran free in the valleys and 
mountains around Maple Ridge. The damage was too great. This was a sad day. A few 
tears fell from Mother Nature and anger started to swell up in her until she was mad. In her 
anger, this was what she decreed: <br>
<br>
&quot;While the <em>Beast</em> cannot be as before, I can make it in another form and I will make the 
<em>Beast</em> into a statue for all the world to see. I will not let man or the sum of all mankind go 
without punishment. They who try to destroy by pollution and technology shall have their 
souls imprisoned and shall wake up with nightmares of the <em>Beast</em> as he captures them and 
does what he will.<br>
<br>
&quot;Furthermore, I, Mother Nature, make this decree that I will give mankind another chance 
to change his ways and use his intelligence to help the environment. <br>
<br>
&quot;Because of past performance, I am starting the Clock of Time, and how much time is left 
to the world depends on what is done. For now, the clock is running with the souls and 
spirits of those who would not heed my warning. Trapped, their pain and anguish can be 
seen in their eyes. The <em>Beast</em> would give no mercy if it could get at them and they would be 
destroyed, but their destruction would not be enough punishment. Instead, they will have to 
look over the world every hour and see what they have done for an eternity and every hour 
the <em>Beast</em> shall have its vengeance as it tramples upon those inside the clock who have done 
damage to the earth.&quot;<br>

<p align=left><font size=3>As one of the fastest growing school districts in British Columbia, School District #42 
serves over 12,500 students in the communities of Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows, with 25 
elementary schools and five secondary schools. The total operating budget for 1994-95 
(excluding debt services) is $68,148,906.<br>
<br>
<b>Keys to Success: Our Philosophy<br>
</b>The &quot;Keys to Success&quot; philosophy was developed in 1992 through a process that involved 
over 200 students, parents, trustees, teachers, administrators, and members of the Maple 
Ridge and Pitt Meadows business communities. The &quot;Keys to Success&quot; statement identifies 
the skills, attitudes, and abilities that secondary school graduates will require to meet the 
challenges of the next century.<br>
<br>
The &quot;Keys to Success&quot; philosophy statement affirms that in School District No. #42 our 
resources and efforts are focused on enabling students to develop seven keys to success.<br>
<em><b><br>
Zest for Learning<br>
</b></em>Enjoys learning and responds to the world as a self-motivated, innovative individual.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3><em><b>Broad Foundation of Knowledge and Skills<br>
</b></em>Acquires, uses, evaluates, and shares academic, fine arts, life, and career preparation skills.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3><em><b>Feelings of Self-Worth<br>
</b></em>Establishes self-confidence and esteem through a positive and realistic outlook.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3><em><b>Interpersonal Relationship</b></em><b>s<br>
</b>Works cooperatively and effectively with others and shows respect for all cultures.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3><em><b>Problem-Solving Abilities<br>
</b></em>Perseveres with purposeful challenges using imaginative, versatile approaches to problems.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3><em><b>Balancing Work and Leisure<br>
</b></em>Maintains physical well-being and emotional contentment through leisure activities and the 
appropriate use of humour.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3><em><b>Global Awareness<br>
</b></em>Protects the environment through appreciation and conservation of the natural world.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Special Programs and Services<br>
</b>In addition to the regular core curriculum offered in all schools, School District #42 offers a 
number of special programs and services, some of which are described below.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Special Needs Support Services<br>
</b>School District #42 is committed to the full service neighbourhood school model. This 
means that students with special challenges are educated in their neighbourhood school with 
their age-appropriate classmates. All students are valued as contributing members of the 
school community.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>At each school, a team of professionals works together to set goals and develop individual 
education plans for children with special challenges. At the District level, specialists such as 
school psychologists, district resource teachers, counsellors, speech and language 
pathologists, and teachers of the hearing or visually impaired are available to provide 
assistance to students, parents, and teachers.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Language Programs<br>
</b>School District #42 offers a variety of languages at both the elementary and secondary 
levels. The District believes that multilingualism is a desirable goal and that students who 
learn a second language will be better able to accept the multifaceted nature of Canadian 
society. Proficiency in a second language can also open doors to employment.<br>
</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size=3>French Immersion instruction is offered to students at seven schools in the District. 
Students enrolled in the French immersion program are taught the regular British 
Columbia school curriculum, but they receive their instruction in French instead of 
English. The District offers both Early Immersion, beginning in kindergarten, and Late 
Immersion, which starts in grade six.</font><font size=4> </font></li>
<li><font size=3>Japanese, Spanish, and German are offered by certain schools in the District at 
various levels of instruction.</font><font size=4> </font></li>
<li><font size=3>English as a Second Language (ESL) instruction is available for children whose 
mother tongue is not English and who require assistance to reach fluency. At present, 
more than 170 children representing over twenty-five different nationalities are 
receiving ESL instruction, further enriching the community of languages in School 
District #42.</font><font size=4> </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size=3><b>Career Education<br>
</b>Beginning in the primary grades and continuing on to graduation, students move through 
several stages of career education including career awareness, career exploration, and 
career preparation. Students who are 15 years and older have the opportunity to try a 
variety of work environments through the work experience program. Over 800 businesses, 
industries, and services have participated in this program. Specific training is offered to 
prepare senior secondary students for direct entry into business / industry, and special 
programs prepare some students for advanced placement at post-secondary institutions. 
Over 20 different career preparation programs are offered in the areas of business, 
communications, the performing arts, the service industry, trades, and technical fields.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Community Education<br>
</b>In association with both Ridge Meadows Parks and Leisure Services and the Arts Council, 
School District #42 sponsors a variety of educational and recreational programs to help 
community members fulfill their educational needs. Some of the services offered include:<br>
</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size=3>Secondary School Completion and Academic Upgrading Programs</font><font size=4> </font></li>
<li><font size=3>Certificate Programs offered through the Business &amp; Office Training Centre</font><font size=4> </font></li>
<li><font size=3>Work Orientation Workshop Program</font><font size=4> </font></li>
<li><font size=3>General Interest, Career / Vocational, and Community Education Courses</font><font size=4> </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size=3>Classes are offered in a variety of locations throughout Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows. A 
community education and recreation brochure is published three times a year, listing course 
descriptions, fees, and locations.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Thomas Haney Centre<br>
</b>Representing a first in Canadian education, this new facility was planned and built to house 
a secondary school and a college campus under one roof.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>A joint project of School District #42, Douglas College, and the District of Maple Ridge, 
Thomas Haney Centre can accommodate up to 1,000 secondary and 450 college students. 
The union of secondary school and college allows students to progress uninterrupted from 
grade eight to the completion of a college diploma, university transfer courses, or other 
studies in the life-long learning continuum.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Secondary school students who are considering post-secondary education can enrich their 
programs by taking Douglas College courses at the same time as they work on their 
secondary program. Such an opportunity ensures a much easier transition from secondary 
school to college.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>As well as sophisticated academic features, the centre possesses a variety of recreational 
facilities.<br>

<p align=left><font color="#000000"><font size=3><b>Mayor's </b></font></font><font size=3><b>Message</b></font><font size=4><b><br>
</b></font>Many families living in Maple Ridge have house pets. Most have dogs and cats, but many also have birds, 
rabbits, mice, fish, and others. A pet can add a great deal of joy to our lives, but it can also become a 
nuisance to neighbours. The following information has been designed to help you bring up well-behaved 
pets and to understand the laws that govern them. Here you will learn how many dogs you may keep at 
home, how to licence a dog, and other facts, such as the leash law.<br>
<br>
We have also included information which may be helpful to you, such as when to vaccinate your cat or 
dog. We will describe some of the more common injuries that can be sustained by your pet and how to 
avoid these injuries. We will tell you about the S.P.C.A. Spay/Neuter Program and what it means to be a 
responsible pet owner. <br>
<br>
A pet is only as responsible as its owner and I urge you to avail yourself of the services provided by the 
Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the following information. By making sure our pets are 
<b>well behaved</b>, we help to make Maple Ridge a very pleasant place for all of us. </p>
<p align=right><strong><i>Carl Durksen</i></strong><i>, Mayor</i> </p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000"><font size=3><b>Responsible Pet Ownership </b></font><font size=4><b><br>
</b></font>There are laws governing dog ownership in the District of Maple Ridge, and there are common sense 
rules to keep your pet safe, happy and a welcome member of our community. <br>
</font></p>
<p><b>Your Dog Must be Licensed</b> <br>
All pets should wear identification at all times. If your pet is injured or lost, an ID tag will ensure that your 
pet gets immediate attention.<br>
<br>
All dogs are required by Municipal law to be licensed every year, regardless of age.<i> (Bylaw No. 
5468-1996)</i> </p>
<div align=left>
<table width=550>
<tr><td width=319>Yearly fee for licences</td><td width=319>$52</td></tr>
<tr><td width=319>Discount before March 1</td><td width=319>$15 </td></tr>
<tr><td width=319>Discount for Spay/Neuter</td><td width=319>$24</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>Dogs must wear their tags on their collars at all times. If you lose the tag, a replacement is required for a 
fee of $5.00. There is no charge for a &quot;Seeing Eye&quot; or &quot;Hearing Assistance Dog&quot; with satisfactory proof.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Tattooing<br>
</b>Tattooing is a relatively painless procedure which can be done any time using an mild tranquilizer or at the 
time your pet is spayed or neutered. It is permanent and cannot be lost or removed. A tattoo makes your 
pet readily identifiable and provides for quick, positive proof of ownership when your pet is lost or stolen. <br>
</p>
<p><b>How Many Pets Can You Have?<br>
</b>You cannot have more than three dogs over the age of four months unless a Kennel Permit has been 
issued. There is no law governing the number of cats you may own.<br>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>Control of Pets - The &quot;Leash Law&quot;</b><b><i><br>
</i></b></font>Dogs on public property must be restrained by a leash or harness. Your dog must be confined to private 
property by cord, chain, or by fencing that is high enough and strong enough to prevent your dog from 
escaping. It is strongly recommended that cats be kept indoors for their own safety and to prevent them 
from becoming a nuisance to your neighbours.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Dogs in Automobiles<br>
</b><em>Your car is a death trap for your pet!</em> Temperatures inside parked cars can reach up to 175&#176;F 
(79.44&#176;C) on a hot summer day. Cars parked in shaded areas with open windows help, but even at 
125&#176;F (51.66&#176;C) <em>your pet can die in 10 minutes</em>. It is against the law to transport a dog in a pickup 
truck or car without proper restraint. They could be severely injured or killed from being tossed around or 
thrown out of the vehicle. </p>
<p><b>Cleaning Up After Your Dog<br>
</b>Any fecal matter (stool) must be immediately cleaned up and removed from any public park and/or 
Municipal property. Remember, excrement carries diseases and is a health hazard, especially where 
people play, walk, sit or lie. Pet stores carry disposable scoops or you can simply take a plastic bag, 
insert your hand in the bag, pick up the feces and then close the bag over them. (<i>Poop and Scoop</i>)<br>
</p>
<p><b>Animal Abandonment<br>
</b>It is against the law in Maple Ridge to abandon your pet. If you are not able to find it a home on your 
own, please bring it in to the S.P.C.A. Shelter.<br>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>Common Sense<br>
</b></font>Bath your pet frequently to prevent odours and control fleas. If you start when they are little, even your 
cat will enjoy a good shampooing.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Lost Animals - Found Animals<br>
</b>If your pet becomes lost, you should immediately call the S.P.C.A.. and all local animal hospitals. It is a 
good idea to keep a record handy of your pet's licence number, rabies tag number, tattoo number, and 
even a current photograph so that staff are able to recognize your pet. If you have found an animal, please 
contact the S.P.C.A. and all local animal hospitals for instructions. <br>
</p>
<p><b>Vicious, Dangerous or Guard Dogs<br>
</b>Your dog is not allowed to harm, injure, or kill another animal or a human being. A dangerous or vicious 
dog must be effectively muzzled to prevent it from biting another animal or human. Guard dogs must be 
kept in an enclosed area that they cannot escape from or be under the absolute control of a handler at all 
times. <br>
</p>
<p><b>Noise Control<br>
</b>No person shall allow any animal or bird in their control or possession which, by its calls, cries, barks or 
other noise, disturbs or tends to disturb the quiet, peace, rest, enjoyment, comfort, or convenience of the 
neighbourhood or of persons in the vicinity.<i> (Bylaw No. 5122-1994)<br>
</i></p>
<p><b>When Your Pet is Dying or Dies<br>
</b>Your Veterinarian or the S.P.C.A. will put your pet to sleep, using an injection which is gentle and 
painless. They can then arrange for cremation and disposal for a fee. There are also private crematoriums 
and pet cemeteries listed in the telephone book. Check with the District of Maple Ridge on burial laws. <br>
</p>
<p align=center><font color="#000000"><font size=4><b>Vaccination &amp; Worming: </b></font></font><font size=4><b>A Longer, Healthier Life for All Dogs and Cats</b></font> </p>
<p align=left>As a pet owner, you want to do all you can to give your dog or cat a long and healthy life. Proper nutrition 
and sanitation combined with regular visits to your Veterinarian are, of course, important elements of 
responsible pet health care. If you haven't had your dog or cat vaccinated against infectious diseases, you 
could be leaving your pet vulnerable to a number of serious illnesses. <br>
<b><br>
Your puppy</b> will require a combination vaccination at 8 &amp; 12 weeks of age which consists of Distemper, 
Hepatitis, Parainfluenza, Leptospirosis, Parvovirus, Coronavirus, and Adenovirus. At 16 weeks of age 
your puppy will require another Parvovirus booster as well as a Rabies vaccination. If you are boarding or 
showing your dog, you must vaccinate against Kennel Cough. </p>
<p><b>Your kitten</b> will require vaccinations at 8 &amp; 12 weeks of age for Distemper (Panleukopenia), 
Rhinotracheitis, Calicivirus, Chlamydia and Feline Leukemia Virus. A Rabies vaccination should also be 
given at 16 weeks of age.<br>
<br>
Vaccinations need to be repeated on a yearly basis, with the exception of the Rabies vaccination which 
only needs to be repeated every three years (after the first year).<br>
<br>
You should bring a fecal (stool) sample with you on each visit. Your Veterinarian will test for worms and 
prescribe any medication that might be needed. Heartworm medication should be given to dogs from May 
to October. A blood test is required. <br>
<br>
Check with your local Veterinarian for more information on vaccinations and worming and the costs. They 
can advise you on travel requirements for your pet as well.<br>
</p>
<p align=center><font color="#000000"><font size=4><b>Common Injuries/Poison Substances: </b></font></font><font size=4><b>Prevention &amp; Treatment<br>
</b></font></p>
<p>Your Veterinarian is the most important person in your pet's life when an accident or illness occurs. By 
keeping a first aid kit handy, you can help your pet until you get to the Animal Hospital. Some common 
items are a thermometer, hydrogen peroxide, gauze bandages, adhesive tape, cotton swabs and tweezers.<br>
<br>
Only buy toys for pets that they cannot destroy. For dogs, a Nylabone is an excellent choice. Swallowed 
pieces of a toy or tinsel, especially for cats, can be fatal.<br>
<br>
Do not leave socks, children's toys, nails, staples, pins, or other sharp objects lying around and don't let 
your pet play with plastic bags which could suffocate him. Unplug, remove, or cover any electrical cords 
or wires that your pet might chew. <em>They could be electrocuted!<br>
</em><br>
If you must tie your dog up, do not tie him up with a choke chain. <em>They could strangle!<br>
</em><br>
A trip to the Veterinarian might be necessary if your pet has any of the following symptoms: loss of 
appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, dull eyes, or a high temperature. It is recommended that you take your pet's 
temperature at the first sign of illness. Using a rectal thermometer, lubricate it with vaseline and carefully 
insert it into the rectum, holding firmly in place for at least two minutes. The normal temperature for your 
cat or dog is between 101&#176;F and 102.5&#176;F (38&#176;C - 39&#176;C).<br>
<br>
Wounds should be cleaned gently with warm water and lightly bandaged before your trip to the 
Veterinarian. <br>
<font color="#000000"><br>
Beware of sharp objects where your pet may walk or play. Walking or running on a cut pad prevents the 
cut from healing.<br>
</font></p>
<p><b>A poisoned animal must be treated instantly.</b> <b>Phone your Veterinarian Immediately!<br>
</b>There are many household products that can kill your pet. These include rat poison, slug bait, boric acid, 
hand soap, detergents, insecticides, mothballs, household cleaners, bleaches, de-icers, polishes and 
disinfectants, paints and varnish removers, acetone, turpentine and even some health and beauty aids if 
swallowed in large enough quantities. Antifreeze is a deadly drink; one teaspoon is enough to kill your 
companion. Tylenol (Acetaminophen), Nicotine, Drugs, and even Chocolate can kill! <br>
<em>If you lock it away from your child - do the same for your pet!<br>
</em><br>
Many household and garden plants can cause serious illness or death. Among them are Peach and Cherry 
Tree Bark, Cyclamen, Lily of the Valley, Rhododendrons, Tulip Bulbs, Azalea, Wisteria, Mistletoe, 
Daffodils, Delphiniums, Foxglove, Dumcane, English Ivy, Morning Glory, Oleander, Philodendrons, and 
Poinsettia. Rhubarb Leaves, raw or cooked, can cause death. <br>
</p>
<p align=center><font color="#000000"><font size=4><b>Spay/Neuter</b></font></font>: <font size=4><b>Stop Unwanted Pets<br>
</b></font></p>
<p>Maple Ridge, like many other communities, has a pet overpopulation problem. Because of the 
indiscriminate overbreeding of domestic pets, the S.P.C.A. handles over 1,550 homeless animals a year. 
Since homes cannot be found for all these pets, few dogs, but many cats must be destroyed.<br>
<b><br>
What are the benefits of spaying or neutering your pet?</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Your pet will remain more healthy and less likely to fight. Spaying eliminates a female's risk of 
developing uterine infections and reduces the chance of developing mammary cancer. The male 
usually becomes less aggressive and is less likely to roam, thus reducing the chance of injury in 
fights or automobile accidents and the risk of prostate and testicle cancer is virtually eliminated. </li>
<li>There are not enough homes for all the animals. By preventing the birth of unwanted pets, you will 
prevent the destruction of thousands of animals. <em>Quite Simply - It Is A Matter of Life and Death! </em></li>
<li>You will not have to chase off all the male suitors. </li>
<li>You will not have to put up with blood stains on your carpets, floors, and furniture. If your pet is a 
male cat, there usually will be no more strong smelling urine sprayed onto furniture and drapes. </li>
<li>Your female cat will not wail, rub or dart out the door. </li>
<li>Dog licences are purchased at a discounted rate. </li>
</ul>
<p>It is recommended that you spay or neuter your pet at the age of six months.<br>
</p>
<p>The S.P.C.A. provides a certificate at the time of adoption to be used toward reducing the cost of spaying 
or neutering your pet. This certificate may be redeemed with your local Veterinarian or at the S.P.C.A. 
Clinic in Vancouver.<br>

The Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is a society, funded by private donations. 
Throughout British Columbia there are 34 branches of the S.P.C.A. In the Lower Mainland 
there are nine (9) shelters as well as the Vancouver Clinic. Your donations are needed to 
carry on the day-to-day work of animal rescue, shelter, and adoption as well as cruelty 
investigation. These donations are tax deductible.<br>
<br>
In Maple Ridge the S.P.C.A. responds to 2,500 calls for help (not including calls for 
information) every year. Approximately 2,300 animals needed our assistance in 1995.<br>
<br>
Here are some of the ways we serve animals and our communities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Investigate and prosecute cases of abuse, neglect, and cruelty. </li>
<li>Shelter homeless and unwanted animals and find them loving homes. </li>
<li>Promote and carry out spaying and neutering of animals to reduce pet 
overpopulation. </li>
<li>Rescue animals injured or in distress. </li>
<li>Return lost animals to owners. </li>
<li>Lobby for legislation to improve conditions for all animals. </li>
<li>Provide animal care advice to the public and humane education programs to schools. </li>
<li>Work to reduce use of animals in research. </li>
<li>Inspect establishments such as stables and pet stores. </li>
</ul>
<p>With your support we can make this a better world for animals and for people too. By 
preventing cruelty, we are creating a more humane and sustainable society. <br>

west, is known as the Gateway to the Fraser Valley. An energetic 
young community, Pitt Meadows' population has increased 21% 
from the 1991 census, to an estimated 1996 population of 14,500. 
The principal activity is agriculture, which absorbs 60% of Pitt 
Meadows' 51.5 square kilometre area.</font></td><td align=right valign=top><img src="ourneighbours_main.jpg" align=bottom width=120 height=185></td></tr>

<p><font size=3>The landscape boasts a beauty conducive to a variety of recreational activities, and urban 
amenities have grown accordingly. Excellent schools, a library, churches, health care 
facilities, financial institutions, and affordable housing round out the package. A town centre 
recreation complex is being planned by Ridge Meadows Parks and Leisure Services.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>The District of Mission, lying 26 km east of Maple Ridge, is a community forested by tree 
farms covering 75% of the land base. This promotes Mission's appearance of being a single 
expansive park. There are also many shake and shingle mills in the area. Mission is a 
community that appreciates the Arts as well, hosting a Folk Music Festival each summer.</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Fraser Valley growth has extended out to Mission, whose 1995 estimated population figure 
of 31,500 mirrors an impressive 18.4% increase over the 1991 census figures. Residential 
growth is complemented by a healthy supply of amenities: schools, post-secondary 
institutions, cultural, recreational, and religious facilities.</font><font size=4> </font></p>

<p><font size=2><i>1997 budget projections are based on the following:</i></font> </p>
<ul>
<li><font size=2>Inflation will remain below 2.5%.</font> </li>
<li><font size=2>Unemployment will remain high at 9-10%.</font> </li>
<li><font size=2>Provincial growth will continue at a sluggish pace of 1%.</font> </li>
<li><font size=2>Maple Ridge will experience a modest increase in building starts over 1996.</font> </li>
<li><font size=2>Interest rates will remain low and therefore, reduce our investment return.</font> </li>
<li><font size=2>Municipal revenue declined $1.8 million, vs. 1996 budget figures. This is a result of reduced 
Provincial Government grants, lower income due to declining interest rates, and reduced 
building and development activity.</font> </li>
</ul>
<p><font size=2><i>The key points of the 1997 Provisional Budget are as follows:</i></font> </p>
<ul>
<li><font size=2>Municipal property taxation to be increased by 3%; this is forecast to generate $550,000; the 
cost to the average home will be $22.</font> </li>
<li><font size=2>Water rate increase of $10.00 to residential properties with an equivalent increase in rates to 
metered properties.</font> </li>
<li><font size=2>Real growth (new properties on the tax role) is projected at 3% and forecast to generate 
$561,400.</font> </li>
<li><font size=2>User fees (building permits, leisure fees, etc.) to increase 5% to more closely recover the cost of 
the service.</font> </li>
<li><font size=2>RCMP fee for false alarms to generate $24,000; this will also act to encourage owners to inspect 
their systems and reduce non-productivity of the Police Department.</font> </li>
<li><font size=2>Capital expenditures funded by General Taxation reduced by approximately 2% or $383,000. 
(Effectively, projects will be moved further into future years).</font> </li>
<li><font size=2>Transfer from Accumulated Surplus of $304,300; $200,000 is to act as a stabilization baseline for 
the decline in interest income and $104,300 to smooth one-time future revenues.</font> </li>
<li><font size=2>Reduced Transfer to Reserve for Building Infrastructure of $456,800.</font> </li>
<li><font size=2>Implement Burning Permit Fee ($41,200) to finance the cost of the branch chipping program. This 
will effectively reduce wood waste and provide an alternative to outdoor burning.</font> </li>
<li><font size=2>Recycling of plastics will be introduced without a fee increase.</font> </li>
<li><font size=2>Four full-time vacant staff positions and numerous part-time positions eliminated for a savings 
of more than $225,000 (also $107,000 for other positions).</font> </li>
<li><font size=2>Fire Department is the recipient of additional funding for member services and changes in 
administration of life insurance.</font> </li>
<li><font size=2>Police Services costs to remain at the 1996 level. Additional funding has been made available for 
a School Liaison Officer under a cost sharing arrangement with the School District and Pitt 
Meadows Municipality.</font> </li>
<li><font size=2>Funding has been identified for an Environmental Coordinator. This provision is contingent on 
a number of items that will require further analysis.</font> </li>
<li><font size=2>Cost saving service level reductions have been necessary in many of our Public Works 
operations. These are in the form of lengthened maintenance cycles (ditch cleaning, brushing, 
etc.). It is recognized that some will be noticeable, however, they are fiscally necessary.</font> </li>

</b></font></p>
<p><font size=3>The real growth estimate included in the Budget for 1997 is 3.0%. Real growth is the new 
construction and land development that was not taxed in the previous year. These 
assessments cover the period November&#160;1,&#160;1995 - October 31, 1996 and are based on 
the market values that existed on July&#160;1, 1996. The actual real growth will be confirmed by 
the British Columbia Assessment Authority in early 1997. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Property Taxation<br>
</b></font></p>
<p><font size=3>a) Council has set a guideline of no tax increase for the 1997 taxation year. Therefore;<br>
</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=3>i) There is no increase in the General Purpose Tax proposed, however 
there are incremental packages which Council may wish to consider. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>ii) There are no local levy increases for the Waterworks or Sanitary 
Sewer Utilities.<br>
</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size=3>b) Council has for the past two years, approved a tax shift which decreases Major and 
Light Industrial taxation up to 6% at the expense of a &#189;% increase in Residential and 
Seasonal Recreational taxation. This shift has been used to demonstrate our encouragement 
to business to relocate or expand here in order to create employment and growth benefits. 
Council must determine if they wish a further tax shift in 1997. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font size=3>c) Debt Levy </font></p>
<p><font size=3>There will be a small reduction in the debt levy due to an increase in real growth and 
negligible change in our debt charges. <b><br>
</b></font></p>
<p><font size=3>d) Waterworks Utility </font></p>
<p><font size=3>This Budget contains a $10.00 user fee increase to provide for the phasing of the rate 
increases that are required for the system and safety improvement being undertaken by the 
Greater Vancouver Water District. These improvement programs will continue to increase 
water supply fees in the future. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font size=3>e) Sanitary Sewer Utility </font></p>
<p><font size=3>The Greater Vancouver Sewage and Drainage District has commenced major treatment 
plant modernizing and upgrading from primary treatment to secondary treatment that will 
notably reduce the pollution entering the Fraser River. This is a multi-million dollar 
undertaking which will result in future user fee increases. Due to a slower construction pace 
and the implementation of Regional Development Cost Charges the anticipated 1997 user 
fee increase is deferred. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font size=3>f) Recycling Levy </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Due to public demand and the Regional mandate to reduce solid waste, this proposed 
budget includes the provision for recycling plastics at the Recycling Depot. A parcel charge 
increase of $2.00 is required to cover the cost of this service.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Provincial Government Unconditional Grants<br>
</b></font></p>
<p><font size=3>Provincial Government Unconditional Grants represent Local Government access to sales 
tax and resource revenues which the local levels are restricted from taxing directly. The 
Unconditional Grant for 1996 was $2,188,837 which is equal to 11.6% of property 
taxation. Property taxation is considered the most regressive form of taxation and therefore, 
these grants are a very important component of our revenue base. Due to the economic 
conditions faced by the Provincial Government we can expect to have major reductions in 
the Unconditional Grants over the next three years. This proposed budget includes a 50% 
reduction for 1997 (total grant of 1.1 million); and it is very important to recognize that 
further reductions in this area appear likely in subsequent years.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Railway Taxation<br>
</b></font></p>
<p><font size=3>The Provincial Government Bill 55 reduced assessments for railways and imposed taxing 
caps on tax rates. While we are not affected by the cap, the assessment reductions result in 
a $60,000 revenue loss.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Investment Income<br>
</b></font></p>
<p><font size=3>The sharp fall in interest rates required that we cut our investment income expectations by 
$325,000 to more reflect the likely longer term interest rates. The expected interest rates in 
1997 are lower than this level and therefore in line with our stabilization policy, this budget 
includes a $200,000 appropriation of surplus to cover the 1997 shortfall.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Manpower Increases<br>
</b></font></p>
<p><font size=3>Due to the uncertainty of Provincial Government Grants over the next several years and the 
pressures for no tax increase there are no new positions in this budget. We have eliminated 
four previously budgeted positions and several temporary labour hours. A program of 
attrition management to assess vacant positions has been implemented.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Collective Employment Agreement<br>
</b></font></p>
<p><font size=3>The current three year union employment contract expires March 31, 1997.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Capital Program<br>
</b></font></p>
<p><font size=3>We have previously targeted 12% of property tax revenue to be allocated to capital 
improvements from the General Revenue Fund. We have reduced this allocation to 10% for 
1997 and future years. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Development Activity<br>
</b></font></p>
<p><font size=3>The revenue generated from land development and building was down in 1996 from our 
previous highs. We expect a slight improvement in 1997, but we have significantly revised 
our revenue projections downward, especially in Engineering subdivision inspections.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size=3>This document translates policy into specific levels of service. It also is a communication 
document on how tax dollars and user fees are allocated for our fiscal year that ends 
December 31, 1997. To more actively prepare for financial uncertainty in the future a 
formal business planning approach will be brought forward to Council in the first quarter of 
1997. The purpose of the business plan is to establish a process to systematically review all 
programs, assess service levels in detail, review partnership or other service delivery 
options that may be available, and develop performance measures to ensure the 
effectiveness and efficiency of expenditures. In the interim, the proposed budget meets the 
guidelines of Council and is recommended for adoption by Council.<br>
</font></p>

<br>

The following survey was recently (Fall 1996) circulated to members of 
the Canadian Association of Municipal Administrators (CAMA). The 
survey, supported by CAMA, is aimed at developing an empirical base of 
information about the use of Total Quality Management similar in scope to 
those surveys recently undertaken in both the United States and the United 
Kingdom. Any questions about the survey should be directed to Mr. R.W.

meetings which affect many people's lives. Therefore, we ask that you act with the appropriate decorum 
that a council meeting deserves. Commentary and conversations by the public are distracting. Should 
anyone disrupt the council meeting in any way, the meeting will be stopped and that person's 
behaviour will be reprimanded.<br>

<p align=center><font size=5><b>How to Sell to the District of Maple Ridge</b></font></p>
<p>The goal of the Purchasing Division of the Corporation of the District of Maple Ridge is to

Municipality and all its taxpayers. Best value includes many characteristics including but not 
limited to: availability, suitability, serviceability, transportation, required training, warranty, 
design, overall life cycle cost implications, and other significant applicable characteristics. 
With each individual purchase these characteristics can change. </p>
<p>The types of goods and services we procure are too numerous to list in full, but some 
examples are: vehicles, heavy duty equipment, parts, pipe, road installation, water and 
sewer services, computer equipment, office products and machines, office furniture, 
consulting services, building and grounds maintenance services, communications, safety 
supplies, fire fighting apparatus and equipment, first aid supplies, drafting supplies, printing 
services, signage, janitorial, electrical, and the list goes on and on. </p>
<p>Some goods and services are purchased repetitively, others rarely. </p>
<p><font size=4><b>How does a supplier get on the Bidder's List? </b></font></p>

<p><font size=3><b>District Financial Results Show Prudence, Careful Planning<br>
</b>At a time when people want more value for their tax dollar, the District of Maple Ridge is 
meeting the challenge. Property taxes for general operating services have remained frozen at 
1993 levels and the District has taken a creative and strong approach to improving service 
while reducing expenses. The District has achieved numerous successes through innovation, 
business process improvements and technological advances.<br>
<br>
These innovations and improvements include adopting a more flexible, customer service 
driven model, more efficient software and computer support, and streamlining of staff time 
and work methods. These achievements come at a time when all governments are facing 
pressure to develop a revenue structure that meets demands for new or enhanced services, 
and to accommodate the escalating cost of existing services.<br>
<br>
Municipalities face special challenges in trying to meet both the need for more services and 
less taxation. There is a fundamental difference between the impact of a 0% increase for a 
municipality compared to the federal or provincial governments. For senior governments, a 
0% change in the tax rates has a built in inflationary increase. Their revenues rise as the 
economy grows. <br>
<br>
At the municipal level, however, a 0% property tax change, provides no additional revenues 
to offset inflationary costs of service delivery. For example, in 1995 our tax revenue 
increased by $829,000 or 3.8% due only to favourable growth - more new residents 
buying properties. However, growth brings with it cost increases and pressures to provide 
more services. Fire and police service costs for example, increased 8.7% during the same 
period as the 3.8% increase in tax revenues. Says Jake Sorba, municipal Director of 
Finance, &quot;Even if we had no growth, we would still have service costs and inflation. 
Residents are getting very good value for their money.&quot;<br>
<br>
Most of the consolidated surplus for 1995 was a result of the treatment of capital and 
reserve funds. Operating funds, on which taxation and fees are based showed only a 
moderate surplus; the Waterworks Utility Fund had an operating deficit, and the Sanitary 
Sewer Utility Fund an operating surplus.<br>
<br>
The District's Sewer and Water Funds are run like separate companies, and like any 
business, they must pay for themselves. Significant cost increases have occurred over the 
years to pay for new mains, treatment plants and other infrastructure. As Maple Ridge 
grows, and environmental concerns become ever more of a priority, cost increases for 
efficient infrastructure will continue. Like private business, in order for sewer and water 
services to continue to be reliable and to be poised to meet future demand, they must show 
a profit. <br>
<br>
Revenue sources for Maple Ridge include tax money from senior governments, grants, user 
fees and licence and permit fees. However, the major source of revenue for Maple Ridge is 
property taxes and the largest tax class is Residential. Interestingly, actual tax revenue, 
adjusted for inflation and growth, has remained flat or declined since 1986! In fact, Maple 
Ridge residents enjoy one of the lowest general municipal taxes in the province. The District 
intends to remain vigilant in regard to Residential taxes, and to encourage a competitive cost 
structure for growth in the Business and Industrial sectors.<br>
<br>
As a part of the Official Community Plan review conducted last year, the District undertook 
a comprehensive public opinion poll. The Angus Reid results reported that &quot;Surprisingly , in 
this period of tax protests, and criticism of government expenditure, most Maple Ridge 
residents are satisfied with the municipal services they receive and the value for their tax 
dollars paid.&quot; In 1995, Maple Ridge received the prestigious Canadian Award for Financial 
Reporting (CAnFR) based on financial reporting and the Distinguished Budget Presentation 
Award for budgeting. These awards recognized the District's commitment to quality and the 
highest standards.<br>
<br>
In order to meet the challenges of the future Maple Ridge must remain cognizant of factors 
such as declining federal transfer payments to provinces that may result in downloading of 
costs to local governments, aging infrastructure requiring increased maintenance and the 
increasing pressures of growth to provide increasing services. The District is poised to meet 
those challenges. Residents can obtain a copy of the 1995 Comprehensive Annual Report 
from the Finance Department at Municipal Hall.</font><font size=4> </font></p>

to thank the people of Maple Ridge for the support given me and the 
elected Councillors at the polls on November 16,1996. As a Council, we

<p>I would like to congratulate Jim Clements, Candace Gordon and Betty Levens on their 
re-election. To Linda King, Ken Stewart, and Tom Baker - congratulations on winning a 
seat on Council. I hope your involvement in Municipal Government will be rewarding. To all 
of you, welcome to the 1996 to 1999 Municipal Council. Each of you has a great deal to 
offer and I look forward to our successful association and to providing good government to 
the citizens of Maple Ridge. </p>
<p>To retiring Councillor Jon Harris - you will be missed; but you can take satisfaction from 
knowing that you served your community well. I know you have always given your best. 
On behalf of the citizens of Maple Ridge, I thank you for your contribution to the provision 
of good government for our community.<br>
</p>
<p>Thank you to Councillors Ernie Day and Franz Prokop for your service to the community 
over the past three years. Your contributions will be part of building our complete 
community.<br>
</p>
<p>To the other candidates who were unsuccessful in the election, I know you will continue 
your community involvement.<br>
</p>
<p>Council business is transacted at the Council table. Council established two standing 
committees to deal with recommendations to Council on broad policy-related matters. I will 
continue the process with some minor changes. </p>
<p>The Corporate and Community Services, and Planning and Operational Committees, will 
remain. Each Committee will be made up of three Councillors.<br>
</p>
<p>The Committee of the Whole will have two sub-committees: a Budget Committee to deal 
with annual and long range financial plans and a Labour Relations Committee to focus on a 
new collective agreement that will be negotiated in the first quarter of 1997.<br>
</p>
<p>The Council meetings will continue to be held in the evenings - generally the second and 
fourth Tuesdays of the month. Meetings of Council In Camera will be held Monday 
afternoons as will the Council/Staff meetings that are used to work on completing our goals 
and objectives. A schedule of meetings for 1997 will be available.<br>
</p>
<p>We will continue with two special purpose citizens&iacute; committees to provide 
recommendations to Council on how certain issues should be handled.<br>
</p>
<p>1. Transit Service Review:<br>
</p>
<p>To be chaired by Councillor Baker and to have representation from Whonnock, Webster&iacute;s 
Corners, Hammond, Albion, Yennadon, and two people from the Core Area. I ask the 
Chair of this Committee to keep informed of actions taken, or proposed, by the Vancouver 
Regional Transit Commission and to provide advice about levels of transit services needed 
by our residents. </p>
<p>2. Air Quality Review: <br>
</p>
<p>To be chaired by Councillor Gordon and have representation from Whonnock, Webster&iacute;s 
Corners, Hammond, Silver Valley, Albion, the Core, and three members from the Urban 
Area. Two bylaws that are currently under review are the Burning Bylaw and the Smoking 
Bylaw.<br>
</p>
<p>One of our goals will be the construction of a new animal shelter during the next year. 
Councillor Clements and I will work with the GVRD to follow up on previous plans at 
Kanaka Creek Park.<br>
</p>
<p>I am also asking Councillors Levens and King to co-chair a committee to address the 
Library/Cultural/Theatre issue in the downtown area. I will set aside $2 million for future 
development from sale of lands, and will ask volunteers and fund-raisers to set aside a goal 
for a three-year period.<br>
</p>
<p>In Planning we have completed the Official Community Plan. Eighteen months of work 
completed the first major review in 12 years. This will set the guidelines for the next decade.<br>
</p>
<p>I am very pleased that we have an Advisory Design Panel to review developments and I 
will assign Councillor Stewart as the liaison from Council. <br>
</p>
<p>The 1997 Budget deliberations will focus on: </p>
<ul>
<li>enhancing environmental protection </li>
<li>water to the east end of Maple Ridge </li>
<li>a chipping and composting site as a top priority. </li>
</ul>
<p>As Mayor, I am very pleased with our working arrangement with Pitt Meadows. The Joint 
Leisure Service Agreement is working very well. We are also considering future 
partnerships which could include Pitt Meadows Airport. <br>
</p>
<p>Our Finance Department has, over the past three consecutive years, received the Canadian 
Award for Financial Reporting as well as the Award for Distinguished Budget Presentation.<br>
</p>
<p>Our debt per capita in 1993 was $400 and in 1996 is $300.<br>
</p>
<p>Downtown development is very important to our community. We have committed to a 25% 
reduction of Development Cost Charges in the Core and have set aside funds for 
streetscape improvements. There will be a Downtown Action Plan to recruit business and 
streamline regulations.<br>
</p>
<p>I want to see a plan for beautification and care of Maple Ridge to make it a complete 
community open for business, making jobs available, and ensuring funds are available for 
the health and safety of our community. <br>
</p>
<p>This Council will establish formal goals and objectives by developing a business plan for the 
Corporation and ensuring that the public interest is being served. We have scheduled 
meetings during December 1996 to start the process. I hope to have a completed set of 
goals and an implementation schedule before the end of 1997. Council and staff will meet 
every second week to exchange information and collectively work to achieve our goals.<br>
</p>
<p>I expect Councillors to be informed of all discussions affecting the Municipality. When 
Councillors meet with individuals or agencies relating to Council business, a brief written 
report must be submitted to the other Council members.<br>
</p>
<p>I want our Seniors to be safe and to feel safe in Maple Ridge. I will continue to work 
closely with Community Law Enforcement and the Seniors to make sure their safety is 
assured. <br>
</p>
<p>I look forward to this Council working together as a team. We will not always agree on all 
issues, but I expect each Councillor to deal with the issues not the personalities. By working 
together, we will accomplish our goals and provide good government for our citizens. I will 
not, at this time, direct Councillors to work on my priorities, other than the one that 
establishes our goals and objectives. I hope we can work together to accomplish our goals 
and objectives and our joint goals for our community.<br>
</p>
<p>I invite our residents to take an active interest in their municipality. With sufficient 
involvement from our citizens, we will make Maple Ridge a better community for us all. 
Over the next three years, I intend to hold public forums in the various communities to listen 
to the views of as many people as possible. Early next year we will set a schedule for these 
meetings.<br>
</p>
<p>I wish each of you here today and all the citizens of Maple Ridge a happy, healthy and 
prosperous New Year.<br>
<br>
Respectfully submitted,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carl E. Durksen<br>
Mayor<br>

<TITLE>Career Development Information For Prospective Students</TITLE>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<font face="HELVETICA,ARIAL" size=-1>
<H2>Career Development Information For Prospective Students</H2>
The Career Development Office (CDO) provides a full range of services to support the career decision-making process.  Students, graduates, and prospective employers are served through a wide variety of programs including:  job vacancy announcements; newsletters on current career information; individual and group counseling on resume preparation, self-assessment, interviewing skills development, and job-search strategy; a career development resource library; an alumni career network; and seminars and panel presentations covering legal career topics as well as alternative career options.  Students are further served through significant employer-support programs such as fall campus interviewing, off-campus regional interviewing, and a resume referral system in the Spring.
<p>
The CDO's priority is to serve the career needs of all students and alumni.  With that in mind, it is important that you know, no matter what your status - prospective student, present student, experienced alumna/us - that the job market of 1996-97 is an incredibly competitive field.  According to the most recent employment statistics reported to the National Association for Law Placement, for the class of 1995 39,305, law students graduated from the 177 ABA-accredited law schools across the nation.  
<P>
We at the CDO believe it is imperative that you investigate your decision to become a lawyer thoroughly and research not only your law institution of choice, but also the nature of the job market today and predictions for employment in the future.
<P>
Attending law school is a serious consideration.  We hope that you will consider The George Washington University Law School.   

<H3>GENERAL SUPPORT ACTIVITIES</H3>

The Career Development Office commits considerable financial and personnel resources to a variety of support activities.  These activities are geared toward in-depth job seeking support for the general student body, especially those whose interests are not served through job fair- type interviewing programs.


	<H3>1.  Job Vacancy Advertising</H3>

During the 1995 calendar year, the Career Development Office processed and advertised approximately 3,500 legal job vacancies to which students and alumni could directly apply.  These opportunities included summer positions, part-time jobs during the academic year, experienced lawyer positions, full-time positions for evening division students, entry-level attorney positions, judicial clerkships, internships, and opportunities to teach.

	<H3>2.  Individual and Group Counseling</H3>

An integral component of office services is individual and group counseling.  Professional staff members meet personally with hundreds of students and alumni each year to provide valuable guidance in the job-search process.  Counseling takes many forms and includes "basic tools" preparation (resumes, cover letters, application procedures, etc.), employment market insight (career options, interpreting organizational research, and job-search strategy), and personal career counseling (self-assessment, and skills recognition and development).  Between July, 1995 and February, 1996 the office staff spent over 650 hours providing individual counseling assistance to students and alumni.


	<H3>3.  Career Development Resource Library and Reference Files</H3>

Through the Career Development Office Resource Library, students and graduates gain access to a wealth of materials supporting the legal job search.  The library collection includes over 350 books and directories providing information on legal career planning, employment trends and statistics, employer profiles, prospective employer contact information, alternative careers, state bar exam application information, review courses, standard application procedures to government agencies, educational opportunities in the U.S. and abroad, subscriptions to legal periodicals including magazines, newsletters, bulletins and newspapers, and handout materials on job-search basics such as resume writing, interviewing, and cover letter preparation.

	<H3>4.  Skill Development Workshops</H3>

Frequently during the academic year, the Career Development Office sponsors informational seminars and workshops to which the student body is invited.  Workshop topics cover such items as effective resume writing, networking, preparing standard federal government employment application forms, and successful interviewing skills.

	<H3>5.  Bi-Weekly Newsletter, the Career Development Office Student Handbook, and Informational Handouts</H3>

The Noteworthy newsletter is published twice monthly and distributed to students in an attempt to keep them informed of upcoming programs, general career news, trends in hiring, changes in bar examination rules, deadlines, and other pertinent information.  To facilitate student job-search preparation, the Career Development Office has composed a number of 
valuable resource handouts on preparing resumes, interviewing, selecting references, federal application forms completion, and cover letter writing.  Students may secure these materials at any time by visiting the Career Development Office.  The Career Development Office Student Handbook provides students with insight into office services, policies and practices.


	<H3>6.  Graduate Career Opportunities Newsletter</H3>

The Graduate Career Opportunities Newsletter is published bi-weekly and is distributed free of charge to alumni at their individual request.  The Newsletter announces vacant positions that require law school graduation and legal experience.  Positions are advertised for many locations across the country, and include all those brought to the attention of the Career Development Office.


	<H3>7.  Specialized Recruiting Efforts for Particular Populations</H3>

Within the law school exist several student populations facing unique considerations in the job-search process.  They include such groups as foreign students, minority students, evening students, LL.M. students, and students with a specialized legal career focus.  The Career Development Office provides support in the form most suited to the particular student group.  Minority students are served through the Minority Clerkship Student Internship Program and the Minority Mock Interview Program.  Foreign students receive individual assistance resulting in targeted letters to specific employers.  Evening students are served through the Evening Express, a series of programs that addresses the special concerns of evening students.


	<H3>8.  Mock Interview Program</H3>

The purpose of mock interviews is to aid students in developing sharp interviewing skills by placing them in a simulated interview situation.  The 20-minute videotaped interviews are conducted by local attorneys (usually GW law school alumni) and legal recruiters who are proficient in this practice.  Students, under the guidance of a career consultant, review their taped session in order to gain insight into personal style and interview strengths or weaknesses, and develop new strategies for improving individual interview techniques.  This past semester, the CDO conducted four days of mock interviewing with seventy-two students participating in the program.


	<H3>9.  Legal Career Panels/Brown Bag Lunches</H3>

The Career Development Office offers a series of presentations geared for first-year law students.  Alumni employed in different areas of legal practice (large firm, small firm, corporations, Capitol Hill/associations, alternative careers, public interest, and federal government/judicial) share their experiences and offer information about their practices as well as specific practice areas.  


	<H3>10.  Alumni Career Network</H3>

The George Washington University Law School Alumni Career Network is a resource that facilitates alumni and student career exploration.  The Network, national in scope, is comprised of law school graduates who have agreed to be a contact for students and fellow alumni in need of career information and advice.  Networkers conduct informational interviews with alumni in order to investigate practice areas, geographic areas, employers, employment trends and alternative career options.  Over 1,000 alumni are members of the Network.

	<H3>13.  Pro Bono Students America</H3>

Pro Bono Students America (PBSA) is a national network of pro bono and public interest programs.  Its mission is to help match law students and public interest organizations seeking student assistance on pro bono or public interest projects.  In conducting a search with PBSA, students specify the issues they want to work on, the kind of experience they're looking for, the hours they want to work, etc.  After students select their top three choices, the PBSA Coordinator forwards their resume to the organizations in order of preference.  Students are asked to commit at least five hours a week and a total of 50 hours a semester.


	<H3>12.  Small Firm Initiatives</H3>

Small law firms traditionally recruit as the need arises rather than participate in organized interview programs.  In order to assist small firm employers, the Career Development Office posts job announcements and/or collects resumes upon request.  In the spring, the Career Development Office targets GW alumni in small DC area law firms, collecting resumes from students seeking small firm employment and matching students and firms by practice area.   


	<H3>13.  Alternative</H3>

In recent years students and alumni have increasingly been interested in exploring careers which are not traditional.  The CDO attempts to provide information and programming to those interested in exploring this career option.  Panel presentations by alumni in legal and non-legal positions including corporations, non-profit organizations, higher education and publishing are offered.  Resources housed in the CDO Resource Library further assist students investigating alternative careers.  The Alumni Network is a wonderful resource for identifying examples of such types of careers.


<H3>INTERVIEWING PROGRAMS OFFERED BY THE CAREER DEVELOPMENT OFFICE</H3>

In addition to the general support activities, the Career Development Office administers campus, regional, and cooperative interviewing programs which provide actual job interviewing opportunities to a wide segment of the student population.  In 1995-96 approximately 620 employers participated in at least one of the five interviewing programs which are outlined in detail below.


	<H3>1.  Fall Interviewing Program</H3>

The Career Development Office organizes a strong fall interviewing program.  Over 250 participating employers represented 24 states and the District of Columbia.  Interviewing organizations primarily included law firms.  Legal services offices, corporations, government agencies, accounting firms, and District Attorneys' offices also participate to a lesser degree.  Approximately 74 employers unable to interview through the formal Fall Interviewing Program requested that the Career Development Office collect resumes for their review and follow-up.  Other employers requested that students contact them directly.  Through this direct-write process approximately 100 summer positions and permanent positions for students were listed.

	<H3>2.  Regional Interviewing Programs</H3>

Regional interviewing programs provide opportunities for students to interview with prospective employers in selected or targeted geographic locations across the country.  During Fall 1995, the Career Development Office conducted regional off-campus interviewing programs in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City and Philadelphia.  In 1996, we are adding two programs in Atlanta and San Francisco.  
<P>
Regional programs supplemented the campus interviewing process by providing students exposure to 65 firms and organizations that did not otherwise interview through Fall Interviewing Program.  Employers likewise benefitted from this effort by seeing qualified candidates who might have been overlooked as a result of the organization's limited campus recruitment program.  Students participating in "regionals" cover their own travel and other personal expenses.

The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies is a group of conservatives and libertarians interested in the current state of the legal order.  It is founded on the principles that the state exists to preserve freedom, that the separation of government powers is central to our Constitution, and that it is emphatically the province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is, not what it should be.  The Society seeks both to promote an awareness of these principles and 
to further their application through it activities.  This entails reordering priorities within the legal system to place a premium on individual liberty, tradition-al values, and the rule of law.

<TITLE>Doctor of Juridical Science</TITLE>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<font face="HELVETICA,ARIAL" size=-1>
<h2>Doctor of Juridical Science</h2>

The Law School admits a very limited number of cadidates for the Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D.) degree.  This is a highly specialized, research-oriented program and is open only to individuals with outstanding academic qualifications and demonstrated research interests in their field of study.


<H3>Entrance Requirements</H3>

<H4>U.S. Law School Graduates</H4>

For S.J.D. applicants who earned their first law degree from a U.S. law school, the following entrance requirements pertain.  Applicants must hold a B.A. or equivalent degree from a regionally accredited college or university and a J.D. and an LL.M. or equivalent degrees, both earned with excellent records, from law schools that are members of AALS or approved by the ABA.  (The requirement for an LL.M. may be waived in exceptional circumstances.)  Applicants must submit copies of their master's thesis or one or more papers or articles they have written.  Applicants must include a research proposal and dissertation topic approved by a full-time member of the Law School faculty who has agreed to serve as the faculty adviser if the applicant is admitted.

<H4>Foreign Law School Graduates</H4>

For S.J.D. applicants who earned their first law degree at a foreign law school, the following entrance requirements pertain.  Applicants must have graduated with an excellent academic record from a foreign law school known for high academic standards; such a determination will be made by the director of the International Legal Studies Program or by a qualified faculty member.  As outlined above for U.S. attorneys, additional requirements include an LL.M. degree (which may be waived in exceptional circumstances), copies of the master's thesis or one or more papers or articles written by the applicant, and a research proposal and dissertation topic approved by a full-time member of the Law School faculty who has agreed to serve as the faculty adviser if the applicant is admitted.  Consideration for admission requires proficiency in the English language, both oral and written, as determined by the director of the International Legal Studies Program or by a faculty member designated by the dean.

<H3>Degree Requirements</H3>

Candidates for the Doctor of Juridical Science must complete the following requirements in order to be awarded the degree: A residence period of not less than one academic year; a course of study and research, designated by the candidate's dissertation committee, of no less than eight credit hours; and completion and acceptance of a dissertation.  The dissertation must be submitted no later than three years from the date of matriculation into the S.J.D. program.

For general office policies and procedures, students should refer to the most recent Student
Handbook.  Additional guidelines followed by the Career Development Office (CDO) are set by
The National Association for Law Placement (NALP).  Students and employers should become
familiar with the policies, procedures and guidelines set forth in the NALP Directory of Legal
Employers.  Failure to adhere to general office policies or NALP guidelines will result in a loss
of access to the resources of the CDO.  A copy of the Directory is available in the CDO

<h3>Pro Bono Students America</h3>
     Want to acquire some client-intake experience?  Do you have
five hours a week to donate to a community organization but don't
know where to find volunteer opportunities?  Still looking for a
public interest job this summer?   A new program is available at
the Career Development Office to facilitate your job search.
<p>
     What is it?  Pro Bono Students America (PBSA) is a national
network of law school pro bono and public interest programs, and
its mission is to help law students find valuable and manageable
volunteer projects during the school year and the summer. 
Georgetown University Law Center recently became the
administrative
center for the Capital States region of PBSA, which serves law
school and organizations in DC, Maryland, Virginia, Delaware,
West
Virginia, Kentucky, and North Carolina.
<p>
     The PBSA computer database uses specific criteria to match
students with organizations--government agencies, legal aid
societies, non-profits, judges and private firms--seeking student
assistance on pro bono or public interest projects.  You can
specify the issues you want to work on, the kind of experience
you're looking for, the number of hours you want to work,  whether
you want flexible hours, and a number of other options designed
to
ensure that you get the volunteer position that is right for you.

So, if you want a position in a public defender's office but can
only spare a few hours a week, PBSA will help you find one.  Or,
if
you're interested in working on women's issues in Chicago for the
summer, PBSA will generate a list for you of Chicago-based
women's
groups seeking summer interns.
<p>
     The computer generates a list of groups that meet  some, if
not all, of the student's criteria.  Students select their top
three choices from the list and the PBSA Coordinator faxes the
student's resume to the organizations in order of preference. 
The
organizations are asked to contact the student within 3-5 days. 
Students are asked to commit at least five hours a week and a
total
of 50 hours a semester.
<p>
     Any GW Law student interested in PBSA should contact Laura Lane at <A HREF="mailto:laura@cdo.nlc.gwu.edu">laura@cdo.nlc.gwu.edu</A> or
(202) 994-7340.
<p>
     Employers interested in becoming part of PBSA should contact
Barbara Moulton at Georgetown University Law Center, 111 F
Street,
N.W., Washington, D.C.  20001-2095, (202) 662-9654.

<h3>Employer Information</h3>

<h3>Recruiting Options</h3>

The Career Development Office is dedicated to providing a variety
of recruiting options for all kinds of legal employers.  We offer
fall and spring interview programs and year-round job posting
services.  This year over two-hundred and fifty employers
participated in the Fall and Regional Interview Programs.  A
spring interview program, the Public Interest Interview Program,
and Small Firm Interviewing during the spring semester, will bring additional
employers on-campus.  And for those employers that do not
interview on-campus, our resume referral service is a viable
option.
<p>
<h3>The Public Interest Interview Program</h3>

The George Washington University Law School and Georgetown
University Law Center sponsor a Public Interest/Public Service
Recruitment Program for public interest employers to interview
law students from both schools for paid summer and volunteer
postitions and permanent positions.   For more information and registration materials please contact Kristen Marshall
at <A HREF="mailto:kristen@cdo.nlc.gwu.edu">kristen@cdo.nlc.gwu.edu</A>or (202) 994-7340.


<h3>The Small Firm Interview Program</h3>

For employers who recruit later in the school year and hire as
positions become available, the Career Development Office offers
in-house interview rooms for on-campus recruiting.  With a full
schedule, an employer may see up to twenty-one students in one
day.  Interviews are usually twenty or thirty minutes in length
and employers pre-screen one hundred percent of the students they
see. Interview rooms are available Monday through
Saturday during the spring semester.  For more information and registration materials please contact Kristen Marshall
at <A HREF="mailto:kristen@cdo.nlc.gwu.edu">kristen@cdo.nlc.gwu.edu</A>or (202) 994-7340.


<h3>The Fall Interview Program</h3>

The Fall Interview Program takes place during the month of
September.  Employers have the option of interviewing near the
law school campus or in their D.C. office.  Employers
participating in the program prescreen the students they
interview and determine the total number of students they see. 
The Career Development Office oversees all arrangements for the
interview day.

<h3>Regional Interview Programs</h3>

Employers who wish to interview students without all the time and
expense associated with traveling out-of-town participate in a
Regional Interview Program.  If a recruitment trip to Washington
is inconvenient, we strongly encourage employers to participate
in one of our Regional Interview Programs.  As with the Fall
Interview Program near campus, employers recruiting in regional
locations prescreen the students they interview.  This year plans
are underway for programs in Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, New
York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco.   When program dates,
locations and other information is available, this site will be
updated.


<h3>Employer Registration</h3>

Employer registration for the Fall and Regional Interview
Programs will be accepted by mail or fax using a request form. 
This site will be updated with more information as it becomes available.

<h3>Resume Referrals</h3>
The Career Development Office will collect and forward resumes to
employers upon request during the fall and spring semester.  The
CDO will post the request, collect resumes from interested
students and forward them to employers.  Requests for a resume
referral are accepted by mail or fax.  Request letters must
include the following basic information about your hiring needs:
type of job; practice area for which you are hiring; if multiple
offices, locations for which you are hiring; student year
requested; hiring criteria; and organizational literature.  There
is no fee for a resume referral.

<h3>Job Announcements</h3>


Job announcements or job posting is a service the Career
Development Office offers year round free of charge.  Job
Announcements are made available to students and alumni in the
Career Development Office Resource Library and posted under one
or more of the categories listed below.


<h3>Job Announcement Categories</h3>

<B>WELCOME TO THE LAW LIBRARY</B><P>
<P>
Welcome to the Jacob Burns Law Library.  The primary goal of the
Library staff is to provide the best possible service to the
students and faculty of the National Law Center and others using
the Library.  We encourage you to ask for assistance or information
from any Library employee to help us achieve that goal.  We also
ask that you make suggestions which will assist us in improving our
services or collection.<P>
<P>
The Library Guide is intended to serve as an introduction to the
Jacob Burns Law Library.  It offers brief descriptions of the
services, resources, and facilities of the Library.  It also
provides maps to help users locate specific materials and
collections.  Finally, the Guide recites some of the rules of
library conduct which users are asked to observe to maintain an
atmosphere conducive to study and research.<P>
<P>
A law library is the laboratory of the legal researcher.  The Jacob
Burns Law Library provides researchers with an impressive array of
resources from many jurisdictions and in many formats to meet their
needs.  Approximately 400,000 volumes form the core of the research
collection.  In addition, the Library offers a variety of legal and
law-related databases and automated indexes to enhance research
capabilities.  Library patrons can use these many resources to
investigate the federal and state laws of the United States, as
well as international and selected foreign laws.  Particular
emphasis has been placed on collecting materials which support the
major programs of the National Law Center, including works on
environmental law, intellectual property law, and programs of the
federal government.  Researchers also will find important resources
focusing on international organizations and international human
rights.<P>
<P>
We hope that your time spent in the Jacob Burns Law Library is
productive, informative, and rewarding.  Please let us know if
there are ways in which we can help you.<P>

<A NAME="FAQ">
<H2>Frequently Asked Questions</H2>

<STRONG>What are the entrance requirements for the J.D. degree?</STRONG>
<P>
An applicant must have a bachelor's degree awarded by a regionally accredited college or university and must have taken the <A HREF="http://www.lsac.org/">Law School Admission Test</A> (LSAT) within the past three years.
<P>
<STRONG>What is the J.D. program application deadline?</STRONG>
<P>
March 1.  Applicants are strongly urged to submit their applications as soon as possible after October 1.  Those who wait until March 1 to submit their application may not have a completed file for several more weeks, or when we receive your LSDAS report (see below).
<P>
<STRONG>What is the application fee?</STRONG>
<P>
$55
<P>
<STRONG>How do I apply for the J.D. program?</STRONG>
<P>
The process begins when you submit a completed application form, which may be either the form available from the Admissions Office or the version generated by <A HREF="http://www.ot.com/multi-app/">LAW MULTI-App</A> software.  The application form should be accompanied by a $55 application fee.
<P>
Every applicant must register with the <A HREF="http://www.lsac.org/">Law School Data Assembly Service</A> (LSDAS).  This service provides a report that standardizes undergraduate grades and lists the applicant's LSAT score.  The report also includes a copy of the writing sample of the LSAT and copies of all transcripts.  The Law School orders a copy of the LSDAS report once a completed application is received.
<P>
<STRONG>When does the admission process begin?</STRONG>
<P>
Once an applicant's file is complete, i.e., once a completed application and LSDAS report have been received.
<P>

<STRONG>Can the application fee be waived?</STRONG>
<P>
The application fee may be waived in cases of extreme financial need.  The number of fee waivers granted each year is limited to five percent of the previous year's applicant volume, and waivers are awarded on a first come, first served basis.  An application for such a waiver may be obtained from the Admissions Office.
<P>

<STRONG>Can I begin the J.D. program in the spring?</STRONG>
<P>
No.  Beginning J.D. students may begin in the fall semester only.
<P>
<STRONG>Are letters of recommendation required as part of the application?</STRONG>
<P>
Letters of recommendation are not required, but we encourage applicants to submit two recommendations.  Letters of recommendation should be included, in sealed envelopes, with the application materials.  If the applicant's undergraduate school maintains a packet of recommendations on file, he or she should arrange to have the packet sent directly to the Admissions Office.
<P>

<STRONG>Can I visit the Law School?</STRONG>
<P>
Yes!  Prospective students are invited to visit the Law School, Monday through Friday, between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.  Admission counselors are available on a walk-in basis to answer questions about the admission process.
<P>
<STRONG>Does the Admissions Office conduct personal interviews?</STRONG>
<P>
No. While admission counselor's are happy to meet with prospective students, these sessions are solely for your information and have no bearing on the admission decision.
<P>
<STRONG>Can I attend a Law School class?</STRONG>
<P>
Yes.  Arrangements can be made for you to sit in on a class.  Contact the Admissions Office for further details.
<P>

<STRONG>Does the Law School accept visiting students?</STRONG>
<P>
Yes. A student in good standing as a degree candidate at an accredited law school may be admitted to the Law School as an unclassified student in order to earn credit for transfer back to his or her home institution.  The majority of visiting students do their course work at the Law School in the summer, but fall and spring semester applications are accepted as well.  Admission will be based primarily on the availability of space.  Applicants must submit a completed application, the $55 application fee, a law school transcript, and a letter of good standing from the dean of the applicant's law school. Application deadlines for visiting students are July 1 for the fall semester, December 1 for the spring semester, and May 21 for the summer session.
<P>
<STRONG>Can you transfer to the Law School?</STRONG>
<P>
Yes.  A limited number of places is available for students who wish to transfer in after completing one year of legal studies at an ABA accredited school.  A maximum of 28 credit hours may be applied to the Law School's degree requirements. Applicants must  submit a completed application, the $55 application fee, a law school transcript, a record of LSAT scores, and a letter of good standing from the dean of the applicant's law school.  Application deadlines are July 1 for the fall semester and December 1 for the spring semester.

<A NAME="process">
<H2>The J.D. Admission Process</H2></A>

The entering J.D. class of the Law School is selected from a pool of approximately 6,500 applicants. This large number permits the Admissions Committee, which is composed of full-time faculty members, the Assistant Dean for Admissions, and the Director of Admissions, to be highly selective. A majority vote of the Committee is required for an applicant to be admitted.
<P>
The Admissions Committee begins to review completed files in December, though the majority of decisions are made in February, March, and April. The order in which files are selected for review is based on the completion date (i.e., the date the LSDAS report is received). Due to the large volume of applications received, it may take as long as three or four weeks from the time of receipt of an application for a file to become complete. And, during the busiest part of the year (January through April), it may take an additional six to eight weeks for a decision to be made on a completed file. Phone calls and letters only hinder this process. Applicants who wish to be informed of the status of their application should complete and submit the two postcards included in the back of this booklet. Applicants who need an early decision should complete their application in the fall.
<P>
All material submitted by the applicant (including the personal statement and letters of recommendation, if submitted) is considered before a decision is made. There are no inflexible standards, nor are there minimum grade-point averages or LSAT scores that are required. However, students whose undergraduate records and LSAT scores indicate a high probability of success in law study are in a favored position. Other factors considered in the admission decision include the undergraduate school attended and the student s major and trend in grades.
<P>
Consistent with the goal of providing an educationally stimulating and diverse environment, the Law School affirmatively seeks to recruit qualified members of groups (notably racial and ethnic minorities) that have been subject to discrimination in the past. This commitment includes considering all aspects of the applicant's personal and academic history in determining his or her potential for success in law school; conducting special recruitment programs; and awarding financial assistance upon a showing of financial need.
<P>
After the Admissions Committee has reviewed a file, a decision is made to admit, deny, or hold the application for a later review. Applicants are advised immediately of the decision, including placement in the "hold" category. Those admitted will receive a letter informing them of that action and requesting that a $100 deposit be submitted directly to the Admissions Office by April 15. Until this deadline has passed, a determination cannot be made regarding how many admitted applicants are seriously interested in coming to the Law School; consequently, the second review of applications in the hold category does not begin until after April 15. In late May, those admitted applicants who have submitted their $100 deposit are billed for a second deposit of $1,000, payable in mid-June. After the class is fully committed, the Admissions Committee may establish a waiting list and inform applicants that they will be admitted only if space becomes available.

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>All the specialized programs
are designed to be pursued either on a full- or part-time basis, and most
specialized courses are offered in the evening. The General LL.M. also
may be pursued on a full- or part-time basis, but students may find that
a number of their chosen courses are offered during the day. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>How much time is needed
to complete the degree?</B> </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>Degree requirements should
be completed in one calendar year (full-time attendance) or two calendar
years (part-time attendance). An additional year may be allowed for completion
of the thesis. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>What are degree requirements?</B>
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>24 credit hours, including
4 hours of thesis and the required number of credits in the field in the
specialized programs; attendance for a residence period of not less than
2 semesters, which should be consecutive; achievement of a grade point
average of 2.67 (for U.S. law school graduates) at the time all requirements
are met; and completion and acceptance of the thesis. Each student's overall
program (course selection and thesis topic) must be approved by the relevant
program director. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>What is required for the
thesis?</B> </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>The thesis should be a paper
similar in quality and length to a law review article. It is not a dissertation
and need not be defended before a committee. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Is it possible to pursue
more than one specialty?</B> </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>LL.M. candidates may pursue
a dual specialization by completing course requirements in each area, and
by writing a thesis that intersects both subject areas. A dual specialization
requires admission to both programs, and may require additional course
work. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Are any joint degree programs
offered at the Law School?</B> </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>GW offers a joint LL.M./M.P.H
degree for students pursuing an LL.M. in Environmental Law. Candidates
must be admitted by both the Law School and the School of Public Health.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>I've taken graduate law
courses elsewhere -- will they count toward my degree?</B> </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>No. Courses taken at other
institutions may not be counted for credit toward an LL.M. at GW Law School.
The only exception is up to 6 hours in courses taken at Georgetown University
Law Center through the consortium, but the student must already be a degree
candidate at GW. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>May I take one course
to see if I'm interested in the program?</B> </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>Not for credit. You must
be a degree-seeking student to receive credit for a course. If only one
or two courses are desired, they may be taken on a not-for-credit or CLE
basis, for which only a certificate of completion is issued. Completion
of a course on this basis will not be counted later toward LL.M. degree
requirements. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>How many courses are required
to maintain full-time/part-time status?</B> </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>Generally, full-time students
take 10 to 12 credit hours per semester, and part-time students between
4 and 6 hours. Relatively few courses are offered in the summer session,
so LL.M. students often use the summer to complete thesis requirements
or pursue independent research and writing projects. In order to receive
federal loans, a student must be registered for 5 hours for part-time status
or 9 hours for full-time status. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>How many students are
in the program?</B> </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>Enrollment varies from year
to year, but generally there are 50-70 students in the Environmental program,
10-15 in Government Procurement, 10-15 in Intellectual Property, 45-55
in International and Comparative (including foreign attorneys), and 5-7
in the General program. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>What does the Graduate
Admissions Committee look for in an application? What are the standards
of admission?</B> </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>A high standard of academic
excellence demonstrated while obtaining the first law degree, a clear demonstration
of interest in the subject area, relevant work experience, maturity, preparation,
and the intellectual capacity for advanced law study. Each application
is evaluated on an individual basis -- there is no GPA &quot;cutoff&quot;
or other absolute criteria. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Will the LL.M. degree
help me find employment in my chosen field?</B> </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>The availability of jobs
in a given field and a given geographic market varies from year to year.
Students are encouraged to make the most of the resources of the Law School
(e.g., the Career Development Office, alumni networks, internships). However,
your total record of scholastic achievement is the most important variable
in finding a job; an LL.M. degree cannot completely compensate for an average
J.D. record. Most students are successful in obtaining employment in their
field of study. Program faculty, including adjuncts who are experts in
their field as well as full-time practitioners, work with students to help
them obtain employment. </FONT></FONT><A NAME="process"></A></P>

- International Legal Studies LL.M. Program for Foreign Law School Graduates</FONT></FONT></H1>

<P><B><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>Do I need to have a law
degree to qualify for admission to the LL.M. program?</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>Yes. Students who hold any
of the following degrees or certificates are <B>NOT </B>eligible for the
program: a degree in international relations; a general bachelor's or master's
degree of arts; and patent examiner certificate or criminal prosecutor
certificate. You must have attended and graduated from a recognized law
faculty and the law degree received must be reflected on the university
transcript.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>Is taking the TOEFL mandatory,
and is 600 really the minimum score? Can you accept a photocopy of the
score? How old can the score be?</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>The TOEFL is mandatory, except
for those applicants who have received their law degree from a university
where English is the language of instruction. If your score is under 600,
your file will still be considered and evaluated. No student is denied
solely on the basis of a TOEFL score. Photocopies of TOEFL scores are NOT
accepted. The score report must be sent directly to the International Legal
Studies Program Office by the TOEFL Testing Service and the applicant's
picture and signature must be on the score report. Scores older than two
years will not be accepted.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>Are photocopies of official
transcripts accepted? What if the university in question refuses to submit
the transcript?</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>No. Transcripts must be original
and must be submitted in a signed and sealed envelope by the registrar
of the university directly to the International Legal Studies Program Office.
In extreme circumstances, a notarized copy will be accepted, provided the
applicant has contacted the ILSP Office in advance and explained the situation.
If a university refuses to send a transcript and will provide it only to
the student, the student can submit the transcript provided in an envelope
signed and sealed by the university registrar.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>Can a foreign attorney
start the program in the spring semester?</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>No. A foreign attorney can
only start in the fall semester as the student is required to take the
&quot;Introduction to American Law&quot; course, which is offered in fall
only.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>Are two letters of recommendation
mandatory, and must they be from law faculty?</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>Yes, two letters of recommendation
are required. They must be academic letters of reference, and should be
from law faculty. Professional letters of reference may also be submitted,
but they do not take the place of the academic references. Personal character
references may not be submitted in lieu of academic references.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>If an applicant wants
to apply for the Intellectual Property Law or Environmental Law program,
why does he or she have to be admitted to the International Legal Studies
Program? Will the academic program in question be different for foreign
students?</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>The International Legal Studies
Program was created specifically to admit and advise foreign attorneys
studying toward the LL.M. degree. The administrative staff, faculty directors,

transcripts from foreign institutions and other credentials submitted by
foreign applicants. Therefore, all applications must come to the ILS Program
Office, regardless of the specialization the applicant wishes to pursue.
The ILS Program staff are also specially qualified to advise foreign students
during their academic programs.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>While they are admitted to
the International Legal Studies Program, foreign LL.M. candidates in each
specialization pursue virtually the same academic program as their U.S.
counterparts and receive the same degree.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>Are foreign law school
graduates in the LL.M. program separated from the rest of the law school
when taking courses, i.e., do they take special courses or are they free
to choose from the Law School's curriculum?</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>Foreign attorneys are eligible

candidates. </FONT></FONT></P>

To Come

<A NAME="process">
<H2>Applying for Financial Aid</H2></A>
There are a number of sources of financial assistance available to students at the Law School. In order to be considered for financial aid:
<P>
The student and his or her parents must register with PROFILE through <A HREF="http://www.collegeboard.org/">College Scholarship Service</A> (CSS) in Princeton, New Jersey. Registration forms are available from the Law Financial Aid Office.
<P>
The student and his or her parents must file a <A HREF="http://www.ed.gov/prog_info/SFA/FAFSA/">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</A> (FAFSA) and submit it to the federal processor. Forms are available from any college or university.
<P>
A signed copy of all pages, schedules, and W-2 forms of the student's federal tax return and a signed copy of all pages, schedules, and W-2 forms of his or her parents' federal tax return should be submitted to the Law School's Financial Aid Office.
<P>
A Financial Aid Transcript completed by each U.S. post-secondary school attended should be forwarded to the Law School's Financial Aid Office.
<P>
Applicants are urged to submit their FAFSA and PROFILE forms to their respective processors early in January so that a completed analysis can be received by the Law School by March 1. Accepted applicants whose CSS/FAFSA data reach the Financial Aid Office after March 15 cannot be guaranteed a decision by April 15, and available funds may then be limited.
<P>
Once a student's financial aid file is completed it will be reviewed for a determination of the applicant's eligibility to borrow Stafford Loan funds, as well as a decision regarding the Law School's sources of financial aid. No awards will be made to an entering student until the admission process has been completed.

<H2>Sources of Aid</H2>
<H3>Law School Aid</H3>

<H3>Grants</H3>
There are a number of grants available to law students, based on financial need. Monies are awarded for the upcoming academic year only. In subsequent years, students' need must be reevaluated.

<H3><A HREF="http://www.ed.gov/prog_info/SFA/StudentGuide/1996-7/index.html">Federal Perkins Loans</A></H3>
Federal loans under this program are awarded by the Law School to a limited number of students on the basis of financial need. Repayment is at 5% and the maximum amount a student may receive cannot exceed a combined undergraduate and graduate total of $18,000. Interest and principal are deferred during the in-school period and for six months after the student ceases to be enrolled.

<H3>Loan Reimbursement Assistance Program </H3>
The Law School also provides assistance in repayment of legal education debt through its Loan Reimbursement Assistance Program (LRAP).  Graduates with educational debt who choose 
public interest employment may receive grants of up to $6,000 per year. Grant awards will depend on the nature of the employment, the applicant s commitment to public interest work, the applicant's and employer's financial need, and the amount of the applicant's educational debt.  The number and size of grants varies from year to year, depending on the number of applications and the availability of funds.  LRAP application forms are available from the Law School Financial Aid Office.

<H3>Other Sources of Aid</H3>

<H3><A HREF="http://www.ed.gov/prog_info/SFA/StudentGuide/1996-7/index.html">Federal Stafford Loans</a></H3>
Subsidized Stafford Loan eligibility is based on financial need, which is determined by the Financial Aid Office using the FAFSA analysis. It is possible to receive up to $8,500 a year at a variable rate of interest under this program. If the student qualifies for the need-based interest subsidy, the federal government pays the interest during the in-school period and for six months after the student ceases to be enrolled. If the student does not qualify for the subsidy, he or she may still receive the $8,500 Stafford Loan at the same interest rate, but the in-school interest accrues, and there is no post-enrollment grace period. Students who have never borrowed a Stafford Loan should request a Stafford application through a national lender from the Law School's Financial Aid Office.
<P>
Unsubsidized Stafford Loans are available to students at a variable interest rate, in amounts up to $10,000 per year. (Students who do not qualify for the interest subsidy on the first $8,500 Stafford Loan may receive an unsubsidized Stafford Loan of $18,500.)

<H3>Credit-Based Loans</H3>
There are several private loan plans available to credit-worthy applicants; a detailed chart of the private loans used by Law School students may be obtained from the Law Financial Aid Office. 
In general, this type of loan provides $1,500 to $20,000 per academic year, up to varying aggregate amounts, depending on the lender. Typically the interest rate is determined by adding 
percentage points to either the 91-day Treasury bill rate or the prime rate, and a guarantee fee and/or insurance fee may be charged. Some programs allow students to defer payments of interest and principal during enrollment. Repayment of such loans usually begins within 60 days of the student s last day of half-time enrollment, at which time both interest and principal become due. We urge applicants to examine their credit report in advance of applying for aid. A history of timely payments (not accounts paid in full) determines whether a student will qualify for credit-based loans.

</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<font face="HELVETICA,ARIAL" size=-1>
<h2>Full-and Part-Time Programs of Study</h2>


Once admitted to the J.D. degree program, candidates may choose one of three options for their first year of study: the Full-Time Day Division, the Full-Time Day/Evening Division, or the Part-Time Evening Division. Each division has the same academic standards, and all required and core courses are taught by the full-time faculty. First-year Day Division classes generally are scheduled between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. First-year Day/Evening Division classes generally meet between 3 and 7:40 p.m. First-year Evening Division classes generally meet between 5:50 and 7:40 p.m. For all divisions, the Legal Research and Writing and Introduction to Advocacy classes can be scheduled in the late evening between 7:50 and 9:40 p.m. After the first year, all full-time students must take the majority of their courses during the day.
<p>
Part-time students may be allowed to transfer to the full-time division after the first year, with the permission of the dean. Under the Law School's residency requirement, a full-time student normally will take six semesters of study, or three academic years, in order to complete the degree. A part-time student normally will take eight semesters, or four academic years, and one summer session. For students who change their status from full-time to part-time or vice versa, the number of semesters of attendance required to meet the residency requirement will vary proportionally.
<p>
  Students who attend full-time are expected to devote substantially all of their time during the academic year to study. First-year students in the full-time divisions are especially urged to refrain from outside employment. Upper-class students taking more than 10 credit hours of course work must limit outside employment to no more than 20 hours per week.

<h2>The First Year and the Required Curriculum</h2>
Each first-year student is assigned to a sec-tion of 85-120 students, and the section has its classes together throughout the first year. Students in a section thus get to know each other quite well and develop lasting friendships out of their first-year experience.The prescribed first-year curriculum is the foundation upon which all further legal study is built. In addition to the fundamental knowledge acquired in the traditional, substantive courses, students begin to develop important skills in the Legal Research and Writing and Introduction to Advocacy courses. These classes of approximately 12 students are co-taught by practicing attorneys and third-year law students. The third-year students, or Research Fellows, are selected at the end of their second year on the basis of demonstrated research and writing ability, communication skills, and commitment to teaching.The required curriculum is as follows:<P>FULL-TIME DAY DIVISION<BR>(First year)<BR><I>Fall semester</I><UL>	<LI>Torts	<LI>Contracts I	<LI>Civil Procedure I	<LI>Criminal Law	<LI>Legal Research and Writing</UL><I>Spring semester</I><UL>	<LI>Contracts II	<LI>Property	<LI>Constitutional Law I	<LI>Civil Procedure II	<LI>Introduction to Advocacy</UL><p>FULL-TIME DAY/EVENING DIVISION<BR>(First year)<BR><I>Fall semester</I><UL>	<LI>Contracts I	<LI>Torts	<LI>Civil Procedure I	<LI>Legal Research and Writing</UL><I>Spring semester</I><UL>	<LI>Contracts II	<LI>Constitutional Law I	<LI>Civil Procedure II	<LI>Criminal Law	<LI>Professional Responsibility and Ethics	<LI>Introduction to Advocacy</UL>(Second year)<br><I>Fall semester</I><UL>	<LI>Property</UL><p>PART-TIME EVENING DIVISION<BR>(First year)<BR><I>Fall semester</I><UL>	<LI>Contracts I	<LI>Torts	<LI>Legal Research and Writing</UL><I>Spring semester</I><UL>	<LI>Contracts II	<LI>Criminal Law	<LI>Constitutional Law I	<LI>Introduction to Advocacy</UL>(Second year)<BR><I>Fall semester</I><UL>	<LI>Property	<LI>Civil Procedure I	</UL><I>Spring semester</I><UL>	<LI>Civil Procedure II</UL>Additionally, upperclass students who attended the Full-Time Day or Part-Time Evening Division in the first year are required to take Professional Responsibility and Ethics, and all upperclass students must fulfill the two-credit legal writing requirement.

<TITLE>Elective Curriculum</TITLE>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<font face="HELVETICA,ARIAL" size=-1>
<h2>Elective Curriculum</h2>

One of the great strengths of GW Law School is the richness of its curriculum. It offers students the opportunity to sample a broad array of areas of the law and to design a program of study that fits their individual interests and career plans.
<p>
The Law School offers over 150 different elective courses each year. In addition to introductory level and more advanced courses in a variety of fields, there are some highly specialized areas of the curriculum that allow students to gain considerable expertise in a field. Those specialized areas include international law, environmental law, intellectual property law, and government regulation and constitutional law.
<p>
The faculty encourages students to take a broad-based J.D. program and to take core courses in the fields of administrative law, commercial law, corporate law, international and comparative law, taxation, and trusts 
and estates. The faculty also recommends 
that students take at least one course that 
will provide a cross-disciplinary perspective 
on the law, such as jurisprudence, law and economics, legal history, or health care law. 
<p>
In addition to traditionally taught classes, there are a number of simulation courses that teach skills such as drafting, trial and appellate advocacy, negotiations, and mediation, 
as well as over a dozen different clinical programs in which students learn skills while working directly with clients. These skills-oriented and clinical courses are described 
in more detail on the following pages. Also, special seminars are often organized by faculty members to address a national policy issue and propose a solution. A recent example is a seminar in which a small group 
of students worked to propose to the U.S. Sentencing Commission appropriate setencing guidelines for environmental crimes.
<p>
To teach some of its more specialized courses, the Law School calls upon experts 
in the field who are at the forefront in their areas of law to teach on an adjunct basis. They come from private practice, all branches of government, the corporate sector, and non-profit organizations. For example, a high level official with The World Bank teaches the International Banking course; the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia teaches Crime Lab; and the Deputy Chief 
of Staff, House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, teaches Legislative Analysis and Drafting.

<TITLE>Clinical Programs</TITLE>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<font face="HELVETICA,ARIAL" size=-1>
<h2>Clinical Programs</h2>


<H4>The Jacob Burns Community Legal Clinics</H4>

The Community Legal Clinics Program was founded in 1971, and the Clinics were renamed in 1991 to acknowledge the generous support of Jacob Burns, LL.B. 24, LL.D. 70. The premise behind the Clinics  inception was to provide students with an unparalleled opportunity to experience the practical application of law while at the same time providing members of the community with critically needed legal services. All of the clinics share a common goal in spite of their diversity -- provide highly motivated law students the opportunity to develop skills as negotiators, advocates, and litigators within an exciting and supportive educational environment.
The clinical programs vary considerably in purpose, duration, requirements, and duties, and every year special projects increase the scope of this rich offering. Services are made available to Spanish-speaking residents of the area through the Clinics  several bilingual attorneys and students.

<H4>Administrative Advocacy Clinic/ Advocates for Older People (AOP)</H4>

Students represent indigent and elderly people in cases concerning retirement, veterans  disability claims, unemployment compensation and public benefits, probate matters, landlord-tenant rent 
disputes, and special education services. Students enrolled in Administrative Advocacy may request placement with AOP which provides legal services to older D.C. residents. The AOP program also runs a Volunteer Income Tax Program in the spring semester.

<H4>Civil Litigation Clinic</H4>

This clinic's court-certified students are permitted to counsel clients, draft pleadings, prepare cases for trial, conduct examinations of witnesses, and argue cases under the close supervision of 
the clinic s supervising attorneys. Many types of civil cases are handled such as landlord-tenant, small claims, family matters, and occasional appeals.

<H4>Consumer Mediation Clinic</H4>

Students may participate in this unique clinical program as early as the summer of their first year. Unlike the other clinical courses at the Law School, the Mediation Clinic does not act as an dvocate or represent clients. Rather, students act as neutral third-party mediators who assist local consumers and businesses in resolving disputes by negotiating mutually agreeable settlements. Students perform case intake, provide information and referrals, and mediate assigned cases involving a wide variety of consumer issues (debt collection, credit problems, defective goods and services, home improvement contracts, etc.). Students in this clinic develop and apply creative problem-solving techniques as well as learning substantive consumer law.

<H4>Domestic Violence Clinic</H4>

This clinic offers students the opportunity to engage in lawyering for social change while providing needed representation to victims of domestic violence. Third-year, court-certified 
students represent clients seeking civil protection orders and enforcing such orders in court. Students interview and counsel clients, draft pleadings, and prepare and try cases in court under 
faculty supervision. Students also work on battered women's self-defense cases with local public defenders and on reform projects seeking to improve the legal system's or community s response to domestic violence. An interdisciplinary approach is also stressed, through collaboration with a consulting psychologist and the GW School of Medicine and Health Sciences' Department of Emergency Medicine.

<H4>Federal, Criminal, and Appellate Clinic</H4>

Under faculty supervision, students litigate appellate cases, primarily direct appeals from criminal convictions in area courts of appeal. Third-year students eligible for court certification take responsibility for the whole case, from docketing through oral argument. The clinic also conducts studies of appellate court procedures and practice that have proven to be of benefit to the local bar.
Immigration Clinic
<P>
In this clinic, aliens subject to deportation or exclusion orders in immigration court are represented by students under faculty supervision. Students determine what forms of relief, if any, are available to their clients, and in appropriate circumstances represent their clients 
in hearings in open court.  Because the clinic s clients come from all over the world, cultural sensitivity is essential and foreign language skills are welcome.

<H4>Small Business Clinic/Community Economic Development</H4>

The clinic gives students practical experience in creating legal structures for new businesses by guiding local area entrepreneurs through the legal requirements necessary to start a new business. Students gain practical experience with client interviewing; drafting legal documents such as articles of incorporation, bylaws, agreements and contracts; and providing basic tax and business counseling. Students work closely with the project s supervising attorney in researching and drafting legal documents related to both profit and non-profit organizations.

<H4>Vaccine Injury Clinic</H4>

This clinic allows second- and third-year students, under faculty supervision, to represent individuals who have suffered serious vaccine-related injuries and who are seeking damages in trial and appellate proceedings before the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The clinic s classroom component focuses on multidisciplinary (medical-legal) training in vaccine injury issues, and on lawyering skills such as client interviewing and counseling and cross examination of medical experts.  Students also work to evaluate the Claims Court s program as a model for tort reform.

<H4>Health Insurance Counseling Clinic</H4>

Second- and third-year students in this clinic provide advice and information and assist in providing legal represen-tation to older D.C. residents who are having difficulty with medical bills, Medicare, Medicaid, and other health insurance problems.  Students perform intake at the clinic office or by home visit, and take major responsibility for up to five cases during the semester.

<H4>Law Students in Court/Bankruptcy Clinic</H4>

This clinic was established in 1978 to provide assistance to low-income residents of the District of Columbia. Bankruptcy Clinic students handle a wide variety of legal and informal financial counseling services including client interviewing, preparation of consumer bankruptcy petitions and Chapter 13 Earner Plans, and negotiations of informal debt reduction and consolidation agreements.

<H4>The J.B. and Maurice C. Shapiro Environmental Law Clinic</H4>

This clinic was established in 1995 by a generous gift from the J.B. and Maurice C. Shapiro Charitable Trust. Under faculty supervision, second-, third-, and fourth-year students represent clients in environmental litigation in both the federal and state systems.  This work includes administrative, trial, or appellate actions, particularly citizen action suits, under a variety of environmental statutes such as the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Federal Facilities Compliance Act.

<H4>The Project for Older Prisoners (POPS)</H4>

The Project for Older Prisoners (POPS) encompasses a number of prison projects in which students are involved as volunteers or work for academic credit. Some students assist individual low-risk prisoners over the age of 55 to help them obtain paroles, pardons, or alternative forms of incarceration. In a typical case, a student will prepare an extensive background report on a 
prisoner to determine the likelihood of recidivism. If the risk is low, the student will then locate housing and support for the prisoner and help prepare the case for a parole hearing. Other students are involved in a Prison Environmentalism project which is working to introduce recycling and environmental industries in prisons. POPS runs a "Books for Crooks" program to help build prison libraries. Another project involves students in a study of the federal prison system and the sentencing guidelines for the U.S. Sentencing Commission. Recently POPS started a Women s Project. Professor Jonathan Turley formed POPS in 1988 while a professor at Tulane Law School, and the program continues to operate in Louisiana. GW Law School POPS 
operates largely in the D.C. metropolitan area, including Maryland and Virginia, and may extend to other states in the future. The program has received considerable media attention and growing bipartisan political support because it addresses a growing national problem: the aging of America's prison population.

<H4>Outside Placement</H4>

Students may also gain practical experience through outside placement with a wide variety of government agencies and private organizations. Students have received credit for their work as interns with organizations and agencies including the Department of Justice, the Environmental Defense Fund, the U.S. Attorneys Office, the D.C. Public Defender Service, the Women s Legal Defense Fund, Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless, the Legal Aid Society, and Consumers Union. Students have also arranged to receive academic credit for their internships with District Court and Superior Court Judges.

<TITLE>Environmental Law LL.M.</TITLE>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<font face="HELVETICA,ARIAL" size=-1>
<h2>Environmental Law LL.M.</h2>
<img src="http://128.164.161.15/yline.gif" WIDTH=357 HEIGHT=13><p>
<img src="http://128.164.161.15/env.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=202 ALIGN=left>
<P>
<H3>About the LL.M. in Environmental Law</H3>

The LL.M. program in environmental law was the first of its kind in the country. There are currently more than 100 students working toward the LL.M. in environmental law and a smaller number, enrolled in other specialties, who are broadening their expertise by including environmental law courses in their programs.
<P>
To earn the LL.M. degree in environmental law, students complete 24 credit hours that include a 
minimum of 12 hours in environmental law courses and 4 hours of thesis.
<P>
About two-thirds of environmental law graduate students attend full time and complete the program in one calendar year (two semesters and one summer).  Part-time students complete their degree requirements in two calendar years.  Admission to the program for both full- and part-time students is generally granted for the fall semester; spring admission may be allowed in special circumstances at the discretion of the program director.
<P>
A number of students enroll in the program part time while they continue to work.  Most do very well, but this requires a serious commitment as well as some planning and organization.  Those who are considering taking the program on a part-time basis are encouraged to discuss the demands of the program as related to the demands of their work with Professor Laurent Hourcl, co-director of the program, before applying.
<P>
<H3>Joint Degree with Public Health Program (LL.M./M.P.H.)</H3>

The Law School and the School of Medicine and Health Sciences offer a joint LL.M./M.P.H. program that includes a specialization in environmental-occupational health.  Students must be admitted to both degree programs separately.  Six credit hours of successfully completed course work may be transferred between programs.  In addition, an LL.M./M.P.H. candidate may use the Law School's required thesis to satisfy a portion of the special project requirement of the M.P.H. program.
<P>
<H3>The Environmental Lawyer</H3>

The Environmental Lawyer is a practitioner-oriented journal produced jointly by the Law School 
and the American Bar Association's Section on Natural Resources, Energy, and Environmental Law.  The journal is unique among environmental law reviews because of the peer review process 
submissions undergo prior to publication.  Professors Arnold Reitze and Elizabeth Glass Geltman 
are involved in the production of the journal, thus allowing for student-faculty interaction in a 
professional environment.
<P>
Although the staff of The Environmental Lawyer consists mostly of J.D. students, openings are 
available for LL.M. candidates interested in serving on either the editorial board or the staff.  Several editorial board slots are held open exclusively for LL.M. candidates, with a term of office running from September to May.  LL.M. students who assist J.D. students in the more complex substantive aspects of environmental law are an invaluable resource to The Environmental Lawyer.

<H3>The Thesis and Research Opportunities</H3>

Each student in the LL.M. program is required to write a thesis under the supervision of a member of the full-time faculty.  The thesis represents the student's synthesis of course work into a creative study that moves the law forward.  The faculty assists students in selecting cutting-edge topics, works with students on thesis development, and provides advice on potential publishing opportunities.  This major research project is a catalyst for student access to an exceptional variety of published and unpublished information sources.  Students develop opportunities to meet and discuss their ideas with some of the nation's leading policy and decision makers.  Most students who are interested in doing so publish their theses.

<H3>Internships</H3>

Students can individualize their degree programs through the Graduate Environmental Outside Placement course, which places students in internships with government agencies or nonprofit, environmentally related organizations.  Students can engage in legal analysis and policy formulation at locations such as the White House Office of Environmental Policy; the EPA; the Departments of Justice, Energy, Interior, and Defense; Congress; the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund; The World Bank; the Environmental Law Institute; and the Center for International Environmental Law.  The placement program can be used by students with specialized interests in subjects such as wildlife preservation or historical property protection.  It can also be used to augment the student's research for the thesis.

<H3>Environmental Law Curriculum</H3>

The curriculum consists of a core of in-depth courses on the EPA's "media" statutes (the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, the Solid Waste Disposal Act, and "Superfund") and approximately 20 additional environmental courses and allows students to tailor their course of study to their individual learning and career objectives.  To supplement their programs, students also may choose from the wide-ranging curriculum of the Law School (in areas such as land use, government contracts, international law, the legislative process, and health care law) as well as courses in other schools of the University.
<P>
The environmental law curriculum is constantly updated to keep pace with changes in the field.  Recent course and seminar additions include a seminar that explores the controversial area of 
constitutional takings under environmental statutes, courses in environmental negotiations and 
environmental law issues for federal facilities, and a seminar involving environmental issues in 
federal procurement.
<P>
Most specialized environmental law courses are offered in the early evening, and many are taught by adjunct faculty members who are among the nation's leading public- and private-sector practitioners and experts in the areas they teach.

<H3><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>About the Government Procurement
Law LL.M.</FONT></FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government Procurement
Law Program is the only one of its kind in the country. To earn the LL.M.
degree in Government Procurement Law, students complete 24 credit hours
that include a minimum of 10 hours in government procurement law core courses
and 4 hours of thesis. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>The experience of program
graduates in recent years confirms that procurement law continues to be
a vital area of interest to increasing numbers of legal employers. Acquisition
of goods and services by the federal government alone now accounts for
approximately $200 billion of the annual federal budget. Moreover, although
some areas of government procurement have been reduced in an era of fiscal
stringency, efforts to downsize government are likely to take the form
of contracting out functions traditionally performed by government personnel.
State and local government procurement adds significantly to the total
volume of government procurement and the associated legal practice opportunities.
In addition, the practice of government procurement law today increasingly
intersects with other disciplines of public law. For example, in recognition
of the important relationship of government procurement law and environmental
law, students in the LL.M. program may study both fields concurrently.
This dual specialization appears to be of significant interest to increasing
numbers of legal employers. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>The LL.M. program in Government
Procurement Law has proven attractive both to attorneys with substantial
experience in the federal government and to those in the private practice
of law, as well as to more recent law school graduates. Conversely, because
of GW Law School's record of leadership in the field, program graduates
have been attractive to employers, many of which are located in the Washington
metropolitan area, the center of the practice of government contracts law.
Many graduates of our LL.M. program hold prominent positions in government
agencies, the Judge Advocate General s Corps, corporations, and private
law firms. Alumni of the program form a network that includes many of the
leaders of the government procurement bar. Alumni support for the program
helps to provide resources that allow the Law School to maintain its preeminent
reputation in this field of law. Recently the Law School obtained a bequest
from the estate of Justine Gubin in honor of her late husband, E.K. Gubin,
who played an important teaching role in the program. The Gubin gift has
been used to endow a professorial chair devoted to government contracts
law and provides important strength to the program. </FONT></FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>Public Contract Law Journal</FONT></FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Public Contract Law Journal
is produced jointly by the Law School and the Public Contract Law Section
of the American Bar Association. It is the premier journal read by practitioners
in the field of government procurement law. The staff of the Public Contract
Law Journal consists of both J.D. and LL.M. candidates. Positions are available
to LL.M. candidates as members and officers of the journal or as members
of the journal s advisory board. The advisory board, composed solely of
LL.M. students, consults with journal members and officers on specific
government procurement issues that arise in the course of preparing the
journal, thereby providing graduate students with the option to participate
in the journal without committing the time necessary for membership. </FONT></FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Thesis and Other Research
Opportunities</FONT></FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=-1>Students in the LL.M. program
are required to write a thesis under the supervision of a member of the
full-time faculty. The student's faculty adviser assists in identifying
and selecting an appropriate topic and works with the student in developing
the focus and direction of the thesis. The thesis represents a culmination
of students formal academic study and challenges them to develop cutting-edge
expertise as they synthesize and rationalize existing doctrine, critique
the state of the law, and advance carefully grounded proposals for reform.
Program faculty are also available to assist students in locating publishing
opportunities for their theses. Additional opportunities for in-depth research
are provided through the government contracts seminar courses, which require
the preparation of a research paper. For many of these papers, students
may select and pursue a topic of their choosing, further developing their
expertise in an area of particular interest. Student research is supported
by the unique resources available to the Law School, including the unparalleled
collection of government procurement materials of the Jacob Burns Law Library,
a law librarian with expertise in the field of procurement law, and access
to government agencies and other institutions located in Washington, D.C.

law and government procurement has been offered on a regular basis. A recent
seminar addressed developments heralded by the newly enacted Federal Acquisition
Streamlining Act. In these seminars, the Law School's location makes possible
the use of guest speakers who are leading figures in the field. </FONT></FONT></P>

<H3>About the Intellectual Property Law LL.M.</H3>



The Intellectual Property Law Program has grown  from a single patent law class taught in 1891 by the Commis-sioner of Patents to one of the most highly acclaimed programs of its kind among major U.S. law schools today.  The focus of the program is on patents, particularly  international and comparative aspects of the field.  With its extensive curriculum, expert faculty, and Washington, D.C.,  location, the program provides unique opportunities for students to be at the forefront of domestic and international patent  policy development. Enriching the formal program of study are the activities of  the Dean Dinwoodey Center for Intellectual Property Studies,  a graduate research institute. The Dinwoodey Center sponsors frequent programs on policy matters that bring together leading academics and jurists from all over the world.  
<P>
The Intellectual Property Law LL.M. Program is designed to provide law school graduates interested in teaching, public policy, or international and comparative aspects of the field with a broad-based curriculum and individualized support for their research. While student enrollment at the Law School numbers more than 1,700, enrollment in the Intellectual Property Law LL.M. program is limited to approximately 15 new students each year.  Because patent law remains the central aspect of the program, students are expected to enter with a basic knowledge of the field.  The student's goal should be to focus on a particular area of scholarship or practice issues, whether domestic, foreign, or comparative.
<P>
To earn the LL.M. degree in Intellectual Property Law, students complete 24 credit hours that include a minimum of 10 hours in intellectual property law courses and 4 hours of thesis. Admission to the program is generally granted for the fall semester; spring admission may be allowed in special circumstances at the discretion of the program director.Both full- and part-time programs of study are offered.  Full-time students usually complete the program within one calendar year (two semesters and one summer); part-time students usually complete the program in two calendar years.

<H3>Internships and Foreign Study</H3>
For many students, internships have proven to be one of the best ways to gain mentorship from members of the local intellectual property community.  Students are especially encouraged to seek internships with a circuit judge at the nearby U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  Regular full-time clerkships, while highly competitive, are also an option for LL.M. students.  Students who arrange for an approved, nonremunerative placement may receive up to four hours of credit for their work, with five hours of work per week being required for each credit. Selected students also have the opportunity for foreign study during the summer or after graduation.  A number of program graduates have received fellowships at the Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International Patent Copyright and Competition Law in Munich or Chizaiken in Tokyo.

<H3>Intellectual Property Studies in the Nation's Capital</H3>
One of the great benefits of studying intellectual property law at GW is that the "real world" is at the student's doorstep. Across the Potomac River stands the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  Nearby Capitol Hill is home to the Copyright Office and the House and Senate Judiciary Committees with principal jurisdiction for intellectual property cases.  The current climate of legislative activity in patents permits important opportunities for students to observe hearings conducted on Capitol Hill.  Some students work as interns on the Hill, while others participate in the preparatory work that takes place in the Administration and with the bar and trade associations.  The National Courts Building on Lafayette Square across from the White House (and four blocks from GW) houses courtrooms of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.  In addition, the Bar Association of the District of Columbia has a special intellectual property section that holds its council meetings at the University and actively welcomes student participation in its events.More than 1,000 patent attorneys in scores of law firms of all sizes practice in Washington. Full- and part-time work at these firms can provide an invaluable learning experience. The Law School has graduated far more patent lawyers than any other law school in the country.  These alumni are strongly represented in the local patent bar, and many alumni participate in the life of the school.

<H3>The Dean Dinwoodey Center for Intellectual Property Studies</H3>
The Dean Dinwoodey Center for Intellectual Property Studies is chartered by the University and 
funded in part by the Bureau of National Affairs in memory of its founder Dean Dinwoodey, J.D. 29.  Hundreds of intellectual property scholars and practitioners have participated in programs of the Dinwoodey Center, and each year a number of prominent lawyers and officials from around the world visit the Law School to conduct research and participate in Dinwoodey Center activities. Dinwoodey Center area projects have studied the patent and other intellectual property laws of foreign countries including Thailand, India, Poland, and Brazil.  The major focus of comparative study has been East Asia, with extensive studies focusing on China and Japan.  One facet of the Dinwoodey Center, the China Project, is coordinated by the Center's associate director, Andy Y. Sun. The China Project sponsors programs such as the recent China Week, which featured a series of discussions with leading Chinese government officials, judges, and professors.  Japanese studies have also been diverse, with numerous visits by delegations from Tokyo and reciprocal visits from Dinwoodey Center members.  Mr. Yoichiro Yamaguchi, who teaches Japanese patent policy at GW, is a regular participant in Dinwoodey Center activities and provides expertise based on his prior service in the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry.  Relationships with Europe continue principally through an exchange of scholars, including those from the Max Planck Institute. The Dinwoodey Center also focuses on the need for domestic patent reform.  Conferences held in nearby Airlie, Virginia, have involved leading officials from all branches of government.  One conference produced an "Airlie Draft" proposing legislative reform involving a 20-year patent term, 18-month automatic publication of patent applications, and related measures.  All of these initiatives became part of the legislative and diplomatic processes and were the basis for Japan-U.S. bilateral agreements in 1994. One initiative was enacted into law as part of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994.  Vigilance over the examination process and regulatory reform are also of concern, and members of the Dinwoodey Center are active in the regulatory process. Graduate law students are integral to the development of Dinwoodey Center activities.  Two new endeavors, the India Project and the Rio Project, were recently established by program students.

<H3>About the International and Comparative Law LL.M.</H3>

The International and Comparative Law Program offers one of the most extensive international law curricula in the country.  Over 20 courses focus on a wide range of issues in both public and private aspects of the field as well as the domestic law of other countries. Complementing and enriching the program are the Oxford-GW International Human Rights Program, held in Oxford each summer, and the International Rule of Law Center, which engages in research and study relating to international norms and institutions that advance human rights, the rule of law, democratic pluralism, and conflict resolution.
<P>
To earn the LL.M. degree in international and comparative law, students complete 24 credit hours that include a minimum of 12 hours in courses in the field and 4 hours of thesis.  The thesis is expected to be a major scholarly paper comparable in quality and length to a law review article.  Students may attend the program either full- or part-time.  In the application process, preference 
will be given to applicants who, in addition to outstanding academic qualifications, have special international experience or interests and a working knowledge of one or more foreign languages.

<H3>International and Comparative Law Curriculum</H3>
 Courses on international human rights, law of international organizations, international commercial law, public international law, and comparative law are focal points of the program. The curriculum is continually updated to keep pace with developments in these fields.  Complementing the full-time faculty is a corps of distinguished adjunct faculty members who offer seminars in their fields of specialization.  The wealth of available legal talent in the Washington area is an important component of the dynamic character of the program.

<h2>General LL.M.</h2>

<img src="http://128.164.161.15/scales.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=202 ALIGN=left>
<P>


The General LL.M. Program accepts a limited number of students to study in areas other than those covered in the specialized programs.  U.S. law school graduates applying to the General LL.M. Program must submit with the application a proposed program of study that includes courses to be taken and a general statement outlining the area of concentration for the thesis.  Upon admission the student will be paired with a faculty member in that area who will assist in further developing a curriculum to fit the student's specific needs and also provide supervision for the thesis.  Areas of interest are limited only by the availability of faculty advisers.
<P>
Recent General LL.M. candidates have focused in such areas as labor law, constitutional law, land development law, and corporate law and securities regulation.  Other possible areas of concentration may be determined by consulting the sections dealing with curriculum in the Law School Bulletin. The General LL.M. Program is directed by the associate dean for academic affairs.
<P>
Graduates of foreign law schools may also pursue the General LL.M. as a means of studying a range of issues in American law.  Such students must be admitted to the International Legal Studies Program.

Professor Wegner joined the faculty in 1989, after six years as an adjunct professor at the Georgetown University Law Center. He started his career in 1965 as a patent examiner; for most of his career he has been in private practice. He has held positions of leadership in several private-sector groups, including the American Intellectual Property Law Association, where he was a member of the Board of Directors. In 1975 76, Professor Wegner lived in Munich as a stipendiat of the Max Planck Society, serving as a research fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International Patent, Copyright and Competition Law. In 1977, he was a kenshuin at the Kyoto University Law Faculty. Since 1985 Professor Wegner has been contributing to the crafting of a patent-harmonization treaty in Geneva as part of a United Nations World Intellectual Property Organization Committee of Experts; he is the only private-sector member whose involvement dates back to the initial meetings of the Committee. Professor Wegner often testifies on intellectual property issues before congressional committees and the Department of Commerce.

  <i>From the announcement:  "The Benton Foundation, with funding from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, has recently made this study available at their website.  It 'compares library leaders' visions for the future with the public's prescriptions for libraries[.]'  Using libraries as a focal point, it should provoke much thought about how other institutions that provide public information will be impacted by the digital revolution.  The study is based on 'a national survey to test public support for libraries in the digital age,' conducted in April of 1996.  At present the study is available in HTML, with an Adobe Acrobat (PDF) version forthcoming."</i>

The importer section contains a searchable directory of U.S. exporters and allows users to post special requests for products and services on an electronic bulletin board.

   <i>From the announcement:  "Dun & Bradstreet, the business information provider, along with the Internet search directory Lycos, has made available this database containing cursory information on over 60,000 public and private U.S. companies with websites.  The quantity of the database is more important at this site than the amount of data available about each site (which is rather scanty, even for the enhanced registered user's retrieval).  There are several search options, but the main feature of the site is a hypertext connection(s) to each retrieved company."</i>
</dd>

  <a href="http://ttnwww.rtpnc.epa.gov/naaqspro/">5.  EPA ANNOUNCES PROPOSED NEW AIR QUALITY STANDARDS</a>

</dt>
<dd>
  <i>From the announcement:  "The United States Environmental Protection Agency has recently proposed new air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter, and information about these proposals is available at a newly established website.  The highlight of the site is the availability of fact sheets, along with full texts (in .zip format) of the new proposals.  There is also a listing of counties not meeting the current and proposed ozone and particulate matter standards, along with a map of counties not meeting the proposed ozone standard.  Also at the site is a fact sheet on how the proposed standards will affect your city or county."</i>

This searchable database allows users to 'obtain demographic data and financial profiles of each FDIC-insured depository institution derived from quarterly reports filed with Federal regulators.'  Users can search by certificate number, bank, geographic location, charter, chartering agency, federal regulator, primary insurance fund, and asset and deposit size.  Retrieval can be sorted by any of 7 variables.  Information returned includes balance sheet and income, loan portfolio/asset quality, and balance sheet details.  Each report is linked to a glossary of terms.  Quarterly and annual data is available back to December 1993.  This is a significant addition to a site that already carries a staggering amount of information about United States banking."</i>

</dt>
<dd>
   <i>From the announcement:  "The well known Internet Public Library has recently revised its online texts collection to make it available for searching and browsing by author, title, and Dewey Classification.  The significance of this enhancement lies in the way the site is organized.  Each entry is accompanied by bibliographic information, including title, author, date, Dewey Classification(s), and hypertext URL(s).  There is an interesting, though not yet perfected, feature that allows users to link to similar works.  A key feature is the listing of books under multiple classifications.  At present, the library contains pointers to over 3,700 books."</i>

The site is organized by country and agency, within subject themes that include statistical sources, executive documents, national legislative documents, national judicial documents, and subnational documents.
