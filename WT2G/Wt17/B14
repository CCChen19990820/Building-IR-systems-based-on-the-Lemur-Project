In India, drought affects not lawns but whole lives. ACTIONAID's help varies according to the needs - and skills - of each community.</font><hr><TABLE BORDER=0 width=260 align=left hspace=10 vspace=10><TR><TH><TABLE BORDER=0 width=250><TR><TD> <img src="12.jpg" align=left hspace=4 vspace=4 width=250 height=162 border=1></TD></TR><TR><TD> <font size=small face=helvetica, arial>Photo: Mark Slide</font> &copy;.<p></TH></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><p>As taps ran dry in British homes this summer, people once again became used to bans on watering their lawns, and saw standpipes installed in their streets. A nuisance, certainly - and a special irritation in a typically rainy country - but not a threat to livelihoods. <p>Thousands of miles away in southern India's arid Karnataka state, though, during the summer drought it is not lawns that go thirsty, but families and crops. Here, temperatures reach 46<font=small>o</font>C during the day, and rain falls on just 41 days of the year. Summer crops wither for lack of moisture, and water for drinking and washing is harder to find.<p>When water is so precious, people become especially inventive in developing ways to find, save and store it. The people of Karnataka are no different, but in the past have not always had the money or the technical expertise to solve the long-term problem. <p>Now, using loans or expertise from ACTIONAID - the type of help provided depends on the community's existing resources - they are able to do just that. As a result, farmers can grow full summer crops for the first time in living memory and an increasing number of people will have access to safe drinking water.In the Raichur district of Karnataka state, ACTIONAID supports a local organisation called Samuha, which in Sanskrit - the ancient language of India - means an organised group or society. <p>Samuha brings together poor families to analyse their problems and identify solutions. Work focuses on improving  people's economic status through agricultural and water development projects, and through savings and credit programmes.<p>In Karnataka, Samuha has offered the most appropriate help to different communities, leading to some very varied types of project.<p><p><b>1) The oil engine</b><p>At a small settlement near Samuha's headquarters in Raichur district, the English words 'oil engine' are relayed by villagers with infectious enthusiasm to a visiting member of the Samuha team. <p>	The centre of conversation, a diesel-powered water pump about the size of the engine of a family car, has been purchased by locals with the help of a loan from Samuha's savings and credit scheme. Under this scheme, members save a small amount each month and in return have access to loans from a central fund provided by ACTIONAID but administered by the community. <p>	The pump draws water from open wells, which is then sprayed meticulously into selected furrows - a significant leap forward after years of having to onerously extract water from an open well using an ox-skin sack pulled by two bullocks.<p>Sales from the crops of sunflowers and groundnuts that spring up as a result provide a new income for villagers who, before the engine's arrival, faced each summer with dread. Thanks to this, the loan is now paid off, and talk is of buying 'Oil engine 2'. <TABLE BORDER=0 width=180 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=right><TR><TH><TABLE BORDER=0 width=160 bgcolor=FFCC99><TR><TD><img src="13.jpg" hspace=5 vspace=6 width=150 height=206></TD><tr><TD><p><font size=small face=helvetica>A detailed landscape map of Herundi (left), drawn up by the villagers, has helped Samuha design an irrigation and drainage system for the village. At a small settlement near Samuha's headquarters in Raichur district, people have to draw water laboriously from an open well using an ox-skin sack (top of page). Now, a loan from Samuha has allowed them to buy a diesel-powered pump.<p>(Mark Slide</font> &copy;).</TD></TR></TABLE></TH></TR></TABLE><br clear=left><p><b>2) The satellite</b><p>In the nearby village of Herundi, 20-year-old Mallana is diligently ploughing fields with the help of his oxen. Despite being only yards from the River Krishna, he knows that a good cotton crop is dependent on the river receiving a steady supply of rainfall from the Monsoon - flash floods will cause it to overflow, washing away the fertile topsoil and, with it, vital income for Mallana's family.<p>Here, Samuha has helped by providing technological support which Mallana could not have had access to by himself, but which will revolutionise his life and those of other farmers in the area. Using satellite images of soils and drainage patterns from the India Space Research station at  Bangalore, together with detail from a landscape map drafted by the village, Samuha has designed an irrigation and drainage system that will allow water from the river to be pumped at controlled levels, over the surrounding crops.<p>Sangana Guoda (45) is one of the farmers who have given time and precious savings to support the scheme. &quot;We have been experiencing drought here for the past 20 years, and the only way to survive a bad summer has been to take a loan from the bank. Now, this year's bank loan will be our last. All the families in the village are behind the plan because they know it will give them a lifestyle that has never before been possible.&quot;<p><b>3) The committees</b><p>Sometimes, the money exists to make improvements, but not the methods to put them into effect - while still ensuring that the communities themselves take part in, maintain and 'own' the programmes. Here, ACTIONAID may need to provide not money but its skills and experience in social organisation.<p>The World Bank-sponsored Integrated Rural Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation project in Karnataka covers about 1200 villages in 12 districts. Here, for the first time, the government of India  is attempting systematically to involve people in the planning, funding, implementation and maintenance of a water and sanitation project.<p> Samuha and another ACTIONAID partner, the Development Promotion Group, have taken up the work in Raichur and Bellary districts respectively. <p>They have helped to establish village committees to examine and approve plans, and raise funds to cover 30 per cent of the environmental sanitation costs. In some cases, villagers who cannot afford the money will contribute to the costs by providing free labour.<p>&quot;The people's contribution to the expenditure on environmental sanitation is the most critical component of the project,&quot; says Samuha Project Leader GL Janardhan. &quot;Without it, their participation will not be truly recognised, either by themselves or the government.&quot;Money, technology or social institutions: there is more than one way to help the people of Karnataka solve their chronic drought problems. Whatever the circumstance, ACTIONAID is looking to find the best - and the most cost-effective - way of achieving change. <p>Access to clean water is a vital part of ACTIONAID'S development work, and is the subject of a current appeal.<p><p><hr><p><a href="../../home.html"><img src="../../pix/home.gif" width=46height=41 hspace=10vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a><a href="../../fight/index.html" target="_parent"><imgsrc="../../pix/globe1.gif" width=46height=41hspace=10 vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a> <a href="../index.html"><img src="../../pix/back.gif" width=46height=41hspace=10 vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a><font size=1 face=helvetica, arial><li type=square><b><a href="../../home.html">Home Page</a></b> <li type=square><b><ahref="../../fight/index.html" target="_parent">JoinACTIONAID</a></b> <li type=square><b><a href="../index.html">Common Cause</a></b></font><br clear=all><p></body></html>                       

Savings and credit schemes can help them through this 'food gap'. </font><p><hr><p>In a small village near Dalocha in   southern Ethiopia, 25 men and women are seated in a circle on the ground in the shade of a large tree. It is eight o'clock in the morning and they have gathered before they start work in the fields. This is the weekly meeting of the Tofik savings and credit group, one of over a hundred groups established with ACTIONAID assistance in the Dalocha area. <p>It is with savings and credit groups such as these that ACTIONAID is working to create real and lasting changes in people's lives. The principle is quite simple. Very often all a farmer needs to improve the productivity of his land is some fertiliser. Or, if he had his own ox to plough his land, he could save the two thirds of his crops that he would normally pay to use a richer farmer's animal. <p>Small improvements such as these can mean substantial changes for a family, but to achieve them requires income that few have. Nor do the poorest farmers in Dalocha have access to credit - few banks would lend to somebody with no security, and private loans, if available, can mean hefty interest rates. This is where ACTIONAID comes in. Through its savings and credit scheme, farmers have access to loans that enable them to improve their own lives and build greater security for their families in the longer term. This week, members of the Tofik group are discussing how they will organise repayment of loans for oxen, seed and fertiliser. There is much disagreement about how much they can afford and the right levels of credit, but eventually a decision is reached. <p>Being part of the group, the members say, has boosted their confidence and raised their status within the community. According to Chairman Kemal Detgeber: &quot;Before, being the poorest farmers, we were nothing. Now, because of the group, we can be confident of having materials for the next planting season and we are proud of what we have achieved. Even the rich farmers are asking to join!&quot;<p>Helping find a solution for all the community to last year's food shortages, achieved much of this 'status' for the Tofik group and other ACTIONAID savings and credit groups around Dalocha. Problems of pestilence and severe hail storms in 1993 had left food reserves across the country very low. In 1994, the April/May belg rains failed to arrive and the main krempt rains were late, so farmers were having to make food, already in short supply, last through to the next harvest in November. It also meant many would be tempted to eat the seed needed for planting. Some families in Dalocha were reduced to eating one meal a day. <p>ACTIONAID field workers met weekly with villagers in Dalocha to discuss the problems they faced and to monitor hunger levels. According to Programme Manager Mohammed Halo: &quot;By June we were concerned for the longer term interests of the community. Some were starting to sell their livestock and the rights to their land or the next harvest in an effort to buy grain at escalated prices.&quot;  <p>The Ethiopian government, recognising the early signs of a potentially devastating situation, called upon the world community for help. Pledges of nearly one million tonnes of food aid were made and preparations began for distribution across the country. <p>However, at an emergency meeting with all the savings and credit groups in Dalocha, the leaders told ACTIONAID they did not want handouts of food or seed. This was not, said the groups, how ACTIONAID had helped them in the past, so why should it be the case now? Instead they asked for additional credit of seeds, fertiliser and blankets to help them through, which they would repay on special terms. <p>The groups also proposed that 9,000 households in the community, including non group members, should be given 100kg of grain each for consumption, to tide them over for the three months until the next harvest. This was provided by ACTIONAID on an interest-free credit basis, with a long-term repayment option for members who already had other credit payments owing. <p>In total, 50,000 people in the Dalocha area were able to survive the crisis thanks to the partnership established between the groups and ACTIONAID. Fortunately the main rains in 1994, when they came, were sufficient to ensure a reasonable    harvest, and by December the farmers had already started to pay back the additional loans.    <p> However, it is a deep-rooted problem which has not gone away. Already this year the Ethiopian government has recognised a likely shortfall of food supplies and has requested help in the form of half a million tonnes of grain. <p>The reasons for this regular food deficit are many. Two decades of an oppressive communist regime has taken its toll, with high expenditure on the      military detracting from investment in industries - including agriculture, which is the backbone of the economy - and in infrastructure, hampering distribution across the country. <p>Erratic rainfall and environmental degradation also challenge agricultural production, while a growing population is continuing to put pressure on the country's resources. <p>Since 1991, though, there has been cause for optimism. With peace and political stability, there have been clear steps towards economic liberalisation and an increase in expenditure on health, education and infrastructure. With elections due in May, there are high hopes in the new government. <p>It would be unrealistic to expect a rapid improvement in Ethiopia's food security, though. In the meantime, if famine on the scale seen in 1984/85 is to be averted again, preventative measures as found with the savings and credit groups are vital. <p>They, together with systems to give early warning of hunger, must be the priority - as any member of the Tofik savings and credit group will tell you.<hr><TABLE BORDER=0 width=280 align=left hspace=10 vspace=10><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER=0 width=260><TR><TD> <img src="16.jpg" align=left hspace=4 vspace=4 width=250 height=154 border=1></TD></TR><TR><TD> <font size=small face=helvetica, arial>Photo: Adrian Arbib</font> &copy;.</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><h3>Being the 'bank manager'     in your spare time...</h3><p>Belene Aday ( left) is facing a difficult meeting. As Chairman of the Bale Geze  savings and credit group in Koysha, south west Ethiopia, he must help the group deal with a member, Asafa, who is now two weeks behind with his repayments. <p>The group is taking a hard line - if one person gets behind with their payments, this can threaten the scheme for all of them - but Belene urges them not to be hasty in casting out a fellow member. Asafa is, after all, a peasant farmer, struggling to make ends meet like the rest of them.<p>However, Belene knows that should Asafa continue not to pay, this could involve him in a great deal of extra work. The ultimate sanction in such a case would be to take Asafa to the court of their local Peasant Association. As chairman, this would be Belene's responsibility. &quot;I am worried about the time this will take,&quot; he says. &quot;I will have to find a compromise between my farm work and my role as chairman.&quot;<p>The group chose Belene as their chairman and he takes his responsibilities very seriously. &quot;It is my job to co-ordinate the group, to ensure we are disciplined at meet-ings and to keep members motivated to make their payments on time,&quot; he explains. <p>Each member saves 25 cents (three pence) a week - an amount which, in an area where cash is scarce, can be difficult to maintain. But Belene is clear of the benefits. When the Bale Geze group started eight months ago, Belene was one of the first to take credit - for a draught ox. He will share this with another member and together they will take four years to pay for it. Before, Belene had to borrow an ox to plough his land and the cost was high - two thirds of the crop yield. <p>And he has further ambitions: &quot;I personally would like to do more than just dig the land. I want to get involved in income generating activities, even to own my own shop.&quot;<p><TABLE BORDER=0 width=230 align=right hspace=10 vspace=10><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER=0 width=210 bgcolor=FFCC99><TR><TD> <img src="15.jpg" align=right hspace=4 vspace=4 width=200 height=143></TD></TR><TR><TD> <p><font size=small face=helvetica>Each member of the Bale Geze savings and credit group saves 25 cents (about 3p) a week. It's a big sum for the farmers - but the benefits can be equally large.</font><p> <font size=small face=helvetica, arial>Photo: Adrian Arbib</font> &copy;.<p></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><p>However, like the other farmers of Bale Geze, Belene's primary concern is ensuring his family is fed and clothed. Crop failures due to the late rains in 1994 have left most facing a difficult year, and Belene worries that without enough clothes and nutrition his son, Bedeke, will not be able to continue going to school.Belene grows teff, beans, peas and sorghum in his fields, and hopes with the help of the ox he will produce enough for his family to eat and some to sell. Only by selling some produce do they have cash for clothes and other essentials. Belene has already planned what he will do once he has paid for the ox: &quot;I will take credit to buy a cow.&quot;<p>At the end of the weekly meeting the Bale Geze savings and credit group decides to allow Asafa to remain a member providing he improves his repayment record in the coming month. Belene is relieved. They have also decided to impose a new penalty - 50 cents for members who are late for the meeting. <p><b>Key facts: ACTIONAID in Ethiopia</b><p>Dalocha and Koysha, featured in this article, are two of four ACTIONAID development areas in Ethiopia.

Here, we look at customs marking the first step in life - the arrival of a baby. </font><hr><p>A myriad of customs welcome children into the world. Developed over thousands of years, these customs celebrate the child's birth, protect it from harm and give it a first identity. <h3>Celebration...</h3>&quot;All births are a gift from God and should be celebrated,&quot; says Asma, a traditional birth attendant (TBA) in ACTIONAID's programme area in Kalinger, Pakistan. <p>Spirituality and festivity often combine in the ceremonies that welcome new babies. The first words a child in Kalinger will hear is a call to prayer whispered into their ear, signifying he or she is Muslim. In Usulutan, El Salvador, babies first hear ritual prayers spoken by the traditional midwife around a candle. Frequently, special foods form part of the ceremony. Just as the first time a Sikh child visits the temple his or her parents will take flour, butter and sugar to make kara parashad  - a sweet pudding shared with other worshippers - so a Hindu baby, even before it tastes breast milk, will taste honey when the sacred symbol, AUM (pronounced Om), is written on its tongue. <p>But not all births are met with enthusiasm. In Kalinger, the proud father of a boy hires a local barber to convey the news to relatives; the birth of a girl often goes unannounced. This discrimination against girls is a feature of many societies. In Usulutan, traditional midwives often charge extra if they deliver a baby boy.<p><h3>Protection... </h3>Poor living conditions throughout the developing world mean that birth does not always end with a safe delivery. As many as one infant in four dies within its first year. Though, traditionally, the loss of babies at this stage is described in spiritual terms - the baby itself often being perceived as a pure spirit, not yet human - the ceremonies which seek to protect infants are often immensely practical.<p>For the first 14 days after giving birth in Sindhupalchowk, Nepal, mothers and infants of the Mahji - a traditional fishing community - stay in a warm room attended only by the midwife. By massaging the mother and child's body with mustard oil and wood from the Sal tree, the midwife keeps them both warm and, it is believed, reduces the swelling which might ensue from exposure. <p>In Sella Limba, Sierra Leone, babies and young children are seen as particularly vulnerable to a disease known as kuwanki, which causes convulsions. Among both Christians and Muslims, the fear of kuwanki is so great that babies are ceremonially bathed in a special herbal medicine on leaving the birthing hut.<p><h3>Identity... </h3>In many communities, names are chosen not as a reflection of fashion but for their religious meaning or because they symbolise significant events around the time of birth. They are just as likely to be selected by close relatives, birth attendants or spiritual leaders as by the parents themselves. <p>Naming ceremonies in Sella Limba, for example, are very elaborate. &quot;The baby's head is shaved, some herb mixture is poured on its head and the name is publicly announced by the herbalist,&quot; explains Isatu Koroma, Sponsorship Services Officer. <p><TABLE BORDER=0 width=180 align=left hspace=10 vspace=10><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER=0 width=160><TR><TD> <img src="18.jpg" hspace=4 vspace=4 width=150 height=209 border=1> </TD></TR><TR><TD> <font size=small face=helvetica, arial>Photo: Jerry Flynn</font> &copy;.</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><p>Ceremonies like these take place in all the countries in which ACTIONAID works. In all of them, ACTIONAID seeks not to replace but to augment tradition, and to give all children - girls as well as boys - the best start in life. ACTIONAID activities are important both in improving post-natal care generally, and in making sure girls are seen as equally valuable members of society. <p>Research by: Isatu Koroma, ACTIONAID Sierra Leone; Khushi Zaman, ACTIONAID Pakistan; Mohammad Salim, Kalinger community member;  Candice Macqueen, ACTIONAID El Salvador; Sanjay Rana, ACTIONAID Nepal.<br clear=left><p><hr><p><a href="../../home.html"><img src="../../pix/home.gif" width=46height=41 hspace=10vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a><a href="../../fight/index.html" target="_parent"><imgsrc="../../pix/globe1.gif" width=46height=41hspace=10 vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a> <a href="../index.html"><img src="../../pix/back.gif" width=46height=41hspace=10 vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a><font size=1 face=helvetica, arial><li type=square><b><a href="../../home.html">Home Page</a></b> <li type=square><b><ahref="../../fight/index.html" target="_parent">JoinACTIONAID</a></b> <li type=square><b><a href="../index.html">Common Cause</a></b></font><br clear=all><p></body></html>

Tales of the opportunities of life in the cities regularly reach them. So why do they stay?</font><hr><p>Twice a week, for six years, Alfonso Palacio walked the twelve-hour journey from Llactun to the provincial capital Huaraz. As president of this dispersed mountain community from 1983 until 1989, he needed to attend regular meetings to discuss the administration of the community. It is a slow journey, at 3,200 metres above sea level through the Andean mountains which, although normally green, are now suffering the effects of a three- year drought.<p><TABLE BORDER=0 width=280 align=left hspace=10 vspace=10><TR><TH><TABLE BORDER=0 width=260 bgcolor=FFCC99><TR><TH><img src="29.jpg" hspace=5 vspace=6 width=220 height=144></TH><TR><TD> <p> <font size=small face=helvetica>Ana and Alfonso on their Llactun farmstead.

The potatoes are divided up according to how much work each individual has put in. The harvest is followed by a festival. (Ava-Cezelia Gonzalex</font> &copy;).</TD></TR></TABLE></TH></TR></TABLE><p>Alfonso should not have been president for that long but with guerilla activity and civil war creating fear and uncertainty in the region and death threats against community leaders not uncommon, the job lacked takers. Without a representative the community may have broken up so, refusing to bow to the pressure, Alfonso continued as president well beyond the usual tenure of four years. He did this because he loves Llactun. Alfonso would not want to live anywhere else. This commitment is typical of many people in the community.<p>It is this same commitment that encouraged them to seek the assistance of ACTIONAID to help improve the quality of life in Llactun. Four years on, the relationship has brought a safe drinking water supply, seed credit on which they can rely, improvements to their cheese factory and help to develop invaluable agricultural expertise.<p>Yet Llactun has not always been the unified community that it appears to be today.<p>Twenty-five years ago Llactun housed a disparate group of families who worked as wage labourers for local landlords. In return for their work, they received a small portion of what they harvested. Alfonso recalls when his father worked growing maize and potato for the landlord. &quot;We planted half the land for him, and half for us, but it was not enough and we were often hungry,&quot; he says.<p>After the 1969 Land Reform Act, for the first time native Peruvians had the chance to own the land their families had worked on for generations. In order to take advantage of these new laws people had to form organised communities. The families in the Llactun region came together to claim their land from the landowners, winning only after seven court cases and prison sentences for many of the activists. Independence was followed by an earthquake and a drought which nearly destroyed the community. <p>Today, for those in Llactun who remember the struggle and the threats to their community, the gains are held dear. &quot;If I ever see anyone who wants to take advantage of the community or the land    it makes me mad,&quot; says Don Guzman.       &quot;I am going to fight until the day I die to keep the land for all of us.&quot;<p>Today, the biggest threat to Llactun is migration, as more and more young people head for the big cities in search of opportunity and a better life. The lure of the bright lights is deceptive. The majority will join the growing army of casual workers eking out a living in the mushrooming shanty towns situated on the outskirts of all of Peru's major cities. Now 70 per cent of the country's 22.5 million population live in urban areas. In 1940, the figure was only 40 per cent, and most of the movement has been since 1976.<p>With pressures on the local economy due to structural adjustment policies, a three-year drought that has threatened the livelihoods of many in Llactun and the day-to-day struggle villagers face, it is perhaps not difficult to understand why so many are tempted by city life. Less dramatic, though still insidious, is the gradual undermining of Andean culture and age-old traditions as the values and culture of the coastal cities filter into the hilltop  communities via car-battery-powered television and advertising. The influence of television is strong and with schools staffed by teachers from the cities teaching a curriculum most relevant to children living in towns, the Andean people are losing sight of their own culture. They are also losing the collective knowledge of how to make best use of the resources they have. Where once Huaraz was known for its water-powered stone mills for grinding flour, today these have fallen into disuse as important water management skills have been lost. Llactun's community leaders fear that without the traditional farming skills, new techniques and even new industries will make it increasingly difficult for communities such as theirs to survive.<p><TABLE BORDER=0 width=180 align=right hspace=10 vspace=10><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER=0 width=160 bgcolor=FFCC99><TR><TH><img src="30.jpg" hspace=5 vspace=6 width=150 height=226></TH><TR><TD> <p><font size=small face=helvetica> William and Jesus Palacio with a woolly friend.  (Ava-Cezelia Gonzalex</font> &copy;).</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE>At the request of the communities, ACTIONAID Peruvian staff are helping to address their problems through a range  of measures which include a new curriculum for rural schools, an agricultural programme which increases self sufficiency for families, and an outlook which enhances the communities' belief in themselves and their culture.<p>Ecological Education is a project, currently in a pilot phase in Cordillera Negra, which directly addresses the growing gulf between the national curriculum and the reality of life in the Andes. Staffed with specially trained teachers the project provides children with a renewed sense of pride  in their culture and important skills           in traditional technology, methods of afforestation and cattle rearing.<p>In other areas the focus is on music as children explore, with the help of a teacher and instruments provided by ACTIONAID, traditional songs that were once performed to celebrate the value of communal agricultural work that underpinned Andean lifestyles. Says Pepe, ACTIONAID'S educational adviser in Tarata: &quot;Children now practise the quena (Andean reed flute) on the way to the fields and last year local families organised a music festival.&quot;<p>The main thrust of ACTIONAID'S programme in Peru however is to ensure that families are able to grow enough food to eat and are no longer so vulnerable to erratic weather conditions. Advice in fertiliser technology, seed credit and support with rearing animals provides communities with a larger and more reliable food supply.<p>Rural life in Llactun is tough. Both women and men work many hours a day just to ensure subsistence for their families. Yet, despite these hardships, there is a clear feeling in the community that they are lucky to be living in Llactun. This may be to do with the collective memory of the struggle they had to secure the land. It is almost certainly in part a recognition of the beauty of the mountains, the clean air and the wild fruits that you will never find in the city.<p><TABLE BORDER=0 width=250 align=left hspace=10 vspace=10><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER=0 width=230 bgcolor=FFCC99><TR><TH><img src="32.jpg" hspace=5 vspace=6 width=220 height=143></TH><TR><TD> <p><font size=small face=helvetica> Photo: Ava-Cezelia Gonzalex</font> &copy;.</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE>The community have many causes for celebration. The annual August festival is a major event which all families help to organise. &quot;There are groups in charge of everything including the band and dancers,&quot; says Blas Leon Antonis. The highlight of the day is the meal, a traditional feast of meat soup followed by guinea pig and potato, washed down with Chicha, a home-made alcoholic brew made from fermented corn. &quot;It's just to refresh ourselves,&quot; says Blas, laughing.<p>All but one of Marina Wanolo Layba's children have moved to Lima, yet she has no desire to follow them. &quot;In Lima, if you don't work you have nothing. Here when we work together, we talk and laugh and we share everything. The air is clean and healthy and there is always food to eat.&quot;<p>It is for people like Marina that Alfonso made his footsore journey twice a week. <br clear=all><p><hr><p><a href="../../home.html"><img src="../../pix/home.gif" width=46height=41 hspace=10vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a><a href="../../fight/index.html" target="_parent"><imgsrc="../../pix/globe1.gif" width=46height=41hspace=10 vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a> <a href="../index.html"><img src="../../pix/back.gif" width=46height=41hspace=10 vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a><font size=1 face=helvetica, arial><li type=square><b><a href="../../home.html">Home Page</a></b> <li type=square><b><ahref="../../fight/index.html" target="_parent">JoinACTIONAID</a></b> <li type=square><b><a href="../index.html">Common Cause</a></b></font><br clear=all><p></body></html>

<font size=4><font size=+2>C</font>onstructing a water supply scheme in rural Pakistan involves more
than laying hundreds of feet of pipes.
Ensuring everybody has a say means overcoming vested interests. </font>

Before the new water supply scheme was built in Maira village the women spent many back-breaking
hours collecting water from distant wells. &quot;While the others were saying their morning prayers,
we
had to
go and fetch water. Most women suffer from headaches or back problems because they had to carry
such heavy loads of water pitchers every day. They go through life with this problem,&quot; says
Shams
Bibi, a
woman of Maira village. <p>
The old scheme consisted of seven lines supplying water to each household for only ten minutes every
alternate day. Rather than wait for their ten minute slot, the women used to take their water from
the
wells. <p>
The situation in nearby Swabi was, if anything, worse. This scheme consisted of an open pipeline
which
was only supplying water to the mosque and the local primary school. The only water source for
villagers
was the lake, which regularly dried up, and nearby wells. One Swabi woman said: &quot;My nine year
old
daughter would go to the well every day and night to collect five pitchers of water to meet our daily
needs. Sometimes we would go to the well three times a day. Each   trip used to take us half an
hour.&quot;<p>
Furthermore, to collect the water women had to pass through the fields where the men were working,
thus contravening the rules of Purdah.<p>
The need for an adequate water supply was obvious. The villagers were keen to take part in
constructing
a new one. The problem was, how to do this within the traditional power structures while ensuring
everyone had an equal say in how it was done.<p>
In Kalinger Union Council, villages are run by the Jirga system - a committee of influential village
elders -
which is one of the most powerful institutions in the region. The word 'jirga' comes from the Persian
language and means 'justice'. The system's functions are primarily to resolve conflicts, undertake
fundraising, ensure mosque development and settle differences between families.<p>
However, as ACTIONAID Pakistan staff found out, the Jirga is more just to some than to others.
Representing traditionally powerful members of a community, the Jirga is not accountable to the
poorest villagers, particularly the women, who had most interest in seeing that the water scheme was
fairly planned with standposts near their homes.<p>
To ensure the water scheme met everybody's needs and could be maintained without ACTIONAID's
involvement, ACTIONAID Pakistan staff realised that the villages would need a new organ- isation that
represented the whole community, but one that the Jirga would support.<p>
Creating this was started by inviting villagers to a series of public meetings, announced through the
public
address systems of mosques and by sending  messengers to each household.<p>
The first groups in Swabi and Maira were largely composed of village elders,  though some of them
were
too frail even to undertake monitoring the implementation work. They soon realised themselves that
younger people must take part.<p>
There was also the problem of vested interests, as Malik Ali former member of the Maira community
management structure explains: &quot;Some people joined the organisation because they were
interested in
the development of the area, while others were looking for individual and political gains.&quot;
Another
member
Khwaj Mohammed adds, &quot;Some tried their best to provide benefits to the rich and influential
people
in the
village with the hope that they would be able to get support in the future, if ever they faced any
difficulties.&quot;<p>
Others, like Haider Zaman, simply joined because they wanted to make a difference: &quot;I accepted
the
responsibility of representing my biradri (household grouping) because I believe I can work with
ACTIONAID
for the development of my area. I will try to instil a sense of trust and responsibility among my
people.&quot;<p>

At each stage of construction, differences had to be resolved. For example the distribution system
involved incorporating pipes from an older, defunct scheme, but once the pipes were dismantled, some
people removed them to use them for individual household connections. The onus was on the
community management structure to settle any disputes and ensure the principles of equity and
commitment to the scheme were upheld.<p>
Social and cultural constraints in the area do not allow the formation of mixed- gender community
groups, so involving the women in decision making was more difficult. Building on existing social
groups
such as the Koranic Recitation Meeting and the Tea Gathering (rather like a coffee morning),
ACTIONAID
was able to encourage the women to discuss together the implications of the scheme. Instigation of a
Standpost Location Meeting, perhaps the most important group, allowed the women to take part in
decisions about where the standposts would be.<p>
The women's Tea Gathering was invited to the completion ceremony, although they had to sit in a
separate house to maintain the traditions of purdah. One woman said: &quot;We are very pleased that
you
have invited us for this occasion. We want you to know that we are with you.&quot;<p>
Guldad, a Maira villager, sums it up by saying: &quot;I have now realised that there is a need for an
active
organisation in our village to work for the development of our area. The organisation can plan for
resources and implement projects. Now I will divert all my energy and efforts towards setting up and
working for such an organisation.&quot;

The only regular visitors are people like ACTIONAID staff, who largely come from other parts of Ghana.<p>During a recent planning and development meeting with the Ayakoliga community, discussions drifted towards the growing disregard for traditional values.<p>&quot;When I was a young boy,&quot; says village elder Asuribun Aketim, &quot;I used to sit by the fireside, sometimes late into the night, while my father talked to me about taboos and traditional values such as honesty and hard work. But these days our young men think that because they know books (educated), they have no need for traditional values. This is wrong.&quot;<p>&quot;Taboos (kisuk) are an important aspect of our way of life. They are a source of moral and spiritual guidance to our community. To disregard them is to disrespect 'Winaam', the supreme creator or God who is the author of all life, the maker of all divine laws.&quot; says another elder, Anugbilla Akoligo. Without written laws as in the case of Christian or Muslim religions, taboos play an important role by serving as 'community laws' to ensure harmony among and within communities.<p>&quot;For us,&quot; explains Akparibo Ayeebo, &quot;prayers alone are not enough. One has to comply with tradition and custom and especially respect traditional laws (taboos), otherwise one incurs the wrath of the ancestors and the displeasure of God.<p><TABLE BORDER=0 width=100%><TR><TH><TABLE BORDER=0 width=230 bgcolor=CCFFFF><TR><TD><img src="37.jpg" hspace=5 vspace=6 width=220 height=146></TD></TR><TR><TD> <p><font size=small face=helvetica> Ayaakoliga villagers discuss local traditions with an ACTIONAID worker.

This is the only way to stop them from taking punitive action,&quot; says Nba Akoligo.In Ayakoliga, adultery is considered one of the most serious taboos. &quot;If a woman commits adultery,&quot; explains Anaba Abere, &quot;she is not supposed to cook for the husband, otherwise he would die. She must confess so sacrifices can be performed to pacify the ancestors. If the woman does not confess, she would face difficulties during childbirth and she may die during labour. There have been many examples in this area and even health workers encourage women who experience problems during labour to speak out.&quot;<p><TABLE BORDER=0 width=180 align=left vspace=10 hspace=10><TR><TH><TABLE BORDER=0 width=160 bgcolor=CCFFFF><TR><TD><img src="36.jpg" hspace=5 vspace=6 width=150 height=222></TD></TR><TR><TD> <p> <font size=small face=helvetica>A pyramid of offerings at a traditional Ghanian funeral.

The husband buys a chicken, its legs are broken and it is then beaten to death with thorns, burnt, and the ashes are thrown away. The woman then enters the house naked and is cleansed by an older woman. She is now considered clean again.<p>Another taboo forbids intercourse between husband and wife during pregnancy and for at least two years after birth. &quot;This is to ensure that the baby is not disturbed during pregnancy and the mother does not pick another seed before the child is old enough to be weaned. It is exactly what the modern people call Aduamak (family planning),&quot; says Aketim. &quot;And this is why our society is polygamous, to avoid the strain that the man would certainly go through during this long period of abstinence. Women in a polygamous marriage consider themselves as sisters. There is absolutely no rivalry or bitterness since they all have an equal chance to share the man.&quot;<p>With little or no access to health   facilities traditional medicine plays an important role in the treatment of various diseases.<p>&quot;The best of our medicine men know many ancient remedies of which orthodox medicine is ignorant,&quot; says Arugbilla Akoligo. &quot;Our local medicine men can cure compound fractures, snake bites, asthma, fits, impotency.&quot;<p>Akparibo Ayeebo concludes: &quot;The world has changed so much that the conditions under which certain taboos were made do not exist any more. This means we need to modify certain aspects of our taboos. One taboo says that if a cow moos in the night it must be killed or the owner would die. In the days of old most farmers had several herds of cattle and it did not matter if one or two were killed. These days very few people have cattle. Imagine the plight of the farmer who has to kill his only bullock just because the poor animal got excited and mooed at night.&quot;<p>ACTIONAID field workers are very sensitive to local culture when working with communities. Sometimes taboos and traditional practices can help the progress of development work. The traditional respect for the land and the acknowledgement that it is precious and must be held in trust, for example, is a good basis on which to discuss environmental issues. It is more difficult, though, when staff see how certain taboos and practices can be detrimental, particularly to health. In some African countries children are prohibited from eating eggs, even in the hungry season when levels of malnutrition rise. A more stark example is the practice of female circumcision which is widespread in many parts of Africa and is surrounded by a number of taboos.<p>Knowing when to speak out and when to accept practices can only be learned over time. With staff and communities working closely together on planning and implementing projects a trust and confidence grows that makes it possible to discuss these issues quite openly.<br clear=all><p><hr><p>Find out more about ACTIONAID's work in <b><a href="../../info/ghana.html">Ghana</a></b><p><p><hr><p><a href="../../home.html"><img src="../../pix/home.gif" width=46height=41 hspace=10vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a><a href="../../fight/index.html" target="_parent"><imgsrc="../../pix/globe1.gif" width=46height=41hspace=10 vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a> <a href="../index.html"><img src="../../pix/back.gif" width=46height=41hspace=10 vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a><font size=1 face=helvetica, arial><li type=square><b><a href="../../home.html">Home Page</a></b> <li type=square><b><ahref="../../fight/index.html" target="_parent">JoinACTIONAID</a></b> <li type=square><b><a href="../index.html">Common Cause</a></b></font><br clear=all><p></body></html>

The pack contains 10 A2 colour photo-boards, which give pupils an accessible introduction to a range of topics including family life, journeys, weather, water and food. Easy-to-reference information appears on the back of each photo-board, together with over 60 practical classroom activities. Photocopiable resources such as maps, activity sheets and a story are also included.   <p>The Mahama Family, Ghana will enable pupils to study "a locality either in the UK or overseas, in which the physical and/or human features contrast with those of the locality of the school," (Geography National Curriculum - key stage 1) and to draw comparisons between their own lives and that of the Mahama family. The pack is ideal both for geography and for cross-curricular work.<p><b>Photo-board pack £45</b><p><hr><p><a href="../home.html"><img src="../pix/home.gif" width=46 height=41 hspace=10vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a><a href="../fight/index.html" target="_parent"><img src="../pix/globe1.gif" width=46 height=41hspace=10 vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a> <a href="resource.html"><img src="../pix/back.gif" width=46height=41hspace=10 vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a><font size=1 face=helvetica, arial><b><li type=square><a href="../home.html">Home Page</a> <li type=square><ahref="../fight/index.html" target="_parent">JoinACTIONAID</a> <li type=square><a href="resource.html">Resources for teachers</a></b></font><br clear=all><p></body></html>

<p><h3>Programme Overview </h3>

<p>ACTIONAID has been working in Bangladesh since 1983. Programmes are reaching more than 160,000
people in four development areas. 

<p>The focus of ACTIONAID's work in Bangladesh is on the formation of community groups called
shomitis. It is with these groups that the development initiatives are planned and managed, with an
emphasis on establishing savings and credit facilities and improving access to healthcare and
education
facilities.

<h3>Examples of ACTIONAID's work in Bangladesh </h3><b>ACTIONAID has:</b>

<p><ul><li>sunk 1,000 tube wells on Bhola Island to a depth of over 850 feet to provide clean water
for
more than 200,000 people.

<p><li>enabled more than 200,000 families to save and take small loans to stabilise household income,
set-up small businesses or, at times of crisis, purchase extra food or rebuild houses. 

<p><li>piloted a new approach to teaching adult literacy called Reflect (Regenerated Freirean
Literacy
through Empowering Community Techniques) where participants develop their own learning materials.
Group members construct maps, graphs and matrices  based on their own lives and through discussion
add key words. Experience has shown already that this technique is much more effective than teaching
adults by the same methods and with the materials used to teach children.

<p><li>helped more than 2000 households learn about improved health care practices, especially in
crucial
areas such as child care, sanitation and the treatment of common diseases.
</ul>

<h3>Programme Overview </h3>

<p>ACTIONAID began working in Ethiopia in 1988. Its programmes are reaching more than 150,000 people
in
five development areas including urban projects in Addis Ababa. 

<p>In all areas, ACTIONAID's work begins with a survey, conducted with the full participation of the
community. These create a picture of the society and show the nature and extent of poverty. From the
results, ACTIONAID  and the community can plan health, education, water, agriculture and investment
programmes which best meet local needs. 

<p>Wherever possible ACTIONAID works by supporting local institutions such as health committees and
parent/teacher associations. By building on existing skills and resources, ACTIONAID enables the
community to take controls of its own development.

<h3>Example of ACTIONAID's work in Ethiopia</h3><b>ACTIONAID has:</b>

<p><ul><li>developed a water scheme in the Dalocha area, by capping springs, creating ponds and
digging
wells, that will eventually provide clean water for the entire 75,000 population of the area.

<p><li>upgraded and equipped a health centre in Dalocha, renovated three health clinics, constructed
16
rural health posts and, through training of traditional midwives and community health workers, helped
improve the provision of primary health care in the Dalocha area.

<p><li>established 20 new community literacy centres and improved school facilities in Koysha, so
helping
more than 4,000 children to gain an education.

<p><li>helped people in the slum district of Entoto, Addis Ababa, to improve the quality of their
lives
through developing better access to healthcare, income generation, and savings and credit schemes.

<p><li>supported many local non-governmental organisations in their work with the rural and urban
poor.
In Addis Ababa, ACTIONAID is collaborating with DAY (Development and You) to promote HIV/AIDS
awareness.

<h3>Programme Overview </h3>

<p>ACTIONAID began work in Pakistan in 1992 and through work in two development areas is reaching a
population of nearly 50,000. 

<p>The key issues for the poor communities in these rural areas is access to clean water, poor
sanitation, limited health care facilities and low agricultural yields. In Bahawalnagar, where a
programme is currently being planned, work will specifically help communities tackle the severe
waterlogging and salinity problems which hamper agricultural production in the area. 

<h3>Examples of ACTIONAID's work in Pakistan:</h3>

<p><ul><li>ACTIONAID has worked with the people of Kalinger Union Council to develop a water and
sanitation project that has made safe water available to all 38,000 people in the area. All members
of the community  - the elders, farmers, women and young people - have contributed to the planning,
implementation and management of the new facilities, from laying pipes to deciding where standpipes
should be located.

<p><li>many women in rural villages are attended to by traditional birth attendants during labour as
the nearest health centre could be many kilometres away. While the midwives can be highly skilled
they are often not fully aware of hygiene issues or how to detect complications. An ACTIONAID
community health worker has provided training for the attendants in Kalinger Union Council so they
can incorporate new methods with their traditional skills.

<h3>Programme Overview </h3>

<p>ACTIONAID began working in Ghana in 1990 and, through work in two development areas, is now
reaching a population of more than 45,000 people. Addressing food security is the main focus of
activity in
both areas. 

<p>Families rely on small-scale farming for their survival and are at the mercy of erratic rainfall
and
pestilence problems. Severe food shortages can occur, leaving farmers with no seed left to plant for
the
following season. By providing seed on credit, developing grain banks, and improving composting and
soil
and water conservation,  ACTIONAID is helping farmers to improve their crop yields. Better access to
health care, clean water and education are also fundamental to improving the quality of life here.

<h3>Examples of ACTIONAID's work in Ghana</h3>
<b>ACTIONAID has:</b>

<p><ul><li>established a community based monitoring system to give early warning of food shortages.
By
checking food prices and availability in the markets every fortnight, watching for seasonal migration
to
the south in search of work and checking on attendance at schools, village development workers can
identify the earliest signs of food shortage. 

<p>ACTIONAID can then assist, for example, with community food distribution before the escalating
crisis
demands large scale emergency relief.

<p><li>provided low-interest seed loans in Sapeliga where erratic rains and crop pests often mean
there is
no surplus of seed for the next planting season. Over 90 per cent of farmers who have taken loans of
sorghum and groundnut have repaid their loans on time.

<p><li>been directly involved in peace discussions in northern Ghana, working with all parties to
seek a
resolution to ongoing problems. Ethnic conflict in 1994 and continuing insecurity in the region have
had an
impact on ACTIONAID programmes.

<p><li>In 1996 a new urban programme is to begin helping poor communities in Tamale in northern
Ghana.

<PRE>

NEWS FROM THE KIRKSTALL VALLEY CAMPAIGN

Residents of Kirkstall, Leeds are taking action this week in an attempt
to block plans for a large supermarket and retail complex in the
Kirkstall Valley.

A recent highly successful action in which supporters of Earth First!
occupied the Chairman of Morrisons PLC's office secured a meeting
between him and KVC, but the company failed to make any significant
concessions. Now, local residents are taking their own action which they
are inviting all organisations and individuals opposed to irresponsible
retail development to join.

On Thursday, January 30th at 4.00 pm there will be a "Mass Crossing" at
pedestrian controlled lights on the A65 (Kirkstall Road). This road is
already seriously overloaded at peak times, and the action could result
in "gridlock" right back to Leeds city centre. The proposed Morrison's
development would put between 5 and 10 thousand extra vehicles a day on
the route. People wishing to take part should meet at the Netto car park
on Kirkstall Road at 3.45. It is intended that the action will be over
by 5.00pm

The next day, Friday 31st Januiary, also at 4.00pm, we will demonstrate
outside Leeds Civic Hall where the LCC Highways. committee will be
meeting. This body has the power to prevent the Morrisons development by
refusing to approve the neccessary road works on the grounds that they
are not in the public interest. Meet for this action on the Civic Hall
steps at 3.45pm.

On the evening of Friday 31st there will be a benefit gig for the
Campaign. Local bands IZON PARADISE, THE TULIP LOUNGE and BINGO will be
playing at THE DUCHESS Vicar Lane, Leeds. Doors open 8.00pm, admission
three pounds.

Thanks again for your support - I hope we will be linking to you from
our very own page soon.

Development Co-operation Review Series:<br>European Community<br>
<i>OECD Development Assistance Committee</i><p></h3>
<h5>(Summary of Development Co-operation Review Series, Number ?, 1995)<br>
For a copy of the full report, please contact OECD Publications, 2 rue Andr&#233; Pascal, 75775 Paris cedex 16, France
<br>
Home Page: <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/index.htm" target="_top">http://www.oecd.org/dac/index.htm</a></h5>
</center><p>
<hr>
<h4>This Report</h4>
The OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) conducts periodic reviews to improve the individual and collective development co-operation efforts of its members.
<p>
The peer review is prepared by the Secretariat and involves staff from development agencies in other DAC member countries. A draft report is prepared by the Secretariat and it forms the basis for a review meeting with the member.
<p>
This publication contains the conclusions as agreed by DAC following the review meeting on 19 September 1995, as well as the report prepared by the Secretariat team.
<p>
<h4>Main Points</h4>
The European Commission (EC) of the European Union is a large and unique multilateral donor with distinctive and ambitious development cooperation goals. At the same time, the EC is also charged to promote coordination among its Member States. Although each Member State has its own development cooperation programme, the Maastricht Treaty specifically envisions a common development policy to be complmented by those of the Member States. The Union is also pledged to take account of its agreed development objectives in the full range of its policies that are likely to affect developing countries.
<p>
The Commission's large aid programme is growing faster than the national programmes of its Member States. By 1994, over 17 per cent of total EU Member States' overseas development assistance was channelled through the EC making it the second largest multilateral donor after the World Bank. With the amount of Member State aid passing through the Commission projected to continue growing, the effectiveness of EC aid is crucial to the overall European effort.
<p>
<h4>Main Points</h4>
Since the last DAC review in 1991, the Commission has made significant progress in several areas. It has introduced project cycle management and the logical framework for project designs, expanded staff training, upgraded its evaluation programme, improved its staffing, promoted a culture of greater transparency and accountability, and strengthened its analytic capacity.
<p>
In its earlier review, the DAC suggested that the EC might benefit from some organisational streamlining and general simplification. However, the organisational structure remains complex as is to be expected from an organisation that aims to group together all the Commission's bilateral external relations in one structure. It is now a major and conscious policy of the EC to strengthen internal coordination, cooperation, and sharing of experience.
<p>
Despite these welcome improvements, the DAC suggests that the Commission still needs to strengthen its capabilities to plan, manage, and implement its new generation of projects. These require a high level of skilled dialogue with recipient countries and patient nurturing of local ownership, particpation, and local ownership. Finally, the DAC suggested that the Commission consider creating a single evaluation unit to encompass all the development activities of the EU, instead of having several units as at present.
<p>

<hr><h3><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>
This report describes in broad terms the possibilities for cooperation between Advisory Councils for Development
Cooperation, including other institutions that may have an advisory function for development cooperation policy in
the current 12 Member States of the EU as well as in the three new Member States, Norway, and Switzerland.
<p>
The report is the result of a one year survey carried out by the European Centre for Development Policy
Management (ECDPM) on behalf of the National Advisory Council for Development Cooperation (NAR) in the
Netherlands. The survey was conducted by Annemiek Kooij under a contract with ECDPM. The report was written by Annemiek Kooij and Ren&#233; Mevis, deputy secretary to the NAR.
<p>
In 1989, the Irish Advisory Council on Development Cooperation (the predecessor of the current Aid Advisory
Committee) and the NAR decided to initiate activities for cooperation between advisory institutions for
development cooperation policy in Europe. A need was felt to strengthen national advisory activities, and to
contribute to the strengthening of the coherence and coordination of EU development policy. 
<p>
In 1991, the idea was discussed in a workshop in The Hague, with participants from several advisory institutions in
Europe. The meeting was also attended by a representative of the Directorate General for Development Cooperation
(DG VIII) of the European Commission (NAR, 1992). Participants concluded that policy making on national as
well as on European level could benefit from coordinated or joint advisory efforts. It was decided that efforts for
cooperation should be continued. A subsequent NAR report on development cooperation after the Treaty of
Maastricht in 1993 recommended that one of the ways for cooperation was for members of several interested
advisory institutions in Europe to produce a joint report on a common theme (NAR, 1993).
<p>
In June and December 1993, DG VIII organised meetings to build up direct and bilateral contacts with experts and
researchers in EU Member States. These were attended by several members of Councils and institutes that were
also involved in the cooperation activities that resulted from the workshop held in the Hague. DG VIII clearly
focuses on gaining access to information and knowledge that is available in Europe for its policy-making. Both
initiatives run parallel, and sometimes they meet. This report might give some clues for a possible common future.
<p>
In 1993, NAR asked ECDPM to explore more detailed possibilities for further cooperation of advisory institutions
and structures for development cooperation. Terms of Reference were designed along the following lines:
<ol>
<li>To conduct a survey of existing advisory structures, of which the results could be discussed at a workshop.
<li>To collect and disseminate information among participants in the survey and among interested institutions,
concentrating on published recommendations. Where appropriate, the feasibility of publishing English summaries
of recommendations should be discussed, in order to facilitate future exchange of information among participants,
notably by NAR and ECDPM.
<li>To explore the feasibility of a follow-up meeting of the 1991 workshop in The Hague.
<li>To indicate ways for the continuation and strengthening of future cooperation.
</ol>
<p>
The survey would focus on Formal Advisory Institutions, i.e. Advisory Councils for Development Cooperation
Policy installed by the Government, and which have the explicit mandate to advise the Government on matters of
development cooperation policy. This definition does not take into account other characteristics, such as
procedures, right of initiative or actually performed functions; these were to be considered as secondary. 'Policy'
was defined as general development policy, excluding specific policies for sectors or countries. A Council can be
classified in this category when at least its mandate permits it to advise on general policy questions; actually it may
also cover other areas. These Institutions are described in this report under the paragraphs two of each country
report, headed 'Formal Advisory Institutions'. Other institutions that might have a policy advisory function are
described in the paragraphs three, 'Other Actors'.
<p>
NAR and ECDPM agreed further that in those countries where there are no Formal Advisory Institutions, leading
research institutes that may have a policy advisory function would be included in the survey. All advisory
institutions, structures and mechanisms in those countries are described under the heading 'Advisory Structures and
Mechanisms'. Research institutes were supposed to have expertise on issues that are essential both to policy
making by national Governments and by the EU institutions.

For the survey, literature on the 17 countries was studied and interviews were held with representatives of relevant
institutions in 14 countries (no interviews were held with institutions in Greece, Italy and Luxembourg).
<p>
In the country reports, Advisory Councils for Development Cooperation and other institutions that may have an
advisory function are described in their policy and administrative context. The last paragraphs connect with
advisory  aspects of the work of NGOs and other relevant groups in society. Country reports include descriptions
of: 1) development cooperation: history and support; policies and changes; administrative structures; policy
planning and coordination; policy papers; 2) advisory institutions and structures: history and tasks; membership;
procedures; agenda's and publications; 3) other actors: Parliament; NGOs; research institutes; private enterprise.
<p>
The final chapter summarises the main characteristics and trends observed in the description of development
cooperation policies and administrative structures, and it summarises and categorises the various advisory
structures. It concludes with an overview of possibilities for future cooperation between advisory institutions in
Europe. 
<p>
Many aspects of development cooperation are covered in the country reports. However, the authors have no
intention to be complete. Including an aspect serves to place advisory structures and their functioning in the
relevant context. The survey is not an evaluation. It intends to give a fair picture of structures and activities as they
are reported in documents and discussions. Naturally, all opinions expressed and observations reported are the
responsibility of the authors.

<b>On 20 December 1995, the EU Development Council met, under the Presidency of Jos Luis Decenta Balleester, Spanish Secretary of State for International Co-operation and Latin America.  Included on the Council's agenda was discussion of a number of proposed regulations providing legal bases for the implementation of existing EU budget lines.  In discussing these proposed regulations, the Council became enmeshed in a lengthy - and in two cases inconclusive - debate on 'comitology' (comitologie, in French).  Since the proposals under discussion - co-financing, decentralised co-operation, rehabilitation, South Africa, humanitarian aid, food aid and security, refugees - all concern the NGO community, EURO-CIDSE embarked on a crash course on this somewhat esoteric (if not arcane) institutional procedure.  We are grateful for all those in the European institutions - Council, Commission, European Parliament - who gave unstintingly of their time and patience as unpaid tutors.  We are particularly indebted to  The European Parliament, Second Edition by Francis Jacobs, Richard Corbett and Michael Shackleton  for its introduction to this issue.  In this initial article, we try to explain (as simply as the subject allows), what is comitology, what is its scope, why does it matter and what are the views of the European Institutions, and an NGO perspective on the budget lines under question.</b>
<p>
<A NAME="wha"><h3>What is Comitology?</h3></a>

Comitology is essentially "Eurospeak" for the variety of committees and procedures utilised in implementing EU legislation.  Whilst most Community legislation provides for the Commission , as the executive arm of the European Community, to implement, execute and adapt its provisions, over the years the Council has subordinated  Commission powers to the scrutiny and approval of committees comprised of national civil servants of the EU Member States.  In essence, therefore, is a question of how the executive powers of the Commission are circumscribed by Member States.  Since the European Parliament, as a democratically elected body, also sees a role for itself, which we deal with below, this has been an issue of some controversy and will certainly be on the agenda of the 1996 Inter-Governmental Conference which will open in Turin on March 29.
<p>
The issue is further complicated by the fact that there are three types of committee under the comitology procedure (originating from a Council Decision of 13 July 1987 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission - Official Journal of the European Communities of July 18 1987) :
<ul>
<li>Type 1. This is an advisory Committee. The Commission submits to the committee a draft of the measures to be taken and the Committee delivers an opinion.  The Commission then takes a decision taking into "the utmost account of the opinion delivered by the Committee".
<p>
<li>Type 2. This is a management Committee.  If a qualified majority within the Committee is opposed to the Commission's proposals, then either a) the Com-mission may delay the application of its decision for up to one month; or b) the Commission shall delay the application of its decision for up to three months.  Within these deadlines, the Council, by qualified majority, may take a different decision .
<p>
<li>Type 3. This is a regulatory Committee.  If the Commis-sion is not supported by a qualified majority (i.e. a blocking minority) in the Committee, the matter is referred to Council for a decision within three months.  If the Council fails to adopt a position then a) the proposed measures shall be adopted by the Com-mission or b) the Commission shall adopt its proposal unless a simple majority in Council votes against it, in which case no decision os taken (i.e. back to the drawing board).
<p></ul>
An additional complication is the process involving the three European institutions for determining the comitology procedure.  Under the Co-Decision Procedure, the Parliament has more power and the comitology procedure is governed by an interim  modus vivendi on comitology adopted on 19 December 1994.  However, the budget lines we are dealing with here fall under the Co-operation Procedure  (which governs development co-operation under the Maastricht Treaty) under which the Parliament has less power and the procedure is government by the Plumb-Delors agreement (an exchange of letters between the then President of the European Parliament of 11 December 1987 and the then President of the Commission of 14 March 1988 and which essentially establishes rules/guidelines for notifying Parliament of draft implementing measures).   Under the Co-operation procedure, the Parliament gives a first reading of the Commission proposal.  The matter then goes to Council.  Once Council has adopted a Common Position, the proposed regulation goes back to Parliament for a second reading.  The Parliament must, within three months, approve, reject or amend (with an absolute majority of 314 votes) the Council Position. The Commission then examines the Council's Common Position and Parliament's amendments and presents a revised proposal to the Council.  The Commission is not obliged to accept Parliament's amendments, but Parliament can threaten to reject the Common Position if they are not taken into account and the legislation will fall.  The Council can overrule the Parliament's rejection - but only if the Council is unanimous and with the agreement of the Commission.  
<p>
The Commission could seek a compromise with the Council, such as agreeing to the use of a II committee instead of a IIIa committee.  If the Commission, however, maintains its position (for example to have no committee with regard to co-financing), with the support of at least one Member State and the Parliament, then in the Council's Second Reading, the Member States have three months to approve by qualified majority or amend with unanimity.  If Council does neither, the proposal falls.   
<p>
<A NAME="sco"><h3>The scope of comitology</h3></a>

In 1995, in response to action taken by the Parliament in the exercise of its proper budgetary powers (to which we will return), the Commission produced a document Budget 1995 Comitologie, the size of two telephone directories.   These documents were analyzed - in what can only be described as a Herculean task - by Terry Wynn MEP (UK, Socialist Group) in a report of 25 July 1995 and which gave rise to a Parliamentary resolution on this issue.  His report states :
<p>
<i>	"1,918 pages in the two volumes and the addendum describe the activities of 424 committees that prepared 4679 "acts" in total during 1994 - either in the form of decisions (199), opinions (4193) or absence of opinions (287).  The sectors on which these committees work cover almost all areas in the Community budget.  It is not always clear how the distinction between decisions and opinions is made, given that 60 of the 199 decisions were made by consultative committees.  The activities of these committees cost 17.98 MECUS, or an average of about 3,480 ECUs per "act", or about 42,400 ECUs per Committee.
<p>
	"Based on the cases where committee type is specified (all under A-2510), the largest proportion are consultative committees (178 Type 1), although 7 further cases are mixed Type 1 and 2 or Type 1 and 3 committees.  Nevertheless, 72 are management committees of Type 2 (20 Type 2b) and 84 are regulatory committees of Type 3 (19 Type 3b with safeguard powers for the Council)."</i>
<p>
In two later paragraphs, Terry Wynn's report goes on to say :
<p>
<i>	"Agriculture is the sector with the most committees (79), followed by external relations (50), customs and indirect taxation (47), environment, nuclear safety and civil protection (43) employment, industrial relations and social affairs, and industry (both 30), fisheries (20), education, professional training and youth (12) statistics (11), energy (10) consumer affairs (8), telecommunications and information policy (7).
<p>
	"Agriculture is also the sector that accounts for the largest number of "acts" : 61% of all "acts" emanate from the agricultural committees.  Strangely, the order of the number of "acts" does not then follow closely that of the numbers of committee in each sector.  The industry committees were responsible for 409 "acts", employment, industrial relations and social affairs for 324, development with four committees for 221 "acts", customs and indirect taxation for 193, external relations 129."</i>>
<p>
The four development committees cited above comprise :
<ul>
<li>The EDF Committee which covers the 70 ACP countries of the Lom Convention (it should be noted in this regard that, pending budgetisation of the EDF - called for by the Commission and the Parliament - the EDF remains an intergovernmental affair).
<li>The ALA Committee which covers Asia and Latin America
<li>The MED Committee which covers the Middle East and North African countries
<li>The Food Aid Committee which covers food aid.
</ul>
The three regional committees (EDF, ALA and MED) have been described to us by everyone we have spoken to as Type 3a committees.  And certainly this is the case for the ALA and the MED Committees, according to the Budget 1995 (Official Journal of the European Communities L 369 of 31 December 1994).  Interestingly, this same official journal lists the EDF committee as a Type 1 committee i.e. advisory.  Food Aid, for its part, has operated, albeit without a legal base, under a Type 2 b Committee.
<p>
There are six pages in the 1,918 page tomes devoted to DG VIII, Development.  The lists give a 1 or 2 line 'object of the act' e.g. Rwanda - humanitarian aid for the population of Rwanda; Ethiopia - social rehabilitation programme; Chad - support for structural adjustment - general import programme.  Adjacent (although we have found gaps in the information) to each act is the committee decision.  There are 3 choices : A (for avis or opinion); a (for absence d'avis, or no opinion), and D for decision.  In every case of the four development committees there is an A.  There is no information on the nature of this opinion.
<p>
<A NAME="iss"><h3>The issues and the views of the Institutions</h3></a>

The issues involved in comitology fall into two distinct categories.  The first, and most important, category is essentially political and involves issues of democratic control, transparency, oversight and accountability.  The second can be summarised as cumbersome bureaucratic delays (or bureaucratic Bumbledom).  These may not only impinge on the timely intervention of EU assistance and add to the heavy administrative burden of the Commission but must also impact on the think-tank/policy formulation aspects of Commission work which can provide a vital tool for/important impetus to EU development policy formulation, coherence, and co-ordination. 
<p>
<A NAME="par"><h4>The Parliament</h4></a>

The Parliament's view on comitology is clear - it is not happy with the current procedures (although it tends to accept Type 1 committees, tolerates at a pinch Type 2 committees and is totally opposed to Type 3 committees).  In his introduction to his report for the Budgets Committee, Terry Wynn states :
<p>
<i>	"The problems raised by comitology are not recent.  All governments devolve executive responsibilities onto committees which may advise, decide or simply deliberate.  The members of such committees are, as a rule, not elected and are generally appointed by the government in power - the executive.
<p>
	"Elected legislators have overseen the actions of these committees often with scepticism.  First, the committees meet in secret and maintain secrecy over the decisions that are taken by them or over the advice that they proffer to the government minister concerned; second, the members of the committees are not elected by often are chosen by the government to which they give advice; thirdly, the elected representatives have felt that some decisions taken in such committees have changed the sense of the legislators (as they interpret that).  From this derives the charge that these committees may subvert the legislative process, being unelected and almost always meeting in secret and therefore not being subject to oversight of the budgetary and legislative authority."</i>
<p>
The 2 volume tomes mentioned above were as a result of the decision in Parliament's budgetary resolutions of 27 October 1994 and 15 December 1994 to place in reserve 90% of the proposed funding for budget lines A-2510 and A-2511 (the budget lines covering the activities of the committees) pending information from the Commission on the decisions and other acts during 1994 by the committees.  On 2 February 1995 the Commission produced its two volume summary and subsequent decisions (the last of which on 10 July 1995) agreed to the transfer of the funds out of reserve.  In the 1996 Budgetary procedure, the Parliament has placed 50% of the proposed allocation in reserve.  
<p>
Introducing his report to the Parliament plenary session in October 1995, Terry Wynn stated :
<p>
<i>	"The reason for this action is the concern of the Budget Committee that the budgetary and legislative competencies of Parliament may be infringed whenever the Council and the Commission take such decisions through the comitology procedure.  The Commission says - and we welcome its commitment - that the Union should now be more democratic, transparent, accountable and accessible.  Comitology is none of these."</i>
<p>
In producing his report, the rapporteur sought and received the opinions of the Parliamentary Committees on Agriculture and Rural Development; Research, Technological Development and Energy; Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights; Social Affairs and Employment; Regional Policy;  Culture, Youth, Education and the Media; Development and Co-operation; Institutional Affairs; and Fisheries.  All had their own critical comments to make : the uneven quality of information supplied, internal information in the Commission on the activities of these committees seems partial and not centralised, points to inconsistencies and lack of oversight etc. etc.
<p>
In his written opinion to the Committee on Budgets, Umberto Scapagnini MEP (Italy, UPE Group) and Chairman of the  Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, stated that the two volumes produced by the Committee represent :
<p>
<i>	"a first attempt to shed some light on comitology procedures in the Commission.  As such, for most of the committees whose work is "described", it represents little more than a single candle burning in the darkness."</i>
<p.
Arguing the need for greater democratic control and accountability, he cited one example which we found particularly pertinent :
<p>
<i>	"To take one instructive example, the proposed Commission directive on infant formula and follow-up milks revealed certain flaws in this process.  Since this proposal was deemed to be an implementing measure within the framework of an existing Council Directive, it did not require Parliamentary approval, just that of the expert committee.  However, details of the proposal were brought to the Environment Committee's attention not as a result of the Plumb-Delors agreement - but by a pressure group which had obtained a leaked copy.  Parliament subsequently adopted a resolution which prompted a revision of the proposal.  Our own experience in the Research Committee is that we seem to have very few comitology documents provided to us via the mechanisms established by the Plumb-Delors Agreement."</i>
<p>
The Parliament's consequent resolution of 26 October 1995 reflects the criticisms outlined above and includes the following paragraphs :
<ul>
<li>Recommends that a timetable is set at the end of which all executive committees set up under Union legislation would meet as a rule in public, unless a specific duly-motivated decision is taken to the contrary and published in good time, and that the dates and times and places of these meetings be published in time to allow those who wish to attend to do so;
<li>Recommends also that the members of these committees register their interests in a public record, that is regularly updated;
<li>Supports the systematic addition, in the comitology paragraph of legislative proposals establishing committees, of the following text : <i>The committee shall meet as a rule in public, unless a specific duly motivated decision is taken to the contrary and published in good time,  It shall publish agendas two weeks in advance of its meetings.  It shall publish minutes of its meetings.  It shall establish a public register of declarations of interest by its members."</i>
<li>In the meantime requests that the principles agreed in the modus vivendi be generalised to all legislative procedures and that the information be forwarded in good time without exception.  to this effect, proposes to place in reserve in the 1996 budget the funding foreseen for the committee activities and requests the Commission to provide information on the activities of the committees before the transfer request is considered. 
</ul><p>
<A NAME="com"><h4>The Commission</h4></a>

In the Parliamentary debate on the Wynn report in October 1995, Commissioner Erkki Antero Liikanen, Commissioner for the Budget, thanked him for his report and stated :
<p>
<i>	"Lastly, with regard to the report by Mr. Wynn on the question of information concerning committees, I recognise the serious concerns of Parliament in this area.  The Commission shares the objectives of transparency, effectiveness and appropriate interinstitutional co-operation.  The Commission provides regular information on the activitires of the executive committees in its annual report and in the budgetary procedure.  It will continue to do so, as requested.  furthermore, the Commission has quickly provided substantial additional information, which was rather broad in the 1995 budgetary procedure.  It is ready to do so again in 1996.  We may want to reflect on the most suitable form and context - I think you concur with this remark.
<p>
	"The Commission is fully committed to the application of modus vivendi agreed in December 1994.  It is willing to review its proper functioning, but it may be useful to have some more experience with such a new procedure.
<p>
	"With regard to the substantial changes concerning the information on the executive committees called for in the Wynn report, the Commission will take a position before the end of the year.  It will have to examine what improvements are possible in the current legel framework.  Other changes may require modifications of the Treaty which could be a result of the intergovernmental conference...."</i>
<p>
Commissioner Liikanen's speech was followed up in a letter of 21 December 1995 from David Williamson, Secretary General for the European Commission to Enrico Vinci, Secretary General of the European Parliament.  We reproduce the bulk of this letter here (leaving out only the introductory paragraph and the standard concluding sentences) :
<p>
<i>" Une note sur le fonctionnement des comit&#233;s en 1995 sera transmise au Parlement europ&#233;en dans les meilleurs d&#233;lais, et au plus tard au cours du premier semestre 1996.  L'information sera plus synth&#233;tique que celle donn&#233;e en 1995 et fournira un bilan d'ensemble.  Elle permettra notamment de distinguer entre les diff&#233;rents types de comit&#233;s, leurs fonctions et leur apport &#224; la gestion des politiques communautaires.
<p>
"La Commission a &#233;galement l'intention de re&#233;diter le r&#233;pertoire des comit&#233;s, publi&#233; dans le pass&#233; sous la forme d'un suppl&#233;ment au bulletin de l'Union europ&#233;enne : cette publication constituera un pas important vers une plus grande transparence et une meilleure connaissance des comit&#233;s.  Elle sera, bien entendu, mise Une note sur le fonctionnement des comit&#233;s en 1995 sera transmise au Parlement europ&#233;en.
<p>
"Ces mesures seront rendues possibles gr&#226;ce au renforcement et &#224; la modernisation progressive de la coordination interne au sein de la Commission.  Ce renforcement et cette modernisation ne doivent cependant pas faire oublier la n&#233;cessit&#233; d'une gestion d&#233;centralis&#233;e, qui tient &#224; la fonction m&#234;me frd comit&#233;s.  Ceux-ci ne constituent en effet pas un bloc, mais doivent r&#233;pondre aux exigences propres et sp&#233;cifiques de chacune des politiques communautaires.

"D'autres mesures pourraient &#233;galement &#234;tre envisag&#233;es.  C'est ainsi que la Commission examinera de facon pragmatique et modul&#233;e les voies permettant une information plus concr&#232;te et continue du Parlement europ&#233;en, par exemple au travers de ses commissions.  Il faudra en tout cas &#233;viter toute surcharge administrative et respecter les crit&#232;res de rapidit&#233; et d'efficacit&#233; qui s'imposent.

"La Commission veillera aussi &#224; ce que le flux des documents transmis au titre du "modus vivendi" ou de l'accord Plumb-Delors soit r&#233;gulier et demeure toujours conforme &#224; l'esprit de ces accords.

"Je voudrais enfin attirer votre attention sur le fait que certains des point figurant dans la r&#233;solution n'impliquent pas la seule Commission.  Je me r&#233;fère, par exemple, aux demandes du Parlement europ&#233;en concernant la publicit&#233; des r&#233;unions des comit&#233;s et le registre d'int&#233;r&#234;ts de leurs membres, qui visent des mati&#232;res o&#249; les responsabilit&#233;s sont partag&#233;es avec les Etats membres.  En tout &#233;tat de cause, la Commission pourrait soulever certains d ces points aupr&#232;s des instances du Conseil.
<p>
"Ces aspects mis&#224; part, pour les questions relevant de sa responsabilit&#233;, la Commission consid&#232;re que les mesures &#224; prendre suite &#224; la r&#233;solution WYNN devraient permettre de r&#233;pondre aux attentes du Parlement en mati&#232;re de simplification et de transparence accrue, tout en continuant &#224; garantir la bonne collaboration entre la Commission et les administrations nationales."</i>
<p>
In other words, and without being too unkind, the Commission will do what is can to simplify, to synthesise and make more accessible information on the workings of committees under the comitology procedures, but can do little on its own about the central issue of the Wynn report - the question of democratic accountability and control.
<p>
From speaking to a number of officials within the Commission, the bureaucratic procedures which accompany the comitology procedure (and in general, the more stringent the committee, the more bureaucratic the procedure) and which strain already overstretched resources e.g. having to produce documents in 11 languages and seven weeks before a committee meeting in some cases.
<p>
<A NAME="cou"><h4>The Council</h4></a>

The position of the Council seems less straightforward - as the lengthy debate during the December 20 Development Council indicates.  But we begin by quoting from the Report of the Reflection Group for the Intergovernmental Conference of December 5th 1995.  This Council Reflection Group, chaired by Spanish Secretary of State for Relations with the European Union, Carlos Westendorp , presented its report to the Madrid Summit of 15-16 December 1995 and the Summit "considers that the guidelines distilled within the Group, following a thorough analysis of the internal and external challenges facing the Union and the possible responses, constitute a sound basis for the work of the Conference."  It should be stressed that this substantial document covers all aspects to be dealt with during the IGC and committee procedure only rates a few paragraphs but which are, nevertheless, worth quoting.  
<p>
<i>Powers of execution (committee procedure)
	<p>
127.  On this subject, which the interinstitutional "modus vivendi" of 20 December 1994 identified as one to be dealt with by the Conference, there are the following positions :
<ul>
<li>Those in favour of a hierarchy of acts resolve this issue by assigning full power to the Commission, subject to control by the Council and the European Parliament.
<p>
<li>Those opposed to granting executive power to the Commission because they believe it would disturb the balance between the institutions are willing to consider simplified procedures which would not undermine the Council's executive functions.
<p>
<li>There is a compromise proposal for a single procedure under which it would be up to the Commission, in consultation with national experts, to decide on implementing measures under the supervision of the Council and the EP, which could cancel the measures and request the application of normal legislative procedures.  At least one member pointed out that opposition by a minority of States should be sufficient to reject any implementing measure.
</ul>
128.  In any case, a large majority in the Group is in favour of simplifying the present committee procedure, which is already complicated and confused and will not survive beyond the next enlargement.  The need to improve the quality of the rules adopted under these procedures was also emphasised.
<p>
In any event, revision of the 1987 Decision on committee procedure does not require reform of the Treaty and therefore consideration must be given to the improvements which can be introduced before the Conference.  In this context, one member has suggested the idea of introducing a standard set of internal rules of procedure to apply to all committees.</i>
<p>
The last two paragraphs are particularly important in the light of the discussions at the 20 December Council meeting.  
<p>
<h4>The December 20 Council Discussions</h4>

As stated in the introduction to this article, the Council discussed the refugees regulation, food aid and security regulation, humanitarian aid regulation (ECHO), South Africa regulation, rehabilitation regulation, co-financing regulation and decentralised co-operation regulation.  Whilst there are significant differences of opinion in terms of comitology with regard to these regulations, it is fair to say that there is a general tendency in Council to go for Type 3a committees.  In discussing this issue with Council sources, three principal arguments emerge :
<ul>
<li>the standardisation of committee pro-cedures and to bring them in line with the three regional committees (EDF, ALA and MED);

<li>the desire of Member States to co-ordinate their activities more closely and this includes financing decisions;

<li>the desire to have a greater say in major policy decisions.  Two examples were cited : a) the decision of the Commission to suspend development aid to Rwanda following the Kibeho massacre  -  decision which at least some in Council were not in agreement; b) that, of the humanitarian aid to Latin America, 80% went to Cuba.  In addition, it is argued, that the new EU Member States are significantly altering their aid patterns, due to their adherence to the EU, and consequently want a greater say in policy decisions.
</ul>
With regard to the individual regulations discussed, the results of the Council were as follows :
<p>
<h4>Refugees</h4>
	
Awaiting Parliament's views on this regulation but the tendency is towards an ALA Committee procedure (Type 3a).
<p>
<h4>Food Aid & Security	</h4>

The Commission has reached a Common Position on this regulation.  For actions above 2 MECUs, the Commission will be assisted by a Type 2b committee (as is the practice at present).
<p>
<h4>Humanitarian Aid</h4>

The Council has approved a Common Position by a qualified majority (with Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands voting against on the grounds that they wanted a tougher comitology procedure - Type 3a).  This common position is a complex and sui generis mix of comitology procedure.  In so far as it has been explained to EURO-CIDSE by Council sources, this involves a) a Type 1 committee for annual guidelines of the programme and for evaluation and management;  b) a Type 2b committee for global plans or expensive and ongoing crisis situations; c) a Type 3a committee for sensitive issues, irrespective of the amount of money involved, such as where there is a question of the military protection of humanitarian aid supplies or where ECHO intervenes directly; d) an urgency procedure where the Commission can decide alone in cases of urgency (defined in the Common Position) for an amount up to 10 MECU.  For amounts up to 2 MECU, the Commission decides (and informs the Member States through the 14 Point Telex reporting system).  Where the amount is in excess of 2 MECU, the Commission must inform the Member States in writing within 48 hours and account for its decision at the committee's next meeting, in particular giving the reasons for its use of the emergency procedure.  Any extension of the particular action needs to go back to the Type 2b committee.
<p>
<h4>South Africa (EPRD)	</h4>

Although no Common Position document is to date available, the Council unanimously agreed that this budget line will be governed by a Type 3a committee.
<p>
<h4>Rehabilitation</h4>

The Common Position states that the Commission shall be assisted "by the relevant geographically determined committee" i.e. EDF, MED, ALA or Type 3a committee for grants of more than 2 MECU.  At the same time, the Commission shall inform the Committee of decisions under 2 MECU not later than 1 week before the decision is taken.  (The Commission can also overrun, without seeking the opinion of the Committee, for an amount less or equal to 20% of the initial financing decision.  If the additional commitment is less than 4 MECU, the Commission shall inform the Committee.  If it is more than 4 MECU. but less than 20%, the Committee's opinion shall be sought).
<p>
<h4>Co-Financing with NGOs</h4>

The Council was unable to reach a Common Position on the comitology issue.  The Commission, supported by Belgium and Luxembourg wants to maintain the current practice of having no committee.  We understand that Germany, the Netherlands, UK and Finland would like a Type 3a.  We understand further that the then Spanish Presidency argued for a Type 2b committee.  We have no information on the position of other member states.  This issue will again be discussed by Council on May 28.  
<p>
<h4>Decentralised Cooperation</h4>

As with the Co-financing Budget line, there was disagreement within Council on the comitology issue, with some  Member States arguing for a Type 3a committee.

<p>
<A NAME="ngo"><h3>Some NGO Perspectives</h3></a>

EURO-CIDSE has tried to tackle this issue in some depth since we are convinced, as Terry Wynn cogently argues, that there are fundamental issues at stake - how can we argue for the promotion  of human rights, democracy and good governance when it comes to development co-operation, if we do not ensure it in our own community, our own European Union.  It is also important that NGOs are not dismissed as simply defending their own turf - we are, of course, but the issue is much broader than that and cannot simply be confined to the kind of horizontal standardisation which the Council appears to favour.
<p>
Before looking individually at the budget lines in question, three preliminary remarks can be made :
<ul>
<li>standardisation is by no means synonymous with simplification (as the Council Reflection Group suggests), especially when the standard is the most stringent type of committee and which, in the Parliament's view, makes the Commission's task of implementing legislation unnecessarily lengthy, complicated and cumbersome.  
<p>
<li>the co-ordination of Member States' activities is both a laudable and a necessary objective.  However, the establishment of a committee will not per se bring this about unless a genuine exchange of information and increased collaboration is part of its terms of reference.  The experience of committees to date seems in general that Member States are well apprised of Commission activity but that this largely remains a one-way street.
<p>
<li>the desire to have a greater say in policy is quite understandable, particularly as the EU and its budget continues to grow.  If we take but one example, that of humanitarian aid, its expenditure has increased from around 100 MECU at the beginning of the decade and the Iraqi crisis to 765 MECU last year.  But the question remains whether the current committee structure (which tends to be project/programme oriented) of national civil servants is best suited to such policy discussions or whether it assists in the process of democratic accountability, co-decision making and interinstitutional co-operation.
</ul><p>
With regard to individual budget lines, we would offer the following comments :
<p>
With regard to Humanitarian Aid (ECHO) and the Rehabilitation regulations :
<ul>
<li>The ECHO procedure seems extraordinarily complicated, particularly since NGOs regard all of ECHO's work, including short term rehabilitation which is part of its mandate as urgent.
<p>
<li>ECHO deals with an enormous volume of work.  In 1995 ECHO dealt with  205 decisions.  For example, if there is an outbreak of civil strife in country x (with attendant refugee problems, outbreaks of disease etc.) ECHO goes to Council for a decision, indicating the types of actions it envisages and proposing a global amount e.g. 10 MECU.  Out of those decisions, in 1995, there emerged between 12,000 and 15,000 contracts.  This volume of work and its urgent nature argue for the most simplified procedures possible.
<p>
<li>In this regard, the fine print of whatever procedures are finally put in place are critical - and these internal regulations are determined by the committee(s) itself once the Parliament has given the regulation its second reading and once the Council has ratified it.  Questions such as the number of languages documents have to be produced in, written procedures/consultations, length of time to take decisions (e.g. within 48 hours or longer) become literally critical in the life-or-death situations with which ECHO is sadly all too frequently confronted.
<p>
<li>The NGO community has some experience with rehabilitation under a Type 3a committee.( in this case the EDF Committee).  It will be recalled that, for a number of years the European NGO community (EURO-CIDSE, the EU-NGDO Liaison Committee, Caritas Europa, EUROSTEP, EURONAID and APRODEV) had long campaigned for special Community measures for rehabilitation, particularly in Africa.  The campaign had both short term and long term objectives : a) to ensure immediate recovery programme for Africa's agriculture and infrastructure modelled in the special EC food aid programmes for Africa in 1991 and 1992; b) to secure a permanent financial instrument i.e. the establishment of a specific rehabilitation budget line.  This campaign came to political fruition in 1993 when a) the May 1993 Development Council launched a fast-track Special Initiative for African Recovery with an immediate allocation of 100 MECU; b) at the instigation of Commission and with strong support from the Parliament, a rehabilitation budget line was introduced into the 1994 EU Budget.  In mid June 1993, Commissioner Marin called together the European NGO networks cited above to implement, through their NGO members, the Council's Special Initiative.  Without going into too much detail (and in any event there is a detailed NGO evaluation of this Special Initiative which is available from EURO-CIDSE) and leaving aside that it was never our intention to create an NGO facility but rather to help African states in crises, by the end of September 1993, 330 projects had been submitted to the Commission in the five countries designated by the Commission (Angola, Mozambique, Somalia, Eritrea and Ethiopia) for a total value of 170,961,738 ECU of which 142,580,524 ECU was requested from the Commission.  In September-November 1994, having decided that to continue to speak of a Special Initiative served no useful purpose, we conducted a survey of the results.  The response rate, despite the frustration level among the NGO community, was 53%.  By November 1994, of the 195 projects known through the survey, 17 had received Commission funding, with a further 5 awaiting funds and 16 waiting to sign contracts.  Whilst our evaluation examines the complex of reasons for the dismal failure of the implementation of this Special Initiative, one of the reasons was undoubtedly the comitology procedure: <i>"Implementation of the Council's decision was made difficult by the inherent contradiction between its commitment to a fast track, urgent and flexible response and the directive to use EDF funds in accordance with existing procedures.."</i>
</ul>
<p>
With regard to food aid and food security, we would highlight the following :
<ul>
<li>This food aid budget line has been operating under a Type 2b committee for quite some time and, in general, NGOs feel that this Committee has functioned well, largely due to the flexibility and confidence on all sides.  But Committees can change and reliance on existing good will is not necessarily the best basis for case law.  Potentially, a Type 2b committee could be a source of blockages and delays.
<p>
<li>This question is particularly important if/when a food emergency arises since the bulk of emergency food aid provision rest with the food aid division in DG VIII and not within ECHO.  In 1995, ECHO had an allocation of 33.6 MECU for emergency food aid (with a likely 87 MECU in 1996).  The food aid division had an allocation of 591.9 MECU in 1995 (with a likely 540.9 MECU in 1996).  
</ul><p>
With regard to the Co-financing Budget Line Regulation, we would offer the following reflections :
<ul>
<li>The Co-financing Budget Line has operated successfully for 20 years without any Member States Committee.  And indeed NGO demand exceeds EC supply.  And here we would cite the old adage "if it isn't broken, don't fix it".  We recognise  and appreciate that this budget line has grown considerably, from its modest experimental period in 1976 of 2.5 MECU to 174 MECU in 1995 (and a decreased 162.5 MECU in 1996, despite the adherence of new Member States).  And we would not underestimate the value of this budget line - particularly in terms of impact of the lives of people in developing countries where much can be done with  relatively small amounts of money.   Nevertheless it does rather pale into insignificance compared to 40.82 BECU allocated to agriculture in the EU 86.525 BECU budget.
<p>
<li>The decrease in the Parliament's allocation to this budget line - the first since the budget line's inception - is in recognition that the NGO division in the Commission simply cannot cope with the volume of work, as evidenced by the underspending in 1995 on this budget line.
<p>
<li>Some ballpark figures illustrate this volume.  In 1995 the NGO Division processed approximately 1,200 projects of which some 800 were financed.  This figure does not include all the contacts and meetings with NGOs regarding pre-discussions on possible projects.  And, of course, there is follow up of projects - financial reports, interim reports, final reports etc. and this involves some 3,000 or so projects. (And this figure does not include the 2-3,000 projects currently financed under the block grant scheme.)  The NGO division has some 1,000 NGOs on its list, some 600 of whom they deal with annually.  For development projects and development education combined there is a total of 12 staff supervised by Amedeo Brusasco and Cesar Granda, with Bernard Ryelandt, of course, as Head of Division (and who currently has also 2 temporary staff - one till the end of February and the other till the end of April).
<p>
<li>The chronic problem of understa-ffing is not new.   Luciano Vecchi (Italy, Socialist) drew attention to this problem in January 1992 (subsequently reflected in the Parliament's resolution of May of that year) 
<p>
"A second major problem posed for the operation and potential expansion of co-financed measures results from the inadequate complement of staff to deal with NGOs at Commission DV VIII, a numerical shortfall which makes the job in hand more difficult for the admittedly very highly qualified and efficient personnel now employed.  Given that the offices responsible for dealing with NGOs (already burdened with an enormous workload) will also be called upon to an increasing extent to attend to decentralized cooperation operations under the Fourth Lom Convention, it appears that existing staff strength needs to be boosted substantially.
<p>
"Finally, in the light of nearly four year's experience with the new rules on co-financing, it might be appropriate to begin discussions on what improvements could be made, both to the procedure for considering projects (without detracting from the Commission's essential supervisory responsibilities and the criteria of good repute and sound management as far as NGOs are concerned) and with regard to extending the far less cumbersome system of global donations."</i>
<p>
Since this report was written (when the Co-financing budget line was 110 MECU), 1 additional staff member was added in 1995.  But, at the same time, due to Council decision, the co-financing budget line lost the mini-budget line which allowed 1 MECU out of the overall funds for the recruitment of staff and equipment.  At the same time, the proposed revision of the general guidelines - and the NGO community is in agreement on an extended block grant system/framework agreements - has still to take place.
<p>
<li> Council sources stress that, in pressing for a Committee (with 13 of the Member States in favour of some type of comitology procedure), they have absolutely no intention of discussing individual projects and hence there will be a proposal that projects under 1 MECU (or 2 MECU in the case of NGO consortia) would be part of the provisions.  And this is eminently sensible and welcome but we would seriously question the ceiling levels in the light of the remarks above regarding the general revision.
<p>
<li>On the other hand, Council sources stress that they would like to have a say in policy formulation/guidelines through, say, an annual meeting.  Beyond the general guidelines for the co-financing budget line, the development  priorities set by Council and the remarks added to the Budget, it is difficult to envisage how such a steering committee would operate in practice bearing in mind the following considerations : a) the Commission's role is essentially reactive - responding to requests submitted to it by a large number and wide range of European NGOs; b) for their part, European NGOs react to the needs expressed by their partners c) NGOs see development as a process and therefore an essentially long term commitment.  We outlined current development thinking at some length in EURO-CIDSE's submission to the Commission (in December 1992) on the revision of the general guidelines and argued for a whole new approach to co-operation with NGOs "in line with the thinking on man and woman at the centre of development policy, protagonists in a complex development process which is part of a global framework of North-South interdependence.  The current General Conditions suggest a simplistic project approach, easily quantifiable, and with people in developing countries as mere beneficiaries of aid from the North." d) NGOs bring their own money to the table.  The Vecchi report cited above stated that for every ECU spent by the Community," NGOs manage to invest a total of ECU 2.5, thus acting as an effective 'multiplier' of Community resources; "  This is not to argue against policy discussions involving the Member States.  Rather, it is to argue for a different formula to the comitology procedures and which involves other parties, such as the European Parliament, and, in particular, the NGOs.  It is also to stress that NGOs are not merely sub-contractors - cheap delivery systems for EU policy (and thus responding to this or that shift in policy towards this or that geographical area or sector or even, God forbid, discussions of whether NGOs from this or that European Member States are getting their fair share of the co-financing cake) but legitimate stakeholders in any policy debate in this context.
<p>
<li> It is also useful here to recall the experience of the South Africa Budget Line (or ESP as it was then termed).  This budget line operated under a Type 1 Committee structure.  Whilst we recognise all the specificity, uniqueness, political sensitivity of this particular budget line, it was, until the emergence of the new democratic South Africa, a budget line which operated exclusively through NGOs.  And whilst every effort was made by the Commission, the South African partners (of which there were only four) and representatives of their European NGO counterparts to ensure the smooth running of this 'advisory' committee, our experience was not a very positive one.  Indeed, less than a year after the programme began operations, the South African partners publicly suspended (in April 1987) their participation in the ESP because of undue political interference from the Member States.  On a more recent note, the Commission, using a firm of external evaluators, has commissioned an evaluation of the Special Programme from its inception in 1986 to the present.  Whilst this evaluation is currently in the process of being finalised, its initial findings regarding 'lessons learned' suggest that the most important lesson to be learned from the ESP is that key ingredients, even the sine qua non, for a successful project are ownership, dedication, and community involvement where applicable.  The ESP was successful because it was reactive rather than top-down.  It empowered organisations financially to carry out activities that from their perspective were crucial to move South Africa towards democracy and prosperity.  No amount of planning by even the most professional and concerned development expert, expatriate or national could replace that collective experience.  Whilst efforts were made at the outset to ensure the programme operated in a special way, in some fundamental aspects, the ordinary routines as regards the formal approval of contracts, payments etc. pertained.  Combined with the large number of parties involved in the process, battles over turf, and understaffing at all levels, the administration of the programme became a nightmare for everyone involved.  When this became apparent, the reaction on the part of the Commission was to seek to reshape the programme to fit the internal administrative constraints rather than the other way round.  An alternative to squeezing the South Africa programme into the standard Lom type mould would have been to radically decentralise formal decision making, by providing block or endowment grants to appropriate South African intermediaries, while strengthening the substantive and financial monitoring of the programme.
</ul><p>
With regard to the South Africa regulation, we have yet to see a common position, we have little to add to other remarks made above, except to say that, if the intention is to bring South Africa in line with EDF procedures, then the new South African government has our sympathy (and speaking as an organisation which ploughed its way through the post-Fiji study, conducted by Price Waterhouse in November 1992, Study on the Causes of Delay in the Implementation of Financial and Technical Cooperation.

<p>
Finally, a word about decentralised co-operation..  Why a budget line with an allocation of 5 MECU in 1995 and 6 MECU in 1996 - and designed to foster experimental and innovative local activities to promote this approach to development - needs a committee of any description is quite beyond our understanding.
<p>
In conclusion, we quote again from Umberto Scapagnini MEP :
<p>
<i>	"In the USA, the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972 obliges all expert advisory committees which advise US Executive Agencies (such as the Environment Protection Agency or the Food and Drug Administration) to meet in public, to publish their agendas in advance, and to publish minutes, with the usual exemptions for national security issues.  The US system is designed to achieve the kind of openness and transparency which ensures that pressure groups, concerned individuals, representatives of industry - the list is endless - make sure that politicians know what is going on in expert committees."</i>
<p>
Does the European Union deserve any less?

The "European initiative":<br>Cooperation between advisory councils at European
level</h2>
<h4><i>NAR Secretariat</i>
<p>
Source: <i>In Brief: Information from the NAR</i><br>No. 10, March 1995</h4>
<p>
</center>
<hr>
<h3>The beginnings</h3>

In 1991 the National Advisory Council for Development Cooperation (NAR) provided the
initiative for cooperation between European advisory bodies in the field of development
cooperation. A workshop was held, at which it became clear that the participants were interested
in continuing this form of contact. One important point to emerge was that the agendas of the
different countries were largely the same - further evidence that coordination could enhance the
impact of national advisory work. The European Commission was also convinced of this fact and
twice invited the advisors to Brussels to give their advice on the implications of the Maastricht
Treaty which, in its provisions on development cooperation, envisages a greater role for European
cooperation. Subjects with a European dimension also occupy an important place in the NAR's
regular advisory activities.
<p>
<h3>Workshop in Feldafing, FRG (November 1994)</h3>

In the run-up to the follow-up meeting, the NAR commissioned a <A HREF="nar_adv.htm">study of the advisory structure
in 17 European countries</A>. This revealed that external policy advice is obtained in a wide variety of
ways in the different countries. The countries of northern Europe tend to opt for advice 'at arm's
length' from a body that is independent and has a fixed structure (a council), while southern
European administrations seem to prefer to obtain advice on each subject individually, on a contract
basis and with various partners. One important conclusion drawn from the study is that
cooperation on the basis of pragmatic considerations would seem to offer the best chance of
success.
<p>
The study was welcomed by delegates at the follow-up meeting, which the FRG organised during
its presidency of the European Union. The Wissenschaftliche Beirat beim Bundesministerium
f&uuml;r wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung which hosted the meeting had taken the
lead with the drawing up of a joint advisory report entitled The <A HREF="nar_comp.htm">Comparative Effectiveness and the
Coordination Efforts of EU Donors</A>.The report, which was drawn up by a team of three authors,
from Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, explores the scope for improving aid
(policy, procedures, instruments, evaluation etc.) by cooperating at European level. It was
approved by the meeting and subsequently presented by the delegates to their overseas aid
ministers. The Council of Ministers of the EU discussed the same subject shortly afterwards.
<p>
The NAR contribution to the report consisted of a <A HREF="hoeb95.htm">comparative study of the effectiveness and
evaluation efforts of EU donors</a>. The Council has since  published this contribution separately.

This chapter summarises in very broad terms the main characteristics and trends that can be observed
in the
description of development cooperation policies and administrative structures as the main environment
in which
advisory institutions have to operate. Secondly, the various advisory boards or councils encountered
are
summarised in several categories, and discussed per category. Third, an overview is given of
possibilities for
cooperation between these institutions. The choice between given alternatives and/or realisation of
these
possibilities, depends very much on the outcome of the subsequent discussions on this report. Within
the current
changing  circumstances, the observations that are made here are mainly points for discussion rather
than
recommendations.
<p>
<hr><a name="trends"><h3>Characteristics and Trends in Policies and Administrative
Structures</h3></a>
<p>
The main characteristic that can be observed from the 17 country reports is their wide range of
variations in all
relevant aspects. A number of these differences dates back to historical situations, from which several
countries are
presently emerging (Portugal, Spain, Austria). All countries have to deal with a current changing
international
political situation that brings new problems and focal points for international cooperation to the fore:
environmental degradation, conflicts and peacekeeping, aid to the Central and Eastern European
Countries (CEEC)
and the New Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union and reception of immigrants.
Moreover nearly all
donor countries face domestic economic constraints. Regardless of old or new policies, focal points,
a too familiar
ghost keeps haunting developing countries: poverty.
<p>
The main differences between the 17 European countries can be observed in the following areas:
<ul>
<li>general aid objectives and their historical background;
<li>the balance between numbers of officially stated objectives and priorities,  available means and
actual
disbursements;
<li>aid targets as well as the actual disbursed volume of aid;
<li>the composition of aid such as emergency aid, and commercial orientation;
<li>instruments and channels such as multi- and bilateral ratio, and channelling through NGOs;
<li>the level of detail to which general objectives are operationalised into separate sector- and country
guidelines,
policies for cross-cutting issues such as WID and the environment;
<li>the forms of political responsibility for development cooperation, policy coordinating authority,
and the
administrative organisation of aid;
<li>aid procedures, including those for evaluation and feedback;
<li>the importance that is attached to policy dialogue with recipient countries and the responsibilities
that are
shared with them, which are strongly related to the decentralisation of implementation;
<li>the number of documents on general policies, White Papers, Strategies, country and sector
policies, and
evaluations in which official policies are described, published and made available to the public. 
</ul>
<p>
Regardless of their present type of development cooperation policy and their actual modes of
implementation, all
donor countries have to find a new coherence, both within the framework of development cooperation
policy as
well as between development policy and other policy areas, notably foreign, domestic and economic
affairs. At the
same time they have to find a new balance between stated objectives and required means. All countries
are in
different stages of this re-orientation process. In a number of countries these changes have led to
administrative re-organisations. The main points of difference are summarised below.
<p>
As far as can be observed from government Strategies, White papers and general Policy Papers, in 11
countries
major policy changes can seen to have taken place over the past four years, that will be continued
during the
coming years, in Denmark, Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Austria, Portugal, Finland,
Sweden, UK and
Switzerland. In 8 of the 11 countries these major policy changes are directly related to efforts for the
integration of
new tasks into 'traditional' areas of development cooperation, in Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands,
Norway,
Finland, Sweden, UK and Switzerland. In this process the integration of Agenda 21 has advanced
farthest. In 3 of
the 11 countries adjustments are, till now, mainly related to surpassing historical constraints (in Spain,
Austria,
Portugal, and to a certain extent in Italy). In a majority of the 11 countries, major policy changes were
accompanied
by re-organisations in the aid administration. In 3 countries no major policy changes could be observed
(in
Germany, France, Luxembourg), while in another 2 countries only administrative changes were, or
are,
implemented (in Belgium, Italy). The situation in Greece is largely unknown. 
<p>
Apparently in a number of countries budget cuts are implemented without major changes in policy.
In the majority
of the 17 countries, decentralisation of aid implementation - for instance: policy dialogue and the
sharing of
responsibilities with developing countries - as a central feature of administering aid can be observed.
In at least 2
countries relationships with development countries are entered into on a basis of mutual responsibility
for each
other's development. The Netherlands and Switzerland established relations in which recipient
countries, for
instance advice on measures for the realisation of the donor country's national goals for sustainable
development. 
<p>
In Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Austria, Finland, Sweden, the UK and Switzerland
White Papers,
Strategies and comprehensive Policy Papers on development cooperation in the 1990s, including an
emphasis on
the integration of Agenda 21 and sustainable development have been written in the last three years,
in addition to
the usual Annual Plans, Annual Reports and Explanations on the Budgets that some countries
produce. Studies on
Agenda 21 include both consequences for developing countries and for development cooperation, as
well as the
consequences of sustainable development for donor countries. In particular in Denmark, Ireland, the
Netherlands,
Norway, Finland, the United Kingdom and Switzerland the sustainable development issue has been
integrated in
cooperation policies, and is linked to their own national environmental plans. 
<p>
<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3>

In 11 countries a Minister or a State Secretary is responsible for development cooperation (Belgium,
Denmark,
Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Austria, Portugal, Finland, Sweden, UK). In 6 of these
11 countries
the Minister is a full member of the Cabinet. To compare: in 1992 out of the 20 member states of the
DAC 8 had a
Minister of  Development Cooperation that held a full Cabinet position. Allocations of responsibilities
and
coordinating authorities vary greatly. In these 11 countries there is a separate form of governmental
organisation for
policy formulation and implementation of official development cooperation, or for parts of it. In most
cases the
responsible directorates are located within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 2 of the 11 countries
implementing
agencies are located outside the administration (Norway, Sweden). In the majority of countries
development
cooperation is distributed over several ministries, agencies and institutions. Some are still traditionally
structured,
some organised on the basis of new concepts and tasks. Internal and external coordination of policy
formulation
and implementation is difficult and time consuming. In the majority of countries the government aid
organisation
has been re-organised several times, initiated mostly by changes in the domestic political situation and
in a few
cases as a direct consequence of changes in the content of development cooperation policies.
<p>
Since 1980/81, and more significantly since 1989, ODA volumes in nearly all of the 17 countries have
decreased.
In 1992/93 the ODA GNP ratio of 12 countries was below the international target of 0.7 per cent and
the ratios of 4
countries were above this target (1 unknown). In 1990 ODA of 11 of the 17 countries (1 unknown)
was already
below the average of the EU member states of 0.51 per cent of GNP. In 11 countries budget cuts are
projected for
the years after 1993, in 4 countries none are planned (Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg, Austria), and
in 2 countries
plans are unknown (Greece and Portugal). Costs for peacekeeping, for aid to the CEECs and the NIS,
for the
reception of immigrants and refugees have been kept mainly outside ODA. Nevertheless the need for
a re-ordering
of all 'external assistance costs' is growing, while the discussion for an up-date of the familiar definition
of ODA
continues. At the same time the call for more attention to domestic economic interests within
development
cooperation policies becomes louder. Multilateral contributions to the EU, UN- and World Bank
institutions grew
fastest. These contributions are likely to continue to increase, at the expense of bilateral aid to
developing
countries, in a time of constant or decreasing total aid budgets. Paraphrasing a question posed by the
Finnish
NGOs, one could ask: 'What is there left to defend Europe's ODA?' 
<p>
Concluding: 17 European countries are searching for new forms of coherence and coordination of new
policies and
instruments, in changing circumstances, still supported by the public, and with apparently less funds. 
<p>
<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>
<p>
Advisory Councils and other advisory structures vary as widely as the above summarised policy and
administrative
environment. This paragraph describes some general characteristics, and elaborates successively
mandate and actual
functioning, size and membership, independence, and subject areas covered. The description cannot
be complete in
all detail, since for some countries (notably Greece) and on some points data are lacking; for instance
on the
subjects discussed by councils that mainly have an internal advising function within the Ministry of
Development
Cooperation. Finally, some general observations are made. Figures elaborated in this survey point to
general
indications and directions of observed developments and trends. 
<p>
In this survey several types of Advisory Structures and Mechanisms are described. These are 'Formal
Advisory
Institutions'. Advisory Councils for Development Cooperation that are installed by the Government
and that have
the explicit mandate to advise the Government, through one of its Ministers, on matters of
development cooperation
policy. Not taking into account other characteristics, such as actual functions, procedures, right of
initiative.
'Policy' is defined here as general development policy excluding specific policies for sectors or
countries. A
Council is classified in this category when at least its mandate permits it to advise on general policy
questions; in
practice it may also cover other areas, for instance a Council may comment on annual reports or
contribute to the
specification of the budget. These include the institutions described under the second paragraphs
headed 'Formal
Advisory Institutions'. In these countries other organisations, structures and mechanisms that might
contribute to or
influence advising on development cooperation policy, are described in the third paragraphs, 'Other
Actors'. They
are not covered in the following summary. 
<p>
In countries where no such Formal Advisory Institution for policy advice exists, all advisory activities
are described
in the second paragraphs of the country descriptions, headed 'Advisory Structures and Mechanisms'. 
<p>
For completeness sake, attention in the country reports has been given to commercial consultancy
services for
implementation of development activities that may influence general development policy. However,
these activities
are excluded from the following summary. This leads to the observation that in the majority of the 17
countries
more policy advisory activities are carried out than the objective of this survey allows to describe.
Formal Advisory
Councils are only one group of several producers of policy advice.
<p>
<h3>Table I: An overview of Formal Advisory Institutions and their structure or status</h3>
<p>
8 formal advisory institutions (board and/or council) in:
<ol>
<li>Denmark,  since 1971 (a Board and a Council)
<li>Germany, since 1963 (a Scientific Council)
<li>Ireland, since 1994 (first Council installed in 1979 )
<li>Italy, since 1987
<li>The Netherlands, snce 1964, (to be abolished in 1997)
<li>Austria, since 1974
<li>Finland, since 1992 (first Council installed in 1979)
<li>Switzerland, since 1976
</ol>
<p>
1 Board of a limited mandate, in:
<ol>
<li>Sweden, since 1965 (a separate Council is installed for each aid agency)
</ol>
<p>
In 2 countries Councils are about to be installed:
<ol>
<li>Spain, planned by the government
<li>Portugal, requested by groups in society
</ol>
<p>
2 Councils have been abolished in:
<ol>
<li>Belgium, since 1962 (abolished in 1985, although not officially )
<li>Norway, since 1968(abolished in 1989)
</ol>
<p>
In 2 countries policy advisory work is carried out by other institutions or influenced by other
mechanisms:
<ol>
<li>France - many renowned research institutes and other organisations
<li>UK - many renowned research institutes, some government owned
</ol>
<p>
in 1 country no formal advisory institutions and/or other institutes are known:
<ol>
<li>Luxembourg
</ol>
<p>
in 1 country the advisory situation is unknown:
<ol>
<li>Greece - no Council, the contribution of research institutes is unknown
</ol>
<p>
In the 11 countries where a Minister or State Secretary is responsible for development cooperation
policy, 6 have
an Advisory Council, in Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland. In 4 of the
11 countries
there is no formal Council, in Belgium (defunct), Norway (abolished), Portugal (requested) and the
UK. In Sweden
several Boards exist, one per aid agency. Sweden is not included in the following description, unless
explicitly
mentioned. Two countries without a Minister or State Secretary of Development Cooperation have
an Advisory
Council, Italy and Switzerland. 
<p>
All 8 Advisory Councils were installed - finally or for the first time - in the same period in which
legislation on
development cooperation was passed and the first governmental administrative institutions were
created, in the
1960s and 1970s. A period, when official development cooperation policy had to be elaborated, and
its support
base -NGOs and voluntary organisations - had to be enlarged in the donor countries. In the
Scandinavian countries,
where a clear distinction exists between relatively small Ministries for policy formulation and larger
agencies for
implementation, a Board as well as a Council for the implementing Agency were established. The
Board (Styrelse)
can be considered a Steering Committee, and the Council (Radet) a Consultative Committee. In
Sweden this is still
the function of the boards at SIDA and the other implementing agencies, BITS, SAREC and
SWEDECORP. One
of the functions of the, now defunct, Belgian Council, certainly was to strengthen the independent
position of the
newly created agency AGCD.
<p>
Generally speaking, the Advisory Councils observed in this survey may be divided into two broad
categories,
according to their official mandates and actual functions:
<ul>
<li>Councils with a primarily consultative function, in Denmark, Italy, Austria, and Finland. The
Council in these
countries serves to inform the administration, as well as Council members and their networks. All 4
Councils meet
in the presence of the Minister or her/his representatives. In Austria the Minister convenes and chairs
the Council's
meetings. Since, among others, Parliamentarians are also Council members (except in Italy),
consensus can be
reached before parliamentary debates take place. None of these Councils publishes results, since these
results are
for internal use only. In practice there are more variations in actual activities. Denmark's Council also
comments on
projects before they are sent to Parliament; the clear intermediating role of Finland's KESU between
Government
and pressure groups in society has been described earlier. In Italy the Council comments on the annual
report on
development cooperation, and in the 1970s the Austrian Council elaborated Austria's Law on
Development
Cooperation into Guidelines for cooperation.
<p>
<li>Councils with mainly an advisory function, in Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and
Switzerland. These
Councils firstly advise the Government on general development cooperation policy, on their own
initiative or on the
governments request. Also here distinctions are not clear cut. In Germany the Minister may attend
discussions of
the Beirat, while in the Netherlands the Minister only discusses written recommendations in a special
meeting with
the Council and is officially obliged to respond in writing to the Council and to Parliament. In
Switzerland the
Council also comments on government policy documents before they are sent to Parliament, and meets
in the
presence of SDC officials. In this category, the now defunct Belgian Council might be classified, since
its first task
was to advise the Government on policy formulation. But in addition the Minister was obliged to ask
the Belgian
Council's advice on his annual report on development cooperation, on policy options and on project
proposals of
NGOs.
</ul>
<p>
Judging from the apparent change in composition of the Dutch Council's membership over the years),
one might
conclude that changes in the principal function of one and the same Council occur; in this example a
change from a
primarily consultative to a mainly advising function.
<p>
It can be observed that the actual realisation of a mandate very much depends on the position and
initiatives of a
Council's members. Secondly, a Council actually combines the function of 'consultative committee'
and that of
'advisory council'. The last observation is supported by the fact that actual Council membership is
based both on
expertise and representation. A construction which might influence the technical contents of
recommendations and
reports, and the speed with which they are produced. 
<p>
Of the 8 Councils, 3 Councils have a membership of less than 20 persons (Ireland, Finland - the
smallest Council
with 10 members - and Switzerland). The German Council has 25 members, while 4 countries have
Councils with
45 members or more: in Denmark (the largest Council with 75 members), Italy, the Netherlands and
Austria.
SIDA's Board in Sweden has 14 members and the Belgian Council used to have 14 and later 35
members. Small or
large, actual representativity of Councils' membership is high, even in Councils of which the members
are
appointed on criteria of expertise and personal capacities. For instance in the Netherlands, the NAR
membership is
based on expertise, but should also include as many sections of Dutch society as possible.
<p>
The Councils in Denmark, Austria and Switzerland have the greatest variety in membership
composition, followed
by (Belgium), Italy, and Finland, then by Ireland and the Netherlands. The German Council has the
most
homogeneous composition and purest scientific character. Trade unions and the business community
tend to be
underrepresented. Councils with a primarily consultative function, include members from the official
development
cooperation administration in (Belgium), Denmark, Italy, Austria and Finland. In Denmark Council
meetings may
also be attended by the press. Three of these Councils also have Parliamentarians among their
members, in
Denmark, Austria and Finland. This underlines their consultative function. In the Netherlands official
contacts on
behalf of the Council with members of Parliament are currently maintained by the Presidium of the
Council, and
have an informative function about the general position of the Council only. Except for the Council
in Austria, the
other 7 Councils have the right of initiative. They select subjects for discussion and write
recommendations. They
bring matters of their choice to the attention of the Minister. 
<p>
Five Councils have their own secretariat that is located in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These are
the two
'consultative councils' in Denmark and Finland, and the three 'advisory councils' in Ireland, the
Netherlands and
Switzerland. The secretaries are officials of the Ministry except in Ireland where the Secretary is
directly contracted
by the Council. Secretaries of the former Finnish Councils were sometimes located outside the
Ministry. 
<p>

In Germany the Council can be contacted through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and in Austria
through the
Federal Chancellery. As far as is known the Secretariats of the Councils in Denmark, the Netherlands,
Finland and
Switzerland are located in the Policy Planning Unit of the development cooperation administration
within the
MFA. Details of feedback procedures of Councils' discussions and reports to- or through these Units
are unknown,
except for the Netherlands. Generally speaking, they vary greatly, according to the appreciation by
Ministers of the
results of the Council's activities. The fate of the now defunct Belgium Council is a point in case.  
<p>
Councils in Ireland and the Netherlands have their own budgets, provided by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs. The
Councils in Germany and Finland have to submit a funding request for each activity to the Ministry.
In the
Netherlands and in Finland,  Councils may have research conducted on their behalf and organise
conferences and
seminars for a wider public. This was also the case with the Belgian Council. In Germany the Ministry
sometimes
decides to publish the reports of the Council. In the Netherlands reports by the Council are always
published (in
several languages). The Irish Council can do so in consultation with the Ministry. Working procedures
of the
Councils seem to be farthest elaborated and formalised in the Netherlands.
<p>
From the foregoing it can be observed that Councils in Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and Finland
have the
most independent relation with their respective Governments, followed by Denmark, Italy,
Switzerland, and last,
Austria. Evidently, this observation does not take into account the variations that doubtless occur,
based on
personal initiatives.         
<p>
Policy areas and subjects that are and were covered by Councils are difficult to describe, since only
three Councils
have the means to publish results of their work. The Netherlands' Council publishes its
recommendations and other
studies; the German Council publishes some of its results. Publications of the present Irish Council
are not yet
known. In most countries results of discussions are for internal use only. However, subject-areas that
were and are treated, are amongst others:
<ol>
<li>General development cooperation policy: WID, migrants and refugees, development cooperation
in the 1990s,
public support for development cooperation, industrial and agriculture development, comments on
reports of
international organisations such as DAC, UNDP and World Bank. Agenda 21 after UNCED 1992
appears to be the
most frequently studied and discussed issue in the past few years. Current agenda's of several Councils
include
discussions on the coming UN Worldconference on Population, the UN Worldconference on Women
and on the
World Social Summit. Although broad in their analyses, these studies are oriented towards the
formulation of
national positions for those occasions.<p>
<li>Specific areas and issues include: comments on annual reports, budgets, project proposals,
specific policy papers, national aid instruments and channels for aid, procedures and guidelines;
</ol>
<p>
Apparently in only one country, Finland, the Council has contributed directly to the Government's
most recent
Strategy Paper (1993), 'Finland's Development Cooperation in the 1990s'. While Agenda 21 is both
on the agenda
of several Governments and on the agenda of several Councils, it seems doubtful whether the two have
actually
met.
<p>
<h3>Further Observations</h3>
<p>
From the foregoing summary a number of very tentative observations can be made.
<ul>
<li>Regardless of their actual consultative or advisory functions, Councils appear to have been most
influential in
the period when development cooperation was yet unexplored and expertise had to be built up. In
several countries
Councils were abolished when the administration had acquired expertise, when support for
development activities
was secured, and when advice could be bought through less complicated procedures from consultants,
specialised
institutes and NGOs. However, current international circumstances appear to create similar
opportunities for
Councils, as in the 1960s and 1970s. The current changes in international relations, again create areas
where new
policies can be explored. Globalisation and regionalisation processes have consequences for: financial
systems,
sustainable development in the traditional 'recipient' and 'donor' countries, technology and
environment, social and
economic reforms, economic development and human rights, security, arms and conflict, economic
dualism,
government policies and private enterprise, population, contents of development cooperation policy
and foreign
policy, etc. Leaving the smaller and more traditional issues, Councils could concentrate on the
coherence of these
policy areas. They could fulfil again an intermediating task between Governments, policy makers, and
scientific
communities as well as related sections of society. 
<p>
<li>The world anno 1994 probably requires a consistent shift of perspective in all activities that
concern relations
between groups of people. The international perspective could replace the traditional national one, in
which the
point of departure could be shared responsibilities with developing countries. This required change
of perspective
might be of the same importance, as was the transition from a colonial order to a cooperation structure,
to which
councils and other advisory or consultative structures and mechanisms have contributed in the past.
<p>
<li>The degree of 'Euro-content' of Councils' activities could certainly be raised. Not only as far as
the number of
activities on specific European issues is concerned, but firstly by the inclusion of the European
dimension in each
study and recommendation. 
<p>
<li>These changes could be facilitated by a number of practical measures, to be derived from the
above described
experiences:
<ul>
<li>the acquisition of a relative independent position appears to enhance a Council's productivity;
<li>a minimum amount of formally regulated procedures, amongst others for operating, feedback
mechanisms, and
secretarial support, is required;
<li>publication of results, studies and recommendations is probably a conditio sine qua non for
participating
effectively in policy debates;
<li>enlarging the accessibility of studies and reports through translations into relevant languages is
an obvious
measure in 'our global village';
<li>inclusion of relevant domestic expertise, as well as expertise from the South, and from 'Brussels'
supports an
international and European approach and quality;
<li>the consultative function could be more clearly separated from the advisory function. Why not
delegate the first
function to the existing 'Committees for Development Education', already concentrate in some
countries on
development cooperation  nd sustainable development? They also are changing their perspective;
<li>a budget would create more possibilities for councils to organise seminars, workshops and have
research
conducted and establish contacts;
<li>Secretariats could integrate the international and European dimension in their work by allocating
some of their
time to these activities, if only by maintaining international contacts;
<li>secretariats could organise meetings with representatives from the EC and other relevant
international
institutions and with partner Councils.
<li>Councils appear to have been established on the initiative of Governments, and seem to have gone
up and down
with administrative reforms. They could find ways to create their own, scientific base of support in
their societies
and through international contacts. For instance, contacts by Councils as a whole or by the Secretariats
could be
institutionalised with research communities and institutes, and international data-bases could be used. 
<li>Networking experiences of NGOs and Universities could be used here. Besides the
EC-NGO-Liaison
Committee and the numerous other NGO-networks, one could mention the 'Joint Planning Committee'
between
NGOs and Governments that was established in 1993 in Paris. Also, the cooperation between the
Evaluation Units
for Development Cooperation from several donor countries could be instructive. Within and without
the DAC,
several of these Units conduct joint evaluations, for instance of the World Food Programme, the EU-
Food Aid
Programme, the Regional Development Banks and a planned evaluation of the EDF.
<li>A flexible model such as the Finnish Council might enhance the topicality of a Council's work.
The KESU in
Finland is installed for a limited period and receives a specific mandate for each new term. 
</ul></ul>
<p>
A short remark should be made about the situation in France and the UK on the one hand and in Spain
and
Portugal on the other. In the first two countries numerous 'other advisory structures and mechanisms'
are present in
many broad as well as specific areas, without an apparent need to create more formalised advisory
institutions for
development cooperation. In Spain and Portugal, perhaps supplemented by Belgium, there is a wish
- from different
quarters though - to organise the available expertise for development cooperation, into some sort of
advisory or
consultative structure. Institutions in both groups of countries may profit from the here described
experiences,
when they want to decide upon their course for further cooperation in this area. 
<p>
<hr><a name="poss"><h3>Possibilities for Cooperation in Europe</h3></a>
<p>
The EC has shown interest in the efforts of several Councils to establish some form of cooperation
between
advisory councils for development cooperation policy. Representatives of the EC attended the 1991
Workshop in
the Hague and in June and December 1993 DG VIII organised two one day meetings on Coherence
of EU-Development Cooperation Policies, that were also attended by representatives of several of the
here mentioned
institutions. However, the DG VIII focuses on ad hoc cooperation with a group of individual experts
for policy
development in specific areas, rather than on establishing more structured or organised forms of
cooperation.
Notwithstanding this difference in focus, contacts and cooperation with the EC should be maintained,
and
approaches should be developed that connect with the European level of policy formulation. 
<p>
Recent EU-related discussions include several useful suggestions for the direction of any future
cooperation
between advisory structures in Europe. With regard to general approaches, inclusion of global issues
and broad
approaches are stressed. For instance, Bossuyt, Laporte and Brigaldino argue, in their discussion of
complementarity, that the EC should limit itself to those areas where it has an added value, such as
macro-economic approaches, policy coordination, or performing the role of think tank. The present
preoccupation with the
implementation of projects should be left to other actors, according to the authors. Faber also stresses
the need for
the study of coherence between areas such as development cooperation, agriculture, trade, environment
and
monetary policies, effectiveness and evaluation of EC policy instruments, on the basis of the
development
cooperation paragraph of the Treaty of Maastricht (art. 130 u). He proposes that the EC introduces
a coherence test.
Broad topics and the coherence between them are mentioned, such as trade, SAP's, good governance,
human rights,
population, Africa, and migration. A report on the position of the Netherlands' Social Economic
Council (SER) in
Europe, also argues that activities of the Council directed towards 'Brussels' should not loose
themselves in short-term details, but should concentrate on fundamental points and main issues.
<p>
In addition to raising the degree of the 'Euro-content' of studies and recommendations by choosing
subjects of
European importance (including studies on the consequences of European measures for Member
States), and by
including the European dimension in reports directed to national Governments, contacts with relevant
institutions
could be helpful. Direct contacts could be established by Councils and their Secretariats with relevant
EC
departments and European umbrella organisations and networks of scientists, researchers and NGOs.
The EC-NGO-Liaison Committee and EADI have already been mentioned, but also contacts with
institutes such as
ECDPM in Maastricht and the North-South Institute in Portugal can be useful.
<p>
As yet there is no 'European Advisory Council for Development Cooperation Policy' , comparable to
the advisory
Social Economic Committee (SEC), that was installed by the Treaty of Rome. An input by advisory
Councils and
other advisory institutions for development cooperation policy into the 'Brussels information
processing
machinery', can contribute to the coherence and coordination of EU development cooperation policy
and to that of
its Member States. However, without a careful pragmatic approach, such a network might be more
of a hindrance
than an asset for effective cooperation. The SEC appears to feel the need for a number of measures for
strengthening its functioning. These measures seem to be related to the above mentioned points with
regard to
national Councils: strengthening independence, institutionalisation of working procedures, clear
criteria for
membership and required and relevant expertise.
<p>
Information on the (former) cooperation of the Councils of Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden
in the 'Nordic
Council' is not conclusive about the actual reason for stopping this cooperation. Perhaps, minds were
too 'like
minded', thereby excluding interesting topics for discussion, or it could not operate independently
enough in order
to be sufficiently creative.  
<p>
The foregoing summary does not generate one exclusive route to one form of cooperation between
advisory
structures in Europe. Depending on the choice of goals, long-term and mid-term, several ways are
open, probably
parallel to each other. The original idea for cooperation pre-supposed the existence of more or less
identical, and
also quite structured advisory councils for development cooperation policy. This 'ideal type' apparently
does not
exist. The 8 - 9 described Councils vary greatly on most essential aspects. In addition, in some
countries any form
of advisory structure is clearly absent. Whatever form any future cooperation will take, it has to take
into account
this variety, at least as a point of departure.
<p>
Theoretically two routes for strengthening European Cooperation could be followed.
<p>
Route I starts with building a structure for cooperation. This approach seems futile and will not create
any
participation. What could it have to offer? The discussions and interviews during this survey did not
find any
enthusiasm for this route. Route II takes as a starting point a pragmatic form of cooperation between
interested
members of councils and other institutions in Europe, which may create in mid-term a network for
practical
cooperation and, in long-term some form of more structured cooperation, if need be. People
interviewed appear
interested in such a, carefully managed, approach. It could start with a relative small nucleus of people
that are
prepared, and have the practical possibilities, to invest in building up cooperation and enlarge the
number of
contacts, gradually.
<p>
The interest for cooperation of people spoken to in 14 countries during this survey, is felt through all
Councils and
institutions. Roughly speaking, people in half of the number of countries visited are prepared to be
involved from
the start in one way or the other. The other half, which is certainly interested, would rather like to wait
for further
developments first. Both groups acknowledge the relevance of cooperation, both for their national and
for their
international functioning. These attitudes support a choice for Route II. Finally, one should be aware
that
cooperation, at least for the time being, actually should be established on commitments of individuals,
since no
Council, or Council member, has a 'European mandate'. 
<p>
In addition to these suggestions, the following practical points of action for enhancing cooperation can
be
proposed. 
<p>
The Council in Germany is prepared to organise a workshop to discuss 1) the results of this survey,
second, 2) a
draft for a joint paper, and 3) possible further steps for cooperation. This workshop might be held later
in 1994
when Germany chairs the EU.
<p>
Cooperation could be initiated by producing joint reports on subjects of common interest. Cooperation
should
produce something of interest to all parties concerned. Members of the Council of Germany, the NAR
of the
Netherlands, the ODI in the UK and the ELO in Portugal expressed their interest and willingness to
prepare a draft
paper for joint discussion. The German Council would be prepared to coordinate matters and produce
a first set-up
for the draft of the joint paper.
<p>
Collection and exchange of information could contribute to the coordination of activities, as well as
to establish
and maintain contacts. A definite interest was expressed in such an exchange. Information might
include subject
areas of work, agenda's, coming reports, events and publications, as well as (changing) procedures.
This report
could serve as a basis. Generally speaking, the information that could be collected during the survey,
consists
mostly of documents that are published by Governments and institutes. It gives little exchangeable
information on
the functioning of advisory Councils and institutes. The majority of the latter type of information was
acquired
during interviews and from internal documents. In fact, policy recommendations were only received
from the
Councils of the Netherlands and Germany. 
<p>
A practical continuation of the present cooperation during this survey, could be the preparation of an
up-dated
edition of this report within the next year.
<p>
Observing the experiences during the survey in the past year, it appears that these efforts need the
regular support
of some sort of focal point, that may function as a liaison between the participants. And, at this stage,
some
encouragement might be needed. An internationally composed steering committee of interested people
could be
installed to coordinate and initiate activities, at however low profile it should operate.
<p>
As indicated in the beginning of this part of the report, the further course of cooperation depends first
and foremost
on the decisions that will be taken by the participants in the coming discussions. The collected material
seems more
than sufficient.

<hr>
This paper is the product of a workshop held in Feldafing, Germany, on 11 November 1994 under the auspices of the Wissenschaftlicher Beirat and with the support of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation. 
<p>
Given the massive changes confronting aid donors, it is important that the decision-takers among the donors grasp the nettle not only of policy reform but also of procedural reform. They should set in motion a process whereby Europe's development assistance can be provided not just coherently, but on the basis of donor comparative advantage. This may not mean easing the European Commission out of its role as "seventeenth donor" but it will require a clearer, more logical and ultimately a more politically sensible division of responsibilities in aid supply between the Member States
and the Commission.
<p>
How should the objective of assessing the strengths of the existing European donors' aid delivery systems and advising on the means for achieving coordination be accomplished? Five methods (not mutually exclusive) are advanced:
<p>
<ol>
<li>In the first, the Development Council has selected four sectors in which EU donors will work more closely at sectoral policy and country levels.
<li>The second, more iterative and practical approach, is for the donors to coordinate (with assistance from the Commission) their aid through a pilot scheme in six recipient countries.
<li>The third approach, promoted by the Dutch DGIS aims to coordinate and improve EU aid by setting up an external evaluation of the European Development Fund. 
<li>The fourth approach is to apply strict competitive performance criteria to aid policies and aid administrations and for those that do not reach the standards to be eliminated.
<li>the fifth approach, and the one recommended by the workshop, is for the various research institutes to carry out a study of the comparative effectiveness of European and Member States' aid, and their aid management systems.
</ol>
The authors conclude by suggesting that efforts to make European aid more effective must be based on a joint approach insted of the current parallel approaches. This requires a sustained intensification of the role played by the European Commission in development cooperation, as well as improved coordination of bilateral development policy, harmonised methods of administrative procedures, the establishment of common rules, and enhanced efforts to ensure parliamentary monitoring of development cooperation at all levels.

<A NAME="int"><hr><h3>Introduction</h3></A>

There are many factors that influence aid effectiveness. They
range from policies of the aid-receiving country to donor
motives and bureaucratic procedures. Foreign aid is probably
the most evaluated branch of government in EU member countries. But although evaluation is part of the common management techniques of most donors and thousands of projects are
as such evaluated, still large parts of aid effectiveness, of
successes and failures of aid-programs and -projects, and
especially of the impact of development aid are unknown. It is
therefore difficult to formulate generalizations on this
subject and even more so to do this in a comparative way. Up
till now evaluations and studies on the effects of foreign aid
do not provide adequate enough data to come to firm and unambiguous conclusions other than expert judgements. Still we
will try in this paper to come to some conclusions on aid
effectiveness on basis of the existing scientific literature
and of a comparison of recent evaluations of European donors.
Based on this material we will also give an overview of
evaluation practices and suggestions for the improvement of
evaluation research by European donors.
<p>

<A NAME="eff"><hr><h3>Effectiveness </h3></A>

The number of evaluations of official aid might well reach the
number of 15.000. Included in that number though are appraisals and monitoring reports. The number of ex-post
evaluations is much lower, but still must run into the
thousands. Most donors evaluate large parts of their project
portfolio. One should think it might be easy with such a large
quantity of research material at hand to come to general
conclusions and to give an answer to the question 'Does aid
work?'. In fact answers are given to that question as well by
donor agencies as by special task forces. Studies and publica-
tions, most of them by evaluation units of donor agencies,
that try to do so, seem, though to use first and for all
'rules of the thumb' rather than scientific or controlled
methods of research. But also in scientific literature it easy
to find statements as:
<p>
'The misuse of aid has been repeatedly substantiated in many
books and articles, and it is not intended to dwell on it
here... In many ways, the official aid agencies have really
lost their way. They continue to use the old formulae and
procedures, as in the past, but with less and less conviction.
Get any aid official over a beer in the 1990s, and he will
soon be questioning the effectiveness of what he is doing in
Africa.' (McCarthy, 1994:179, 216)
<p>
This might be partly true, but then it is very difficult to
discover this many books and articles in the author's bibli-
ography, because not even one title that would substantiate
his argument is given.
<p>
In donors' documents it is easy to find data that prove the
contrary. In the Annual Review of the Operations Evaluations
Department of the World Bank one could read year after year
that three quarters of the projects evaluated achieved overall
satisfactory results. The percentages were lower in Sub Sahara
Africa and particularly in East Africa, but in general the
large majority of projects performed as planned. In the
nineties though results deteriorated and more than one third
was rated as unsatisfactory. This led to the so-called Wapen-
hans-report, its critique on the functioning of the Bank and
proposals for organizational reforms. In recent German annual
reports on evaluation it was stated that about 30% of the
evaluations gave positive results for the projects evaluated,
40% mixed results and about a quarter of the projects per-
formed unsatisfactory. In the only Dutch report out of 1984
giving an overview of about 150 evaluations by the evaluation
unit since its formation, the unit concluded, but the results
had to be handled with care that: 15% of the projects per-
formed very satisfactory, 35% reasonably satisfactory, 19%
more or less satisfactory, 20% rather unsatisfactory, 8% very
unsatisfactory and on 3% no judgement was possible.
<p>
Although sometimes this kind of results are presented with
great care and warnings against over-interpretation are given,
one should look at them with at least as much doubt as the
certainty with which the reports are generally presented.
Evaluation methods used, the quality of researchers, the
length of field research among other make evaluation results
incomparable in most of the cases. Riddell concluded:
<p>
'To date, aid evaluation has been a very blunt and inadequate
tool with which it is difficult to construct firm and in-
contestable conclusions: in many cases there is simply insuf-
ficient evidence available, in others the evidence is too
ambiguous... In short, both critics and supporters of aid
appear to have been far too eager to draw general conclusions
about aid's performance than the evidence available would
justify.' (Riddell, 1987: 184, 188)
<p>
One could say that seven years later this is still true. Of
course the number of evaluations executed has risen, the body
of knowledge has grown, but also now these firm and incontest-
able conclusions can not been drawn in an objective, scien-
tific, or say non-partisan way. It is definitely now easier to
say which things, projects or programmes, go wrong or which
instruments have a high failure-rate, but large fields of
aid's impact are still unknown. This is particularly true for
the impact of aid-projects and -programmes on poverty al-
leviation or on the poorest strata in society. Also here
Riddell concluded:
<p>
'Of the evaluation material that does exist, much does not
consider this impact (on the poor, p.h.) explicitly or at
all.' (Riddell, 1987: 194)
<p>
And also here the situation has changed little. It seems thus
wise to dwell on some issues where more evidence is available.
<p>
Too often the reasons for aid-failure or for low aid effec-
tiveness in compilations of evaluations, country- or sector-
evaluation studies by donor-organizations are laid at the aid-
receiving side: government policies and institutional barriers
in developing countries are seen as the cause for unsatisfac-
tory project-outcomes. It is certainly true that endogenous
factors have a heavy impact on project-outcomes. A sound
macro-economic policy might be the most mentioned and most
influential factor here, but for projects in a lot of sectors
other factors might be of more influence. A lack of institu-
tional capacity to design and monitor projects often leads to
blue-print planning and inadequate and too optimistic project
designs, many times fuelled by commercial interests. Lopsided
power structures might make a failure of every poverty
oriented project in a given region or country. It is remark-
able how little the unequal distribution of power or f.e.
clientele politics are used as an explanatory factor for low
aid effectiveness. In this sense the evaluation-exercise is
often depoliticized.
<p>
Without propagating a self-castigating exercise, one could
conclude out of many evaluation reports that donors only
seldomly make their own decision-making processes and bureau-
cratic procedures an integral part of evaluation and impact-
measurement. The Nordic countries and the Netherlands are
here, partly, the exceptions. The influence, though, of power
relations and of bureaucratic procedures and structures within
the donor-country on aid effectiveness is large. Political and
commercial interests do influence country-choice, project-
choice and technology-choice. Studies of aid effectiveness
indicate that the number of failed or partly failed projects
rises when other than purely developmental motives play an
important role. When political/strategic or eco-
nomic/commercial motives overrule the motive that foreign aid
should first and foremost bring economic, social and human
development, aid-projects and -programs clearly show more
deficiencies. Donors with a greater emphasis in their programs
on commercial and strategic goals seem to be comparatively
less effective and have relatively more failures. The end of
the Cold War might have diminished donors' political and
strategic considerations in the provision of aid in most
regions of the world. One can imagine that they will continue
to play an important role in the Middle East and to a lesser
extent in Central America, but in general they will be more at
the background. Economic and commercial interests still dis-
tort aid programs. In its latest annual report the Development
Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD states:
<p>
'The practice of making a certain amount or specific types of
aid funding conditional on procurement in the donor country is
one which has long raised concerns about the quality and
sustainability of the aid provided.'
<p>
On the costs incurred DAC especially mentions:
<p>
'The interest in the provision of goods and services may give
impetus to project designs that do not correspond well with
recipients' priorities for sustainable development and the
inputs may be priced well above prevailing market levels.'
<p>
These commercial interests often bring with them: blue-print
planning, an over-emphasis on hard-ware, a technological bias
and difficulties in standardization, less value for money and
complications in aid-management within recipient countries.
Regardless of the absorption capacity of aid-receiving
countries, driven also by the budgetary or institutional needs
to spend money, donors in many cases push their projects into
aid-receiving countries. As such, one of the reasons that aid
effectiveness is clearly lower in Africa (R.Cassen, 1985;
T.Killick, 1990) could be that aid-projects and -activities
are more donor-driven in African than in other developing
countries.
<p>
When aid does not work, most of the time it appears that the
mistakes were made right in the beginning: superficial iden-
tification and appraisal, blue-print or inadequate project-
design and wrong choice of technology, appraisal distorted by
bureaucratic or commercial interests are among the most common
mistakes. When the project or program is merely identified, it
already often seems difficult to stop the 'financing train'.
Budget pressures, the need to invest aid-money and an emphasis
on loan approval clearly diminish the quality of appraisal.
One could conclude here that investment in the pre-project-
phase pays itself off easily. Donor agencies should be able
and ready to invest more in the identification and appraisal-
phases. Once planned and in execution project-implementation
is often rather inflexible. Donor's procedures often don't
allow changes in the lay-out of projects or programmes, only
after time-consuming bureaucratic procedures. To improve aid
effectiveness it seems clearly necessary for donors to be more
flexible and to let changes to be incorporated in project-
plans during the implementation phase.
<p>
Aid effectiveness is heavily affected by the recipient-coun-
try's policies and its social and institutional environment.
Wrong macro-economic policies, especially wrong price-
policies, and policies that favour the rich and/or the urban
population, make projects easily less cost-effective or set to
fail from the beginning. The several country-studies of
Sweden, the Netherlands and the World Bank give ample prove
here. But one should add that these studies should be treated
as 'cases' or 'examples'. At first because the researchers'
capabilities and attitudes, as well as their focus or terms of
reference do play a role in their final judgements on aid
effectiveness. Secondly because research methods differ and
are not all of the same quality. Thirdly because these
evaluation studies don't, yet, allow for a comparative
judgement. Several country-studies f.e. are made of Tanzania
with quite negative results on aid-delivery in this country,
but these studies can't lead us to the sort of statements
politicians seem to like, that aid effectiveness in Kenya must
be 'better' or 'worse', or that all aid to so-called socialist
countries a waste.
<p>
'Ownership', reflecting the extent to which a project or
program emanated from the recipient country itself, is the new
buzz-word here. It is believed that a high degree of aid
receiver's ownership and a low or absent imposition from
abroad improve project performance. This could be related with
the correlation between absorption-capacity and aid-perform-
ance: weak institutions and limited planning capacity, or a
limited will to planning of the recipient country, give aid-
project and -programs that are introduced or imposed from
abroad a better chance to be implemented, but a limited chance
of success. Lower aid effectiveness in Africa, compared to
Asia, might be the best proof for the fact that a low absorp-
tion-capacity finds its causes in a low level of overall
development, and for the low extent of local ownership and
consequently low project performance. This implies that donors
should invest more in institutional development and the plan-
ning capacity of the recipient country. Especially technical
aid  should be used more to this effect: to train, especially
in Africa, a new generation of planners who adhere to demo-
cratic procedures and principles of participation. It implies
also that donors and practitioners should pay more than lip-
service to 'participation'. 'Local ownership' in itself, by
definition, should imply that participation of the affected
social groups or classes in planning and project design is
assured. More democratic structures, a higher accountability
and transparency of decision-making in aid-receiving countries
in this way should lead to a higher degree of aid effective-
ness.
<p>

<A NAME="eva"><hr><h3>Evaluation by European Donors</h3></A>

Before entering into some general issues of aid evaluation, we
will try to give a short overview of the evaluation work by
the EU member states and other European donors. Most of them
started with evaluations in the second half of the seventies
or in the eighties. Work done by USAID and the World Bank was
in most cases the example. Some countries have several
evaluation units in all the executing agencies or ministries,
but where the execution of aid programmes is centralized in an
agency or ministry there is mostly only one evaluation unit.
Most evaluation units are small and amounts spent on
evaluation research is limited, confined to less than 0,35%
and in most cases less than 0,10% of ODA (see also Table 1).
<p>
<A HREF="../no/no.htm">Norway</a> has a small, three professionals large, evaluation
unit, placed in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, i.e. outside
the aid-agency NORAD, of two persons dealing with external
evaluations. It spends about 0,12% of ODA on evaluations (see
table). Since 1986 it published three to nine evaluation
reports per year. Some of these evaluations deal with
projects, most with sector reports or multilateral aid
studies. Furthermore ten, quite voluminous but quite superfi-
cial and little critical, country studies were published
between 1985 and 1990, most of them executed by the
Chr.Michelsen Institute. Apart from that 40 to 50 project
reviews are made by the country desks. Country studies and
external evaluations are free to get for the interested audi-
ence.
<p>
Evaluations made by the evaluation unit were dedicated to
specific projects and special programmes, as well as to dif-
ferent aid channels, from multilateral agencies (f.e. UNESCO,
UNIFEM) to private organizations. Most of the times field
research is rather short and linked, especially in the case of
import-support, more to macro-economic aspects. Several
studies are almost entirely based on file-studies and inter-
views with officials.
<p>
One Norwegian evaluation report was dedicated to the learning
effects of evaluations and reviews. It concluded that there
was a gap between the evaluation system and policy oriented
studies. In the evaluation studies aid delivery was more
addressed than impact and policy issues. Evaluation reports
seemed, according to the report, to serve the purpose of
control and management more than the purpose of feed back.
<p>
<A HREF="../se/se.htm">Sweden</a> has since 1972 an evaluation unit, that is placed
inside the Swedish International Development Agency with four
professional staff members. Expenditure on the work of the
unit is some 0,07% of ODA. It carries out some 20 evaluations
a year (on some 300 ongoing projects) and publishes about four
to five, as well project as thematic, studies a year.
Evaluation results are public and easy to come by. The
evaluations are the more traditional type of project
evaluations, with rather short field-visits, limited to aid-
delivery, with no aid-receiving country involvement in the
evaluation, etcetera. They therefore better should be called
project-reviews. Only recently some more thematic evaluations,
f.e. on import support, were done.
<p>
The 1992 management reform, implying a shift in responsibility
for aid implementation to the aid-receiving countries, meant
also a shift in emphasis of evaluations to more non-project
impact-studies and thematic studies. At this moment a special
Secretariat, directly under the Minister, is involved in a
major review of the overall Swedish international cooperation
programme. In the course of this exercise country-studies and
case-studies of macro-economic impact were made. Already nine
main reports and more than twenty sectoral and thematic
studies were written. The final report will be published in
1995.
<p>
<A HREF="../fi/fi.htm">Finland</a> restored its evaluation unit in 1993, placed within
the policy coordination unit of the agency. Its three
evaluation officers coordinate the internal evaluations done
by FINNIDA and hire mainly external, often foreign, consul-
tants for thematic evaluations or evaluations of aid-
instruments. Recently f.e. NGO-activities and the investment-
support programme were evaluated and together with BMZ and
CIDA an evaluation of UNFPA was made. Short field research is
part of most of the studies. In the 1980s about 60 project
evaluations were done, now the number of evaluations is about
20 a year. The unit has about 0,22% of Finnish ODA at its
disposal for evaluations.
<p>
<A HREF="../dk/dk.htm">Denmark</a> has an independent evaluation unit since 1982, that
gained more autonomy since the reorganization of DANIDA in
1991. Its staff consists of four evaluation officers. A rather
large amount of ODA, 0,33% is reserved for this evaluation
research. The number of evaluations was quite high in the
eighties up to 31 in a year, but most evaluations were mere
project evaluations then. Since 1988 about 8 to 9 evaluation
studies were done. They are public and can be easily attained
by interested researchers. 
<p>
Evaluations became more thematic since 1988 than before.
Multilateral aid was already for a long time part of the
surveys, but a major evaluation on 11 agencies in four
countries was published in 1991. Sectoral evaluations included
f.e. electrification, public telephone, grain storage and
drinking water projects. The unit did also organize a more
procedural evaluation of NGO-aid. Nearly all evaluations are
executed by external consultants. By methodological quality
and by time reserved for field research several of the
evaluation studies distinct themselves from most of other
donors' work in this field.
<p>
Participation of local authorities and researchers in
evaluations is limited. A shift to more impact-studies was
proposed two years ago. Feed back mechanisms seem to be first
and for all informal, but the writing of follow-up memorandums
is part of the unit's job.
<p>
The <A HREF="../gb/gb.htm">United Kingdom's</a> evaluation department was formed in 1980
It has six officers and publishes about fifteen reports a
year, some of them are published by the institutes that
contracted the research. About 0,06% of ODA is spent on evalu-
ations. These studies are normally released to the public. In
the beginning evaluation was project-oriented, but there are
more thematic, sectoral and cross-country studies now. The
content of the reports is rather mixed. Most reports deal with
the review of projects, but there are also summaries of
evaluations by other donors, summaries of evaluations of
similar projects, etcetera. Also the volume ranges from five
pages to more than 150. Focus in the evaluations is generally
on financial and economic analysis. Field-research is short
and superficial, impact-analysis nearly absent. 
<p>
Apart from these evaluations the totally independent National
Audit Office undertakes irregular studies on aid-programmes
and -projects. Recently it has published reports on water and
irrigation projects and the environment, emergency relief and
the Pergau Hydro-Electric Project in Malaysia. For this short
research visits to (some of) the countries involved are also
made. The evaluation is not purely on financial regulations
but also impact analysis may be part of it.
<p>
The administration has tried to assure feedback of evaluations
by demanding reference to former evaluations in the submis-
sions for new projects. To reach this relevant evaluation
reports are disseminated at the time officials are planning
new projects. Other feedback instruments seem to have low
priority.
<p>
In <A HREF="../nl/nl.htm">the Netherlands</A> individual project evaluations are dealt
with by the country desks. The evaluation unit, 'Inspection
Development Cooperation in the Field' (IOV), with a staff of
10 professionals undertakes larger studies of most of the time
two or even three years with several field studies. The
'inspectors' themselves are responsible for the final reports
and write most of it themselves. External expertise is hired
for field research and often also for the whole exercise. The
evaluations deal with special programmes and aid-instruments
or are country studies. Two to four, quite voluminous reports
are published each year and disseminated free of charge to the
interested audience. The unit is semi-independent within the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 0,06% of Dutch ODA is spent on
IOV-evaluations.
<p>
Local government institutions and researchers play only a
limited role in the evaluations. Field research is rather
short and sometimes superficial. In general the evaluations
are more directed at improving aid-management and aid-delivery
than at measuring aid-impact. Project officers are part of the
'reference group' which advises on methodology and approach. A
critique is that therefore major points of critique are
omitted or final reports are undone of sharp comments. In 1993
an 'Inspection'-report was published dealing with (internal)
evaluation and monitoring. It was quite critical on the
quality of and methodological aspects of evaluations and
concluded that aid/receiving organizations played only a
limited role in evaluations and that the feedback on policy
formulation of these internal evaluations/project reviews was
nearly absent, because structures to feed the institutional
memory were missing.
<p>
In <A HREF="../de/de.htm">Germany</a> about 50 evaluations per year are executed, mostly
by external experts. The unit with four professionals produced
about 750 reports since 1976. About 0,2% of ODA is spent on
evaluation by the ministry and the executing agencies for
technical and financial aid, of which about two thirds by the
evaluation unit. The unit functions more or less as a coor-
dinating and technical support unit for evaluation. 
<p>
Most of the evaluations are project reviews with limited
research time. Two to six cross-project sectoral or thematic
evaluations (Querschnittsanalysen) are made every year. In
recent years f.e. drinking water projects, fertilizer fac-
tories, special energy projects, small industries, women in
development were subject of such analyses. Furthermore
sometimes file-studies or literature-studies on aid-
instruments or developmental themes are published (f.e. cul-
ture and development, sustainability). 
<p>
Yearly reports are made in which general overviews of
evaluation results are given. The main accent is on project
and sectoral studies. No country studies are made up till now.
Feed back mechanisms seem still poor at the moment.
<p>
The several executing agencies and ministries of the
government of <A HREF="../fr/fr.htm">France</a> have their own evaluation units. Most of
the times their evaluations are combined with auditing. The
unit within the Ministry for Cooperation has a number of five
professional staff members and a budget of 0,15% of ODA. It
carries out thematic and country studies, respectively  about
six and two a year. Since these reports are classified, only
out of excerpts a limited view on the exercise could be ob-
tained. The accent is on project evaluations; critical but
without a broad range would be the main characteristic of
evaluation research here. The unit of Caisse Fran&#162;aise de
D&#233;veloppement evaluates about 15 projects a year and also
the Treasury of the Ministry of Economics has a two staff
members unit which carries out 15 to 20 of these evaluations.
Most of these are project reviews and also these are clas-
sified and for internal use only.
<p>
Since a reorganization of its aid-agency, ABOS, in 1992 <A HREF="../be/be.htm">Belgium</a> also has a separate evaluation unit. The Belgium unit
dealt before with research, organization and evaluations. The
new unit has two professionals and a head only for evaluation.
It carries out only a limited number of project evaluations,
project reviews (8-10 per year) that have a restricted circulation. Feed-back mechanisms are still underdeveloped. Only
0,05 percent of ODA is spent on evaluation.
<p>
The evaluation-unit of the European Union was reorganized in
1992 after a very critical report on EU evaluation activities
by the former head of the evaluation unit of ODA and after
continuous critical comments on EC-aid by the European
Auditors and the European Parliament. As a consequence of new
evaluation policies the number of professional staff was
brought to 10. Accent is on project evaluations. The number of
project evaluations reaches the hundred. The quality is not
high, since clear references on methodology are often lacking
and main topics are restricted to technicalities. This is
mainly due to limited field research and reliance on a pool of
researchers of varying qualities. Recently also thematic
cross-sectoral studies were introduced, as well as country
studies, until this moment only directed at technical aid.
Yearly reports on aid evaluations are published.
<p>
Ireland, Portugal and Italy don't have separate evaluation
units. Evaluation is done only sporadically. Ireland has a
Audit and Evaluation Unit though that carried out a first
country-study in 1993 in Lesotho. Until then a very limited
number of project evaluations was executed. The main accent is
on project reviews. Portugal is preparing rules for
evaluations. Also Austria's evaluation capacity is still
limited; a restricted number of mainly mid-term project
reviews/evaluations are carried out up till now.
<p>
Summing up one could conclude that in the northern European
countries the evaluation-function in aid agencies and/or
ministries is  better developed than in southern European
countries (Belgium belonging here to the southern European
part). But also in the northern donors' evaluation work some
easy improvements could be made. The quality of evaluations,
as far as it could be analyzed from the about 90 reports that
were studied for this paper, leaves us with an even more mixed
picture. In terms of the range of subjects and aid-channels,
time spent on field research, methodological accountability
etcetera the Danish reports show the best quality; Finland and
the Netherlands coming next. Most evaluation research by the
other donors is mere project-reviewing with poor reference to
criteria and research methods used. Feed-back mechanisms seem
to have been ameliorated in recent times, but also here
definite improvements could be made especially in the field of
enhancing the learning capacities of the organizations.
<p>

<A NAME="con"><hr><h3>The Context of Evaluation</h3></A>

Evaluation is one of the most important tools to improve aid
effectiveness. One can conclude from the above that too many
donors still have limited or no evaluative capacity, no clear
procedures or guidelines concerning the impartiality and
independence of evaluations, no programming of evaluations, no
or little rules for reporting and dissemination of evaluation-
studies and no structures for follow-up. This leads to the
conclusion that donors take the 'Principles for Evaluation of
Development Assistance' of the DAC (1992) until now not very
seriously.
<p>
Most evaluations by European donors could be better called
project reviews. Limited research time and especially limited
field research makes it impossible for the evaluators to come
further than discussions with authorities and project staff
and an obligatory visit to the 'field'. Given these limited
possibilities measuring results and measuring impact,
especially in complex projects or programmes, seems therefore
impossible, especially when the evaluators want to go beyond
the aid delivery systems themselves.
<p>
Furthermore, evaluation by donor agencies is currently still
too much donor-centred. The aid-relationship in itself implies
inequality, but too often only lip-service is paid to catch-
words as 'partnership in evaluation' and 'participation in
evaluation'. Also in many aid-receiving countries there is no
open climate for impartial and objective evaluation. Still,
donors should make more efforts to involve local scientists
and experts in evaluation and direct their technical aid more
to capacity-building for monitoring and evaluation activities.
Some developing countries, especially in South Asia, have a
long standing tradition in evaluation. Although data on the
quality of their research is lacking, donors should at least
be ready to study the possibilities for a more narrow
cooperation and trying to integrate these developing country
evaluation experts in their own research.
<p>
Evaluation at the moment is too much directed at project-
performance and the improvement of effectiveness on that
level. In that sense, evaluation is too often only a manage-
ment-tool instead of an instrument to enhance the learning
capacities and institutional memory of the aid-organizations
or -agencies. Too often results of evaluations do not go
beyond the desks of the country-officers and the field-
missions involved. Evaluation of EC, Norwegian and Dutch
evaluation-, monitoring- and feed-back-systems led to very
critical comments on the quality of evaluation-research and -
reporting, especially also on the methodological issues, and
on the lacking of feed-back mechanisms.
<p>
More creativity is needed to come to new and more advanced
evaluation techniques with the right mix of quantitative and
qualitative methods. Until now participation of target-groups
in evaluation just seems to be a catchword in official
documents, but is sparsely effectuated. Most evaluation is
done by rapid appraisal in which only local staff and local
officials are involved or interviewed. Donors should, at the
risk of not getting the material they hope for, experiment
with other techniques: self-evaluation also with quantitative
criteria; participation by means of group interviews or group-
evaluations; investing more in long time, even repetitive or
time series, research, etcetera. 
<p>
Most donors have difficulties with integrating their
evaluation results in new country- or sectoral policies. An
open discussion on evaluation results could give an input to
institutional learning and integration in future policies.
Donors should therefore look for ways to disseminate their
evaluation reports to a broader audience. Accountability to
the general or interested public in the donor-countries should
be attained by openness and a wide dissemination of evaluation
material. Too often donors run their 'aid-business' like a
secret service and not as a government-activity which involves
tax-payers' money.
<p>
There is, in general a lot of pressure from parliament,
political parties and interest groups to have more indications
that 'aid does work'. Although many questions regarding
overall aid effectiveness and the impact of foreign aid in
general remain, evaluation though should not in the first
place be used to legitimize the 'aid-business' or to assure
future public support for development cooperation. The public
debate in the donor-countries on the quality of aid is of
great importance to redirect donor-policies, but the first
role evaluation has to play is to improve future aid policy,
aid programs and projects by improving feed back mechanisms
and learning capacities. This also because it seems impossible
to gather in the end enough data to come with clear and un-
questionable conclusions on the impact of development aid. One
of the aspects of the 'Does aid work?'-discussion, though,
should be taken more into account and more underlined; i.e.
the general impact of aid-programs and projects on poverty
alleviation and economic and human development in general
still gets to little attention compared with the progress and
efficiency of a specific project. Evaluation is often, still
too much a project-oriented management-tool. Impact-
measurement, therefore, should be a central focus of evalu-
ations in the coming years. 
<p>
Out of the material collected for this paper one can conclude
also that it seems far easier to come with and gather infor-
mation on the ineffectiveness of aid or to demonstrate aid-
failure than to show aid effectiveness. For critical resear-
chers it is always possible to find objectives that are not
attained, actions that were not cost-effective or target-group
interests that were damaged by project-activities. To learn
lessons in another way, it might be useful to undertake a
critical study on aid-successes and analyze the economical,
socio-political and institutional factors that contributed to
these successes and to a higher aid effectiveness.
<p>
<A NAME="end"><hr><h3>Conclusions</h3></A>

It is still impossible to come with generalized statements on
aid effectiveness and even more so to come to a comparison on
effectiveness of the several European donors. Evaluation has
up till now been a rather blunt instrument, mainly also
because most evaluation research does not go 'deep', stays
away from impact measurement and the quality of it is often
low and in each case of varying level, partly due to time and
budgetary constraints. Only a few donors, f.e. Denmark at
first and then also Finland and the Netherlands, have reached
good or satisfactory levels of evaluation research. A more
creative approach is needed. Furthermore evaluation research
and evaluation results, in most European countries, should be
discussed more in public, through a wider dissemination of
reports, also to ameliorate feed-back mechanisms and to en-
hance the learning capacities of donors' institutions.

<HR>
<P>
La politique europ&eacute;enne de d&eacute;veloppement est n&eacute;e
de la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; d'&eacute;viter, avec la cr&eacute;ation
de la Communaut&eacute; Economique Europ&eacute;enne (CEE) en
1958, de ne s&eacute;parer de leurs &quot;m&eacute;tropoles&quot;
les r&eacute;gions d&eacute;pendantes des puissances coloniales
europ&eacute;ennes. L'&quot;association&quot; pr&eacute;vue dans
les trait&eacute;s de Rome devait permettre surtout la libre importation
dans la CEE des biens en provenance des pays associ&eacute;s.
En compl&eacute;ment de ces dispositions a &eacute;t&eacute; cr&eacute;&eacute;
le premier Fonds Europ&eacute;en de D&eacute;veloppement (FED),
dont le financement jusqu'&agrave; ce jour est assur&eacute; directement
par les Etats membres, et non &agrave; partir du budget de l'Union
Europ&eacute;enne (UE). Apr&egrave;s l'accession &agrave; l'ind&eacute;pendance
des diff&eacute;rents partenaires associ&eacute;s, au d&eacute;but
des ann&eacute;es 60, ces rapports privil&eacute;gi&eacute;s se
sont poursuivis tout d'abord dans le cadre des Conventions de
Yaound&eacute; (1963 et 1969) puis, apr&egrave;s l'adh&eacute;sion
de la Grande Bretagne &agrave; la CE (1973), dans le cadre des
Conventions de Lom&eacute; (&agrave; partir de 1975). La coop&eacute;ration
pratiqu&eacute;e dans le cadre de ces accords avec les Etats d'Afrique,
de la Cara&iuml;be et du Pacifique (ACP), qui sont entretemps
au nombre de 70, constitue le noyau de la politique de d&eacute;veloppement
de l'UE et fait fonction de mod&egrave;le pour la coop&eacute;ration
Nord-Sud au niveau international.
<P>
<B>Appr&eacute;ciations positives</B>
<P>
  Les appr&eacute;ciations positives port&eacute;es sur
  la coop&eacute;ration dans le cadre des Conventions de Lom&eacute; reposent avant tout sur les
  caract&eacute;ristiques suivantes:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Caract&egrave;re contractuel: Ces conventions d&eacute;finissent en termes obligatoires pour
  les deux parties aussi bien les objectifs
  communs de la coop&eacute;ration que les
  droits et devoirs des parties contractantes. 
<P>
<li>Durabilit&eacute;: Les conventions sont conclues pour plusieurs ann&eacute;es (autrefois
  5 ans, depuis Lom&eacute; IV 10 ans) et permettent donc une
coop&eacute;ration pr&eacute;visible.
<P>
<li>Supranationalit&eacute;: Les conventions &eacute;tant
  pass&eacute;es entre des r&eacute;gions, elles permettent de
surmonter le bilat&eacute;ralisme et
  conf&egrave;rent donc une certaine ind&eacute;pendance par
rapport aux convoitises nationales.
<P>
<li>Dialogue continu: La n&eacute;gociation, la planification,
la programmation et le contr&ocirc;le de la coop&eacute;ration
au d&eacute;veloppement (CD) s'effectuent au sein d'organes paritaires, &agrave; savoir:
le Conseil des ministres ACP-UE, le Comit&eacute; des ambassadeurs
ACP-UE et l'Assembl&eacute;e paritaire.
<P>
<li>Approche tr&egrave;s large de coop&eacute;ration: En plus
des programmes et projets classiques de coop&eacute;ration financi&egrave;re
et technique, la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE englobe &eacute;galement
des avantages commerciaux, des instruments de stabilisation des
recettes d'exp&oacute;rtation de mati&egrave;res premi&egrave;res
(Stabex, Sysmin) et, depuis Lom&eacute; IV, des mesures de soutien
&agrave; l'ajustement structurel.
<P>
<li>Part &eacute;lev&eacute;e de dons: Les dons repr&eacute;sentaient
75% du 6&egrave;me FED. Depuis Lom&eacute; IV, mis &agrave; part
les pr&ecirc;ts consentis par la Banque Europ&eacute;enne d'lnvestissements
(BEI), les aides financi&egrave;res sont accord&eacute;es exclusivement
sous forme de subventions non remboursables, ce qui signifie que
l'&eacute;l&eacute;ment don repr&eacute;sente 92% du 7&egrave;me
FED.
<P>
<li>Prise en compte particuli&egrave;rement importante des
pays moins avanc&eacute;s (PMA): 40 % des prestations d'aide publique
au d&eacute;veloppement (APD) de l'UE vont aux PMA, tandis que
la part correspondante qui leur est attribu&eacute;e en moyenne
par tous les donateurs de l'OCDE se monte &agrave; seulement 25%.
Cette part importante accord&eacute;e aux PMA est toutefois consid&eacute;r&eacute;e;
moins comme une performance que comme un d&eacute;ficit structurel
de la coop&eacute;ration entre l'Europe et l'Afrique. II n'est
en effet pas flatteur pour l'Europe que ses anciennes colonies
continuent d'&ecirc;tre aujourd'hui encore les pays les moins
d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s du monde.</ul>
<P>
La r&eacute;vision &agrave; mi-parcours de la Convention actuellement
en vigueur de Lom&eacute; IV, qui s'est achev&eacute;e au d&eacute;but
de 1995, a conduit &agrave; des d&eacute;bats plus fondamentaux
et &agrave; des changements plus substantiels que les ren&eacute;gociations
ant&eacute;rieures de la Convention. Ainsi les Etats UE et ACP
se sont entendus par exemple sur l'adoption d'une clause d&eacute;mocratique,
en plus de celle relative aux droits de l'homme, sur l'introduction
de &quot;dotations sp&eacute;ciales &agrave; des fins incitatives&quot;
pour des mesures consid&eacute;r&eacute;es comme particuli&egrave;rement
importantes par l'UE (d&eacute;veloppement durable, promotion
du secteur priv&eacute;, politique de l'environnement, r&eacute;formes
institutionnelles) ainsi que pour l'intensification de la &quot;coop&eacute;ration
d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e&quot;, c'est&agrave;dire de la coop&eacute;ration
avec des acteurs semi-publics ou priv&eacute;s. En outre, a &eacute;t&eacute;
examin&eacute;e la possibilit&eacute; de suspendre la coop&eacute;ration
en cas de violations des droits de l'homme et de mauvaise administration
des affaires publiques, la gestion conjointe des fonds a &eacute;t&eacute;
limit&eacute;e, une programmation par tranche des versements et
de nouvelles modalit&eacute;s de financement pour diff&eacute;rents
instruments ont &eacute;t&eacute; convenus (Stabex, appui financier
aux politiques d'ajustement structurel, mesures de r&eacute;habilitation).
<P>
En ce qui concerne les proc&eacute;dures et instruments de CD,
la coop&eacute;ration dans le cadre de Lom&eacute; est donc &agrave;
la hauteur de notre &eacute;poque. Mais dans une perspective plus
globale de la politique de d&eacute;veloppement, elle laisse
encore beaucoup &agrave; d&eacute;sirer, en particulier au niveau
de la politique commerciale. En effet, l'objectif souhait&eacute;
de &quot;libre-&eacute;change&quot; n'a jamais &eacute;t&eacute;
atteint, et les avantages commerciaux restant aux Etats ACP par
rapport aux autres pays en d&eacute;veloppement sont de plus en
plus &eacute;rod&eacute;s par la lib&eacute;ralisation g&eacute;n&eacute;rale
du commerce mondial et du commerce ext&eacute;rieur de l'UE.

non membre de l'UE, appel&eacute;s <B>pays tiers m&eacute;diterran&eacute;ens
(PTM) </B>est devenu le deuxi&egrave;me pilier r&eacute;gional
de la politique de d&eacute;veloppement de l'Union Europ&eacute;enne.
Sur la base de &quot;l'approche globale m&eacute;diterran&eacute;enne&quot;,
&eacute;labor&eacute;e en 1972, des accords de coop&eacute;ration
de dur&eacute;e illimit&eacute;e ont &eacute;t&eacute; conclus
avec les diff&eacute;rents pays de la r&eacute;gion au cours des
ann&eacute;es 70. Des ressources budg&eacute;taires et des pr&ecirc;ts
de la BEI sont mis &agrave; la disposition de ces pays dans le
cadre de protocoles de financement pour des p&eacute;riodes de
5 ans. Comme &quot;r&eacute;ponse strat&eacute;gique&quot; &agrave;
l'&eacute;volution &eacute;conomique et d&eacute;mographique de
ces pays et &agrave; la menace &eacute;cologique qui p&egrave;se
sur la r&eacute;gion m&eacute;diterran&eacute;enne, I'UE a &eacute;bauch&eacute;
au d&eacute;but des ann&eacute;es 80 une &quot;politique m&eacute;diterran&eacute;enne
r&eacute;nov&eacute;e&quot;, qui pr&eacute;voit une intensification
de la coop&eacute;ration. Depuis 1994, un nouveau partenariat
euro-m&eacute;diterran&eacute;en est discut&eacute;, ses &eacute;l&eacute;ments
les plus importants devant &ecirc;tre &quot;I'espace &eacute;conomique
euro-m&eacute;diterran&eacute;en&quot;(EEEM) et une &quot;zone
euro-m&eacute;diterran&eacute;enne de stabilit&eacute; et de s&eacute;curit&eacute;
politiques&quot; &agrave; l'instar de la CSCE.
<P>
La coop&eacute;ration avec d'autres pays en d&eacute;veloppement
a &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;tendue &eacute;galement. Cependant,
dans le domaine commercial en particulier, celle-ci est rest&eacute;e
bien en de&ccedil;&agrave; des esp&eacute;rances des pays concern&eacute;s.
Des accords de coop&eacute;ration ont &eacute;t&eacute; conclus
surtout dans les ann&eacute;es 80 avec un grand nombre de pays
d'Asie et d'Am&eacute;rique Latine, sans toutefois comporter d'engagement
sur des aides financi&egrave;res. Les fonds vers&eacute;s tous
les ans par l'UE de fa&ccedil;on &quot;autonome&quot;, c'est-&agrave;-dire
sans base contractuelle, ont &eacute;t&eacute; attribu&eacute;s
principalement aux pays les plus pauvres de ces r&eacute;gions.
Les propositions pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es &agrave; la fin de 1994
par la Commission au sujet de ses futures relations avec les Etats
du Mercosur, ainsi qu'avec le Mexique et le Chili, et sa nouvelle
&quot;strat&eacute;gie asiatique&quot;, ne changeront pas grand
chose &agrave; la place relativement peu importante qu'occupent
ces r&eacute;gions dans la politique de d&eacute;veloppement de
l'UE. Les accords pr&eacute;cit&eacute;s tiennent plut&ocirc;t
compte du r&ocirc;le plus important que jouent l'Am&eacute;rique
Latine et l'Asie sur l'&eacute;chiquier politique international
et dans les &eacute;changes mondiaux.
<P>
La coop&eacute;ration avec <B>l'Europe de l'Est </B>a &eacute;t&eacute;
amorc&eacute;e &agrave; la fin des ann&eacute;es 80. Les accords
conclus en 1988 et 1989 tout d'abord avec la Pologne et la Hongrie,
puis de 1990 &agrave; 1992 avec tous les autres pays de l'Europe
de l'Est et de l'ancienne Union Sovi&eacute;tique, constituent
le cadre juridique des relations de coop&eacute;ration et de commerce.
<P>
Le d&eacute;placement des priorit&eacute;s des politiques &eacute;trang&egrave;re
et de d&eacute;veloppement en direction de la r&eacute;gion m&eacute;diterran&eacute;enne
et de l'Europe de l'Est continuera de s'accentuer au cours des
prochaines ann&eacute;es. Pour le quinquennat 1995-1999, il est
pr&eacute;vu d'affecter 13,3 milliards d'&eacute;cus aux Etats
ACP, 6,69 milliards &agrave; l'Europe centrale et orientale, 4,69
milliards aux pays riverains du Sud de la M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e
et 5,5 milliards &agrave; tous les autres pays d'Asie et d'Am&eacute;rique
Latine pris ensemble. Sur le plan du contenu, il y a lieu de constater
par contre une convergence croissante de toutes les politiques
de d&eacute;veloppement r&eacute;gionales de l'UE: des approches
nouvelles (politiques de l'environnement et d'ajustement structurel,
promotion de la d&eacute;mocratie et du respect des droits de
l'homme, etc.) qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;labor&eacute;es
dans le contexte de la coop&eacute;ration avec une r&eacute;gion
en d&eacute;veloppement sont int&eacute;gr&eacute;es successivement
&agrave; la coop&eacute;ration avec d'autres r&eacute;gions en
d&eacute;veloppement.
<P>
<B>La politique europ&eacute;enne de d&eacute;veloppement apr&egrave;s
le Trait&eacute; de Maastricht</B>
<P>
<B>Compl&eacute;mentarit&eacute;, coordination et coh&eacute;rence</B>
<P>
La politique de d&eacute;veloppement de l'UE acquiert une dimension
nouvelle dans le contexte de l'intensification de l'int&eacute;gration
europ&eacute;enne. Dans le Trait&eacute; de Maastricht instaurant
l'Union Europ&eacute;enne, la politique de d&eacute;veloppement
est pour la premi&egrave;re fois codifi&eacute;e en tant que
domaine politique autonome (Titre XVII, article 130uy). Le trait&eacute;
exige que soit men&eacute;e une politique de d&eacute;veloppement
compl&eacute;mentaire, coordonn&eacute;e entre les diff&eacute;rents
Etats membres et la Commission et coh&eacute;rente avec les autres
domaines politiques. L'imp&eacute;ratif de coordination (Article
130x) laisse esp&eacute;rer une simplification des proc&eacute;dures
administratives, des effets de synergie et des gains d'efficacit&eacute;,
la r&eacute;duction des d&eacute;pendances bilat&eacute;rales
et &eacute;ventuellement l'abandon des pratiques d'aide li&eacute;e.
Les efforts en ce sens ne progressent cependant que tr&egrave;s
lentement.
<P>
<B>Objectifs de la politique europ&eacute;enne de d&eacute;veloppement</B>
<P>
Les objectifs que l'UE s'engage &agrave; poursuivre dans sa politique
de d&eacute;veloppement selon le Trait&eacute; de Maastricht (Art.
130u) sont les suivants:
<P>
<ul>
<li>d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;conomique et social durable
des pays du Tiers monde et en particulier des pays les plus d&eacute;favoris&eacute;s,
<P>
<li>int&eacute;gration harmonieuse et progressive des pays
en voie de d&eacute;veloppement dans l'&eacute;conomie mondiale,
<P>
<li>Iutte contre la pauvret&eacute; dans les pays moins d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s,
<P>
<li>d&eacute;veloppement et renforcement de la d&eacute;mocratie
et de l'&eacute;tat de droit,
<P>
<li>respect des droits de l'homme et des libert&eacute;s fondamentales.</ul>
<P>
Ces objectifs ont &eacute;t&eacute; op&eacute;rationnalis&eacute;s
dans un document intitul&eacute; &quot;Horizon 2000&quot;, pr&eacute;sent&eacute;
en 1992 par la Commission et adopt&eacute; par le Conseil &agrave;
titre de &quot;D&eacute;claration&quot; et non de &quot;R&eacute;solution&quot;
selon l'usage habituel. Dans ce document il est stipul&eacute;
que le d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;conomique durable doit &ecirc;tre
atteint au moyen d'une &quot;lib&eacute;ralisation cons&eacute;quente
de l'&eacute;conomie&quot;. Cependant, une d&eacute;finition plus
pr&eacute;cise du terme durabilit&eacute; n'y est pas donn&eacute;e
et il n'est pas tenu compte des r&eacute;sultats de la Conf&eacute;rence
des Nations Unies sur l'environnement et le d&eacute;veloppement
(CNUED, Rio 1992). Comme &eacute;l&eacute;ment positif, le document
&quot;Horizon 2000&quot;, r&eacute;clame pour la premi&egrave;re
fois de compl&eacute;ter les crit&egrave;res &eacute;conomiques
pour l'attribution de prestations d'aide par des crit&egrave;res
de performance et propose un contrat de solidarit&eacute; entre
l'Afrique et la Communaut&eacute;.
<P>
<B>Volume et importance de la coop&eacute;ration europ&eacute;enne
au d&eacute;veloppement</B>
<P>
Le volume financier de la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement
de la Commission de l'UE correspond &agrave; celui d'un donateur
moyen. Les prestations d'aide figurant au tableau se composent
&agrave; peu pr&egrave;s &agrave; parts &eacute;gales de prestations
&agrave; partir du FED (Convention de Lom&eacute;) et de prestations
&agrave; partir du budget de l'UE.
<P>
Le trait&eacute; de Maastricht a r&eacute;it&eacute;r&eacute;
l'objectif d'une contribution de 0,7% du PNB des pays membres
et de l'UE au titre de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement (cf. Art.
1 30u, alin&eacute;a 3), pourcentage qui n'est actuellement atteint
que par quelques Etats membres, mais pas par l'UE (Etats membres
et Commission). En ce qui concerne les fonds de coop&eacute;ration
au d&eacute;veloppement g&eacute;r&eacute;s par la Commission,
il n'y a pas lieu de s'attendre &agrave; des augmentations substantielles
dans un avenir pr&eacute;visible: Les versements en 1993 sont
tomb&eacute;s au-dessous du niveau de 1991. L'augmentation de 10%
des engagements s'explique avant tout par l'intensification de
la coop&eacute;ration avec les PTM et l'&eacute;norme accroissement
des prestations d'aide humanitaire. Le 8&egrave;me FED ne sera
gu&egrave;re augment&eacute;, malgr&eacute; l'adh&eacute;sion
de l'Autriche, de la Su&egrave;de et de la Finlande.
<P>
L'importance que pourrait rev&ecirc;tir la politique europ&eacute;enne
de d&eacute;veloppement, si elle &eacute;tait mieux coordonn&eacute;e,
appara&icirc;t clairement lorsque l'on consid&egrave;re les prestations
de la Commission et des Etats membres prises ensemble: Avec une
part de plus de
50% de l'aide publique au d&eacute;veIoppement accord&eacute;e &agrave; travers le monde, l'UE est, de loin, le plus grand donateur, suivie des Etats-Unis et du Japon avec respectivement 17% (1992).
 <P>
<B>Bilan</B>
<P>
Bien que la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement de l'UE
continue de pr&eacute;senter des points faibles, elle m&eacute;rite
n&eacute;anmoins dans l'ensemble une appr&eacute;ciation positive.
Elle a engendr&eacute;  en particulier dans le cadre des Conventions
de Lom&eacute;  des instruments d'intervention originaux (stabilisation
des recettes d'exportation, promotion de la coop&eacute;ration
r&eacute;gionale, etc.) et des proc&eacute;dures exemplaires (dialogue
institutionnalis&eacute;, garantie contractuelle des prestations
de coop&eacute;ration) qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; perfectionn&eacute;s
sur la base des connaissances et exp&eacute;riences accumul&eacute;es
au cours de trois d&eacute;cennies de d&eacute;veloppement. Le
financement et la stabilisation pendant de nombreuses ann&eacute;es
de r&eacute;gimes peu enclins au d&eacute;veloppement ou m&ecirc;me
criminels (&quot;client&eacute;lisme collectif&quot;) sont &agrave;
reprocher autant &agrave; la politique de coop&eacute;ration de
l'UE qu'&agrave; celle de la plupart des donateurs bilat&eacute;raux.
En revanche, la politique de d&eacute;veloppement de l'Union compte
&agrave; son actif le fait qu'elle ait &eacute;t&eacute; l'une
des premi&egrave;res &agrave; commencer d&egrave;s les ann&eacute;es
80 &agrave; suspendre sa coop&eacute;ration dans les cas particuli&egrave;rement
graves de violation des principes d&eacute;mocratiques et &agrave;
prendre des &quot;mesures positives&quot;, de promotion du respect
des droits de l'homme.
<P>
La plus lourde critique que l'on puisse formuler &agrave; l'encontre
de la politique de d&eacute;veloppement de l'UE concerne l'in&eacute;galit&eacute;
de ses rapports avec les diff&eacute;rentes r&eacute;gions du
monde en d&eacute;veloppement. Avec l'europ&eacute;anisation des
politiques de d&eacute;veloppement, il s'agira de &quot;globaliser&quot;
la politique de d&eacute;veloppement, c'est&agrave;dire de &quot;lom&eacute;iser&quot;
les rapports de coop&eacute;ration avec l'Asie, l'Am&eacute;rique
Latine et les PTM. Il faudra pour cela introduire des proc&eacute;dures
de dialogue et de coop&eacute;ration et concevoir et mettre en
&#156;uvre une &quot;politique globale&quot; ad&eacute;quatement
diff&eacute;renci&eacute;e sur le plan commercial et coh&eacute;rente sur le plan  de la politique &eacute;trang&egrave;re.

<P>
<B>L'avenir de la coop&eacute;ration dans le cadre de
Lom&eacute;</B>
<P>
La r&eacute;vision &agrave; mi-parcours de Lom&eacute; IV a prouv&eacute;
une fois de plus la capacit&eacute; de dialogue des partenaires
et la capacit&eacute; de d&eacute;veloppement de la Convention
de Lom&eacute;. Nombreuses sont pourtant les prises de positions
en faveur d'un arr&ecirc;t des relations privil&eacute;gi&eacute;s
avec les Etats ACP consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme de moins en
moins int&eacute;ressants sur le plan de la politique &eacute;trang&egrave;re
et sur celui des &eacute;changes commerciaux. Le Commissaire Joao
de Deus Pinheiro a annonc&eacute; pour bient&ocirc;t une r&eacute;&eacute;valuation
radicale de la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE. Si une telle r&eacute;&eacute;valuation
conduit &agrave;
<P>
<ul>
<li>diff&eacute;rencier les instruments de Lom&eacute; en fonction
du niveau de d&eacute;veloppement des pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires,
<P>
<li>fournir aux autres PMA une assistance aussi bonne et aussi
compl&egrave;te que celle apport&eacute;e aux Etats ACP et surtout
<P>
<li>apporter un soutien substantial aux nouveaux gouvernements
d&eacute;mocratiques et l&eacute;gitimes, &#156;uvrant pour le
d&eacute;veloppement de leur pays, et refuser cette aide aux r&eacute;gimes
corrompus et criminels</ul>
<P>
elle sera tr&egrave;s appr&eacute;ci&eacute;e. Elle ne s'est d'ailleurs
que trop fait attendre. Si cette r&eacute;&eacute;valuation conduit
au contraire &agrave; laisser expirer avec la Convention de Lom&eacute;
le seul accord important de coop&eacute;ration Nord-Sud et &agrave;
l&eacute;gitimer ainsi la compression des prestations d'aide au
d&eacute;veloppement, l'UE risquerait ainsi de perdre sa cr&eacute;dibilit&eacute;
et de devoir recommencer &agrave; z&eacute;ro sa politique de
d&eacute;veloppement: Comment les pays du Nord, y compris ceux
de l'UE, peuvent-ils r&eacute;clamer des pays en d&eacute;veloppement
des efforts consid&eacute;rables d'ajustement, alors qu'euxm&ecirc;mes
sont loin de tenir leurs propres promesses (objectif de 0,7% du
PNB, modes de production et de vie moins polluants, etc.)? Comment
peut-on pratiquer une &quot;politique globale&quot; autrement
que par un dialogue entre partenaires et par une coop&eacute;ration
avec tous les acteurs concern&eacute;s?
<P>
Maintenant plus que jamais, il importe de ne pas saper les structures
de dialogue et de coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es
dans le cadre de Lom&eacute;, mais au contraire de les utiliser
plus intensivement et de les appliquer &agrave; la coop&eacute;ration
avec d'autres r&eacute;gions en d&eacute;veloppement. C'est justement
&agrave; cet &eacute;gard que la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE peut
servir de mod&egrave;le au dialogue Nord-Sud.

La signature de l'accord sur la r&#233;vision de la
IV&#232;me Convention de Lom&#233; s'est tenue au
Mahatma Ghandi Institute &#224; Moka (Maurice) le
4 novembre 1995. La c&#233;r&#233;monie de
signature pr&#233;sid&#233;e par le pr&#233;sident
en exercice du Conseil europ&#233;en, M. Javier
Solana  Madriaga, ministre des Affaires
Etrang&#232;res d'Espagne et le pr&#233;sident du
Conseil des Ministres ACP, M. Moi Avei, ministre du
Plan national de Papouasie-Nouvelle Guin&#233;e,
en pr&#233;sence du Commissaire europ&#233;en en
charge du D&#233;veloppement, Jo&#227;o De Deus
Pinheiro et du Premier ministre mauricien, Sir
Anerood Jugnauth, a &#233;t&#233; empreint d'une
grande sobri&#233;t&#233; contrastant avec le faste
tropical des signatures pr&#233;c&#233;dentes dans
la capitale togolaise, tout en b&#233;n&#233;ficiant
d'une organisation exemplaire qui a offert l'occasion
de d&#233;couvrir un pays consid&#233;r&#233;
comme une carte de visite de la coop&#233;ration
euro-ACP. Cette signature a r&#233;uni  les ministres
des Affaires Etrang&#232;res ou en charge du
D&#233;veloppement des 15 Etats de l'Union
europ&#233;enne et de 69 des 70 Etats ACP, le seul
absent ayant &#233;t&#233; la Somalie qui n'a pas
ratifi&#233; la convention Lom&#233; IV. L'Afrique du
Sud y &#233;tait pr&#233;sente en qualit&#233;
d'observateur ; elle repr&#233;sente un
&#233;ventuel futur membre de la Convention, avec
un statut particulier, &#224; l'issue de
n&#233;gociations  en cours. La rencontre de
Maurice a &#233;t&#233; aussi l'occasion d'amorcer
le dialogue sur une question int&#233;ressant tous
les signataires, le futur m&ecirc;me de la Convention
de Lom&#233;. Le Premier ministre du pays
h&ocirc;te a lanc&#233; une proposition
d'organisation dans un bref d&#233;lai d'un Sommet
ACP suivi d'un Sommet ACP-UE sur l'apr&#232;s
Lom&#233; IV.</b>
<p>
     Le sentiment dominant chez les participants &#224;
la signature de la convention r&#233;vis&#233;e semblait
&ecirc;tre le soulagement, un soulagement
t&#233;moignant de la peur d'un blocage  suscit&#233;e
par les difficult&#233;s des n&#233;gociations qui ont
pr&#233;c&#233;d&#233; l'accord du 30 juin du Conseil
des ministres ACP-UE. Les diff&#233;rentes
interventions faites &#224; la c&#233;r&#233;monie de
signature t&#233;moignent de ce soulagement et aussi
de la pr&#233;occupation de voir s'&#233;laborer une
r&#233;flexion profonde sur le futur de la
coop&#233;ration entre l'Union europ&#233;enne et les
ACP, oblig&#233;e &#224; s'adapter &#224; un contexte
&#233;conomique, politique et commercial mondial
tr&#232;s diff&#233;rent de l'&#233;poque o&ugrave;
elle a &#233;t&#233; lanc&#233;e. A commencer par le
discours de bienvenue du ministre des Affaires
Etrang&#232;res de la R&#233;publique de Maurice,
Hon. R. Jaddoo. Dans une intervention bilingue
fran&#231;ais-anglais, pluriculture mauricienne oblige, il
a fait part de ses appr&#233;hensions devant les
nombreuses incertitudes du Nouvel ordre mondial post
Guerre froide et post GATT, &#233;mettant le voeu que
"le nouveau credo de l'ultra-lib&#233;ralisme et du
mercantilisme ne submerge pas la Coop&#233;ration
ACP-UE" 
<p>
<A NAME="cha"><h3>Le changement dans la continuit&#233;</h3></A>

     Le deuxi&#232;me intervenant  &#224; la c&#233;r&#233;monie, le
Commissaire europ&#233;en Jo&#227;o De Deus Pinheiro a rappel&#233;
l'&#226;pret&#233; des n&#233;gociations  de r&#233;vision de la Convention, une
r&#233;vision, souligne-t-il, qui, tout en ne scellant pas un nouveau pacte, ne
constitue pas pour autant un exercice de second ordre. Sur les difficult&#233;s des
n&#233;gociations, il a tenu &#224; rendre hommage &#224; la d&#233;termination
et &#224; la pers&#233;v&#233;rance de la pr&#233;sidence fran&#231;aise dans
la recherche d'un compromis satisfaisant pour les ACP quant &#224; l'offre
financi&#232;re. Pour lui, le recours en dernier lieu &#224; l'arbitrage des chefs d'Etat
et de gouvernement europ&#233;ens pour adopter ce compromis, loin de constituer
un &#233;l&#233;ment d&#233;courageant, peut &ecirc;tre per&#231;u, avec le recul,
comme un signe de l'importance accord&#233;e par l'Union &#224; sa
coop&#233;ration avec les pays ACP. En insistant sur le fait que les
n&#233;gociations &#233;taient limit&#233;es &#224; un nouveau protocole financier,
il met en exergue l'importance du changement intervenu. Un changement dont
l'enseignement principal est paradoxalement la continuit&#233;. Continuit&#233; dans
la volont&#233; de l'UE de soutenir les efforts de ses partenaires ACP et qui se
traduit par un accroissement de 22 % des ressources en ECU, 49 % en dollars,
l'instrument de mesure des transactions internationales, pour la nouvelle tranche de
cinq ans. Mais "l'essence-m&ecirc;me" de la convention r&#233;vis&#233;e
r&#233;side dans sa flexibilit&#233;. Il a encore retenu l'augmentation de
l'efficacit&#233; par une programmation originale consistant &#224; lib&#233;rer dans
un premier temps soixante-dix pour cent de l'aide r&#233;serv&#233;e &#224; un
pays et le reste en fonction de l'utilisation de cette tranche, et aussi le renforcement
du dialogue politique  avec comme &#233;l&#233;ment essentiel le respect de la
d&#233;mocratie, et en dernier lieu la r&#233;orientation de la dimension
&#233;conomique de la coop&#233;ration vers le d&#233;veloppement du secteur
priv&#233; et la comp&#233;titivit&#233; des ACP. Il a rappel&#233; aussi que, pour
une meilleure efficacit&#233;, les nouvelles dispositions de la convention exigent que
la programmation soit r&#233;alis&#233;e dans les douze mois qui suivent la
signature. Pour finir, il a lanc&#233; un appel &#224; la r&#233;flexion pour le
renouvellement de la convention &#224; l'expiration de Lom&#233; IV.
<p>
     Dans un discours concis, le pr&#233;sident du Conseil des ministres de l'UE,
Javier Solana, a fait une analyse semblable des modifications intervenues dans la
convention en insistant sur la symbolique de la coop&#233;ration euro-ACP, "un
mod&#232;le unique au monde de coop&#233;ration internationale" et un
"t&#233;moignage de la constance" des intentions de l'Europe quant &#224; la
fa&#231;on de vivre ensemble sur cette terre et qui repr&#233;sente pour lui ce que
le po&#232;te cara&iuml;b&#233;en, Derek Walcott, Prix Nobel de litt&#233;rature,
per&#231;oit comme "the bread that lasts when systems have decayed". Sur
l'&#233;largissement du dialogue politique, il a soulign&#233; une innovation, &#224;
son &#233;gard, capitale en terme de participation des citoyens, &#224; savoir les
dispositions pour renforcer le caract&#232;re d&#233;mocratique de
l'Assembl&#233;e paritaire ACP-UE et qui veulent que ses membres soient
effectivement des &#233;lus d'assembl&#233;e nationale ou r&#233;gionale de leurs
pays respectifs.

<h3><A NAME="cic">Les cicatrices d'une dure n&#233;gociation</h3></A>

     L'intervention du pr&#233;sident du Conseil des ministres ACP, Hon. Moi Avei
a insist&#233; sur  les cicatrices d'une n&#233;gociation dure et les
appr&#233;hensions qu'elle avait soulev&#233;es sur le futur de la convention. En
reconnaissant les n&#233;cessit&#233;s de changement dans un monde qui change,
M. Moi Avei a &#233;pingl&#233;, par exemple, que par t&ecirc;te d'habitant des
ACP, l'enveloppe de Lom&#233; n'accorde que 5,5 ECU pour cinq ans, ce qui
revient, et il a cit&#233; un commentateur, &#224;  "deux pintes de bi&#232;re et un
paquet de chips dans un pub banal de Londres. Mais pendant que le Convention
offre cette bi&#232;re du midi &#224; chaque habitant des ACP, la baisse de prix des
denr&#233;es lui a piqu&#233; le plat de la table, et le fardeau du service de la dette,
la veste du dos". Pour le moins, le ton &#233;tait franc. Il s'est demand&#233; ce que
pouvait faire une convention pour hisser les plus pauvres un peu plus pr&#232;s des
riches inaccessibles quand on voit que dans les ann&#233;es 80, les ACP ont perdu
100 milliards de dollars de revenus d'exportation &#224; cause de l'effondrement des
prix des mati&#232;res premi&#232;res, alors que durant cette p&#233;riode, le total
de l'aide, toutes origines confondues, re&#231;ue par les pays les moins
avanc&#233;s, les PMA, ne d&#233;passaient pas 50 milliards. Il d&#233;clare avoir
n&#233;anmoins trouv&#233; des bonnes raisons &#224; opposer aux pessimistes
qui estiment que Lom&#233; a &#233;chou&#233;. D'abord il ne faut pas demander
&#224; la convention plus qu'elle ne puisse donner. Elle ne s'&#233;tait jamais
voulue l'outil de d&#233;veloppement mais un des outils. De plus malgr&#233; les
situations difficiles que connaissent beaucoup de pays ACP sur quoi la presse
s'&#233;tend, il existe toute une s&#233;rie de pays de ce groupe dont l'effort
continu, et l'aide de Lom&#233;, ont &#233;t&#233; r&#233;compens&#233;s de
succ&#232;s. Les discussions sur la sortie de la liste des PMA de onze d'entre eux
t&#233;moignent a contrario de ce succ&#232;s. Si Maurice, poursuit le
pr&#233;sident du Conseil des ministres ACP, n'avait pas &#233;t&#233; choisi
comme h&ocirc;te de la c&#233;r&#233;monie &#224; cause de sa valeur d'exemple,
il n'en demeure pas moins une preuve palpable de cette r&#233;ussite. M. Moi Avei
a encore utilis&#233; un langage franc pour s'adresser au co-pr&#233;sident
europ&#233;en de la c&#233;r&#233;monie pour lui faire remarquer que les pays
ACP ont dans le pass&#233; regrett&#233; que la Communaut&#233; ait
interpr&#233;t&#233; la Convention sur la d&#233;licate question des droits de
l'homme de fa&#231;on unilat&#233;rale en suspendant l'aide &#224; certains pays,
ce qui est en contradiction avec l'esprit et la lettre de Lom&#233;. Aussi salue-t-il
l'innovation que constitue la "clause de suspension", en insistant sur le fait que celle-
ci ne constitue pas en soi  une garantie et que son application exige la plus grande
pr&#233;caution.
<p>
     Sur la coop&#233;ration commerciale, Moi Avei s'est f&#233;licit&#233; de la
plus grande ouverture du march&#233; europ&#233;en aux produits ACP
apport&#233;e par la r&#233;vision, et aussi de la compensation offerte par l'UE 
pour les pertes subies par les ACP &#224; cause de l'application en Europe des
exigences du GATT. Ces compensations repr&#233;sentent 25% des pertes et il
esp&#232;re que le reste suivra au fur &#224; mesure de l'adaptation des provisions
de Lom&#233; aux cons&#233;quences de l'Uruguay round. Et la conclusion du
repr&#233;sentant des ACP traduisait aussi bien le sentiment de soulagement : "Du
point de vue ACP, l'issue des n&#233;gociations sur le plan commercial a
&#233;t&#233; satisfaisante, loin de toute fa&#231;on de ce qu'on aurait pu
logiquement craindre au moment de leur ouverture".
<p>
     Le premier ministre mauricien qui a pris la parole apr&#232;s, a retenu de la
version r&#233;vis&#233;e de la convention, son orientation vers le secteur
priv&#233; et esp&#232;re que la Banque europ&#233;enne d'Investissement (BEI)
et le Centre de D&#233;veloppement agricole (CDI) et le Centre Technique pour
l'agriculture et le d&#233;veloppement rural (CTA) joueront &#224; plein leur
r&ocirc;le dans ce sens. Il souhaite aussi un coop&#233;ration encore plus grande
entre les entreprises de l'UE et des ACP. Il appr&#233;cie l'accent mis sur la lutte
contre la pauvret&#233; dans le nouvel accord. Et dans cette lutte il faudrait repenser
certains des concepts utilis&#233;s, entre autres celui du d&#233;veloppement, trop
souvent restreint aux indicateurs de croissance &#233;conomique alors que la justice
sociale appara&icirc;t de plus en plus comme un &#233;l&#233;ment cl&#233; de ce
d&#233;veloppement, surtout depuis le Sommet social de Copenhague. Et cette
justice sociale est encore plus imp&#233;rative dans un pays pluriculturel o&ugrave;
il faut &#233;viter tout sentiment de frustration ou de marginalisation de l'un ou l'autre
groupe de la population. On peut croire que le Premier ministre avait en t&ecirc;te
son propre pays et comme souci justement les oppositions d'int&#233;r&ecirc;t de
groupes ethniques qui allaient d&#233;boucher quelques jours apr&#232;s sur la
d&#233;mission de son gouvernement.
<p>
     C'est le discours du ministre des Finances de Maurice, Hon. Ramakrishna
Sithanen qui allait clore la premi&#232;re partie de la c&#233;r&#233;monie avant
la signature proprement dite. Dans un langage polic&#233;, il allait donner une
&#233;cho percutant aux propos du pr&#233;sident du Conseil ACP en stigmatisant
l'injustice sociale au niveau plan&#233;taire. Le d&#233;clin de l'aide internationale
au d&#233;veloppement (AID) est dramatique, ce qui est, d'apr&#232;s lui, un
paradoxe au moment o&ugrave; les pauvres en ont le plus besoin pour faire les
r&#233;formes r&#233;clam&#233;es de toute part. Il n'est de l'int&#233;r&ecirc;t de
personne, a-t-il proph&#233;tis&#233;, que le foss&#233; entre les quelques
soci&#233;t&#233;s d'abondance et la masse des pauvres se creuse au point de
susciter chez certains le recours aux "armes du d&#233;sespoir". Et il a
r&#233;clam&#233; la reformulation de la coop&#233;ration ACP-UE non plus comme
un "Partenariat" mais comme une "Alliance". Il a ensuite &#233;tabli un petit
catalogue des critiques et des recommandations y aff&#233;rentes aux uns et aux
autres. Aux ACP, il conseille une acc&#233;l&#233;ration du processus de
d&#233;mocratisation et de bonne gestion &#233;tatique, une meilleure approche du
rapport secteur public / secteur priv&#233;, une meilleure mobilisation des ressources
humaines en se souciant plus du d&#233;veloppement des sciences et technologies,
un &#233;quilibrage entre les milieux urbain et rural, un int&#233;r&ecirc;t plus
affirm&#233; pour les Technologies de l'Information, et des mesures ad&#233;quates
pour mobiliser l'&#233;pargne int&#233;rieure et attirer ainsi les capitaux
ext&#233;rieurs. A l'Europe, le ministre a fait des demandes qui sonnent comme des
d&#233;nonciations de manques. Comme de partager avec les ACP leur expertise
dans des branches comme le d&#233;veloppement des infrastructures, des
t&#233;l&#233;communications et des technologies de l'information, ou de soutenir
les pays en d&#233;veloppement dans les forums internationaux comme l'OIT ou les
Institutions de Bretton Woods. Il rappelle que la Convention de Lom&#233; avait vu
le jour &#224; un moment o&ugrave; l'Europe &#233;tait en qu&ecirc;te d'une
identit&#233; politique pour s'affirmer au niveau international et que la convention lui
en avait fourni une opportunit&#233; id&#233;ale. Maintenant on serait &#224; la
veille de l'&#233;mergence d'une nouvelle identit&#233; europ&#233;enne
caract&#233;ris&#233;e par une entit&#233; plus compacte, celle de l'Union
Economique et Mon&#233;taire avec une monnaie commune et une politique de
s&#233;curit&#233; commune. Cette entit&#233; aurait encore besoin des ACP pour
renforcer la monnaie unique europ&#233;enne en participant &#224; une sorte de
"Zone ECU", ce qui permettrait aux deux parties d'affronter plus efficacement la
comp&#233;tition avec d'autres blocs r&#233;gionaux. Et il a sugg&#233;r&#233; en
dernier lieu qu'un "Comit&#233; des Sages" soit mis sur pied dans un bref
d&#233;lai, et qui aurait  &#224; pr&#233;parer le Sommet des Chefs d'Etat ACP
propos&#233; par son Premier ministre &#224; l'ouverture du Conseil des ministres
ACP qui venait de se d&#233;rouler en marge de la signature. 
<p>
<A NAME="eff"><h3>Une efficacit&#233; mise en doute</h3></A>

     La c&#233;r&#233;monie de signature &#224; Maurice a marqu&#233; la fin
de la 20&#232;me session minist&#233;rielle conjointe ACP-UE r&#233;unie les 3 et
4 novembre 1995, qui elle-m&ecirc;me avait suivi la soixante-deuxi&#232;me session
du Conseil des ministres ACP ouverte le 1er novembre. Plus que dans son
intervention &#224; la c&#233;r&#233;monie de signature, c'est &#224; l'ouverture
de cette session que le Premier ministre de Maurice avait pr&#233;sent&#233; son
analyse de la coop&#233;ration et fait part de sa proposition d'un Sommet ACP pour
pr&#233;parer le futur de la Convention, une id&#233;e compl&#233;t&#233;e par
apr&#232;s de celle d'un Sommet ACP-UE. Les repr&#233;sentants de la
Communaut&#233; europ&#233;enne, le pr&#233;sident du Conseil, Javier Solana,
et le Commissaire, Jo&#227;o De Deus Pinheiro, tout en ne pouvant pas s'engager
avant qu'une d&#233;cision officielle ne soit prise, ont salu&#233; positivement cette
id&#233;e, d'autant qu'elle venait en &#233;cho &#224; l'appel &#224; la
r&#233;flexion de celui-ci pour l'apr&#232;s Lom&#233; IV. Ce qui a amen&#233; Sir
Anerood Jugnauth &#224; faire sa proposition, est son analyse de la perception
europ&#233;enne de la coop&#233;ration. Une nouvelle philosophie de partage de
responsabilit&#233; quant au d&#233;veloppement a remplac&#233; le "sentiment
de culpabilit&#233; des anciennes puissances coloniales". La philosophie du
d&#233;veloppement des pays pauvres, leur culture et leur pratique politique  sont
d&#233;sormais stigmatis&#233;es comme la cause essentielle de leurs
probl&#232;mes. C'est que beaucoup de pays europ&#233;ens ne croient plus en
l'efficacit&#233; de la coop&#233;ration ACP-UE et que leurs int&#233;r&ecirc;ts se
tournent vers l'Europe de l'Est, la M&#233;diterran&#233;e et les pays du Maghreb.
Tant et si bien que l'Union europ&#233;enne a adopt&#233; l'ann&#233;e
derni&#232;re une approche int&#233;gr&#233;e de ses strat&#233;gies vis-&#224;-
vis de ces seules r&#233;gions, sans y associer les ACP. "This is not a good sign"
se pr&#233;occupe-t-il. Les pays ACP devraient, ajoute-t-il d&#233;cupler leurs
efforts de d&#233;veloppement afin de pr&#233;venir les cons&#233;quences du repli
sur soi et des politiques nationalistes grandissant dans l'Union europ&#233;enne. Les
n&#233;gociations pour la r&#233;vision ont montr&#233; &#224; suffisance que
l'Union a chang&#233; assez pour subordonner son aide au d&#233;veloppement
&#224; des consid&#233;rations purement politiques. Mais elles ont aussi
montr&#233; que les ACP ont m&ucirc;ri assez pour accepter cette nouvelle donne
de mani&#232;re r&#233;solue, a-t-il conclu. 
<p>
     Les &#233;changes de vue en coulisse font mention de l'ann&#233;e 96 pour
le Sommet ACP et de 1997 pour le Sommet ACP-UE qui devrait d&#233;finir la
coop&#233;ration ACP-UE &#224; l'horizon du prochain mill&#233;naire. Mais la
p&#233;rip&#233;tie de la d&#233;signation rat&#233;e du Secr&#233;taire
g&#233;n&#233;ral des ACP qui a assombri la fin du Conseil ACP de Maurice n'est
pas pour faciliter ce travail de r&#233;flexion. Le renvoi en trois fois de cette
d&#233;signation fragilise le bloc ACP amen&#233; &#224; fonctionner depuis une
p&#233;riode de plus d'un an, et probablement encore pour au moins six mois,
jusqu'au prochain conseil  au Samoa occidental, sans responsable attitr&#233;
&#224; sa t&ecirc;te. Trois tours de scrutin durant cette p&#233;riode n'ont pas pu
d&#233;partager le candidat du Zimbabwe, Tobias Mapuranga, et celui du Gabon
Marcel Ibinga. Et encore &#224; Maurice, malgr&#233; la prolongation du Conseil
ACP au 5 novembre, alors qu'il aurait d&ucirc; se boucler le 2 novembre, cet
&#233;pineux probl&#232;me n'a pas &#233;t&#233; r&#233;solu. Les 39 voix
obtenues par le candidat zimbabw&#233;en, contre 22 pour le second, sont
insuffisantes ; il lui fallait les deux tiers des suffrages. Le Conseil s'est born&#233;
&#224; rejeter d&#233;sormais les deux candidatures  et &#224; appeler les deux
r&#233;gions, l'Afrique Australe et l'Afrique centrale, &#224; qui revient le poste
actuellement d'apr&#232;s un syst&#232;me de rotation, de proposer un nouveau
nom.
<p>
<A NAME="mes"><h3>Mesures d'urgence</h3></A>

     Parmi les points importants &#224; l'ordre du jour du Conseil des ministres
ACP-UE figuraient les mesures transitoires applicables &#224; partir du 1er mars
1995 marquant l'expiration du protocole financier li&#233; &#224; la premi&#232;re
phase de Lom&#233; IV, ceci pour &#233;viter un vide en attendant la ratification de
la Convention par les Etats signataires. Ce Conseil devait aussi ent&#233;riner un
protocole &#224; la Convention relatif &#224; l'adh&#233;sion de l'Autriche, de la
Finlande et de la Su&#232;de &#224; l'Union europ&#233;enne et adopter  aussi des
mesures provisoires en attendant la ratification de ce protocole. En ce qui concerne
la mise en oeuvre anticip&#233;e des dispositions de la Convention
r&#233;vis&#233;e, le conseil des ministres ACP-UE a d&#233;l&#233;gu&#233; ses
comp&#233;tences au Comit&#233; des Ambassadeurs ACP-UE qui d&#233;finira
dans les d&#233;tails les mesures &#224; prendre.
<p>
     En plus de ces points concernant tr&#232;s directement la signature de la
convention, de nombreuses autres questions &#233;taient &#224; l'ordre du jour.
Parmi lesquelles, la r&#233;vision de la liste des pays les moins avanc&#233;s (45
au total), sur laquelle &#233;taient apparus des d&#233;saccords entre les deux
parties. Le Conseil ACP-UE de mai 1994 avait d&#233;cid&#233; d'adapter cette liste
aux crit&#232;res des Nations Unies. Ainsi, 11 pays ACP, essentiellement de la
Cara&iuml;be et du Pacifique, dont les revenus annuels d&#233;passent 200 dollars
par t&ecirc;te d'habitant devaient en &ecirc;tre exclus, ce qui les priveraient d'une
s&#233;rie d'aides particuli&#232;res de la CE, et cinq devaient s'y ajouter (Angola,
Lib&#233;ria, Madagascar, Za&iuml;re, Zambie). Tenant compte des
d&#233;savantages qu'entra&icirc;ne la sortie de la liste des onze pays, surtout de
B&#233;lize qui b&#233;n&#233;ficiait jusque l&#224; d'aide sp&#233;ciale &#224;
destination des "pays enclav&#233;s et insulaires", l'Union europ&#233;enne s'est
engag&#233;e &#224; accorder &#224; certains d'entre eux des compensations dont
les mesures pratiques seront d&#233;finies par le Comit&#233; des Ambassadeurs
ACP-UE et pr&#233;sent&#233;es au Conseil ACP-UE de mai 1996. Sur un autre
plan, le Comit&#233; des Ambassadeurs est aussi charg&#233; d'&#233;tudier le cas
de la Somalie qui n'a jamais pu profiter du 7&#232;me FED, n'ayant pas ratifi&#233;
la Convention de Lom&#233;. l'Assembl&#233;e paritaire ACP-UE avait
demand&#233; au Conseil de prendre les mesures pour corriger cet &#233;tat de
chose.
<p>
     Diff&#233;rents points relatifs &#224; la coop&#233;ration commerciale
&#233;taient aussi inclus dans l'ordre du jour. Ils concernaient des denr&#233;es
agricoles comme la banane, le rhum, le sucre et le cacao et aussi le Stabex. Les
pays ACP ont fait part de leur demande du maintien, apr&#232;s
l'&#233;largissement &#224; quinze de l'Union europ&#233;enne, du quota de 30 %
de bananes sur le march&#233; communautaire. Aux pr&#233;occupations des pays
ACP producteurs  &#224; propos d'une &#233;ventuelle directive europ&#233;enne
autorisant l'utilisation de 5% de beurre v&#233;g&#233;tal autre que celui du cacao
dans le chocolat, les repr&#233;sentants de l'Union ont donn&#233; la garantie
qu'une pareille d&#233;cision n'est pas projet&#233;e. Sur les questions de politique,
en plus de la r&#233;clamation du Soudan du d&#233;blocage de ses transferts
Stabex &#224; laquelle les repr&#233;sentants de l'UE ont oppos&#233; une fin de
non recevoir tant que des progr&#232;s n'auront pas &#233;t&#233; enregistr&#233;
dans ce pays sur le plan de la d&#233;mocratie, ceux-ci ont r&#233;serv&#233; la
m&ecirc;me r&#233;ponse au Za&iuml;re qui avait sollicit&#233; un d&#233;gel de
la coop&#233;ration avec une dizaine de pays ACP dont il fait partie.
<p>
<A NAME="mau"><h3>Maurice, ou le choix d'une vitrine</h3></A>

     La c&#233;r&#233;monie de signature de la Convention de Lom&#233; a eu
lieu &#224; Maurice alors que jusque l&#224;, elle s'&#233;tait toujours
d&#233;roul&#233;e dans la capitale togolaise. Le choix du lieu  ne pouvait &ecirc;tre
plus symbolique de l'&#233;v&#233;nement. Le calme de cette &icirc;le des
Mascareignes et en m&ecirc;me temps son nouveau dynamisme qui en fait l'un des
pays en train de sortir effectivement du sous-d&#233;veloppement, se pr&ecirc;taient
bien &#224; une c&#233;r&#233;monie qui se voulait modeste, ne marquant qu'une
simple r&#233;vision, mais importante par les modifications introduites, surtout dans
le nouvel &#233;tat d'esprit de la coop&#233;ration Europe -ACP
r&#233;v&#233;l&#233; par les  n&#233;gociations.
<p>
     Le ma&icirc;tre-mot de la version r&#233;vis&#233;e de la Convention de
Lom&#233; est l'efficacit&#233;. Les c&#233;r&#233;monies qui se sont
d&#233;roul&#233;es &#224; Maurice  semblaient avoir fait option de cette
efficacit&#233;, du rejet du gaspillage, sans pour cela &ecirc;tre spartiate.
C'&#233;tait la f&ecirc;te, sans les fastes. On &#233;tait loin des flonflons de
Lom&#233;. Pas de palais tout neuf, ni d'arc de triomphe, ni de nouveaux
tron&#231;ons routiers, et de beaux h&ocirc;tels &#233;rig&#233;s pour la
circonstance. La signature, et les Conseils ACP et ACP-UE, de m&ecirc;me que la
plupart des manifestations annexes se sont d&#233;roul&#233;s sur le campus de
l'Universit&#233;, dans le charme discret de la petite ville de R&#233;duit et &#224;
l'auditorium du Mahatma Ghandi Institute. Les r&#233;ceptions et les activit&#233;s 
culturelles, &#224; l'image d'une &icirc;le qui a fait le choix, rare dans beaucoup de
PVD de la d&#233;centralisation, s'&#233;taient organis&#233;es un peu partout sur
l'&icirc;le, &#224; Port-Louis, Rempart, Curepipe, Vacoas, ou ailleurs.
<p>
     Seuls le site de l'Universit&#233; o&ugrave; se sont tenus les conseils,
l'entr&#233;e du Mahatma Ghandi Institute, et de rares autres lieux &#233;taient 
d&#233;cor&#233;s, souvent discr&#232;tement, et rien qu'avec des drapeaux de
Maurice, les &#233;tendards des autres pays ne sont apparus que pour accompagner
les signataires au moment de la c&#233;r&#233;monie officielle, quelques secondes
pour chacun d'entre eux. Le pays h&ocirc;te ne boudait pas pour autant son plaisir,
l'efficacit&#233; du comit&#233; d'organisation, la chaleur et la sympathie familiale
de l'accueil qui ont s&#233;duit tous les visiteurs, montraient bien l'int&#233;r&ecirc;t
qu'il y pla&#231;ait. C'&#233;tait l'image d'un pays, d'une d&#233;mocratie qui
continuait &#224; fonctionner, malgr&#233; les c&#233;l&#233;brations, avec ses
heurs et malheurs. Une crise gouvernementale pointait &#224; l'horizon, qui allait
&#233;clater d&#232;s les derniers invit&#233;s partis. Cela n'a en rien
perturb&#233; le bon d&#233;roulement de toutes les manifestations de la semaine.
La gestion sereine d'une crise politique est certainement un bon barom&#232;tre du
niveau de d&#233;veloppement d&#233;mocratique d'un pays.
<p>
     Si Maurice n'avait pas &#233;t&#233; choisi comme vitrine de la Convention,
la plupart les commentateurs n'ont pas manqu&#233; de le consid&#233;rer comme
tel et de rappeler comment &#224; partir d'une bonne utilisation du protocole surcre
de la convention, ce petit pays a r&#233;alis&#233; d'abord une diversification
agricole, tout en maintenant et m&ecirc;me d&#233;veloppant la production du sucre
au point d'obtenir r&#233;cemment une augmentation sensible de son quota
d'importation sur le march&#233; europ&#233;en. Dans un deuxi&#232;me temps,
la diversification s'est &#233;largie vers les services et la petite industrie et
maintenant, le pays est en train d'initier une diversification vers des produits de haute
technologie comme les services informatiques. Le podium qui recevait les officiels
&#224; la c&#233;r&#233;monie de signature de Lom&#233; IV bis &#233;tait tout
pourpr&#233; de bouquets d'anthuriums. Quand Maurice avait d&#233;cid&#233;
d'utiliser les revenus engendr&#233;s par le protocole sucre de Lom&#233; pour
diversifier sa production agfricole, son choix s'&#233;tait d'abord port&#233; sur les
fleurs au point de devenir apr&#232;s peu de temps le deuxi&#232;me exportateur
mondial  d'anthuriums. Du succ&#232;s et des fleurs. La convention
r&#233;vis&#233;e pourrait-elle trouver de meilleurs symboles ?

<P
<B>The Maastricht Treaty for the first time puts the development
policy of the European Union on a firm legal basis. It requires
coordination with the development policies of the member states
and coherence with other union policies. Since the expenditure
of the EU and the member states together make up 40 per cent of
the funds allocated worldwide, the further development of European
development cooperation assumes considerable importance.</B>
<P>
The European development policy grew out of the need not to cut
off from their &quot;mother countries&quot; the areas dependent
on the European colonial states through the formation of the European
Economic Community in 1958. The &quot;association&quot; provided
by the Treaties of Rome in principle gave goods from the associated
countries customs free access to the EEC. As a complement to this
the European Development Fund (EDF) was set up which to this day
is financed directly by the member states(and not out of the EU
budget). After the association partners gained their independence
in the early 60s, continuation of the special relationship was
agreed, first in the Yaound&eacute; Convention (1963 and 1969)
and, after Britain's accession to the EEC in 1973, in the Lom&eacute;
Conventions (from 1975). The cooperation practised under these
agreements with meanwhile 69 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)
states represents the core of the EU development policy and is
regarded internationally as the model for North-South cooperation.
The positive assessment of the Lom&eacute; cooperation rests on
the following characteristics:
<P>
<ul>
<li><B>Contract nature: </B>The agreement lays down in a form
binding on both sides both the joint aims of the cooperation and
the rights and duties of the contracting parties.
<li><B>Durability: </B>The agreements run for several years
(hitherto five, since Lom&eacute; IV 10 years), making cooperation
calculable.
<li><B>Supranationality: </B>As agreements between regions
they overcome bilateralism and make possible a certain independence
of national interests.
<li><B>Continuous dialogue: </B>Negotiation, planning, programming
and control of the development cooperation are done by bodies
with equal representation: the ACP-EU Council of Ministers, the
ACP-EU Committee of Ambassadors and the Joint Assembly.
<li><B>Broad cooperation approach: </B>Beside the usual projects
and programmes of financial and technical cooperation the  Lom&eacute;
Convention encompasses trading  advantages, commodity policy measures
 (STABEX, SYSMIN) and since Lom&eacute; IV  measures to support
structural adjustment  efforts.
<li><B>High grant proportion: </B>The grant  element of the
sixth EDF amounted to 75 per  cent. Since Lom&eacute; IV, with
the exception of the  European Investment Bank (EIB), all loans
 given are non repayable. The grant element of  the present EDF
is 92 per cent.
<li><B>Above average benefits for the least  developed countries
</B>(LDC): 40 per cent of  the Official Development Aid disbursements
of  the EU go to LDCs compared with an average  of 25 per cent
of the corresponding share of  all OECD countries.</ul>
<P>
Parallel to the Lom&eacute; Convention the EC over  time took
on additional development policy  tasks. The food aid in the beginning
was not  very development oriented but simply grew  out of the
surplus production of the European  Community.
<P>
Another regional focus of the EC  development policy became cooperation
with  Mediterranean countries that are not in the EU.  On the
basis of the &quot;Global approach to  Mediterranean policy&quot;
cooperation  agreements of indefinite duration were  reached with
individual countries in the  1970s. Budget funds and EIB loans
are made  available within the framework of finance  protocols,
each of five years duration. As a  &quot;strategic response&quot;
to the economic and  demographic development in the  Mediterranean
region the EC in the early 90s  formulated a &quot;new Mediterranean
policy&quot;  providing for intensified cooperation.

<p>
Although cooperation with further  developing countries was expanded,
it fell far  short of the countries' expectations (see  Table
2). Cooperation agreements were  reached especially in the 80s
with a great  many countries and regional organisations of  Asia
and Latin America but they do not include  pledges of financial
aid. Funds annually made  available by the EU &quot;autonomously&quot;
from the  budget, i.e. without a contractual basis, are  reserved
especially for the poorest  developing countries.
<P>
Cooperation with eastern Europe began in  the late 80s. The association
and &quot;Europe&quot;  agreements concluded in 1988 and 1989
first  with Poland and Hungary, then with all  countries of eastern
Europe and the former  Soviet Union, offer a legal framework for
 cooperation and trade. In addition, within the  framework of
the PHARE and TACIS technical  aid programmes funds are made available
 which taken together will considerably  exceed those set aside
by the 7th EDF for the  69 ACP states.
<P>
EU development policy assumes an  altogether new dimension in
the context of  growing europeanisation. The treaty on  European
Union decided in Maastricht in 1991  for the first time encodes
development policy  as a sector of policy in its own right (Title
 XVII, Article 130uy). The treaty demands a  development policy
coordinated between the  member states and the EU and coherent
with  other fields of policy. The coordination command (Art. 130x)
raises hope for  administrative simplifications, synergy gains,
 reduction in bilateral dependencies and  possibly the abandonment
of supply tying.
<P>
Systematisation and improved coordination  is planned at following
levels:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Policy coordination (elaboration of joint  sectoral and
regional concepts which are also  binding for the bilateral development
policies);
<li>operational coordination (sectoral and  country specific);
<li>coordinated cooperation with other bilateral  and multilateral
donors and in international  bodies;
<li>coherence (coordination of development  policy with other
EU policies).</ul>
<P>
How the coherence command, which is  also laid down in Article
130v of the  Maastricht Treaty, is to be met is still unclear.
 The council of the development ministers  charged the Commission
in November 1992 to  elaborate proposals by November 1993 on 
how the effects of other EU policies on  developing countries
can be systematically  monitored. Approaches to this might be
<P>
<ul>
<li>that the Commission proposals of all general  directorates
would have to be countersigned  by the General Directorate (GD)
I and/or GD  Vll,
<li>that all EU directives would have to show the  impact of
the measures on developing  countries, analogous to the obligatory
&quot;fiches  financiers&quot; in which financial effects are
 outlined.</ul>
<P>
<B>Aims</B>
<P>
The aims to which the Treaty on European  Union (Article 130u)
obligates the EU  development policy are
<P>
<ul>
<li>sustainable economic and social  development of the developing
countries,  especially the most disadvantaged ones,
<li>harmonious, gradual integration of the  developing countries
into the world economy,
<li>fighting poverty in the developing countries,
<li>further development and strengthening of  democracy and
the rule of law,
<li>observance of human rights and  fundamental freedoms.</ul>
<P>
In a concept paper presented by the  Commission in 1992, adopted
only as a  &quot;declaration&quot; rather than the usual &quot;decision&quot;
 by the Council <a href="#1">(1)</a>, the aims are operationalised.  Accordingly,
sustainable and economic  development is to be achieved by &quot;a
 consistent drive to liberalise domestic  economic activity&quot;.
Sustainability is not defined  more closely and generally the
outcome of the  United Nations Conference on Environment  and
Development (UNCED, Rio de Janeiro  1992) is not taken into account.
Positive,on the  other hand, is that the &quot;Horizon 2000&quot;
paper  suggests complementing the economic criteria  of allocation
of development cooperation  inputs with efficiency criteria and
calls for a  solidarity pact between Africa and the Union.
<P>
<B>Scale of EU aid</B>
<P>
In financial volume the development  cooperation of the EU is
about the same as  that of a medium donor. The expenditures of
 the EU listed in Table 1 comprise  approximately equal parts
of expenditures  from the EDF (Lom&eacute; cooperation) and from
the  EU budget.
<P>
The Maastricht Treaty reaffirms the 0.7 per  cent aid target of
the member states and the  EU (Articles 130 u Paragraph 3) which
 currently only few member states reach and  the EU as a whole
does not. With regard to  the development cooperation funds controlled
 by the Commission, no increases are to be  expected in the near
future; the 1993 budget  allocations for development cooperation
were  11 per cent lower than those of 1992 and  there is little
likelihood that the 8th EDF will  show increments of the nominally
50 per cent  that have been usual.
<P>
The importance of EU development aid  nonetheless becomes clear
when one adds  up the expenditures of the EU and the member  states,
which are to be increasingly  harmonised. With a share of 40 per
cent of  the ODA given worldwide, the EU is then by far  the biggest
donor, followed by Japan and the  USA with 17 per cent each.
<P>
<B>Organisation</B>
<P>
Depending on whether it is EU development  cooperation or cooperation
under the EC-ACP  Lom&eacute; Convention various institutions,
powers  and procedures are involved in the EU  development policy.
The major players in both  cases are the`member states which decide
 on EU development policy in the Council and in  the committees.
The &quot;Development Council&quot;  (the development ministers
of the 12 member  states) convenes twice a year and makes the
 fundamental decisions about the development  policy of the EU.
In the six committees in  which the member states are represented
at  working level the projects and programmes of  the EU are approved
by qualified majority.
<P>
The Commission, comprising the  commissioners and the general
directorates,  forms the executive. Its key functions  comprise
the right to propose, the elaboration  of strategies and concepts
and the  implementation of EU development policy.
<P>
Responsible for the development  cooperation are Commissioner
Manuel Marin  (responsible since 1993 for the development  cooperation
with all developing countries) and  the general directorates I
and VII. General  Directorate I (&quot;Foreign Relations&quot;)
in addition to  general foreign policy is responsible for  North-South
relations, Mediterranean policy  and relations to Asia and Latin
America; the  General Directorate Vl11 (&quot;Development&quot;)
for  the Lom&eacute; cooperation. In addition the GD VII  administers
food aid for all regions, immediate  aid and co funding of NGO
projects.
<P>
In contrast to most bilateral donors the EU  has no implementing
organisations of its own;  implementation of projects and programmes
is  contracted out to consulting firms and  nongovernmental organisations.
In the  developing countries the &quot;Delegate&quot;  represents
the EU in all development  cooperation matters.
<P>
Of little importance in the area of  development cooperation is
the European  Parliament which has no lawmaking power.  In the
Lom&eacute; cooperation sector it may merely  ratify the convention
and in the communal  development cooperation it may merely set
 down the budget framework. The main  controlling function is
exercised by the  European Audit Office which draws up annual reports
about the development policy of the EU.
<P>
Although the EU's development cooperation  has always had and
continues to have flaws,  overall appraisal has to be positive.
It has  brought forth original instruments (export  earnings stabilisation,
promotion of regional  cooperation, etc.) and exemplary procedures
 (institutionalised dialogue, contractual pledges  of development
cooperation) which were  developed further in the light of the
 experiences and insights of three  development decades.
<P>
The biggest flaw in EU development policy  is the unequal treatment
of the various  regions of developing countries. As  development
policies will be conducted jointly  in the EU, it will be important
to &quot;globalise&quot;  development policy, i. e. to transfer
the Lom&eacute;  experience to the development cooperation  with
Asia, Latin America and the  Mediterranean developing countries.
<P>
<B>Outlook</B>
<P>
The 7th EDF ends on 28 February 1995.  Before negotiations on
replenishment of EDF 8  start in 1994 the contracting parties
will have  to name the regulations of the agreement they  want
worked over. Everything indicates that  the EU and the member
states are taking the  half time appraisal of Lom&eacute; IV seriously.
Now  that the &quot;Father of the Lom&eacute; treaties&quot;,
Dieter  Frisch, has left as general director for  development,
the responsible Commissioner  Marin has announced a&quot;modernisation&quot;
of the  Lom&eacute; cooperation. One can presumably take  that
to mean that the allocation of funds is to  be made flexible and
that overall the  development cooperation is to be made more 
conditional. If &quot;modernisation&quot; leads to more  emphasis
to observance of human rights,  reduction of military spending
and &quot;good  governance&quot;  as the Council declared in 
November 1992  this has to be welcomed  and is in fact long overdue.
But if greater  emphasis on these aspects primarily serves  as
a pretext to legitimise cutting development  aid, the credibility
of the EU will be at stake.  How could the EU demand far reaching
 adjustment efforts from the developing  countries without even
coming close to  fulfillment of its own promises  reaching the
 0.7 per cent target, more  environmentally friendly methods of
 production, etc.? The dialogue structures of  the Lom&eacute;
cooperation shouldn't be  circumvented but, on the contrary, used
more.

<b>
As yet another milestone in ACP-EU relations is reached - with the signing of
the agreement in Mauritius revising the fourth Lom&#233; Convention - we need
to pause and reflect on the ground that has been covered over the years. When
Lom&#233; I was concluded in February 1975, few would have anticipated that
the Convention would continue for more than two decades, let alone become
the finest and the most complete instrument of North-South cooperation ever.
At that time, 46 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states and the nine
member countries of the European Community (EC) gathered in the Togolese
capital to sign the document after several months of negotiations.</b>
<p>
Four years into its implementation, and despite benefiting from the experience of the
two earlier Yaound&#233; Conventions, the ACP States wanted the five-year
agreement scrapped and a completely new one drawn up. The European Community,
on the other hand, preferred to adjust and update it. The two sides met half way and
established the tradition of tough and thorough renegotiations and of compromise.
The principles of equal partnership and respect for the sovereignty of the ACP states
were also recognised.
<p>
<H3>Adapting to changing trends</h3>

Over the past 20 years, the Lom&#233; Convention has built on and consolidated
what has been achieved in previous agreements. It has, of course, been influenced
by trends in political and economic thinking, the balance of power and the situation
generally in the international scene. Thus, world economic recession, deteriorating
terms of trade for the developing countries, the Uruguay Round negotiations, the
collapse of the Iron Curtain and the completion of European internal market have all
contributed to making the Lom&#233; Convention the unique and all-embracing
multilateral instrument of cooperation that it is today. Each ACP state - whatever its
economic and physical condition, whether it is least developed, landlocked or insular -
 has something special for it in the Convention.
<p>
Lom&#233; II (1980-1985), which was signed by 58 ACP countries and nine member
states of the European Community, saw, among other things, the range of products
covered under the system of export stabilisation (Stabex) considerably expanded and
support given to the mining sector (Sysmin). Although not inscribed in that
Convention, human rights and investment guarantees - on which the ACPs were
reticent - began to emerge as major issues in ACP-EC relations. By December 1984,
when Lom&#233; III (1986-1991) was concluded, these subjects had found their way
into the agreement. The number of ACP states had increased to 65 and European
Community now had ten members. Lom&#233; III also saw the concept of policy
dialogue introduced. Food security and food self-sufficiency as well as the
development of services such as tourism and maritime transport were emphasised.
<p>
<h3>Growing membership</h3>

The growth in the membership of the Convention illustrates its continuing
attractiveness. When Lom&#233; IV was signed in December 1989, the number of
ACP and EC signatories had grown to 68 and 12 respectively. Today there are 70
ACPs and 15 members of the European Union (the European Community having
meanwhile become a Union following the completion of the internal market and the
signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992).
<p>
      Lom&#233; IV was different from its predecessors in being given a ten-year
duration (1991-2000), although the financial protocol was for five years. Provision was
made in the agreement, however, for the possibility of a 'mid-term review', coinciding
with the negotiations on the second financial protocol. The Convention was agreed
at a time of rapid and dramatic political changes in Eastern Europe - changes which
were to have a significant impact on the global political balance. Structural
adjustment, as espoused by the Bretton Woods institutions, was also becoming the
order of the day in economic management in many developing countries. The latter
was, not surprisingly, included in Lom&#233; IV but with an important social
dimension.
<p>
      The negotiations for the second financial protocol provided opportunities to
enrich the Convention further with provisions on democracy, good governance and
human rights. These reflect the modern consensus that genuine and sustainable 
development can only take place in a liberalised environment, both political or
economic.
<p>
      As far as the ACP states are concerned, the amount of development
assistance on offer under the Lom&#233; Conventions has always been less than
hoped for. Despite this, each new agreement saw an increase in real terms in the
financial resources made available. The second financial protocol of Lom&#233; IV
is an exception. This time, the funding has not gone up in real terms although the
nominal amount has risen by 22% in line with inflation.
<p>
      Because it is contractual, the Lom&#233; Convention has provided ACP states,
during the past 20 years with a partnership characterised by security and reliability.
Nonetheless, it was recognised during the signing ceremony of Lom&#233; IV in 1989
that the re-emergence of Eastern Europe into the free world would lead to increased
competition for international aid.
<p>
      While the ACP states and European Union ponder the future of their
relationship after the year 2000, in signing the revised Lom&#233; Convention in
Mauritius, they have reaffirmed what the aim of the link has always been - merely to
contribute to development. Mauritius is recognised as a showcase of the Convention.
Ultimately, the destinies of the ACP states are in their own hands.
<p>
<h3>Four decades of partnership</h3>

Although the ACP group only came into being at the time of the first Lom&#233;
Convention in 1975, cooperation between the European Community (now the Union),
and countries with which they had special relations in sub-Saharan Africa, the
Caribbean and the Pacific, dates back to 1957. This was when the Treaty establishing
the European Economic Community was concluded. The evolution of the relationship
is charted below.

Lom&#233; Review Heightens ACP Concerns</h2>
<p>
<h4>Full text of an article from the <i>ECDPM Programme Highlights 1995</i>: page
4</h4>
</center>
<hr>
Under the Lom&#233; Convention, the European Union provides the most generous
preferential access to markets offered anywhere in the world. It's also one of the largest aid
programmes in the world. Its days seem to be numbered.
<p>
Questions were being asked before the mid-term review of Lom&#233; IV began late last
year. But the quibbling that took place during the review, changes which were made to the
pact, and the decision of EU Member States not to increase funding to ACP countries in real
terms underscore the fact that major innovations must be made if there is to be a Lom&#233;
V.
<p>
Few concessions were made to the ACP side during the re-appraisal of the 20-year-old
Convention, an aid and trade package between Europe and 70 sub-Saharan African,
Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries including 40 of the world's poorest nations. Although
Europe agreed to some compromises after the funding deal was finalised, many from ACP
countries expressed disappointment about the outcome of the review. 
<p>
<h3>ACP Disappointed and Relieved</h3>
"Of course we're disappointed. It's not adequate," former Zambian ambassador Kapembe
Nsingo said of the funding package. "Given the accession of the new members (Finland,
Sweden and Austria), they should have augmented the total envelope."
<p>
Disappointment was coupled with relief, however, since at certain points during the
negotiations ACP countries were uncertain whether the review would produce any kind of
agreement.
<p>
"At one point ... it did look as though we were not going to have a conclusion to the matter
and, furthermore, hanging over it was the threat of substantial reductions in the envelope,"
noted Carl Greenidge, interim Secretary General of the ACP Group in Brussels and ECDPM
Board Member. "We were relieved and most appreciative of the contributions of EU
countries, especially France, to getting the matter resolved."
<p>
Over the coming five years, ACP countries will receive 14.965 billion ECU from Europe;
this is a 23.3 percent increase over funding during the first protocol (1990-95). Of this
amount, Member States contributed 12.8 billion ECU (compared with 10.9 billion ECU
under the first protocol). This may sound impressive on first glance. In real terms, however,
it represents a drop in aid.
<p>
That disappointed ACP countries, which hoped for 15.8 billion ECU, mainly to improve
processing, marketing, transformation and distribution of produce so that ACP states can hold
their own in a competitive EU market.
<p>
As Greenidge pointed out, however, the ACP is in a weak bartering position because Europe
now has a surplus in the commodities provided by the group. Furthermore, with the end of
the Cold War, the priorities of Western Europe in general and Germany in particular have
changed. 
<p>
<h3>More Control for the EU</h3>
Although the overriding concern for ACP countries is the level of Lom&#233; funding, they
also are worried about Europe's effort to exert more leverage and control over its partners.
But, as Greenidge acknowledged, "The group is relatively clear on the question of
conditionality; some degree of conditionality is inevitable."
<p>
The shift towards greater European control is manifested in changes to the Convention. These
cause many to question whether Lom&#233; is still a unique partnership, or just another aid
programme where the donor sits in the driver's seat.
<p>
The review, itself opposed by the ACP states, occurred because Europe wants to see more
value for its money. It decided that the best way to achieve this was to link the allocation of
funds more closely to performance. Countries which perform well - according to European
standards, though no one is quite sure how performance will be evaluated - will receive more
money.
<p>
Also, instead of granting a fixed amount of money for a five-year period and giving
recipients a relatively free hand in using the funds, entitlements will be for three years and
recipients must absorb 70 percent of the total funds that have been allocated. If the recipient
fails to do so, the funds may be re-allocated. Although some ACP countries argue that this
condition abrogates the basic principles of partnership, Greenidge disagrees.
<p>
The condition doesn't nullify the partnership, he said. "It leaves in the hands of the
Commission - and, more specifically, the desk officers of the Commission - an undesirable
degree of discretion in the allocation of funds," he explained. "But the matter of
implementation has been raised with the Community and hopefully during the initial period
we will be able to agree what objective criteria will be used in this phasing of disbursements
and determining whether a second disbursement is appropriate."
<p>
<h3>Greater Emphasis on EU Priorities</h3>
Some ACP countries also believe that Europe is linking performance too closely with
political issues such as human rights. Indeed, one of the most significant changes made
during the review was the introduction of a human rights "suspension clause" in Article 366
of the Convention. This states that if any of the essential human rights specified in Article
5 are violated, development aid can be suspended partially or completely. However, as a
concession to the ACP, the EU agreed that this can only happen after a joint ACP-EU
consultation and decision-making process.
<p>
Another change is that the Commission will now take greater responsibility in preparing
projects. It will appraise projects single-handedly but will collaborate with recipients to draft
project proposals (in the past, recipient countries did this themselves). Not unexpectedly, this
is also a concern of the ACP countries.
<p>
"We are not opposed to them looking at projects, but it concerns us that the Commission will
only fund projects it looks favourably on," Greenidge said, adding: "There is a tendency in
some situations to pursue projects in which it has an interest."
<p>
During the review, the EU signalled that it would begin to press harder for ACP countries
to take note of donor priorities when seeking funds. Among the areas identified as needing
particular attention are education, health and training, which Commission officials believe
are central to the economic development of ACP countries. The issue is sensitive, and ACP
countries have resisted what they see as EU efforts to dictate aid policy.
<p>
Nevertheless, by the end of the mid-term review, ACP countries decided that it was not
unreasonable for the Convention to reflect the priorities of both themselves and Europe.
"That is the way [the document] is worded," said Greenidge. "At the end of the day, the
group has been able to have the proposals modified in a way that is more tolerable than the
original proposals would have been. The package wasn't thrust down our throat; it's
something we have negotiated."

<P>
The processes leading to increased economic integration and closer
political union in Europe are redefining the relationship between
the European Union and the Caribbean. In respect of the Single
European Market the Caribbean is provided with an opportunity
to develop new products and services for sale in the European
Union as at the same time it is faced with serious threats to
the future viability of its traditional trade, particularly in
bananas. The Maastricht Treaty is also having a contradictory
effect, dissolving differences between different parts of
the Caribbean in relation to the European Union on issues such
as immigration, drug trafficking and development policy while
widening them on others such as citizenship and social issues.
The net effect of these changes is an erosion of traditional bilateral
relations in respect of Europe's relation with the Caribbean and
the accentuation of differences of interest within the Caribbean
as regards its economic and political interests in Europe. The
Caribbean must recognise these changes in negotiating a new relationship
with the European Union once the Lom&eacute; Convention expires
in the year 2000.
<P>
Los procesos que conducen hacia una creciente integraci&oacute;n
econ&oacute;mica y una uni&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica m&aacute;s
estrecha en Europa est&aacute;n redifiniendo las relaciones entre
la Uni&#243;n Europea y el Caribe. En el marco del Mercado Unico Europeo,
el Caribe cuenta con la oportunidad de desarrollar nuevos productos
y servicios destinados a la venta en la Uni&oacute;n Europea a
la vez que enfrenta series amenazas a la viabilidad futura de
su comercio tradicional, especialmente los pl&aacute;tanos. El
Tratado de Maastricht tiene tambi&eacute;n un efecto contradictorio,
ya que disuelve las diferencias entre las diversas partes del
Caribe y la Uni&oacute;n Europea sobre temas tales como la inmigraci&oacute;n,
el tr&aacute;fico de drogas y las politicas de desarrollo, al
mismo tiempo que aumenta las divergencias sobre otros, tales como
la ciudadan&iacute;a y algunos problemas sociales. El efecto neto
de estos cambios es una erosi&oacute;n de las relaciones bilaterales
tradicionales en el marco de las relaciones entre Europa y el
Caribe, y una acentuaci&oacute;n de las diferencias de intereses
en el Caribe mismo con respecto a sus intereses econ&oacute;micos
y politicos en Europa. El Caribe debe reconocer estos cambios
en el momento de renegociar su nueva relaci&oacute;n con la Uni&oacute;n
Europea cuando expire, en el a&ntilde;o 2000, la Convenci&oacute;n
de Lom&eacute;.
<P>
<a name=intro></a><H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>
The establishment of the Single European Market (SEM) with effect
from 1 January 1993 and the creation of the European Union (EU)
with the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty in November
1993 have had the effect of reconfiguring relations within Western
Europe and reshaping its relations with the rest of the world.
One region where these developments have been viewed with particular
concern is the Caribbean which has had a dose relationship with
Europe for more than five hundred years. The foundations of this
relationship have been 'exclusive'bilateral links between the
metropolitan powers and specific Caribbean islands and enclaves
which have resulted in a host of political relationships and a
wide range of economic ties. In total, these have both bound the
Caribbean closer to Europe and privileged it in comparison to
many other developing regions. The fear in the Caribbean, quite
simply, is that the Maastricht Treaty and the SEM presages the
end of such relationships and attendant arrangements as the EU
takes on a more multilateral stance in its formulation of interests
and its promotion of economic policy.
<P>
This article examines these fears and assesses the likely consequences
of the SEM and the EU on the Caribbean in the present and future.
It finds that the immediate impact of the SEM on the Caribbean
is not that great, but that in the midterm, and especially the
longterm, the Caribbean has some cause for concern. The same conclusion
holds for the KU, with the added proviso that the Caribbean must
recognise that the spillover from closer integration in Europe
wi&uuml; increasingly call for nuanced policies from the Caribbean
to accommodate its differential effects. Accordingly it suggests
that the Caribbean should take immediate advantage of a relatively
benign shortterm to reconsider and revise its relationships with
the EU in the longer term.
<P>
<a name=single></a><H3>The Single European Market and the Developing World</H3>
<P>
The SEM has been created by the Single European Act of 1987<I>
</I>which proposed a European Community (EC) 'without internal
frontiers' by the end of December 1992. In effect, this meant
the removal of barriers to the free movement of goods, persons,
services and capital within the EC and the creation of 'new frontiers'
with the rest of the world. Questions relating to this second
dimension, however, were clearly subordinate to the first. In
the discussion in the EC on the SEM, and in the technical studies
prepared for its implementation, the focus was within Europe.
Little consideration, if any, was given to the external consequences
of the SEM. Accordingly, the best that the much cited Cecchini
Report on the benefits of the SEM could come up with was the 'guestimate'
that the SEM would increase trade by one per cent. Translated
into benefits for the developing world this was presented as a
'shot in the arm' that would rebound marginally to the advantage
of these countries and act as a stimulus for their development <a href="#1">(1)</a>.
<P>
The degree to which this may, or may not, be the case has been
the subject of several studies. One of the most persuasive was
that undertaken by Michael Davenport and Sheila Page entitled
<I>Europe: 1992 and the Developing World <a href="#2">(2)</a>.  </I>They present
an estimate of the impact of the SEM which suggests a net trade
benefit to the developing world of ECU 6,781 million<a href="#*">*</a>, or approximately
five per cent of their total exports. To this could be added an
additional ECU 1,600 million were the public procurement rules
in respect of aid relaxed to allow developing countries to buy
from the cheapest source. Although the SEM stipulates the opening
of public procurement throughout the KU, this is unlikely to happen
in the bilateral aid sector (approximately 85 per cent of all
European aid) where more than 50 per cent of aid remains tied.
<P>
Davenport and Page thus present a positive picture overall, but
they also qualify it in respect of individual countries. For example,
in respect of trade creation and diversion they note that for
many countries, particularly those engaged in manufacturing, the
gains are cancelled out by losses. They also note that whatever
scheme is adopted for bananas (and they set out several in an
appendix to their study) St Lucia and St Vincent will lose with
an attendant 'serious danger of a major political and social upheaval' <a href="#3">(3)</a>.
<P>
They also note that in many ways it is not the numbers that matter
but the wider intangible effects on investment and external relations.
They therefore argue that the opportunities presented within the
SEM has diverted investment from the developing world; and that
it is by no means clear that the EC will avoid the temptation
to impose the costs of internal adjustment within the SEM by imposing
costs outside. This could mean not only an increase in non-tariff
barriers but also a boost to thinking which sees the future of
the world trading system in terms of blocs. This last observation
has a particular resonance for the Caribbean which finds itself
uncomfortably situated between an evolving North American Free
Trade Area (NAFTA) and a consolidating EU to each of which it
needs access and from each of which it needs financili support,
if its development potential is to be maximised <a href="#4">(4)</a>.
<P>
<a name=trade></a><H3>The Caribbean and the Lom&eacute; Conventions: Trade</H3>
<P>
The framework for Caribbean trade with the EC is provided by the
Fourth Lom&eacute; Convention. This covers all the independent
Caribbean countries, except Cuba, and by extension all the dependent
territories, except those of the USA. The trade regime under Lom&eacute;
is very liberal allowing nonreciprocal duty free access to the
EC for most goods and services produced in the region. In 1991
the value of visible trade with the EC for the Caribbean ACP alone
(i.e. excluding the OCT and the DOM) was ECU 1,332.6 million,
some 20 per cent of their total exports <a href="#5">(5)</a>.
<P>
Notwithstanding its importance to the region, the record on trade
is disappointing. It is dominated by traditional commodities and
highly dependent on preferential access to the EC, codified in
the case of sugar, bananas, rum and rice in separate protocols.
These protocols not only maintain privileged access but also provide
indirect price support. The sugar industry, particularly in CARICOM,
could not survive commercially without the protocol and the same
applies to the banana industry which has relied on preferential
national regimes to maintain viability. The value of the former
to the Commonwealth Caribbean has been estimated by the European
Commission as ECU 527.8 million above world market price 1981/85
inclusive and of the latter as a subsidy above world market of
US$ 149 million for the same period. In all, the World Bank has
estimated that over the period 198087 preferential arrangements
have provided around US$ one billion in resource transfers to
the Caribbean ACP <a href="#6">(6)</a>.
<P>
Where preference is not so marked, the record in visible trade
is poor. The Caribbean has not been able to expand nontraditional
trade with the EC. Instead, the emphasis has been on the expansion
of services. These have featured in a substantial way only in
the Fourth Convention and therefore the growth of recent years
cannot be directly attributed to Lom&eacute;. Instead, the Caribbean
has capitalised on 'natural advantages' to develop offshore financial
services and tourism. Both these sectors engage overwhelmingly
with the US. However, in both there is also a significant European
dimension and in respect of tourism it is one that has been directly
encouraged by the European Commission in its development strategies
for the region.
<P>
The Lom&eacute; Conventions thus confer significant advantages
and provide substantial benefits to the Caribbean. Although the
aid component is important, it is, according to one well informed
assessment 'trade, particularly through the special protocols
in sugar and bananas, [that] is still the dominant effective element
in the assistance package' <a href="#7">(7)</a>. It therefore follows that any prospect
of changes to this situation was necessarily alarming to the region.
Indeed, it is no surprise to find that among the ACP it was the
Caribbean that first became aware of the impact the SEM might
have on their development and who convened the first EuropeCaribbean
Conference to consider this matter in September 1988. Since then
five other annual conferences on this theme have been held, the
last in Santo Domingo in November 1993. The conferences have uniformly
drawn attention to the problems that the SEM raises for Caribbean
traditional trade, particularly in bananas. But they have also
established that new opportunities will open up for the Caribbean
in Europe if it adopts the right economic and political strategies.
The SEM must therefore be viewed not simply as a threat but also
as an opportunity for Caribbean business and for Caribbean governments
to reengage with the EU in new ways.
<P>
<a name=sem></a><H3>The SEM and the Caribbean: Commercial Considerations</H3>
<P>
The positive and negative effects of the SEM on Caribbean commerce
are relatively clear and are set out below <a href="#8">(8)</a>. It is also apparent,
however, that there are some effects that are relatively neutral.
Insofar as these cover important areas of Caribbean commerce,
these must also be noted. 
<P>
<B>Positive Effects/Opportunities</B>
<P>
The single greatest beneficial effect
of the SEM is likely to lie in the tourism sector <a href="#9">(9)</a>. Tourism currently
provides about 25 per cent of expon receipts for the Caribbean
and direct and indirect employment for around 450,000 persons.
In the five year period 198~90 some 51.4 million tourists visited
the region, of which 6.4 million were from Europe. More to the
point, tourist arrivals from Europe nearly doubled in this period.
They also usually stay longer than US tourists and spend significantly
more per day  US$ 1,275 per visit as compared to US$ 725 for US
tourists. They also do not make as strong a distinction between
the winter season and summer season as do North American tourists,
so contributing to occupancy rates throughout the year.
<P>
The main destinations for European tourists in 1990 were Guadeloupe
and Martinique, which together attracted some 325,800 European
visitors, mainly French; Barbados, 152,000, mainly British; St
Maarten, 132,900; Jamaica 121,000; and the Bahamas, 96,000. The
Dominican Republic received an estimated 68,200 and Cuba 145,000,
of which 60,000 came from Germany and 40,000 from Spain.
<P>
The presumption, of course, is that these figures can be bettered
as disposable income in the EC rises as a consequence of the SEM.
There is some support for this argument from experience. In 1993
there was a 10 per cent increase in arrivals from Europe bringing
its total arrivals to 2.25 million.The most dynamic European markets
were Germany (a 41 per cent increase to 450,000), Britain (a 13
per cent increase to 490,000), and France (an 8 per cent increase
to 520,000). Strong growth was also recorded for Italy and Spain <a href="#10">(10)</a>.
These are the countries with among the highest per capita incomes
in Europe. But the increase was also the result of effective market
promotion directly backed by the EC, which is now supplying significant
support to the Caribbean Tourism Organisation and to the establishment
by it of permanent offices in Germany, Denmark and Italy. Further
growth can therefore be expected. At the same time, though, the
French, British and Dutch markets were slack from 1990 to 1992
indicating that levels of demand may already be near their peak.
There is thus nothing automatic about the growth of European tourism
in the Caribbean. It will have to be worked for in an environment
in the EU that is increasingly competitive and in which the real
returns to the host countries are not often as great as they seem
once the costs of promotion, infrastructure, imports and profit
repatriation are considered.
<P>
The 'locomotive effect' of higher disposable income may also benefit
the Caribbean in the area of nontraditional trade. It has already
been established that up to now the record in this sector is disappointing.
However, there is now a greater awareness in the Caribbean of
the need to be competitive in external markets and to establish
an active marketing strategy in favour of selected goods in specific
markets. In other words to identify niches where Caribbean products
can be sold.
<P>
The experience of Britain suggests there are four main nontraditional
niche markets for Caribbean goods: an ethnic market for Caribbean
foodstuffs and beverages; one for natural resourcebased materials
and their derivatives; another for machine manufactures and scientific
instruments; and garments and apparel <a href="#11">(11)</a>. The prospects for
the first and last of these markets have been investigated in
several studies. In both cases they show that a more positive
approach is needed by the Caribbean. In respect of the ethnic
market growth prospects are poor so the Caribbean can expand only
by 'crossing over' into the 'exotica' market. In turn, this will
require greater attention to quality and particular attention
to international marketing practices. It may also require some
consolidation of the fragmented Caribbean food industry to reap
economies of scale and learning and to provide a suffficient production
base to establish joint ventures and promote product development.
<P>
The export of garments and apparel to the SEM must also be more
vigorously pursued if there is to be any success <a href="#12">(12)</a>. At present,
only Jamaica is involved in any scale, with 10 per cent of its
garment exports going to the EC in 1990. Other Caribbean countries
sell far less with a similar production system, so there is obviously
room for expansion. At the same time there are difficulties to
be overcome. One of the most notorious is sourcing yarn in order
to meet the stringent 'rules of origin' provisions of the Lome
Convention. Others relate to design, response time, and product
and market development. However, these are not insuperable and
there are good prospects for Caribbean producers to exploit market
niches at the midrange of the market. Leisurewear and swimwear
are particularly promising in this regard, especially since they
can be promoted through and in association with tourism.
<P>
<B>Neutral Effects</B>
<P>
Exports of Caribbean ACP sugar (the Dominican Republic excepted)
to the EC are covered by the terms of the Sugar Protocol which
was negotiated alongside but is independent of the Lome conventions.
The Protocol is based on four elements: the principle of a mutual
purchasing/supply commitment for agreed quantities at a guaranteed
price for an indefinite period. It allows for a favourable price
(in re&#156;nt years some three times the world market price)
for around twothirds of ACP Caribbean sugar production and practically
all their sugar exports. Indeed, to meet the terms of the Protocol
and to receive the premium price associated with it, several ACP
states have imported sugar in recent years to cover domestic demand.
<P>
Since the Sugar Protocol is contractual and indefinite it is not
directly affected by the SEM. At the same time there are developments
in the EC which contribute to an erosion of its value and so render
the Protocol a 'wasting asset' for the Caribbean ACP <a href="#13">(l3)</a>. One
of these concerns price. The price received by the ACP for their
raw cane sugar is largely determined by the intervention price
paid for beet sugar grown in the EC. This, in turn, is covered
by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EC. It is no secret
that in recent years the CAP has been under attack as wasteful
and pricedistorting, both within the EC and by GATT. Its reform
can be confidently anticipated and in the case of sugar this means
an anticipated decrease in the intervention price of 710 per cent
in the next six years. The price received by Caribbean ACP exporters
will reduce by the same amount (prices were frozen in 1984/85
and reduced 1989/90 and 1993/94) so proportionately eroding the
advantage the ACP maintain over world price levels.
<P>
The other concerns access. In reality all Caribbean ACP sugar
is sold for refining in Britain by Tate and Lyle. The continuation
of the Sugar Protocol is thus predicated on the willingness of
Tate and Lyle to continue to buy cane sugar and on the British
government's willingness to meet part of the domestic demand for
sugar through cane imports. At present neither are under threat,
and indeed Tate and Lyle has returned to the Caribbean to manage
the sugar industry in Jamaica, Guyana, St Kitts and Barbados.
However, these arrangements do render the Caribbean particularly
dependent at a time of generalised crisis in the sugar industry
which is once again raising ageold questions in the region about
its viability. Any failure by the Caribbean to maintain significant
levels of production inevitably reduce the commitment by Britain
and Tate and Lyle to the Protocol, thereby inviting demands from
countries such as Germany for its review if not its actual termination.
<P>
The other major neutral effect, at least in the shortrun, derives
from the Rum Protocol. This establishes an annual quota of rum
to be imported dutyfree into the EC. The major importer of ACP
rum is, and has been, Britain and the major suppliers in the past
have been Guyana, the Bahamas, Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad
(their quota for 1993/94 being 224,827 hectolitres). Under Lome
IV the Protocol is to be phased out by the end of 1995 after which
the market will be open for competition. In theory, this will
favour the Caribbean ACP (including Haiti and the Dominican Republic)
as rum is one industrial product where the ACP producers have
achieved international competitiveness. At the same time, it must
be noted that the Rum Protocol was negotiated at French insistence
to protect its highcost and lower quality rum producers. The way
they have interpreted the Protocol in the past and at present
is one which continues to provide every protection to their own
producers and to insist that the EC allocate global quotas strictly
according to the rules. Although after 1995 this will no longer
apply, a strong rearguard action has been fought by the French
to protect by quota 'traditional dark rum' produced in the DOM
for a further five years <a href="#14">(14)</a>. Prospects for further growth in
rum exports by the Caribbean ACP are therefore likely to remain
artificially limited in a market the European Commission claim
is already 'saturated' with alcohol.
<P>
<B>Negative Effects/Constraints</B>
<P>
The future of banana exports from the Caribbean ACP and the French
DOM have been by far the most contentious issue in the discussion
of the impact of the SEM on the region <a href="#15">(15)</a>. Bananas dominated
the first European-Caribbean Conference and they have caused many
a sleepless night throughout Europe and the Caribbean as officials,
businessmen and politicians have formulated and argued over scheme
after scheme, with relatively little headway or agreement being
realised.
<P>
The main material facts appear relatively simple <a href="#16">(16)</a>. The import
and sale of bananas in the EC has traditionally been based on
various national arrangements which in effect compartmentalise
the market. In the cases of Britain France, Spain, Portugal, Greece
and Italy the markets operate in favour of either EC produced
bananas (21 per cent of the market in 1990, with imports overwhelmingly
from the Caribbean DOM and the Canary Islands) or ACP produced
bananas from traditional suppliers (19 per cent of the market
in 1990, overwhelmingly from the Windward Islands, Jamaica, Belize
and Suriname in the Caribbean and the Ivory Coast and Cameroon
in Africa). Other EC states obtain their supplies (60 per cent
of the market in 1990) from the 'dollar zone' (Central America
and South America) subject to a customs duty of 20 per cent with
the exception of Germany, the main consumer country (35 per cent
of consumption in 1990), where customs duties are waived under
a quota arrangement covering its entire consumption.
<P>
These arrangements have been deemed incompatible with the SEM
since they do not permit the free circulation of goods. The task
of the European Commission has therefore been to devise a scheme
which replaces the segmentalised market. This would be relatively
easy were EC produced and ACP produced bananas competitive with
'dollar bananas', but they are not. The existence of national
import arrangements has given rise to considerable differences
between EC states regarding consumption (the Germans eat 35.7
Ibs of bananas a year compared to the European average of 22.3
Ibs); prices (in Germany in August 1991 bananas cost US$ 1.30
a kilo compared to US$ 2.07 in Britain); production costs (Latin
American production costs per kilo are less than one half those
of the Caribbean ACP and just under one third of the Caribbean
DOM); quality (it is said that the quality of Caribbean fruit
is below that of 'dollar fruit'); and marketing (wholesale retail
margins in Britain, where a complicated system of licences apply,
are double those of Germany). Any opening of the market to cheaper
'dollar bananas' would mean the end of production for export by
the DOM and most of the Caribbean ACP.
<P>
Such a prospect was not only inconceivable for the French in the
case of the DOM (where they provide 40 per cent by value of agricultural
exports and employ 12,000 persons) but also incompatible with
the Banana Protocol of Lom&eacute; IV. In Article 1 this states
that 'In respect of its banana exports to the Community markets,
no ACP State shall be placed, as regards access to its traditional
markets and its advantages on those markets, in a less favourable
situation than in the past or present'. The free circulation of
'dollar bananas' within the EC would clearly jeopardise such a
contractual obligation. It would also have serious consequences
for the Caribbean ACP, particularly the Windward Islands, where
in 1990 bananas sold to the EC (nearly all to Britain) accounted
for 56 per cent of the export earnings of Dominica, 62 per cent
of those of St Lucia and 54 per cent of St Vincent. In all, more
than 40 per cent of the population of the ~mdwards are directly
or indirectly involved in the banana industry and the dependence
on the crop has grown in recent years as the tonnage produced
has increased from 164,000 tonnes in 1985 to 278,00C tonnes in
1990.
<P>
The problem facing the EC was to reconcile all the above. In practice,
however, this proved to be virtually impossible. In April 1992,
after more than two years of study and consultation, the Commission
proposed a quota based solution which would have reserved current
market levels for the ACP and the EC while imposing a 20 per cent
tariff on 'dollar bananas' which account for the remainder. This
proved unacceptable to Germany, Denmark and the Benelux countries
and new proposals were put forward by Britain in December. These
set a two million tonne quota at a tariff of ECU 100 per tonne
(approximately 20 per cent) for all 'dollar bananas' entering
the EC. Imports above that level were be subject to a tariff of
ECU 850 (approximately 170 per cent). A basic tariff-free quota
was set for ACP bananas up to the greatest volume shipped up to
1990 and a 'partnership' scheme was devised whereby 'dollar banana'
operators who market ACP produce were to be favoured in the distribution
of licences. The proposals were opposed by Denmark and Germany
but agreed by other ministers, subject to final consideration.
When this took place in Brussels in February 1993, Belgium and
The Netherlands joined with Germany (though not Denmark which
now occupied the rotating presidency of the EC and was obliged
to seek consensus) in raising new objections. After some revision
of the proposals to allow for an upward adjustment of the 'dollar
banana' quota in line with market demand and a review of the proposals
if there were any significant price increases, plus assurances
that traditional importers of 'dollar bananas' would not be prejudiced
by the new licensing system, the new regime was adopted, to take
effect from 1 July 1993.
<P>
In Latin America the new regime was seen as a victory for the
Caribbean ACP. Objections were raised in the GATT, at the OAS
and in joint meetings with CARICOM. The German government also
filed a request for annulment of the regulation to the European
Court of Justice. The German petition was not upheld although
the EC did respond with an amended offer to some Latin American
countries in December 1993. This proposed an increase in the tariff
quota for imports of dollar bananas from 2 million to 2.2 million
tonnes from 1995 and the division of the global quota into specific
quotas for each country. The offer was conditional on the withdrawal
of the complaint from GATT. The Latin American countries did not
agree and as expected the GATT ruled that the preference given
to ACP bananas was incompatible with the provisions of the GATT
and therefore should be eliminated. This finding was rejected
by the EC. However, in a reversal of their previous stance they
kept the offer on the table and in subsequent negotiations a new
agreement was reached with Colombia, Costa Rica, Venezuela and
Nicaragua. This established an increased global quota of 2.2 million
tonnes determined for each country on the basis of its historic
exports to the KU, plus a reduction of tariff within the quota
from ECU 100 to ECU 75 per tonne. The offer was rejected by Guatemala,
Panama Ecuador, Honduras and Mexico who resolved to take the dispute
to the new World Trade Organization. One final twist to this complicated
story was provided toward the end of 1994 when the US Trade Representative
(in response to complaints by Chiquita Brands International and
the Hawaii Banana Industry Association) initiated an investigation
into the EC banana regime under Section 301 of the US Trade Act.
The outcome to this enquiry is still awaited.
<P>
The EC market for ACP and DOM bananas has been secured for the
moment. However, it is clear that in the medium to longterm renewed
challenges will come from Latin American banana producers and
from the large US banana multinationals. Both have invested in
new production in recent years in anticipation of a more open
EC market post1992 and both face a stagnant US market. Furthermore,
the Banana Protocol refers only to access, not to prices which
have fallen steeply in the last two years. The preferential market
for bananas ends in the Year 2002. The ACP and the DOM will therefore
have to address the question of future access and competitive
price if they are to remain as exporters to the EC. In the meantime
a special system of income support and financial and technical
assistance over three years, worth some ECU 50 million in 1993,
has been approved as an ancillary measure to enable them to offset
income losses and promote new marketing initiatives <a href="#17">(17)</a>.
<P>
In general terms the balance of costs and benefits of the SEM
to the Caribbean are not dissimilar to those for the developing
world as a whole. The Caribbean is a prospective beneficiary in
respect of tourism and niche markets in exotic foods, garments,
and potentially, rum. It has also secured support for the time
being for sugar and bananas. However, for both these commodities
'exceptional'conditions apply and neither are able to benefit
from the trade creation aspect of the SEM in primary products
since the amount of sugar and bananas to be imported are, in effect,
fixed. The Caribbean is here dependent on preference and in the
long run faced with a 'wasting asset' in respect of sugar (through
price erosion) and a challenge in respect of bananas (by those
seeking to weaken the new regime). In the shortterm the Caribbean
neither wins nor loses, but in the mediumterm it must seek to
promote the opportunities it has through innovative product development
and marketing. In the same timeframe it must also review the future
of sugar and bananas, with particular attention to the latter.
It is, for example, noteworthy that political leaders in the Windward
Islands were very active in Europe in defence of their interests
but remarkably inactive in their own islands in promoting any
debate or review on the future of the banana industry <a href="#18">(l8)</a>.
<P>
<a name=treaty></a><H3>The Maastricht Treaty and the Developing World</H3>
<P>
The Maastricht Treaty, concluded on 7 February 1992, establishes
the European Union. This deepens the processes of integration
between the member states by developing existing areas of cooperation
and identifies new areas of common policy in respect of the external
frontiers of the KU. The EU is defined as consisting of three
pillars: the European Community treaties and economic and monetary
union; a common foreign and security policy; and cooperation in
the spheres of home affairs and justice. The developing world
will feel the effects of new policies and arrangements in a number
of areas including immigration, rights of asylum, visa policy,
consular access and so forth, although the most immediate and
farreaching will be in development policy. The Maastricht Treaty
establishes development cooperation as a Community policy which
supplements its member states continuing bilateral development
policies. In Title XVII it defines the objectives (Article 130U)
and the methods (Article 130V and Article 130X) and gives greater
scope for the European Commission and the European Parliament
to influence the shape and content of development policy. It also
sets in train a process whereby a common development policy will
emerge (not a single development policy) in support of a common
foreign and security policy.
<P>
The principles and objectives which will define development policy
postMaastricht were set out in outline by the Commission in its
document'Development Policy in the Runup to 2000' and endorsed
by the Council of Ministers in their meeting of November 1992.
These are:
<P>
<ul>
<li>the sustainable economic and social development of the developing
countries, and more particularly the most disadvantaged among
them;</li>
<P>
<li>the smooth and gradual integration of the developing countries
into the world economy;</li>
<P>
<li>the campaign against poverty in the developing countries; and</li>
<P>
<li>the promotion of democracy, the rule of law and human rights
and fundamental freedoms <a href="#19">(19)</a></li></ul>
<P>
In statements and documents issued since then the Commission has
made it clear that these principles and objectives will inform
its approach to the renegotiation of the various agreements it
has with developing countries, including the Mid Term Review of
the Lom&eacute; Convention, the protocols with the Southern Mediterranean
countries, and the guidelines which determine its relations with
Asia and Latin America.
<P>
To date, the most important changes brought about relate to the
Mid Term Review of the Lom&eacute; Convention. When the Convention
was signed in December 1989, provision was made for it to be reviewed
half way through its tenyear lifetime, along with the renewal
of the Financial Protocol (the 'add' component of the Convention).
The review process is in its final stages. The emphasis from the
Community has been on conditionality in order to promote human
rights, good governance and democracy; as well as the better use
(including unilateral determination by the Commission) of procedures
and instruments relating to the identification, allocation and
disbursement of aid. The emphasis from the ACP has been on measures
to improve trade in agriculture, commodities and services; plus
additional aid, particularly for the private sector and Stabex.
The issues involved have created considerable controversy and
are as yet still unresolved. However, it is increasingly clear
that the EU regard the Lom&eacute; Convention as having outlasted
its usefulness in its present form. The ACP must therefore be
prepared for a radically new relationship with the EU once the
present Convention expires.
<P>
<a name=aid></a><H3>The Caribbean and the Lom&eacute; Conventions: Aid</H3>
<P>
The provision of aid is an integral part of the Lom&eacute; Conventions
and the sum total made available to the Caribbean (including the
dependent territories) is ECU 1,367 million for the twenty year
period 19769S. This aid has been welcomed and its contribution,
particularly to national development projects, is generally positive.
It has been particularly important to the smaller lessdeveloped
countries of the Eastern Caribbean who have, in ECU per capita
terms, been among its greatest beneficiaries <a href="#20">(20)</a>.
<P>
The question of the future of aid from the EC is therefore important
to some countries, if not all. The problem facing them, and the
region as a whole, will be the volume and distribution of the
aid on offer along with any new conditionalities that may be imposed.
The principle that aid will go to the most impoverished and disadvantaged
would, under a generous interpretation, funnel aid in the Caribbean
to Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Guyana (as the poorest countries)
and to Dominica, St Lucia, St Vincent, Grenada and Belize (as
the most disadvantaged). However, on a more stringent interpretation
the latter may well lose out. The idea that was established in
the second Lom&eacute; Convention that small island developing
countries needed a higher level of assistance no longer enjoys
the support of international agencies whilst the plight of sub-Saharan
Africa has loomed ever larger in the calculations and concerns
of Commission. The policy reforms promoted by the Commission within
the Mid Term Review overwhelmingly reflect their perceived needs
and are of only marginal relevance to the majority of states in
the Caribbean (including the Eastern Caribbean) <a href="#21">(21)</a>. This particularly
applies to conditionalities related to human rights, democracy
and good governance since the record of the Commonwealth Caribbean
in upholding these is exceptional within the developing world.
The issue that arises is therefore not so much the question of
sanction if these are not fulfilled, but of recogmtion and due
reward when they are regularly met.
<P>
The prospect for continued aid at the present level is therefore
open to question. The record of a minority of countries in utilising
resources available to them under their national indicative programmes
is below average while the regional programme has repeatedly run
into diffficulties. The importance being attached by the Commission
to policy dialogue directly touches on sovereignty and dependence
in a region which, with the significant exception of Haiti, has
the ability to determine its development priorities and, in a
significant number of countries, the capacity to carry them out
with its own resources. In these circumstances the importance
to the region of rethinking the assistance package it negotiates
with the Commission becomes a matter of considerable significance.
<P>
<a name=other></a><H3>The Maastricht Treaty and the Caribbean: Other Dimensions</H3>
<P>
The other areas where the Maastricht Treaty is likely to introduce
major changes relate to cohesion, social policy, common citizenship,
cooperation on police, judicial and immigration affairs, and a
common foreign and security policy <a href="#22">(22)</a>.
<P>
<B>Cohesion</B>
<P>
Cohesion is aimed at reducing differences between the levels of
development in the various regions of the Community and of promoting
the economic and social development of the leastfavoured among
them. In recent years the principal means of achieving these ends
have been the Regional Development Fund and the European Social
Fund. The budgets of both were doubled between 1987 and 1993 to
meet the objectives of the SEM. One of these is that regions in
the EC should compete with each other on more equal terms requiring
substantial investment from the Community in physical and human
infrastructure. The policy of cohesion is thus complementary to
policies already pursued in furtherance of the SEM. It is also
further strengthened with the establishment under the Maastricht
Treaty of the Committee of Regions which has important functions
in respect of economic and social cohesion, transEuropean networks,
public health, education and culture.
<P>
The single beneficiary of cohesion in the Caribbean are the DOM.
They are part of the EU and in a Declaration on the Outermost
Regions of the Community annexed to the Treaty of Maastricht their
specific condition as distant, insular, small, dependent and underdeveloped
regions is specifically recognised. As such, they continue to
benefit from a programme originally designed to improve their
economic competitiveness which was implemented in 1989 in furtherance
of the SEM. This programme, identified by the acronym POSEIDOM
(Programme d'Options Sp&eacute;cifiques &agrave; l'Eloignement
et &agrave; l'Insularit&eacute; des DOM), not only sets aside
substantial funds from the Community budget for their development
(ECU 840 million for the period 199499), but also recognises their
location in a region comprised largely of ACP states by encouraging
specific measures of cooperation via the Lom&eacute; Convention
<a href="#23">(23)</a>. The DOM are thus doubly advantaged (or if another view is
taken, receive substantial compensation for their disadvantage).
Either way, the net effect is to further the economic assimilation
of the DOM into the Community, so confirming their increasing
dependence on Paris, as at the same time it emphasises their singular
political status in the Caribbean, so widening the political gap
between them and the rest of the region. Practical measures of
cooperation are not made impossible by this fact, but agreed measures
may be more difficult to achieve.
<P>
<B>Social Policy</B>
<P>
Social policy is the subject of a separate chapter and protocol
(to which Britain was not signatory) in the Maastricht Treaty.
It develops policy and procedures first laid down in the Social
Charter &agrave;greed in December 1989. The main objectives are
the promotion of employment, improved living and working conditions,
proper social protection, dialogue between management and labour,
the development of human resources and the combating of social
exclusion. It is this last provision which is probably the most
important for persons of Caribbean origin or descent since it
has the potential to raise questions of ethnicity race and colour,
even though the thrust of the chapter is directed toward the elimination
of discrimination against women.
<P>
There are just over one million people of Caribbean origin or
descent legally settled in the KU. Of these, some 521,000 are
from the Commonwealth Caribbean, living primarily in Britain;
some 250,000 are from the Caribbean DOM, almost all of whom are
to be found in France; and 240,000 are Surinamese alongside 80,000
from The Netherlands Antilles and Aruba, mainly living in The
Netherlands. (Numbers from Haiti, living mainly in France, or
from Cuba and Puerto Rico, living mainly in Spain, are not known).
The vast majority of these people are citizens of the Union, either
by residence or birth. In Britain this population is estimated
at 482,000 of whom 72 per cent aged 16 and over and 87 per &#156;nt
aged under 16 hold British nationality. In The Netherlands all
those from Aruba and The Netherlands Antilles have Dutch citizenship
as do many of those from Suriname. Those born in the DOM are,
by definition, citizens of France <a href="#24">(24)</a>.
<P>
The main problems facing people of Caribbean origin or des&#156;nt
in the EU are thus not those of citizenship as such (although
see below), but issues of racial discrimination in employment
and within the community which collectively amount to significant
disadvantage in a number of areas. The record of individual countries
in tackling the many issues raised differs widely according to
legislation, enfor&#156;ment and custom. The provisions of the
Social Chapter are likely to do little to overturn these disparities
sin&#156; most redress will continue to rely on national policies.
The ideal of a single European institutional response to the growth
of racism throughout the EU is thus unlikely, however much this
is canvassed in informal panCaribbean networks in Paris, London
or Amsterdam. Equally, the removal of racial discrimination in
employment and in the community is more likely to be pursued by
invoking 'subsidiarily' (the principle which provides that in
areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the EU
shall take action only if and in so far as the objectives of the
proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member
states) than it is within any common framework promoted by the
Commission.
<P>
<B>Common Citizenship</B>
<P>
Part of the problem in realising common action among those of
Caribbean origin and des&#156;nt in the EU is the lack of a common
citizenship. The Maastricht Treaty creates citizenship of the
European Union. Everybody holding the nationality of a member
state will also be a citizen of the Union with the right to live
and work anywhere in the EU and to enjoy voting rights and to
stand in local and European elections in the country in which
they reside, subject to specific exceptions. However, not everyone
of Caribbean origin or des&#156;nt is affected and some anomalies
are created.
<P>
The most significant is that between the citizens of British dependent
territories in the Caribbean on the one hand and those in the
DOM and The Netherlands Antilles and Aruba on the other. The former
are British subjects with the right of abode in the United Kingdom
(as distinct from British citizens) whereas nationals of the DOM
have full French citizenship and those of The Netherlands Antilles
and Aruba full Dutch citizenship. This distinction allows the
latter two to move freely anywhere within the KU, and to exercise
rights and to claim entitlements in, for example, London, whilst
the citizens of British dependent territories in the Caribbean
cannot do the same in Paris or the Hague. Similarly, while full
British and Dutch citizens could, if they so desired, reside freely
in the DOM, they cannot do so without permission in the Caribbean
OCT <a href="#25">(25)</a>.
<P>
Another anomaly is between those from the Caribbean who as full
citizens of the European Union have common entitlements throughout
the Union and those who as resident (third country) citizens do
not, but are subject to specific and different national restrictions.
These are nontransferable from one country to another. Thus Caribbean
origin people with rights of residence in Britain have entitlements
to work, housing, education, health and social welfare benefits
which are not offered to those of similar status elsewhere in
the KU. And while The Netherlands gives all residents the right
to vote in local elections, Spain does so only if reciprocated
and Britain if they are Commonwealth citizens of established residence.
<P>
<B>Police Cooperation, Immigration and Crime</B>
<P>
The most visible effect for most people in the EU of the 'new
Europe' has been the abolition of Customs checks and passport
controls at internal frontiers. Goods can move freely between
countries and with the entry into force of the relevant articles
of the Schengen Agreement at the end of March 1995, people travelling
between signatory countries (France, Germany, Spain, Portugal
and the Benelux countries) can do so as well. While this provides
advantages it is also open to abuse. The provisions of the Maastricht
Treaty seek to prevent this possibility through cooperation in
the fields of justice and home affairs. Title VI of the Treaty
establishes eight areas of common interest between member states:
asylum policy, rules governing the crossing of external borders
of the Union, immigration policy and policy governing nationals
of third countries combating drug addiction, combating fraud,
judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, customs cooperation,
and police cooperation to combat terrorism, drug trafficking
and international crime. To support these objectives a new police
agency, Europol, has been created. However, the enforcement of
policy will be national and the issue of internal security as
a whole remains subject to intergovernmental cooperation. Individual
member states will therefore remain as the main actors in this
area, with the understanding that at international conferences
and in international organizations, member states will defend
common positions.
<P>
The main effect of these provisions on the Caribbean relate to
immigration, asylum, drug trafflcking and international crime.
In respect of immigration the main change is likely to be the
simplification of visa control along with more stringent conditions
for entry. These are to be achieved by the adoption of an External
Frontiers Convention and a Regulation governing the crossing of
the external frontiers/borders of member states. The current situation
is one in which nationals of many third countries require a separate
visa to enter each state, nationals of other third countries require
no visa at all, and yet others require them for some but not others
(with different rules applying to those EU states party to the
Schengen Agreement and those which are not). This is to be simplified
by the establishment of uniform list of third coumtries whose
nationals will require a temporary visa to enter the EU. The proposal
by the Commission places all the Caribbean countries on this list
except for Jamaica <a href="#26">(26)</a> Stricter controls than those which applied
before in respect of some Caribbean countries and specific member
states (e.g. between the Commonwealth Caribbean and Britain) are
thus likely to result, although these may be offset by the benefit
of a common visa acceptable to all EU countries following initial
entry to the Union. This has a particular resonance in the EU
because of the DOM. The external frontiers of the EU begin in
the Caribbean. The relative from Dominica or St Lucia visiting
family in Guadeloupe or Martinique has entered the EU (on an analogy
with Puerto Rico and the US). Since this can be done relatively
easily and without offficial knowledge the possibility of subsequent
illegal entry to mainland Europe (given that France is a member
of the Schengen Agreement) naturally arises. The concomitant of
easier travel within the EU is therefore a stricter system of
frontier surveillance, particularly 'on the part of countries
which, because of their geographical position and configuration,
are exposed to increased migratory pressure' <a href="#27">(27)</a>.
<P>
The issue of asylum is a major issue within the EU but one that
does not yet involve the Caribbean. It may do so, however, should
the situation in Haiti again deteriorate (when Paris may seem
an attractive haven) and, in particular, should social order in
Cuba irretrievably break down. In the latter case it should not
be forgotten that many Cubans continue to have family and other
links with Spain.
<P>
However, the real questions immediately facing the Caribbean are
to do with drug traffficking and international crime. The Caribbean
is a major centre for both these activities and the countries
involved include dependent territories as well as independent
states. Britain, France and The Netherlands within the EU are
directly engaged in these questions as are other members indirectly,
such as Germany and Spain, which are major targets for cocaine
traffickers. The net effect has been to raise the policing profile
of Europe both within the Caribbean and within Europe.
<P>
The focus within the Caribbean has been on providing improved
enforcement capabilities to curb drug trafficking and money laundering.
This has necessitated increased resource transfers, closer administrative
regulation, and latterly greater cooperation between EU countries
directly involved within the region and with the United States.
The sum total of changes brought about have been considerable
but are too complex to be fully discussed here. What must be noted,
however, is that they have been significant in redefining the
nature of the relationship of Britain and The Netherlands to their
dependent territories and go some way to explaining why the policy
in both countries of permitting greater domestic autonomy for
these islands has been reversed in recent years.
<P>
The focus in the EU has been on improving the ad hoc cooperative
procedures which have been established to provide better information
and coordination between national forces. In drugs trafficking
this goes back to 1971 when the Pompidou Group (a body of the
Council of Europe) was set up to counter drugrelated crime throughout
Europe. This was followed by the creation of the Trevi Group in
1975, which by the end of the 1980s was giving priority to combating
drug traffficking, organized crime and money laundering; and the
Comit&eacute; Europ&eacute;en Lutte AntiDrogu&eacute;s in 1989,
which subsequently drew up the first European Plan to Combat Drugs
adopted in 1990. Among the priority measures agreed were repression
of trafficking and international action with consumer, producer
and transit countries. In the Caribbean this has led to the establishment
of the Bridgetown Group in 1990 as a regional counterpart to the
EU parent Dublin Group. It meets monthly on an informal basis
and is attended by representatives of British, Canadian, French
and US diplomatic missions together with officials from the EC,
OAS and UN. Similar groups have been estabFiished in Trinidad
and Jamaica. Among their functions are information exchange, financial
and technical assistance to combat trafficking and the encouragement
of a common approach to the drugs problem <a href="#28">(28)</a>.
<P>
The other area is money laundering. The SEM permits the free flow
of capital and services throughout the EC. It is therefore easier
for drugs traffickers to move money from one member state to another.
To counter this possibility individual states have become members
of international organisations seeking to curb this activity.
All states of the EU are members of the Financial Action Task
Force, party to the Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure
and Confiscation of the Proceeds of Crime (adopted by the Council
of Europe), and subject to the directive on money laundering issued
by the EC in June 1991. The significance of money laundering in
the Caribbean has also prompted action. The British, Dutch and
French are members of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force
and with the US help to underwrite its costs. They have also signed
Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties with the US which are binding
on their Caribbean territories or possessions. Finally, tighter
regulations have been enforced in the offshore financial services
industries in the British dependent territories <a href="#29">(29)</a>.
<P>
Article K.1 of the Maastricht Treaty provides for the establishment
of a European Police Office (Europol) which is targeting drugs
via a recently established Europol Drugs Unit. The Treaty also
makes drug dependency a priority subject for action in the field
of public health and at the Lisbon Council in 1992 the fight against
drug trafficking was identified as one of six priority objectives
in developing a common foreign and security policy. The idea of
an integrated approach to the drugs problem is therefore being
developed within the framework of the Treaty and is being promoted
by the Commission in a European Union Action Plan to Combat Drugs
over the next five years. The major new area to effect the Caribbean
will be in foreign affairs and development policy. The Commission
proposes 'using the possibilities which antidrugs clauses in the
external agreements of the Community with third countries provide
for promoting cooperation' and 'making cooperation in the fight
against drugs a priority in terms of trade and development policy'.
The special preferential trade arrangements for some Andean and
Central American countries are specifically mentioned in this
regard as also is the Fourth Lom&eacute; Convention. The Commission
clearly envisages activating the provisions of Lom&eacute; noting
that it 'has now identified the needs of the countries most affected'
and that it will conduct an 'indepth dialogue with the countries
concerned with a view to adopting an operational approach in the
framework of the EDF' <a href="#30">(30)</a>. The Caribbean is not specifically
identified but given its increasing involvement as a transit point
for drugs to Europe it is difficult to imagine that the Commission
will overlook it in furthering its new policies.
<P>
In all, there has been a substantial growth of coordination and
cooperation on matters relating to immigration, asylum, drug trafficking
and international crime in the EU in recent years. In many ways
it is understandable as a necessary corollary of closer union.
It does, however, carry one major intangible danger for the large
majority of persons of Caribbean origin or descent. The new 'enemy'
in much of Europe is the bogus asylum seeker, the illegal immigrant
and the drug trafficker <a href="#31">(31)</a>. The upsurge of racism in Europe in
recent years links all three to 'blacks' end makes little or no
distinction as to ethnicity or status. The European citizen or
resident of Caribbean origin is as likely to be caught up in this
as any other Third World person, particularly given the linkage
of drugs with the Caribbean. This must be a worrying problem for
Caribbean governments and it is a matter on which coordinated
action by them within the EU ought to be considered.
<P>
<B>Foreign and Security Policy</B>
<P>
The Maastricht Treaty establishes a common foreign and security
policy (CFSP), to be defined and implemented by the EU and its
member states. This is not the same as a single policy. Member
states will continue to determine and pursue policy independently,
but they are expected 'to safeguard the common values, fundamental
interests and independence of the European Union' and 'to gradually
implement joint action in the areas in which Member States have
essential interests in common'. There is even a commitment to
'the eventual framing of a common defence policy', although it
is very clear that this is far in the future and will involve
substantial consideration of the role and future of NATO as well
as the Western European Union <a href="#32">(32)</a>.
<P>
The most immediate effect this is likely to have on the Caribbean
is in the area of diplomatic representation. All citizens of the
European Union are now entitled to protection by the diplomatic
or consular authorities of any other member state, on the same
conditions as the nationals of that state, where his or her own
country does not have diplomatic recogmtion. The Commission has
also proposed that member states experiment with joint diplomatic
facilities (as in Abuja, Nigeria), especially when interests are
not that significant. The effect of these changes on the Caribbean,
where most independent states are small, member state representation
on the spot is patchy, and diplomatic costs are relatively high,
is likely to be one which rationalises current levels of accreditation
and may in future reduce it. In its place a practical 'specialisation'
may emerge, particularly for consular affairs, with Britain serving
the interests of the Union in CARICOM, Spain in the Spanishspeaking
republics, and France in Haiti.
<P>
The other question is whether 'common essential interests&quot;
can be identified. The present pattern of relations in the Caribbean
is one which emphasises the bilateral and established metropolitan
interest. The emergent pattern, however, is one in which policy
is more and more subject to common frameworks. This is readily
apparent in the Community's trade and aid relations in the region
through the Lom&eacute; Convention. The SEM provides another and,
moreover, establishes a decisive role for the European Parliament
(via the Single European Act) in approving or rejecting cooperation
and association agreements with the Community (which govern trade
and aid relations with the EC). The Maastricht Treaty provides
a third. Development policy is to be decided by qualified majority
voting in the Development Council (part of the proceedings of
which will now be open) thereby enhancing the profile of Community
institutions <I>vis&agrave;vis </I>national governments. Additionally,
the practice of seeking a common European position is to be strengthened,
with the prospect that certain objectives should be subject to
a common position or joint action. This has already become a feature
of policies on human rights where a European dimension is recognizable.
The way this will effect the Caribbean is yet to be determined.
Issues relating to drugs and cooperation between the OCT have
recently led to a stronger identification of 'common interests'
by the British and the Dutch in the Caribbean. The questions of
transition and human rights in Haiti have led to 'common positions'
being adopted by the EU and the national governments. It is therefore
not improbable that at some time in the near future the balance
of European interests in the region will shift in favour of the
multilateral, thereby encouraging the eventual emergence of a
single policy toward the independent states of the Caribbean.
<P>
The creation of the EU has significant, if as yet largely unrecognized,
implications for the future of CaribbeanEuropean relations. Some
of these are contradictory, as in the establishment of common
frameworks within Europe which divide the Caribbean and its European
diaspora (policies on cohesion, some social issues and citizenship),
while others have the effect of creating common agendas and mechanisms
(as in development policy, measures to control immigration and
combat drug trafficking, and promote a common foreign policy).
Similarly, a European presence is likely to be enhanced in matters
relating to the DOM and the OCT while it will be diminished in
the ACP as individual historical associations are diluted by policies
designed to promote common European interests in a region of only
limited significance to increasing numbers of EU countries. The
issues and outcomes of the Lom&eacute; MidTerm Review have highlighted
this fact and the belief by many that EU relations with the developing
world must now be placed on a different footing than in the past.
The Caribbean would do well to recognize this new reality and
to determine what common political and social interests it has
in Europe (in addition to economic interests) in order to maximize
its potential effect.
<P>
<a name=new></a><H3>A New Caribbean Policy for a New Europe</H3>
<P>
The European presence in the Caribbean is undergoing revision
and change. The dominant pattern of bilateral relations is being
overtaken by new dynamics which favour the evolution of multilateral
relations. While these will not immediately supersede the bilateral
relationships they do add another dimension to them and ultimately
multilateral relationships (economic and political via the KU)
will come to determine the conditions under which bilateral
relations can be developed. This new situation has already
been reacted to in part by governments and the private sector
in the Caribbean. The larger Caribbean countries maintain embassies
in Brussels and CARICOM has for a long time adopted a common approach
to the evaluation and negotiation of the Lom&eacute; Conventions.
With the enlargement of the Caribbean ACP, consequent to the admission
of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, this arrangement has been
institutionalised in a new grouping, CARIFORUM, of which Suriname
is also party. The private sector is also widening its horizons.
The Caribbean Association of Industry and Commerce in Barbados
has joined forces with the longestablished West India Committee
in London to create the Caribbean Council for Europe (CCE) which
will be based in Brussels. The task of this organisation is to
identify business opportunities and promote and lobby for the
region in the European Commission and the European Parliament.
<P>
In spite of these positive developments, however, there is still
a sense in which the real significance of these changes is not
sufficiently understood in the Caribbean. This particularly affects
the type of relationship which is likely to be negotiated with
the EU in any post-Lom&eacute; arrangement. The options most widely
canvassed seem to envisage either: (a) a new association agreement
with the EU based on the present ACP and designed to preserve
as many of the <I>acquis </I>from the Lom&eacute; Convention as
possible, (b) a new relationship bringing together the Caribbean
and Central America to negotiate a common framework agreement
with the EU, with the proviso that the new agreement must also
be compatible with NAFTA membership; or (c) a <I>sui</I> <I>generis
</I>relationship based on the Association of Caribbean States
(ACS), taking into account the ideas of partnership between Latin
America and Europe set out in the recently adopted 'Basic Document
on the Relations of the European Union with Latin America and
the Caribbean' <a href="#33">(33)</a>. The problem with the first two proposals is
that while they take on board the experience of EC-Caribbean relations
on matters of trade and aid they ignore the new political and
social dimensions in the EUCaribbean relationship which will develop
from the Maastricht Treaty.
<P>
The effect of these is to complicate matters to such a degree
that any single agreement is unlikely to satisfy all parties unless
it includes within it some means by which differing intensities
of relations with Europe can be developed or maintained. A similar
point can also be made regarding the ACS proposal, with the additional
proviso that issues of preference in trade and aid will be very
much secondary to broader agendas of direct relevance to the majority
of the Hispanic states but of only indirect concern to many of
the Anglophone countries. In short, differences of interest between
Caribbean states as regards their relations with Europe as well
as by European states (working within and outside of the framework
of the KU) in their relations with the Caribbean (and any regional
grouping to which they may subscribe) will have to be accommodated
if any workable arrangement is to be concluded.
<P>
The new concept which has arisen within the EU to allow for differences
between member states within a common framework is 'variable geometry'.
This allows different member states to proceed towards integration
in different areas at different speeds. The idea is already accepted
in part in the Caribbean in respect of NAFTA where it is now recognised
that several countries are likely to seek individual entry in
advance of any agreed 'group approach'. Something similar will
also have to inform the negotiation of a postLom&eacute; agreement
with Europe. This is not to suggest that individual countries
or even subregional groups (such as the Organization of East Caribbean
States) negotiate separately with the EU, particularly since the
EU has in the past preferred 'group-to-group' arrangements with
developing countries and is most unlikely to conclude any agreement
with the Caribbean (with or without Central America or the other
member states of the ACS) other than within a common framework.
But it does point to the Caribbean exploring the possibility of
bringing 'variable geometry' into play in designing its approach
to negotiations with the EU. To put this into effect and to successfully
carry it into the outcome of the negotiations themselves is going
to require more forethought and a higher level of understanding
Europe's medium to longterm interests in the region, as well as
the Caribbean's interests in Europe, than has been the case in
the past. Fortunately, there is a 'breathing space' of a few years
in which the elements of a new approach can be assembled. It is
essential that the Caribbean seize this opportunity to develop
a negotiating mandate in which the several and different interests
of the Caribbean can be finessed and combined in a new policy
towards Europe.

<TR><TD>Abstract <TD>The paper outlines financial and technical cooperation as practised under the Lome-Convention. The present keynote is `thoughtful pragmatism'. Outgoing from the objectives of the Community's development policy, top priorities for the future cooperation are identified. Partnership continues to be the guiding principle of     the Lome-Conventions. But is it still appropriate? The post-Fiji-study highlighted various reasons for the dysfunction and shortcomings of the cooperation. More flexibility in the allocation, management and distibution of resources among the various instruments should be considered. Political dialogue has to  be joined by policy dialogue. Programming as an instrument of this dialogue should be maintained but the rigidity of the present system should be lessened. Tighter coordination among donors and among EU-member states and the Commission and tighter intergration of the various development-policy instruments should bring advantages not only for the member states.

consacr&eacute;e &agrave; la Convention de Lom&eacute; vient d'&ecirc;tre
publi&eacute;e &agrave; Bruxelles, dans toutes les langues officielles
de la CE.</B>
<P>
Le 21 mai dernier, le Commissaire au D&eacute;veloppement, <I>Joao
de Deus Pinheiro</I>, a r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute;, &agrave;
l'occasion d'une conf&eacute;rence de presse, les r&eacute;sultats
d'un sondage effectu&eacute; en d&eacute;cembre 1995 dans les
15 Etats membres par le bureau de consultance Inra (International
Research Associates) pour le compte de la Commission. Cette enqu&ecirc;te,
bas&eacute;e sur un &eacute;chantillon de 16.346 personnes &acirc;g&eacute;es
de 15 ans et plus, visait &agrave; d&eacute;terminer la mani&egrave;re
dont les Europ&eacute;ens per&ccedil;oivent les pays en d&eacute;veloppement.
Les r&eacute;sultats montrent que l'aide aux populations d&eacute;munies
des pays en d&eacute;veloppement ne figure plus depuis 1991 parmi
les grandes priorit&eacute;s des Europ&eacute;ens. En effet, cette
pr&eacute;occupation ne se place qu'en huiti&egrave;me position
d'un classement domin&eacute; aujourd'hui par la lutte contre
le ch&ocirc;mage. Une bonne nouvelle toutefois : ces m&ecirc;mes
Europ&eacute;ens classent le d&eacute;veloppement des r&eacute;gions
d&eacute;favoris&eacute;es en quatri&egrave;me position dans la
liste des actions prioritaires &agrave; mener conjointement par
les Etats membres - les trois premi&egrave;res places allant &agrave;
la lutte contre le terrorisme, la protection de l'environnement
et la d&eacute;fense des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts &eacute;conomiques
de l'Europe.
<P>
Si 82% des Europ&eacute;ens se d&eacute;clarent favorables &agrave;
la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement, 12% y sont oppos&eacute;s.
Le degr&eacute; de soutien varie, bien entendu, d'un pays &agrave;
l'autre - et il est int&eacute;ressant de noter que les Etats
membres confront&eacute;s &agrave; une crise &eacute;conomique
sont les plus r&eacute;ticents, quels que soient leurs ant&eacute;c&eacute;dents
en termes d'aide au d&eacute;veloppement. En Belgique, 65 % seulement
de l'opinion est favorable &agrave; ce type de coop&eacute;ration
contre 69 % en Autriche et 72 % en France. A l'autre bout de l'&eacute;chelle,
la Gr&egrave;ce bat le record avec 97 %, suivie de l'Espagne (96
%) et de l'Irlande (91 %). L'Inra pr&eacute;cise que cette variation
refl&egrave;te les difficult&eacute;s &eacute;conomiques croissantes
des Etats du Nord de la Communaut&eacute;. On pourrait ajouter
que les Etats m&eacute;ridionaux de l'Union sont probablement
davantage convaincus de l'efficacit&eacute; de l'aide, &eacute;tant
eux-m&ecirc;mes b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires des fonds structurels
attribu&eacute;s par la CE pour la modernisation des r&eacute;gions
communautaires en retard de d&eacute;veloppement.
<P>
 Mais le rapport de l'Inra met &eacute;galement en &eacute;vidence
un certain nombre d'id&eacute;es fausses &agrave; propos de l'aide
europ&eacute;enne au d&eacute;veloppement, fr&eacute;quemment
engendr&eacute;es par le manque de transparence des politiques
de d&eacute;veloppement en question, affirme le Commissaire Pinheiro.
<P>
 Parmi les personnes interrog&eacute;es, 57 % croient que l'assistance
communautaire prend essentiellement la forme d'une aide d'urgence
plut&ocirc;t que d'un soutien de projets &agrave; long terme.
Or, c'est l'inverse qui est vrai. La majorit&eacute; des personnes
interrog&eacute;es ont r&eacute;pondu &quot;non&quot; &agrave;
la question suivante : &quot;L'aide contribue-t-elle &agrave;
r&eacute;duire la pauvret&eacute; dans les pays en d&eacute;veloppement
?&quot; et consid&egrave;rent que les agences des Nations Unies
(Unicef, Unesco, etc.) font davantage que la CE &agrave; cette
fin. Elles tiennent &eacute;galement les organisations non gouvernementales
en beaucoup plus haute estime &agrave; cet &eacute;gard que les
Etats membres de l'UE et les institutions de Bretton Woods (FMI
et Banque mondiale).
<P>
 D'autres conclusions importantes de ce sondage - dont le Professeur
Pinheiro assure qu'elles alimenteront la r&eacute;flexion de ces
prochains mois sur l'orientation de la coop&eacute;ration apr&egrave;s
Lom&eacute; IV - sont reprises dans notre encadr&eacute;.
<P>
<H3>La r&eacute;vision &agrave; mi-parcours et au-d&eacute;l&agrave;</H3>
<P>
 Le Professeur Pinheiro estime que certains aspects signal&eacute;s
par le sondage, telle la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; d'une gestion
plus ferme de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement, ont d&eacute;j&agrave;
&eacute;t&eacute; abord&eacute;s lors de la r&eacute;vision &agrave;
mi-parcours de la Convention de Lom&eacute; dont les modalit&eacute;s
entreront en vigueur au d&eacute;but de 1997. La programmation
du huiti&egrave;me FED (Fonds europ&eacute;en de d&eacute;veloppement)
est bien avanc&eacute;e et, dans un souci d'efficacit&eacute;
accrue de l'aide, pr&eacute;voit l'octroi au d&eacute;part de
70 % des ressources attribu&eacute;es &agrave; chacun des Etats
membres pour trois ans - l'affectation du solde &eacute;tant li&eacute;e
&agrave; une analyse effectu&eacute;e &agrave; l'issue de ces
trois ans. Le Professeur Pinheiro pr&eacute;cise en outre qu'un
document &quot;strat&eacute;gique&quot; est &eacute;labor&eacute;
concernant chacun des 70 Etats ACP avant que des ressources leur
soient attribu&eacute;es. Cette proc&eacute;dure se d&eacute;roule
en concertation permanente avec les Etats membres et les  d&eacute;l&eacute;gations
de la Commission dans le but d'une v&eacute;ritable synergie entre
les uns et les autres.
<P>
 Des changements plus radicaux interviendront probablement &agrave;
l'&eacute;ch&eacute;ance de la Convention actuelle en l'an 2000.
Le Professeur Pinheiro a signal&eacute; qu'un premier projet (Livre
vert) relatif &agrave; l'orientation &eacute;ventuelle de la relation
ACP-UE au si&egrave;cle prochain sera publi&eacute; par la Commission
avant la fin de l'ann&eacute;e. Ce projet contiendra sans doute
plus de questions que de r&eacute;ponses sur l'avenir de la coop&eacute;ration.
&quot;Je ne suis pas convaincu que nous devions maintenir la structure
de Lom&eacute; pour tous les pays &agrave; l'aube du troisi&egrave;me
mill&eacute;naire&quot;, a d&eacute;clar&eacute; le Commissaire
aux journalistes, attirant leur attention sur les degr&eacute;s
tr&egrave;s diff&eacute;rents de d&eacute;veloppement qui caract&eacute;risent
d&eacute;sormais les nations signataires de la Convention. Maurice,
en passe de devenir &quot;le Singapour de l'Afrique&quot;, fournit
un exemple &eacute;loquent &agrave; cet &eacute;gard. Le Commissaire
rappelle par ailleurs que les petits Etats insulaires des Cara&iuml;bes
sont &agrave; une tout autre &eacute;tape de d&eacute;veloppement
que des pays tels que la R&eacute;publique centrafricaine ou le
Burundi. Il ajoute que toute d&eacute;cision concernant l'avenir
devra tenir compte des &eacute;volutions r&eacute;gionales.
<P>
<H3>Des r&eacute;ponses aux questions sur Lom&eacute;</H3>
<P>
 Entre-temps, la Commission ne m&eacute;nage pas ses efforts pour
am&eacute;liorer l'image de l'aide communautaire. L'Unit&eacute;
Information de la Direction g&eacute;n&eacute;rale D&eacute;veloppement
vient de publier, &agrave; cette fin, une brochure intitul&eacute;e
<I>20 Questions et R&eacute;ponses</I> &agrave; propos de la Convention
de Lom&eacute;. Apr&egrave;s une br&egrave;ve explication des
objectifs de la Convention, la brochure r&eacute;pond aux questions
les plus fr&eacute;quentes de ceux qui mettent en doute les avantages
de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement et des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences
commerciales, en montrant que les &eacute;conomies d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es
comme les &eacute;conomies en d&eacute;veloppement y trouvent
leur compte. Elle pr&eacute;cise, par exemple, que pour chaque
centaine d'ECU qu'elle d&eacute;pense en aide, la Communaut&eacute;
en r&eacute;cup&egrave;re 48 sous la forme d'achats de projets,
de fournitures et d'assistance technique &agrave; des entreprises
europ&eacute;ennes ! Elle expose &eacute;galement de mani&egrave;re
succincte la mani&egrave;re dont la Commission surveille l'octroi
de l'aide en vue de mettre fin aux d&eacute;tournements de fonds
et &agrave; la corruption. Elle insiste sur le droit de la Cour
des Comptes europ&eacute;enne de v&eacute;rifier la comptabilit&eacute;
des projets et les transferts de fonds, voire d'examiner des documents
dans les Etats signataires de Lom&eacute;, sans l'autorisation
du pays concern&eacute;. Une s&eacute;curit&eacute; suppl&eacute;mentaire
est assur&eacute;e par le syst&egrave;me du transfert bancaire
une fois que le projet a d&eacute;marr&eacute; : en d'autres termes,
un document sp&eacute;cifie que l'adjudicataire du contrat X,
dont le num&eacute;ro de compte en banque est Y, doit &ecirc;tre
cr&eacute;dit&eacute; du montant Z.
<P>
 Par ailleurs, on peut y trouver les raisons de l'implication
de la Commission europ&eacute;enne dans l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement,
alors que ses diff&eacute;rents Etats membres ont leur propre
aide bilat&eacute;rale dans ce domaine. Elle d&eacute;montre les
avantages d'une aide communautaire par rapport &agrave; des arrangements
bilat&eacute;raux, et d&eacute;crit l'&eacute;volution du syst&egrave;me
de Lom&eacute; parall&egrave;lement au processus de mondialisation
de l'&eacute;conomie, lequel s'est acc&eacute;l&eacute;r&eacute;
depuis la chute du Mur de Berlin. Un condens&eacute; statistique
des flux d'aide publique au d&eacute;veloppement (APD) atteste
que l'Union europ&eacute;enne (Communaut&eacute; plus Etats membres)
fait mieux que ses concurrents industrialis&eacute;s. C'est ainsi
qu'en 1994, la Communaut&eacute; et ses 12 Etats membres (Autriche,
Su&egrave;de et Finlande non comprises) ont consacr&eacute; en
moyenne 0,40 % de leur produit national brut &agrave; l'APD -
ce pourcentage allant de 1,03 % au Danemark &agrave; 0,20 % en
Italie. A titre de comparaison, les chiffres sont de 0,29 % en
ce qui concerne le Japon et 0,15 % en ce qui concerne les Etats-Unis.
<P>
En 1994, l'APD des Douze a atteint 26,59 milliards de dollars
- dont 4,83 milliards en provenance des fonds de la Communaut&eacute;
europ&eacute;enne elle-m&ecirc;me.

<b>A la diff&#233;rence des Conventions qui l'ont
pr&#233;c&#233;d&#233;e et qui &#233;taient pr&#233;vues chacune
pour une dur&#233;e de cinq ans, la quatri&#232;me Convention
ACP-CE, sign&#233;e &#224; Lom&#233; le 15 d&#233;cembre 1989,
a &#233;t&#233; conclue d'embl&#233;e pour une p&#233;riode
globale de dix ans prenant effet le 1er mars 1990; seul, le protocole
financier annex&#233; &#224; la Convention &#233;tait limit&#233;
&#224; une premi&#232;re phase de cinq ans et obligatoirement
renouvelable &#224; cette &#233;ch&#233;ance quinquennale.</b>
<p>
Toutefois, soucieux de m&#233;nager une certaine flexibilit&#233;, les
n&#233;gociateurs de 1989 avaient envisag&#233; la possibilit&#233;
d'une r&#233;vision &#224; mi-parcours du texte de la Convention, selon
une proc&#233;dure pr&#233;cis&#233;e &#224; l'article 366 de celle-ci.
Ce processus ne devant pas &ecirc;tre confondu avec une
ren&#233;gociation int&#233;grale, sa mise en oeuvre effective s'est
concentr&#233;e sur quelques points essentiels faisant, du reste, l'objet
d'une convergence de pr&#233;occupations entre les partenaires quant
&#224; leur choix. Et ceci m&ecirc;me si les modifications ou
compl&#233;ments pr&#233;conis&#233;s par chaque groupe n'allaient
pas toujours dans une direction identique au d&#233;part.
<p>
Ouvertes le 20 mai 1994 &#224; M'babane (Swaziland), les
n&#233;gociations pour la r&#233;vision &#224; mi-parcours de la
Convention se sont conclues le 30 juin 1995 &#224; Bruxelles (voir
encadr&#233; r&#233;sumant le d&#233;roulement des
n&#233;gociations). Leurs r&#233;sultats ont &#233;t&#233;
formalis&#233;s dans l'accord sign&#233; &#224; Maurice le 4 novembre
1995.
<p>
<A NAME="ens"><h3>Les enseignements majeurs de la r&#233;vision?</h3></A>

Avant d'esquisser les grandes lignes de ce bilan, il importe de souligner que divers
facteurs d'&#233;volution expliquent le chemin parcouru par les n&#233;gociateurs.
Depuis la signature de la Convention de Lom&#233; IV, en effet, d'importantes
mutations d'ordre &#233;conomique et politique se sont produites tant au niveau du
contexte international qu'au niveau de l'&#233;volution propre des Etats ACP et de
la Communaut&#233;:
<ul>
<li>aggravation de la mauvaise conjoncture des ann&#233;es 1980, qui a
contrari&#233; les efforts de d&#233;veloppement de nombreux PVD et
accentu&#233; les difficult&#233;s li&#233;es &#224; l'insuffisante
comp&#233;titivit&#233; des produits ACP;
<p>
<li>bouleversements de la situation politique mondiale (&#233;quilibres
id&#233;ologiques et g&#233;ostrat&#233;giques), suite aux profonds changements
intervenus en Europe centrale et orientale et dans l'ex-URSS;
<p>
<li>extension du processus de d&#233;mocratisation dans les pays touch&#233;s par
de tels changements ainsi que dans les Etats ACP eux-m&ecirc;mes, processus qui
s'est accompagn&#233; d'un certain d&#233;sengagement de l'Etat dans les secteurs
de la production et des &#233;changes;
<p>
<li>dans le cadre sp&#233;cifiquement communautaire, signature en 1992 du
Trait&#233; sur l'Union europ&#233;enne qui a consacr&#233; un titre nouveau
&#224; la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement, avec des objectifs pr&#233;cis
assign&#233;s &#224; l'action de la Communaut&#233; qui constituent autant
d'&#233;l&#233;ments d'une strat&#233;gie de coop&#233;ration en faveur des PVD
et que la Communaut&#233; a &#233;t&#233; invit&#233;e &#224; aider ses
partenaires &#224; mieux prendre en compte.  En outre, depuis le 1er janvier 1995,
la Communaut&#233; est pass&#233;e de 12 &#224; 15 Etats membres.
</ul>
Sur un plan plus particuli&#232;rement technique li&#233; &#224; la mise en oeuvre
de la Convention elle-m&ecirc;me, des difficult&#233;s ont par ailleurs &#233;t&#233;
identifi&#233;es, telles que l'exc&#232;s de rigidit&#233; du syst&#232;me de
programmation de l'aide communautaire; de m&ecirc;me, en pr&#233;sence de la
lib&#233;ralisation des &#233;changes commerciaux au niveau mondial et au niveau
de l'ouverture du march&#233; communautaire, les Etats ACP ont fait &#233;tat de
vives pr&#233;occupations concernant l'&#233;rosion des pr&#233;f&#233;rences
dont ils b&#233;n&#233;ficiaient dans le cadre du syst&#232;me de Lom&#233;.
<p>
Tous ces facteurs ont incit&#233; les partenaires de Lom&#233; &#224; ne pas se
cantonner au renouvellement du seul protocole financier et &#224; mettre &#224;
profit la possibilit&#233; de r&#233;vision &#224; mi-parcours offerte par l'article 366
de la Convention pour apporter un certain nombre d'am&#233;nagements au texte
existant. (A titre indicatif, on notera que 71 articles ont &#233;t&#233; ainsi
modifi&#233;s, supprim&#233;s ou ajout&#233;s, par comparaison avec un dispositif
initial comportant 369 articles. Outre le protocole financier, 2 protocoles existants sur
9 ont &#233;t&#233; modifi&#233;s (dans les mati&#232;res commerciales) et un
nouveau protocole, relatif &#224; la gestion  durable des ressources foresti&#232;res,
a &#233;t&#233; introduit.  Enfin, 17 d&#233;clarations communes ACP-CE ou
&#233;manant de la Communaut&#233; seule ont &#233;t&#233; annex&#233;es
&#224; l'acte final de l'accord de r&#233;vision (contre 78 en 1989).
Fondamentalement, la r&#233;vision du dispositif initial de la Convention de
Lom&#233; IV peut &ecirc;tre rapport&#233;e &#224; quatre axes : un volet
institutionnel et politique, un volet commercial, un volet th&#233;matique et sectoriel,
un volet financier).
<p>
<A NAME="ins"><h3>Volet institutionnel et politique</h3></A>
<p>
<h4>D&#233;mocratie et droits de l'homme</h4>

Un consensus s'est r&#233;alis&#233; pour introduire &#224; l'article 5 de la
Convention une r&#233;f&#233;rence &#224; la reconnaissance et &#224;
l'application des principes d&#233;mocratiques, &#224; la consolidation de l'Etat de
droit et &#224; la bonne gestion des affaires publiques - &#224; c&ocirc;t&#233; de
la r&#233;f&#233;rence d&#233;j&#224; existante &#224; la jouissance des droits
fondamentaux de l'homme.  Des moyens financiers pourront &ecirc;tre
mobilis&#233;s pour l'appui &#224; des mesures en ce sens. En outre, un montant
de 80 millions d'ECU a &#233;t&#233; sp&#233;cifiquement r&#233;serv&#233; sur
les fonds r&#233;gionaux dans le protocole financier pour permettre l'appui de la
Communaut&#233; aux mesures de r&#233;formes institutionnelles et administratives
dans le contexte de la d&#233;mocratisation et de l'Etat de droit.
<p>
Le respect des droits de l'homme, de la d&#233;mocratie et de l'Etat de droit a
&#233;t&#233; consacr&#233; comme un &#233;l&#233;ment essentiel de la
Convention. La cons&#233;quence pratique de cette reconnaissance est qu'en cas
de violation d'un de ces principes des proc&#233;dures sont pr&#233;vues pour
tenter de rem&#233;dier &#224; la situation. Ces proc&#233;dures,
d&#233;taill&#233;es &#224; l'article 366 bis (enti&#232;rement nouveau), consistent
avant tout en m&#233;canismes de consultations entre les parties. En cas
d'&#233;chec ou en cas d'urgence ou de refus de consultation, la partie qui a
invoqu&#233; le manquement &#224; une obligation peut prendre les mesures
appropri&#233;es; celles-ci peuvent aller jusqu'&#224; la suspension totale ou
partielle de l'application de la Convention &#224; l'&#233;gard de la partie
concern&#233;e  - &#233;tant bien entendu que la suspension constitue une mesure
prise en dernier ressort.
<p>
<h4>Dialogue politique</h4>

Les deux parties ont manifest&#233; leur int&#233;r&ecirc;t pour renforcer leur
dialogue sur le plan politique. Cette orientation s'est notamment traduite par
l'adjonction, &#224; l'article 30, d'un nouveau paragraphe pr&#233;voyant
l'&#233;largissement de ce dialogue dans le cadre du Conseil des Ministres ACP-CE,
mais aussi en-dehors de cette enceinte (par exemple &#224; l'&#233;chelon
r&#233;gional).
<p>
<h4>Assembl&#233;e paritaire</h4>

En ce qui concerne l'Assembl&#233;e paritaire, dont le r&#233;gime des sessions a
&#233;t&#233; maintenu &#224; deux r&#233;unions annuelles, un compromis
important est intervenu au sujet de la composition de cette instance. En effet,
apr&#232;s plusieurs mois de discussions consacr&#233;es &#224; la proposition de
l'UE de ne retenir dans l'article 32 de la Convention qu'une repr&#233;sentation
exclusivement parlementaire, les n&#233;gociateurs sont finalement convenus de
maintenir la possibilit&#233; de repr&#233;sentants d'une autre origine pour les Etats
ACP, &#224; condition, toutefois, qu'ils soient d&#233;sign&#233;s par le Parlement
du pays concern&#233;; en l'absence de Parlement, la participation d'un
repr&#233;sentant devrait &ecirc;tre soumise &#224; l'approbation pr&#233;alable de

<A NAME="com"><h3>Volet commercial</h3></A>

       Les n&#233;gociations relatives au volet commercial ont &#233;t&#233;
marqu&#233;es par une approche radicalement nouvelle. Pour la premi&#232;re fois
depuis Lom&#233; I, elles ne se sont pas principalement limit&#233;es &#224; un
d&#233;bat sur l'acc&#232;s pr&#233;f&#233;rentiel, con&#231;u comme &#233;tant
le moyen d&#233;terminant pour assurer l'&#233;coulement des produits ACP; elles
se sont &#233;largies et m&ecirc;me centr&#233;es sur une analyse de l'ensemble
des &#233;l&#233;ments &#224;  l'origine d'une r&#233;ussite commerciale et des
moyens &#224; mettre en oeuvre pour assurer une telle r&#233;ussite gr&#226;ce
&#224; une approche sectorielle et int&#233;gr&#233;e. Ainsi, l'accent mis dans le
d&#233;bat sur la coop&#233;ration ACP-CE dans le domaine du commerce a
&#233;t&#233; d&#233;plac&#233; du r&#233;gime pr&#233;f&#233;rentiel vers
l'inventaire des actions n&#233;cessaires pour le d&#233;veloppement du commerce.
<p>
       Cette nouvelle approche a donn&#233; lieu &#224; plusieurs nouveaux articles
(art. 6 bis, 15 bis) et &#224; une s&#233;rie de modifications d'articles existants (art.
50, 51, 136, 220). Elle est en particulier refl&#233;t&#233;e dans un nouvel article
15 bis, qui d&#233;finit l'objectif et les orientations du d&#233;veloppement du
commerce; elle est en outre mise en exergue dans une d&#233;claration commune
sur le d&#233;veloppement du commerce &#233;manant des repr&#233;sentants des
Etats ACP, de la Communaut&#233; et de ses Etats membres, &#224; l'occasion de
la signature de l'acte de r&#233;vision.
<p>
       Cette nouvelle approche ne s'est pas pour autant purement et simplement
substitu&#233;e aux n&#233;gociations classiques sur le r&#233;gime
pr&#233;f&#233;rentiel et les r&#232;gles d'origine, qui ont fait l'objet principal de la
deuxi&#232;me partie des discussions en ce domaine.  Toutefois, contrairement
&#224; l'exp&#233;rience du pass&#233;, ce d&#233;bat a &#233;t&#233;
plac&#233; par les deux parties sur un niveau politique davantage que sur un niveau
&#233;conomique, notamment quant aux cons&#233;quences de l'Uruguay Round.
<p>
<h4>Produits ACP</h4>
       En mati&#232;re d'acc&#232;s des produits ACP au march&#233;
communautaire, le compromis final qui s'est d&#233;gag&#233; sur la base d'une
approche horizontale plut&ocirc;t que produit par produit pr&#233;voit essentiellement
:
<ul>
<li>l'extension du r&#233;gime pr&#233;f&#233;rentiel &#224; la quasi-totalit&#233;
des produits originaires des ACP;
<li>l'assouplissement de l'encadrement quantitatif appliqu&#233; &#224; certaines
concessions tarifaires;
<li>l'extension de concessions tarifaires en dehors des calendriers actuels.
</ul>
Ainsi, les Etats ACP b&#233;n&#233;ficieront &#224; l'avenir, &#224; quelques rares
exceptions pr&#232;s, d'un r&#233;gime pr&#233;f&#233;rentiel pour l'ensemble des
produits, et cela pendant toute l'ann&#233;e.
<p>
<h4>R&#232;gles d'origine</h4>
       Comme d'habitude, le dossier des r&#232;gles d'origine &#233;tait parmi les
plus compliqu&#233;s. Ceci non seulement &#224; cause de la technicit&#233; du
sujet, mais aussi en raison de la n&#233;cessit&#233; de trouver un juste
&#233;quilibre entre l'objectif de promouvoir le d&#233;veloppement industriel des
Etats ACP et les contraintes d&#233;coulant du niveau actuel d'industrialisation peu
&#233;lev&#233;.  Le compromis finalement enregistr&#233; &#224; l'issue des
n&#233;gociations pr&#233;voit surtout une nouveaut&#233; importante : la
possibilit&#233; d'un cumul entre les Etats ACP et des pays en d&#233;veloppement
voisins "appartenant &#224; une entit&#233; g&#233;ographique coh&#233;rente"
(article 6, paragraphe 5 du protocole nþ1). M&ecirc;me si cette possibilit&#233; est
limit&#233;e &#224; certains pays express&#233;ment &#233;num&#233;r&#233;s
et m&ecirc;me si, notamment, certains produits textiles ont &#233;t&#233; exclus de
cette possibilit&#233; de cumul, cette nouvelle disposition constitue n&#233;anmoins
un pas important vers une coop&#233;ration r&#233;gionale entre Etats ACP et
autres pays en d&#233;veloppement.
<p>
       Les autres modifications apport&#233;es aux r&#232;gles d'origine dans le
protocole nþ1 concernent l'augmentation de la tol&#233;rance en valeur de 10 &#224;
15 % et celle de la d&#233;rogation automatique pour le thon.
<p>
<h4>Viande bovine et bananes</h4>
       Deux produits faisant l'objet de protocoles sp&#233;cifiques ont
b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; d'une attention particuli&#232;re : la viande bovine et la
banane. En ce qui concerne la viande bovine, un accord s'est assez rapidement
r&#233;alis&#233; pour porter, comme demand&#233; par les Etats ACP, la
r&#233;duction tarifaire de 90 % &#224;  92 %. Des am&#233;nagements de nature
administrative ainsi que l'inclusion de la Namibie dans la liste des pays
b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires ont compl&#233;t&#233; la r&#233;vision de ce protocole.
En ce qui concerne les bananes, les n&#233;gociations ont &#233;t&#233; plus
ardues. Le d&#233;bat s'est finalement sold&#233; par une "d&#233;claration
commune sur les bananes" (annexe LXXXVIII) qui pr&#233;voit de faire face aux
probl&#232;mes sp&#233;cifiques des fournisseurs de bananes ACP de la
Communaut&#233; dans le cadre de l'aide programmable.
<p>
<h4>Ressources foresti&#232;res</h4>
       Enfin, sur insistance des Etats ACP, un nouveau protocole a vu le jour : le
protocole no 10 sur la gestion durable des ressources foresti&#232;res. Apr&#232;s
des n&#233;gociations difficiles, il a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;cid&#233; d'int&#233;grer
dans ce protocole comme actions prioritaires pour la mise en oeuvre du 8&#232;me
FED (mais sans enveloppe financi&#232;re sp&#233;cifique) la conservation, la
gestion durable et la restauration des for&ecirc;ts tropicales sur base des
crit&#232;res et indicateurs harmonis&#233;s au niveau international.  Les principes
d'une participation active de tous les acteurs concern&#233;s (notamment les
communaut&#233;s locales) et d'une planification pr&#233;alable aux niveaux
national, r&#233;gional et local constituent des acquis importants dans ce contexte.
<p>
       Un progr&#232;s substantiel a &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; accompli en ce
qui concerne le commerce du bois tropical : &#224; cet &#233;gard, le protocole
repr&#233;sente le premier accord formel au niveau international qui reconnaisse la
n&#233;cessit&#233; d'un d&#233;veloppement des syst&#232;mes de certification
des for&ecirc;ts et qui s'inscrive dans le cadre d'une harmonisation internationale.
<p>
<A NAME="the"><h3>Volet th&#233;matique et sectoriel</h3></A>

       Sous cette appellation, sont inclus un certain nombre de domaines faisant
l'objet d'une coop&#233;ration sp&#233;cifique dans le cadre de la Convention de
Lom&#233; et que les partenaires ont entendu renforcer ou adapter &#224; la faveur
de l'exercice de r&#233;vision &#224; mi-parcours.
<p>
<h4>Coop&#233;ration culturelle</h4>
       En pr&#233;sence des probl&#232;mes d&#233;licats rencontr&#233;s dans
la mise en oeuvre de la coop&#233;ration culturelle, l'UE estimait qu'il convenait de
clarifier les ambigu&iuml;t&#233;s r&#233;sultant de la r&#233;daction initiale de
l'article 141 et de l'annexe XXII de la Convention - dans la mesure notamment
o&ugrave; ces dispositions pouvaient &ecirc;tre interpr&#233;t&#233;es comme
assurant &#224; la Fondation pour la coop&#233;ration culturelle ACP-CE une
exclusivit&#233; dans la mise en oeuvre du Titre XI et comme lui accordant un droit
&#224; une aide permanente de la part de la Communaut&#233;. Sans
n&#233;cessairement s'en tenir aux textes existants, les ACP ont pour leur part
insist&#233; sur le maintien d'une mention explicite de la Fondation dans la
convention. Le compromis auquel sont parvenus les n&#233;gociateurs sur ces deux
dispositions refl&#232;te ces pr&#233;occupations respectives.
<p>
<h4>Coop&#233;ration industrielle</h4>
       En ce qui concerne la coop&#233;ration industrielle, la ren&#233;gociation des
articles 87 &#224; 96 a abouti &#224; une red&#233;finition du r&ocirc;le du
Comit&#233; de coop&#233;ration industrielle et &#224; un recentrage des objectifs
du Centre pour le d&#233;veloppement industriel (CDI) : ce dernier est appel&#233;
&#224; concentrer ses futurs efforts sur les Etats ACP qui ont identifi&#233; l'appui
au d&#233;veloppement industriel ou au secteur priv&#233; en g&#233;n&#233;ral
dans leur programme indicatif. La Commission, la Banque europ&#233;enne
d'investissement et le CDI sont invit&#233;s &#224; entretenir une collaboration
op&#233;rationnelle et &#224; pr&#233;parer conjointement des programmes d'appui
aux secteurs industriel et priv&#233;.
<p>
       En outre, la direction du CDI est d&#233;sormais responsable devant un
conseil d'administration compos&#233; de six membres nomm&#233;s par le
comit&#233; de coop&#233;ration industrielle sur la base de l'&#233;galit&#233; entre
les Etats ACP et la Communaut&#233;.
<p>
<h4>Coop&#233;ration d&#233;centralis&#233;e</h4>
       D&#232;s le d&#233;part, il existait un consensus entre les deux parties sur
l'int&#233;r&ecirc;t qu'il y avait de d&#233;velopper la coop&#233;ration
d&#233;centralis&#233;e, susceptible, du reste, d'accompagner le processus de
d&#233;mocratisation par les initiatives qu'elle peut susciter au niveau local. Mais des
divergences s'&#233;taient manifest&#233;es au cours des n&#233;gociations sur les
modalit&#233;s permettant de traduire cette impulsion nouvelle, en particulier quant
&#224; l'acc&#232;s direct des acteurs de la coop&#233;ration
d&#233;centralis&#233;e (collectivit&#233;s locales, coop&#233;ratives, syndicats,
etc.) au financement communautaire et au contr&ocirc;le des autorit&#233;s
nationales des pays b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires.
<p>
       Des discussions approfondies ont abouti &#224; un remaniement significatif
du dispositif initial : les articles 20, 21 et 22 constituant le chapitre 3 de la
premi&#232;re partie ("acteurs de la coop&#233;ration") de la Convention ont
&#233;t&#233; supprim&#233;es et remplac&#233;es par une section
sp&#233;cifique ("coop&#233;ration d&#233;centralis&#233;e") ins&#233;r&#233;e
dans le chapitre 2 ("coop&#233;ration financi&#232;re") du Titre III de la
troisi&#232;me partie consacr&#233;e aux instruments de la coop&#233;ration ACP-
CE. Ce nouveau dispositif couvre maintenant cinq articles (art. 251 A &#224; 251 E). 
Parmi les innovations que comporte ce dispositif, il y a lieu de souligner :
<ul>
<li>qu'une forme de coop&#233;ration qui combine les efforts et les ressources des
organisations des Etats ACP et de leurs homologues de la Communaut&#233; est
maintenant consacr&#233;e;

<li>que la possibilit&#233; d'appuyer la coop&#233;ration d&#233;centralis&#233;e
est envisageable &#224; partir des ressources du programme indicatif ou des fonds
de contrepartie;

<li>que la contribution du FED &#224; ces op&#233;rations peut aller jusqu'&#224;
300.000 ECU par projet ou programme.
</ul>
       L'annexe LXXX contient par ailleurs une d&#233;claration commune relative
&#224; des &#233;changes de vues entre agents de la coop&#233;ration
d&#233;centralis&#233;e, avec pour but d'encourager leur participation &#224; des
projets et programmes financ&#233;s par le FED.
<p>
<h4>Transports maritimes</h4>
       Dans le domaine des transports maritimes, les discussions ont abouti &#224;
un renforcement des dispositions de l'article 129. A ce titre, les parties ont
soulign&#233; leur intention d'accorder une attention particuli&#232;re, &#224;
l'int&#233;rieur des instruments existants de la coop&#233;ration pour le financement
du d&#233;veloppement, aux mesures tendant &#224; faciliter et encourager
l'acc&#232;s des op&#233;rateurs maritimes ACP aux ressources pr&#233;vues par
la Convention; cela devrait notamment concerner les projets et programmes
destin&#233;s &#224;  am&#233;liorer la comp&#233;titivit&#233; des services
maritimes.
<p>
       Il est par ailleurs express&#233;ment pr&#233;vu que la Communaut&#233;
puisse dor&#233;navant apporter un concours sous forme de capitaux &#224; risques
et/ou de pr&ecirc;ts de la BEI. lors du financement des projets et des programmes
dans les secteurs relevant des transports maritimes.
<p>
<h4>Stabex</h4>
       Alors que la question Stabex s'est av&#233;r&#233;e comme &#233;tant l'une
des plus &#233;pineuses au cours de la n&#233;gociation de la Convention en 1989,
les propositions formul&#233;es par l'UE en vue de sa r&#233;vision  &#224; mi-
parcours ont &#233;t&#233; pour la plupart ais&#233;ment accept&#233;es par le
groupe ACP.  Les principales modifications au syst&#232;me concernent les points
suivants :
<ul>
<li>en cas d'insuffisance des ressources, aucune r&#233;duction
suppl&#233;mentaire ne sera appliqu&#233;e de ce fait, pour les Etats moins
d&#233;velopp&#233;s ou enclav&#233;s, lorsque la base du transfert est
inf&#233;rieure &#224; 2 MECU, et, pour les Etats insulaires, lorsqu'elle est      
inf&#233;rieure &#224; 1 MECU (article 194, nouveau paragraphe 5);
<p>
<li>les transferts peuvent &ecirc;tre utilis&#233;s en conformit&#233; avec des efforts
d'ajustement structurel et en appui &#224; toute politique coh&#233;rente de
r&#233;formes (article 209, paragraphe 4);
<p>
<li>les transferts seront &#224; l'avenir vers&#233;s sur un compte portant
int&#233;r&ecirc;t ouvert dans un Etat membre de la Communaut&#233; (article 211,
paragraphe 1).
</ul>
       Les ressources allou&#233;es au syst&#232;me au titre du second protocole
financier s'&#233;l&#232;vent &#224; 1 800 MECU (soit un accroissement de 20 %
par rapport au montant correspondant du premier protocole financier de la
Convention).
<p>
<A NAME="fin"><h3>Volet financier</h3></A>

       Dans la ligne de la tradition suivie dans toutes les n&#233;gociations
ant&#233;rieures, l'&#233;l&#233;ment sp&#233;cifique que repr&#233;sente le
protocole financier n'a &#233;t&#233; abord&#233; que dans la derni&#232;re phase
des travaux, c'est-&#224;-dire au d&#233;but de 1995 et apr&#232;s qu'aient
&#233;t&#233; identifi&#233;s les points les plus sensibles appel&#233;s &#224; faire
l'objet d'un "paquet" final.
<p>
       Dans le prolongement du Conseil europ&#233;en de Cannes, une offre portant
sur 14,6 milliards d'ECU a &#233;t&#233; faite aux Etats ACP et
ent&#233;rin&#233;e au terme du processus de n&#233;gociation.
<p>
       Le volume de ressources ainsi mis &#224; la disposition de la
coop&#233;ration ACP-UE pour la deuxi&#232;me phase de l'application de la
Convention repr&#233;sente une augmentation de 22 % en &#233;cus par rapport
&#224; celui aff&#233;rent &#224; la premi&#232;re p&#233;riode quinquennale (12
milliards d'&#233;cus); cet accroissement est plus substantiel (49 %) si on
&#233;value en dollars les deux montants respectifs; en tout &#233;tat de cause, il
contraste avec la tendance g&#233;n&#233;rale au recul des aides qui pr&#233;vaut
depuis quelques ann&#233;es tant sur le plan bilat&#233;ral que sur le plan
multilat&#233;ral. La r&#233;partition du nouveau protocole financier par grandes
masses est d&#233;taill&#233;e dans le tableau.
<p>
<h4>Aide programmable</h4>
       L'aide programmable, qui repr&#233;sente la majeure partie de l'apport
financier de la Communaut&#233; &#224; ses partenaires ACP et porte sur des
d&#233;penses dont l'affectation s'inscrit dans une certaine pr&#233;visibilit&#233;,
reste une caract&#233;ristique fondamentale de la coop&#233;ration ACP-CE.  Dans
le cadre du processus de r&#233;vision de la Convention, la volont&#233; de
renforcer le dialogue entre partenaires s'est traduite par des innovations au niveau
de ses objectifs et de ses modalit&#233;s, dont la programmation constitue toujours
une pi&#232;ce ma&icirc;tresse.
<p>
       Ainsi, un pas important a &#233;t&#233; accompli en direction des souhaits
de l'UE avec l'adjonction, &#224; l'article 4, de la prise en compte, dans le dialogue
avec chaque Etat ACP et en regard de la propre strat&#233;gie de
d&#233;veloppement de ce dernier, des objectifs et des priorit&#233;s de la politique
de coop&#233;ration de la Communaut&#233;.
<p>
       Ces objectifs et priorit&#233;s sont explicit&#233;s dans une d&#233;claration
de la Communaut&#233; (annexe III bis) qui en donne une &#233;num&#233;ration
directement inspir&#233;e de l'article 1 33U issu du Trait&#233; de Maastricht : le
d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique et social durable des pays en
d&#233;veloppement, leur insertion harmonieuse et progressive dans
l'&#233;conomie mondiale, la lutte contre la pauvret&#233;, le d&#233;veloppement
et la consolidation de la d&#233;mocratie et de l'Etat de droit ainsi que le respect des
droits de l'homme et des libert&#233;s fondamentales.
<p>
       Par le biais de ces nouvelles dispositions, il s'&#233;tablit ainsi une
compl&#233;mentarit&#233; des approches dans les fondements du dialogue sur les
politiques, appel&#233; d&#233;sormais &#224; combiner strat&#233;gie de
d&#233;veloppement de chaque Etat ACP et objectifs de coop&#233;ration de la
Communaut&#233;. Le nouvel article 281.2(a) et (b) y fait &#233;cho.
<p>
       En ce qui concerne les modalit&#233;s du dialogue, la programmation a
&#233;t&#233; assortie d'une plus grande flexibilit&#233; dans l'utilisation des
ressources qui en font l'objet, dans le double souci d'&#233;viter leur
st&#233;rilisation excessive et de donner une incitation &#224; la bonne performance
dans la mise en oeuvre des programmes indicatifs. Dans ce contexte, le principe
d'une programmation en deux tranches a &#233;t&#233; introduit dans les nouveaux
textes relatifs &#224; l'exercice de programmation (art. 281 et 282). Il se traduit par
le dispositif suivant :
<ul>
<li>au d&#233;but de la p&#233;riode de cinq ans couverte par le nouveau protocole
financier, la Communaut&#233; donne &#224; chaque Etat ACP une indication claire
de l'enveloppe financi&#232;re programmable totale dont il peut disposer au cours
de cette p&#233;riode;
<p>
<li>pr&#232;s un &#233;change de vues sur le projet de programme indicatif
&#233;tabli par le pays b&#233;n&#233;ficiaire, la Communaut&#233; et ce dernier
arr&ecirc;tent de commun accord le programme indicatif proprement dit, qui
pr&#233;cise le montant de la premi&#232;re tranche &#224; hauteur de 70 % de
l'enveloppe globale envisag&#233;e pour cinq ans;
<p>
<li>le programme indicatif, qui peut &ecirc;tre r&#233;vis&#233; &#224; la demande
de l'Etat ACP concern&#233;, est obligatoirement revu lorsque celui-ci a
r&#233;alis&#233; un niveau d'engagements &#233;lev&#233; dans la mise en
oeuvre du programme et, en tout &#233;tat de cause, au plus tard trois ans
apr&#232;s l'entr&#233;e en vigueur du second protocole financier;
<p>
<li>&#224; l'issue de la r&#233;vision du programme indicatif, les ressources
n&#233;cessaires &#224; son ach&#232;vement peuvent &ecirc;tre attribu&#233;es
en tenant d&ucirc;ment compte d'un certain nombre d'&#233;l&#233;ments, tels que
l'enveloppe indicative totale initiale, mais aussi les progr&#232;s r&#233;alis&#233;s
dans l'ex&#233;cution de la premi&#232;re tranche et l'&#233;tat de pr&#233;paration
des activit&#233;s envisag&#233;es dans le cadre de la seconde tranche.
</ul>
       Une d&#233;claration de la Communaut&#233; (annexe LXXXI) pr&#233;cise
que la notification des montants indicatifs ne s'appliquera pas aux Etats ACP avec
lesquels celle-ci a suspendu sa coop&#233;ration.  De m&ecirc;me, en ce qui
concerne les pays dans l'incapacit&#233; de signer ou de mettre en oeuvre leur
programme indicatif national, une partie des ressources y - aff&#233;rentes peut,
dans certaines conditions, &ecirc;tre d&#233;ploy&#233;e en faveur de la population
en vue d'une aide d'urgence, d'une aide humanitaire ou d'actions de
r&#233;habilitation (art. 254.3).
<p>
       Enfin, le nouvel article 283 invite la Communaut&#233; et les Etats ACP
&#224; prendre toutes les mesures n&#233;cessaires pour que le programme indicatif
soit adopt&#233; dans les douze mois suivant la signature du second protocole
financier.  Cela signifie que la programmation devra &ecirc;tre achev&#233;e au plus
tard fin octobre 1996.
<p>
<h4>Ajustement structurel</h4>
       Dans le domaine de l'ajustement structurel, un accord s'est rapidement
r&#233;alis&#233; sur l'essentiel des propositions formul&#233;es par les ACP, et
notamment celles tendant &#224; utiliser des ressources d'ajustement structurel pour
encourager les efforts d'int&#233;gration r&#233;gionale et appuyer les
r&#233;formes allant dans le sens d'une lib&#233;ralisation &#233;conomique intra-
r&#233;gionale, de m&ecirc;me qu'&#224; assouplir les proc&#233;dures.
<p>
       Les n&#233;gociations ont &#233;t&#233; plus laborieuses sur la
possibilit&#233; de mettre en oeuvre des aides budg&#233;taires directes pour les
pays &#224; monnaie convertible et librement transf&#233;rable; elles ont finalement
abouti &#224; un accord sur ce point (art. 224,d).

<h4>Banque europ&#233;enne d'investissement</h4>
       Pour ce qui est des interventions de la BEI, les principales innovations
concernent :
<ul>
<li>l'am&#233;lioration des proc&#233;dures de programmation : d&#233;sormais,
chaque Etat ACP obtiendra de la BEI une indication globale des ressources propres

<h4>Proc&#233;dures</h4>
       En ce qui concerne les proc&#233;dures de mise en oeuvre de la
coop&#233;ration pour le financement du d&#233;veloppement, th&#232;me qui a
constitu&#233; l'un des points les plus d&#233;licats de la discussion, la
conf&#233;rence minist&#233;rielle de cl&ocirc;ture des n&#233;gociations a
&#233;tabli une d&#233;claration commune (annexe LXXXII) par laquelle elle invite
notamment le Conseil des Ministres ACP-CE &#224; approfondir l'examen des
questions relatives &#224; l'attribution des march&#233;s et au r&ocirc;le des
organes d'ex&#233;cution, et, si n&#233;cessaire, &#224; les adapter pendant la
dur&#233;e du protocole financier. Les travaux du Conseil des Ministre &#224; cet
effet seront men&#233;s &#224; travers le Comit&#233; de coop&#233;ration pour
le financement du d&#233;veloppement institu&#233; par l'article 325 de la
Convention.
<p>
       Certaines dispositions relatives &#224; la participation aux march&#233;s
financ&#233;s par le FED dans les Etats ACP (art. 274, 294 et 296) ont par ailleurs
&#233;t&#233; modifi&#233;es de mani&#232;re &#224; permettre, &#224; titre de
r&#233;ciprocit&#233;, leur ouverture aux entreprises des PTOM.
<p>
Enfin, on notera le changement d'appellation du d&#233;l&#233;gu&#233; de la
Commission qui, d&#233;sormais, est d&#233;nomm&#233; "chef de
d&#233;l&#233;gation".
<p>
<h4>Dette</h4>
       En pr&#233;sence de l'extr&ecirc;me sensibilit&#233; manifest&#233;e par les
Etats ACP &#224; l'&#233;gard du probl&#232;me de la dette, la Communaut&#233;,
en d&#233;pit de l'impossibilit&#233; pour elle de satisfaire toutes leurs
requ&ecirc;tes tendant &#224; un annulation unilat&#233;rale de la part de l'UE, a
mis au point une d&#233;claration (annexe LXXXIV) par laquelle :
<ul>
<li>elle r&#233;affirme sa volont&#233; de contribuer de fa&#231;on concr&#232;te
et constructive &#224; l'all&#232;gement de la dette des Etats ACP,

<li>elle confirme sa d&#233;termination &#224; poursuivre les discussions sur ces
questions dans les instances appropri&#233;es (cela vise notamment les enceintes
internationales) et en tenant compte des difficult&#233;s particuli&#232;res des Etats
ACP,

<li>elle prend un engagement tout &#224; fait concret : celui de transformer en
subventions l'ensemble des pr&ecirc;ts sp&#233;ciaux non encore engag&#233;s au
titre des conventions pr&#233;c&#233;dentes; ces pr&ecirc;ts repr&#233;sentent un
montant de l'ordre de 135 MECU.
</ul>
       En ce qui concerne certaines perspectives ult&#233;rieures, on notera que,
pour les pays appel&#233;s, le cas &#233;ch&#233;ant, &#224; rejoindre le groupe
des Etats ACP, une &#233;volution potentielle a &#233;t&#233; d'ores et
d&#233;j&#224; m&#233;nag&#233;e pour l'Afrique du Sud (qui vient d'ouvrir des
n&#233;gociations avec l'UE en vue d'&#233;tablir des relations sp&#233;cifiques)
et la Somalie (qui n'avait pas ratifi&#233; la Convention sign&#233;e en 1989) : des
proc&#233;dures simplifi&#233;es ont &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;vues respectivement
&#224; l'article 364 et &#224; l'article 364 (bis) pour permettre &#224; ces deux pays
d'acc&#233;der, selon certaines conditions, &#224; la Convention r&#233;vis&#233;e
avant son entr&#233;e en vigueur.  On rappellera que cette entr&#233;e en vigueur
de l'ensemble de l'accord sign&#233; &#224; Maurice exige elle-m&ecirc;me sa
ratification par la totalit&#233; des Etats membres de l'UE et au moins deux-tiers des
Etats ACP (art. 360 et 366).

<b>The signature of the agreement on the revised Lom&#233; IV
Convention took place at the Mahatma Ghandi Institute in Moka
(Mauritius) on 4 November 1995. The ceremony was presided over by
Spanish Foreign Minister and European Council President, Javier
Solana Madariaga, and ACP Council President, Moi Avei who is Papua
New Guinea's National Planning Minister.  Also present were the
European Development Commissioner, Joþo De Deus Pinheiro, and
the Prime Minister of Mauritius, Sir Anerood Jugnauth. The sober
atmosphere was in marked contrast to the tropical splendour of
previous signing ceremonies in the Togolese capital, whilst first-rate
organisation gave those attending an opportunity to learn more about
the host country, widely recognised as a "model" partner in the
system of ACP-EU cooperation. The event brought together foreign
and development ministers, or their represenattives, from the 15 EU
states and 69 of the 70 ACP countries. The only absentee was
Somalia, which has not yet ratified Lom&#233; IV. South Africa
attended as an observer and possible future "member" of the
Convention. Negotiations on a special link for this country with the
Lom&#233; system are currently under way. The Mauritius meeting
was also an opportunity to begin dialogue on a matter of concern to
all the signatories, namely the future of the Convention itself. The
Prime Minister of Mauritius proposed that an ACP Summit be
organised as soon as possible, to be followed by an ACP-EU Summit
to discuss what should come after Lom&#233; IV.</b>
<p>
     The predominant feeling among the participants seems to have been
relief. Earlier fears of an impasse because of negotiating problems prior to
the agreement of 30 June in the ACP-EU Council of Ministers, had proved
unfounded. This relief was evident in a number of speeches delivered at
the signing ceremony. Another prominent theme in the official addresses
was the need for in-depth consideration of the future of EU/ACP
cooperation. Speakers recognised that the latter must adapt to a global
economic, political and commercial context which is very different from that
in existence when the system of cooperation began. The event began with
a speech of welcome from the Mauritian Foreign Minister, R. Jaddoo.
Addressing the meeting in French and English (a reflection of his own
country's multicultural character), he spoke of his apprehension in the face
of the uncertainties of the new world order. He referred specifically in this
context to the ending of the Cold War and the post-GATT trends,
expressing the hope that "the new creeds of ultra-liberalism and
mercantilism will not overwhelm ACP-EU cooperation".
<p>
<A NAME="cha"><h3>Change and continuity</h3></A>

     The second speaker, Commissioner Pinheiro, referred to the tough
negotiations that had led to the revised Convention. He emphasised that,
although the revision did not amount to a new accord, it nonetheless
represented a milestone. On the obstacles that had been encountered
during the negotiations, notably on the financial package, he paid tribute to
the determination and perseverance of the French presidency which had
striven to obtain a compromise satisfactory to the ACP countries. In his
view, the fact that, as a last resort, the matter had to be put to the
European Council (Heads of State and Government) for decision, should
not be seen in a negative light. It was rather an indication of the importance
that the EU attaches to its cooperation with ACP countries. Although
stressing that the negotiations were focused on devising a new financial
protocol, he underlined the importance of the change which had taken
place: a change whose principal message, perhaps paradoxically, was
continuity. This, he said, was reflected in the EU's willingness to support
the efforts of its ACP partners, as demonstrated by a 22% increase in ECU
resources for the next five-year period. In dollar terms (the currency used
in international transactions), this represented a 49% increase.
<p>
     He went on to stress, however, that the very "essence" of the
revised Convention lies in its "flexibility". Professor Pinheiro spoke of the
improved effectiveness of a system in which a first tranche (70% of the
financial resources earmarked for a country) is initially released, and the
remainder is made available later on the basis of how the initial allocation
has been deployed. He also praised the reinforcement of political dialogue
in the Lom&#233; system, with respect for democracy as an essential
element, and the reorientation of cooperation in the economic sphere
towards the private sector and competitiveness in the ACP countries. He
pointed to the fact that, in order to improve efficiency, the new Convention
rules required programming to take place in the 12 months following
signing. In conclusion, he urged those present to give thought to renewal of
the Convention when Lom&#233; IV expires.
<p>
     In a brief speech, the EU Council President, Mr Solana, offered a
similar analysis of the changes to the Convention, stressing the symbolic
value of EU-ACP cooperation. It is, he averred, "a unique model in the
world of international cooperation" and "proof of commitment" on the part
of Europe to living in harmony in the world. It represented, for him, what the
Caribbean poet and Nobel laureate, Derek Walcott, calls "the bread that
lasts when systems have decayed". On expansion of the political dialogue,
he stressed an innovation which he saw as crucial in terms of grassroots
participation, namely the provisions reinforcing the democratic nature of the
ACP-EU Joint Assembly. In future, ACP representatives will normally have
to be politicians who have been elected at a national or regional level in
their own countries. 
<p>
<A NAME="the"><h3>The scars of tough negotiations</h3></A>
<p>
     The speech by the ACP Council President, Moi Avei, focused on the
"scars" of what had been a tough negotiating round, and on the concerns
arising from this as to the Convention's future. In recognising the need for
change in a changing world, the speaker claimed nonetheless that
Lom&#233; resources provided to ACP countries amounted to just ECU 5.5
per capita over 5 years. Citing a commentator, he said that this amounts to
"two pints of beer and a packet of crisps in an average London pub." He
continued, "while the Lom&#233; Convention has been providing a
lunchtime beer for every ACP person, declining commodity prices have
been taking the food off their tables, and the debt service burden the shirts
off their backs". He was at least being frank. He questioned what the
Convention could do to bring the poorest people even slightly closer to the
seemingly inaccessible rich. He argued that during the 1980s, ACP
countries lost 100 billion dollars in export income owing to the collapse of
raw material prices. During the same period, total aid from all sources
received by the least developed countries did not exceed 50 billion.
Nevertheless, he said, there were sound arguments for opposing the
pessimists who claimed that Lom&#233; has failed. First, the Convention
should not be expected to deliver miracles. It was never intended to be the
sole tool of development but was only one of a number of tools. Moreover,
despite the difficult situation experienced in many ACP countries, on which
the media tended to focus, there was a series of countries in the Group
where ongoing efforts and Lom&#233; aid have resulted in success. The
discussions about removing a group of countries from the "least-developed"
list bore witness to this success, he stressed. And although Mauritius had
not originally been chosen to host the ceremony because of its value as an
example, it offered, nonetheless, concrete proof of this success. Mr Moi
Avei also used frank language in addressing the European co-President of
the ceremony when he commented that, in the past, the ACP countries had
been disappointed with the Community's interpretation of the Convention on
the delicate matter of human rights. It had, he said, unilaterally suspended
aid to certain countries, something which goes against the spirit and letter
of Lom&#233; cooperation. He also welcomed the innovative "suspension
clause", in the revised agreement but he stressed that great caution should
be exercised in applying it.
<p>
     On trade cooperation, Mr Moi Avei expressed pleasure at the
improved access to the European market for ACP products and at the
compensation offered by the EU for ACP losses resulting from the formerþs
implementation of GATT requirements. This compensation represented
25% of total losses and he was hopeful that the remainder would follow in
sequence, with the adaptation of Lom&#233;'s provisions to the results of
the Uruguay Round. The sense of relief referred to earlier was also obvious
in the ACP Council President's conclusion. "From an ACP standpoint," he
argued, "the outcome of the negotiations in relation to trade has been
satisfactory, which is far from what could have been reasonably anticipated
when the review opened".
<p>
     The Prime Minister of Mauritius then addressed the meeting,
referring to the emphasis that the revised Convention places on the private
sector, and expressing the hope that the European Investment Bank, the
Centre for Agricultural Development and the Technical Centre for
Agriculture and Rural Development would make a major contribution in this
area. He expressed a desire for greater cooperation between EU and ACP
businesses. The revised accord gives emphasis to poverty alleviation and
Sir Anerood spoke in favour of this, adding that a number of current
concepts needed rethinking. These, he suggested, included "development"
itself, which was too often restricted to economic growth indicators. Social
justice issues, he pointed out, were increasingly being recognised as a key
element of development, particularly in the wake of the Copenhagen
Summit. He described social justice as being of particular importance in a
multicultural country where any feeling of frustration or marginalisation of a
population group should be avoided. Perhaps the Prime Minister had his
own country in mind and the conflicting interests of ethnic groups which, a
few days later, were to result in his government's resignation.
<p>
     The first part of the ceremony before the actual signing closed with
a speech by Mauritius's Minister of Finance Ramakrishna Sithanen. He
gave strong support to the condemnation by the President of the ACP
Council of social injustice worldwide. The decline in international
development aid had been dramatic and was, according to him, a paradox
at a time when poor people needed it most of all to implement the reforms
called for on all sides. Looking to the future, he added that it was in the
interests of no one for the gulf between the few wealthy societies and the
poor masses to grow to the point where some would be prompted to take
up the "weapons of desperation". He called for reformulation of ACP-EU
cooperation as an "alliance" rather than a "partnership". In the same vein,
he delivered a series of criticisms and recommendations to the two sides.
He advised the ACP countries to accelerate the process of democratisation
and good governance, recommending closer ties between the public and
private sectors, and more efficient mobilisation of human resources, with
greater emphasis on development of science and technology. He also
spoke of the need for a balance between urban and rural environments,
greater commitment to information technologies and adequate measures for
encouraging saving on the domestic front, thereby attracting foreign capital.
Turning to Europe, the Minister made demands which may have been
interpreted as criticism of past failings. They should share their expertise
with ACP countries in areas such as infrastructure development,
telecommunications and information technologies, he argued. And they
should support developing countries in international fora such as the ILO or
the Bretton Woods institutions. He pointed out that the Lom&#233;
Convention had come into being at a time when Europe was seeking a
political identity to strengthen its international position and that the
Convention was seen as an ideal opportunity. At present, a new European
identity was emerging, characterised by a more compact body - economic
and monetary union with a common currency and a common security
policy. This body would still need the ACP countries to reinforce the single
European currency by participation in a kind of "ECU zone", which would
enable the two parties to confront competition with other regional blocs
more efficiently. Lastly, he suggested that a "Committee of the Wise"
should be set up forthwith to prepare an ACP Heads of State summit.
<p>
<A NAME="eff"><h3>Effectiveness called into question</h3></A>

     The signing ceremony in Mauritius came at the end of the 20th ACP-
EU joint ministerial session (meeting on 3 and 4 November 1995). The ACP
Group also staged its own Council meeting beginning on 1 November. It
was at this session that the Mauritian Prime Minister presented his analysis
of cooperation and first put forward the proposal for an ACP summit to look
at the future of the Convention. The idea was enlarged subsequently to
include a call for an ACP-EU summit as well.
<p>
     From the European side, Javier Solana and Joþo De Deus Pinheiro
were not empowered to make any definite commitment on the latter idea
(this would require a decision of the EC Council of Ministers) but they
greeted it positively, particularly since it echoed Mr Pinheiro's call for
thought to be given as to what should happen after Lom&#233; IV. Sir
Anerood Jugnauth made his proposal on the basis of an analysis of the
European perception of cooperation - a new philosophy of shared
responsibility for development which, he thought, had  supplanted the
"feeling of guilt of former colonial powers". He also observed, however, that
the cultures and political practices of poor countries are now stigmatised as
the major cause of their problems. Many European countries, he claimed,
no longer believed in the effectiveness of ACP-EU cooperation and their
interest is now turning towards Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean and the
Maghreb countries. He noted that during the last year, the EU had adopted
an integrated approach in its strategies vis  vis these regions only, without
associating the ACP countries. "This is not a good sign", argued Sir
Anerood, adding that the ACP states should increase their development
efforts tenfold in order to offset the consequences of the inward-looking and
nationalistic policies increasingly appearing within the EU. The mid-term
review negotiations, he claimed, amply demonstrated that the Union had
changed, with development aid being subordinated to political consider-
ations. It also demonstrated, however, that the ACP countries had matured
sufficiently for them to accept this new situation in a resolute manner, he
concluded.
<p>
     In discussions on the fringes of the main meeting, it was suggested
that the ACP Summit should be staged in 1996 with the proposed ACP-EU
gathering to discuss cooperation for the beginning of the next millennium
taking place the following year. However, the failure to appoint an ACP
Secretary General, which cast a shadow over the end of the Mauritius ACP
Council, will not help in the task of planning. The fact that this appointment
has had to be put off three times has destabilised the ACP bloc which has
had to operate for over a year in a state of limbo. It now appears that the
situation may remain unresolved for at least a further six months, until the
next Council meeting in Western Samoa. Three rounds of voting have failed
to break the deadlock between Tobias Mapuranga of Zimbabwe and
Marcel Ibinga of Gabon. Even in Mauritius, despite the fact that the ACP
Council meeting was extended to 5 November (it should have ended on
2 November), this thorny problem was not solved. The 39 votes obtained
by Mr Mapuranga, as against 22 for his opponent were insufficient, as he
needed to obtain two thirds of the overall vote to be elected. The Council
then decided to reject both candidatures and has called upon Southern and
Central Africa, who, through a system of rotation, should currently hold the
post, to propose a new name.
<p>
<A NAME="eme"><h3>Emergency measures</h3></A>

     Included in the important points on the agenda for the ACP-EU
Council of Ministers were transitional measures applicable from 1 March
1995, marking the expiry of Lom&#233; IV's first  financial protocol. The
purpose of this was to avoid to avoid a legal vacuum pending ratification of
the revised Convention by the signatory states. The Council also drew up
an interim protocol relating to the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden
to the European Union and adopted provisional measures to cover the
period leading up to ratification. As regards early implementation of the
provisions of the revised Convention, the ACP-EU Council of Ministers
delegated its powers to the ACP-EU Committee of Ambassadors, which will
define in detail the measures to be taken.
<p>
     Many other questions were on the agenda in addition to these points
relating directly to the Convention signature, including a review of the list of
least developed countries (45 in total), which had given rise to
disagreement between the two sides. The May 1994 ACP-EU Council had
decided to adapt this list to UN criteria. Eleven ACP countries, mainly in the
Caribbean and the Pacific, whose annual income exceeds $200 per
inhabitant, were to be excluded from it, which would cut them off from a
number of special EC aid facilities, with five countries having to be added
to the list (Angola, Liberia, Madagascar, Zaire and Zambia). In view of the
disadvantages which would arise from the removal of 11 countries from the
list (particularly Belize, which hitherto had received special aid intended for
landlocked and island countries), the EU undertook to grant a number of
them compensation. The practical measures in this respect are to be
defined by the ACP-EU Committee of Ambassadors and submitted to the
May 1996 ACP-EU Council. In another context, the Committee of
Ambassadors is also responsible for examining the case of Somalia which
has not been able to benefit from the 7th EDF since it has not ratified the
Lom&#233; Convention. The Joint Assembly has asked the Council to take
measures to rectify this state of affairs.
<p>
     Various points relating to commercial cooperation were also on the
agenda. These concerned agricultural commodities such as bananas, rum,
sugar and cocoa, as well the Stabex system. The ACP countries submitted
their request for maintenance of the 30% banana quota on the Community
market following expansion of the EU to 15 members. ACP producing
countries expressed concern about a possible European directive
authorising the use of vegetable butter instead of cocoa butter in chocolate,
but Union representatives gave an undertaking that such a decision was
not on the cards. On policy matters EU representatives opposed the
payment, demanded by Sudan, of its frozen Stabex transfers on grounds of
the lack of progress towards democracy in that country. A similar position
was taken as regards Zaire which had sought a thaw in relations.
<p>
<A NAME="sho"><h3>'Showcase' Mauritius</h3></A>

     The Convention's signature ceremony, hitherto always held in the
Togolese capital (Lom&#233;), was staged this time in Mauritius. The
significance of the venue chosen was not lost on the participants. This
peaceful island country in the Mascarene group has enjoyed dynamic
economic growth to emerge from a state of underdevelopment. The
ceremony was a modest one, marking a review of the Convention rather
than a full-blown renegotiation, but the changes introduced were
nonetheless important. Particularly significant were the new attitudes to
Europe-ACP cooperation which emerged in the negotiations.
<p>
     The watchword of the revised Lom&#233; IV is effectiveness and the
ceremonies which took place in Mauritius reflected this new emphasis on
efficiency. Without making the event too spartan, the organisers eschewed
elaborate and expensive arrangements. There was no brand new congress
hall and no triumphal arch. No new sections of road or five-star hotels were
built for the occasion. The signing ceremony and the two Council meetings,
as well as most of the other events, took place on the university campus,
amid the discreet charm of the small town of R&#233;duit. Reflecting the
host country's commitment to decentralisation (which is rare in developing
countries), the receptions and cultural activities were organised throughout
the island, in Port-Louis, Rempart, Curepipe, Vacoas and elsewhere.
<p>
     Only a few places were decorated for the occasion, notably the 
university, where the Council meetings took place, and the entrance to the
Mahatma Ghandi Institute. Decorations were discreet, consisting normally
of a few Mauritian flags. The banners of other countries were seen only
briefly, being unfurled when the signatories of the relevant nations took
centre stage to sign the accord. Despite the lack of fanfare, the people of
Mauritius offered their ACP and EU visitors a warm welcome, amply
demonstrating their interest in the event. The organising committee ran the
operation with smooth efficiency. In fact, at the time, a government crisis
was looming - it came to a head shortly after the guests departed. Yet this
did not in any way disrupt the smooth running of all the week's events. 
Calm management of a political crisis is indeed a good barometer of the
level of democratic development of a country.
<p>
     Although Mauritius had not been chosen specifically as a showcase
for the Convention, most commentators regarded it as such. Many referred
to the fact that, through proper utilisation of the Convention's sugar
protocol, this small country had achieved agricultural diversification. At the
same time, it has succeeded in developing its sugar production to the point
where it recently obtained a substantial increase in its European market
import quota. Diversification has spread to services and light industry and
now the country is in the throes of diversifying into high-tech products, such
as computer services.
<p>
     The podium which received the officials at the signing ceremony was
decked with bouquets of purple anthuriums. When Mauritius opted to use
the income generated by the Lom&#233; sugar protocol to diversify its
agricultural production, its first choice was to produce flowers, which it did
so successfully that it soon became the world's second largest exporter of
anthuriums. The host country is justifiably proud of its success - and it
chose to 'say it with flowers'. What better way to symbolise the launching
of Lom&#233; IV's second phase?

<P>
<B>European development  policy grew from the need  not to cut off
the former  colonies from their  &quot;mother countries&quot;
 through the formation of  the European Economic  Community. The
 &quot;association&quot; provided by  the Treaties of Rome  primarily
enable the duty  free access of goods  from the associated  countries
to the European  Union (EU).  Complementarily the first  European
Development  Fund (EDF) was set up; it  is still funded directly
by  the member states (not  from the EU budget).</B>
<P>
After the associated partners achieved their independence in the
early 60s, continuation of the special relationships was agreed
first in the conventions of Yaound&eacute; (1963 and 1969) and
after Great Britain's accession to the EC (1973) in the conventions
of Lom&eacute; prom 1975). The cooperation practised within the
framework of these agreements with by now 70 African, Pacific
and Caribbean (ACP) states represents the core of EU development
assistance and is regarded internationally as a model for North-South
cooperation.
<P>
The positive assessment of the Lom&eacute; cooperation is based
especially on the following characteristics:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Treaty character: The agreements bindingly lay down the
joint aims of the cooperation as well as the rights and obligations
of both contracting sides.
<P>
<li>Durability: The agreements have terms of several years
(in the past five, since Lom&eacute; IV 10 years), allowing calculable
cooperation.
<P>
<li>Supranationality: As agreements between regions, they overcome
bilateralism and give a measure of independence from national
convetousness.
<P>
<li>Ongoing dialogue: Negotiation, planning, programming and
control of development cooperation happen in bodies with parity
representation  the ACPEU Council of Ministers, the ACPEU Committee
of Ambassadors and the Joint Assembly.
<P>
<li>Broad cooperation approach: In addition to the usual projects
and programmes of financial and technical cooperation, the Lom&eacute;
cooperation encompasses trade advantages, commodity policy measures
(Stabex, Sysmin) and since Lom&eacute; IV also measures to support
structural adjustment efforts.
<P>
<li>High grant element: The grant element of the 6th EDF amounted
to 75 %. Because only nonrepayable grants are given, since Lom&eacute;
IV, with the exception of loans made by the European Investment
Bank (EIB), the grant element of the 7th EDF is 92 %.
<P>
<li>Above-average consideration for the least developed countries
(LDCs): 40 % of the disbursements of Official Development Assistance
(ODA) of the EU goes to LDCs, whereas the corresponding average
proportion of all OECD donors amounts to merely 25 %. But the
high LDC proportion must be seen less as a pluspoint than as a
structural deficit of European-African cooperation  it is no coincidence
that most of the former European colonies remained least developed
countries!</ul>
<P>
The mid-term review of the current Lom&eacute; IV Convention, completed
in early 1995, has prompted more fundamental debates and further-reaching
changes than earlier new negotiations of the agreement. For example,
EU and ACP states have agreed on inclusion of a democracy clause
in addition to the human rights clause, to the introduction of
&quot;special appropriations for Incentive building&quot; for
measures in areas the EU holds to be especially important (sustainable
development, private enterprise, environment policy, institutional
reforms) as well as intensification of the &quot;decentralized
cooperation&quot;, i. e. cooperation with semi or non-statal players.
In addition, the possibility was opened of stopping development
cooperation in case of human rights violations and bad governance,
the joint administration of funds was limited, and phased disbursements
and changed financing modalities for various instruments were
agreed (Stabex, structural adjustment financing, rehabilitation
measures).
<P>
Thus in respect of development cooperation procedures and instruments
Lom&eacute; cooperation is up to date. But in a more comprehensive
development policy sense much remains to be desired, especially
in regard to trade policy. The &quot;free trade&quot; striven
for was never achieved. The remaining trade policy advantages
of the ACP states vis-&agrave;-vis other developing countries are
increasingly being hollowed out by the general liberalisation
of world trade and the EU's foreign trade.
<P>
<B>Cooperation with other development regions</B>
<P>
The second regional focal area of EU development cooperation has
become cooperation with Mediterranean countries that are not members
of the EU (MTC). On the
basis of the &quot;Global Approach to Mediterranean Policy&quot;
worked out in 1972, cooperation agreements with open ended terms
were reached in the 1970s with individual countries. Budget funds
and EIB loans are made available within the framework of finance
protocols with terms of five years each. As a &quot;strategic
response&quot; to economic and demographic development and the
ecological threat in the Mediterranean region, the EU designed
a &quot;new Mediterranean policy&quot; in the early 90s aimed
at intensifying cooperation. There has been discussion since 1994
about a new &quot;Euro-Mediterranean partnership&quot; whose major
components are to be the &quot;Euro-Mediterranean Economic Area&quot;
(EMEA) and a &quot;Euro-Mediterranean Zone of Political Stability
and Security&quot; (analogous to the Conference on Security and
Cooperation on Europe, CSCE). Although cooperation with additional
developing countries was expanded, it remained far short of their
expectations, especially in regard to trade. Cooperation agreements
were entered with a large number of countries and regional organisations
of Asia and Latin America, especially in the 1980s. But they include
no pledges of financial aid. The funds made available &quot;autonomously&quot;
by the EU, i. e. funds annually taken from the budget without
a contractual basis, are reserved mainly for the poorest developing
countries of these regions. Nor will the proposals submitted by
the Commission at the end of 1994 on future relations with the
Mercosur of Latin America as well as Mexico and Chile and the
&quot;new Asia strategy&quot; change much in the relative low
ranking of these developing regions in the EU's development cooperation.
Rather, the agreements take account of the grown importance of
Latin America and Asia for foreign policy and trade.
<P>
Cooperation with east Europe began in the late 80s. The agreements
reached first with Poland (1988) and Hungary (1989), then with
all east European countries and the former USSR from 1990 to 1992,
provide a legal framework for cooperation and trade.

<P>
The shift in foreign and development policy priorities towards
the Mediterranean region and east Europe will increase further
in the years ahead. For the five-year term 1995-1999 the ACP states
received more than 13 billion ecus, central and east Europe 6,7
billion, the southern Mediterranean seabord countries 4,6 billion
and all Asian and Latin American countries together also 4,6 billion.
In content, an increasing convergence is discernible in all regional
development policies of the EU. Conceptual innovations (environment
and structural adjustment policy, promotion of democracy and human
rights, etc.) developed in the context of cooperation with a region
of developing countries, are being successively integrated in
the development cooperation with other developing regions.
<P>
<B>European development policy after Maastricht</B>
<P>
EU development cooperation policy receives a new dimension in
the context of
increasing Europeanisation. In the treaty on European Union adopted
in Maastricht in 1991 development cooperation policy is codified
for the first time as an area of policy in its own right (Title
XVII, Article 130uy). The treaty demands a development policy
that is complementary, coordinated between member states and the
Commission and coherent with other areas of policy. The
coordination demand (Art. 1 30x) gives rise to hope for administrative
simplifications, synergy and efficiency gains, reduction of bilateral
dependencies and possibly the abandonment of supply tying.
<P>
The Maastricht Treaty on European Union (Article 1 30u) commits
the development cooperation of the EU to &quot;foster&quot;:
<P>
<ul>
<li>the sustainable economic and social development of developing
countries, and particularly the most disadvantaged among them,
<P>
<li>the smooth and gradual integration of developing countries
into the world economy,
<P>
<li>the campaign against poverty in developing countries,
<P>
<li>the observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms,
and developing and consolidating democracy and the rule of law.</ul>
<P>
In a concept paper submitted by the Commission and adopted by
the Council as a &quot;Declaration&quot; rather than the usual
&quot;Resolution&quot;, the socalled &quot;Horizon 2000 Paper&quot;,
the aims are operationalised. Accordingly sustainable economic
and social development is to be reached by &quot;consistent liberalisation
of the economy&quot;. No precise definition is made of sustainability,
however, just as generally the outcome of the UN Conference on
Environment and Development (UNCED, Rio 1992) is left out of EU
considerations. Positive in the &quot;Horizon 2000 Paper&quot;
is that for the first time performance criteria are demanded to
complement the economic criteria for the allocation of EU aid,
and a solidarity treaty between Africa and the community is suggested.
<P>
<B>European development cooperation</B>
<P>
In its financial volume the development cooperation of the Commission
compares with that of a medium-size donor. The development cooperation
disbursements comprise about equally disbursements from the European
Development Fund (EDF, Lom&eacute; cooperation) and the budget
of the EU (see table).
<P>
The Maastricht treaty again reaffirms the 0,7 percent target of
the member states and the EU (see Art. 13u Para. 3) which, however,
few member states reach. In regard to the development cooperation
funds administered by the Commission, no significant increases
are to be expected in the foreseeable time, in fact disbursements
dropped in 1993 below the level of 1991.
<P>
How much greater the value of European development policy could
be overall if it were better coordinated becomes plain when one
looks at the disbursements of the Commission and the member states
together. With a share of more than 50 percent of the ODA given
worldwide the EU is then by far the biggest donor, followed by
the USA and Japan (1992) with 17 percent each.
<P>
Although the development cooperation of the EU remains flawed,
overall it must be positively assessed, however. It has brought
forth original instruments, especially within the framework of
the Lom&eacute; cooperation (export earnings stabilisation, fostership
of regional cooperation) and procedures of a model character (institutionalised
dialogue, contractual assurance of aid disbursements) which in
line with the findings and experiences of three development decades
were developed further. Just like most other bilateral donors,
the development cooperation of the EU must be accused of having
supported and stabilized for many years little development oriented
and sometimes even criminal regimes (&quot;collective clientelism&quot;).
It speaks in favour of the development policy of the EU that as
one of the first it began already in the 1980s to stop development
cooperation in especially bad cases and is trying actively with
socalled &quot;positive measures&quot; to promote respect for
human rights.
<P>
The biggest flaw of the EU's development cooperation is the unequal
treatment of the various regions of developing countries. As development
policies are Europeanised it will be important to &quot;globalize&quot;
the development policy of the EU, i. e. to &quot;Lom&eacute;ize&quot;
the development cooperation with Asia, Latin America and the MTC.
In these processes it will be important to introduce the dialogue and cooperation procedures as well as individual
instruments of the Lom&eacute; cooperation into the development
cooperation with the other regions of Third World countries (without
abandoning the financial emphases in favour especially of African
LDCs) and to develop and implement an appropriate &quot;global
policy&quot; coherent with trade and foreign policies.
<P>
<B>On the future of the Lom&eacute; cooperation</B>
<P>
The midterm review of Lom&eacute; IV has again shown the ability
of the contracting parties to engage in dialogue and of the Lom&eacute;
Convention to be developed further. Despite this, there are increasing
demands for ending the special relationships with the ACP states,
regarded increasingly as uninteresting in foreign policy and trade
terms. Commissioner Pinheiro has announced a &quot;radical reappraisal&quot;
of the Lom&eacute; cooperation for the near future. If this leads
to
<P>
<ul>
<li>the Lom&eacute; instruments being differentiated by development
status of the relevant respective recipient countries,
<P>
<li>other LDCs being given support as good and comprehensive
as that given the ACP states and above all
<P>
<li>the newly democratically legitimated development oriented
governments being given substantial support and aid being withdrawn
from criminal and corrupt regimes this is only to be welcomed
and lone overdue. But if these demands aim at letting the Lom&eacute;
Convention, the only meaningful North-South development pact,
run out and justifying the reduction of development cooperation
contributions, the credibility of the EU is at risk and development policy will be thrown back to square one. How can the North,
how can the EU demand far-reaching adjustment efforts from developing
countries without ever coming close to honouring their own pledges
(0,7 % target, environment-compatible production and living patterns,
etc.)? How should &quot;global policy&quot; be practised if not
as a dialogue between partners and in cooperation with all participants?
<P>
It is now more important than ever not to lever out the dialogue
and cooperation structures developed within the framework of the
Lom&eacute; Convention, but, on the contrary, to use them more
intensively and to expand this type of cooperation to other regions
of developing countries. EspecialIy in this regard the Lom&eacute;
cooperation is model for North-South cooperation.

<b>It took the Summit meeting of EU heads of government in Cannes, France on June 26-
27 for agreement finally to be reached on funding for the Lom&#233; IV second financial
protocol covering the next five years. A wrangle over the level of funding, traditionally
pooled from the pockets of the EU Member States, had held up talks on other improvements
to the Convention such as access to the EU market for ACP farm produce. Under pressure
from the French Presidency, Member States finally agreed on the sum of ECU 13.307 billion for the next five years. This includes a 1.28% share for the 20 Overseas Countries and
Territories (OCTs).</b>
<p>
        After a round of late night bargaining among Member States - and agreement by the
European Commission to scrape the bottom of its own 'barrel' with ECU 292 million of
'unallocated Lom&#233; resources' - the leaders of the European Union succeeded in
reaching the French Presidency's 'bare minimum' of ECU 13.3bn. This takes account of
inflation within the Union over the past five years (21.5%), but means no 'real' increase for
the 70 ACP countries this time round, despite the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden
to the EU since Lom&#233; IV came into operation.
<p>
        The final deal was reached after the French agreed to increase their national
contribution by another ECU 100 million with Germany finally consenting to give more than
last time despite originally seeking a nominal decrease. Britain, which said it wanted to shift
more of its overseas development contributions to its bilateral budget, also put more into the
'kitty' than it had originally envisaged. One result is that France now replaces Germany as
the number one contributor to the EDF. All other EU states except Britain are providing
more, in nominal terms, this time round (see Table 1).
<p>
        The deal was done in part thanks to decisions on EU development assistance packages
for other 'developing' regions - six Eastern and Central European nations in line for EU
membership and 12 Mediterranean nations with whom the EU has ambitions of creating a
giant Euro-Mediterranean free trade zone. In a typical piece of EU bartering, the German
government agreed to put a little more into the Lom&#233; pool following agreement on an
ECU 6.7bn package for Central and Eastern Europe over the period 1995-2000. Meanwhile,
some of the EU's Mediterranean nations (notably Spain and Italy) - content with an ECU
4.7bn aid deal covering the same period for their Mediterranean basin neighbours - were able
to agree to the ACP figure with some last-minute adjustments.
<p>
        ACP nations, who had sought a package of ECU 15.8 bn, notably to improve
processing, marketing, transformation and distribution of produce to hold their own in an
ever more competitive EU market, expressed initial disappointment. 'This is natural when
one receives less than one requested,' Papua New Guinea's information minister, John
Moms, told journalists.
<p>
        But the financial deal swiftly led to a special one-day meeting of EU and ACP
ministers on June 30 to tackle the outstanding matters in the mid-term review: more open
access to the EU market, tariff concessions, a declaration on the protection of tropical forests,
another on the alleviation of ACP debt, a compromise on methods of allocating development
funds and finally, a breakdown of the financial package for the next five years among the
different instruments of the Convention (see Table 2).
<p>
<a name="som"><h3>Some Trade Concessions</h3></a>
<p>
        Under the new arrangements, there will be better access to the EU market for ACP
farm products although it is less than the ACP group had hoped for. For numerous products
which currently do not qualify for any preference, customs duties and levies are reduced by
16% across the board. Excluded from this are highly sensitive items such as olives, olive
products, wine and lemons. The ACPs originally sought 36% tariff cuts.
<p>
        A 50% reduction of the current levy on 15 000 tonnes of cereals and 500 tonnes of
pork meat has been agreed. There are also numerous concessions for products currently
subject to quotas and reference quantities. The tariff quotas on fresh figs, sorghum and millet
are transformed into less restrictive 'ceilings', tariff quotas on sheep meat, poultry meat, milk
products pears and meat preparations are doubled and the quota for strawberries rises from
1500 to 1600 tonnes.
<p>
        Import duties on rice are reduced by 15% within existing quotas and 'reference
quantities' are abolished for all products except oranges and mandarins. There is also some
liberalisation in respect of a number of items that can only be exported to the EU at certain
times of the year. Finally, the export quotas for canned tuna and tuna loins are increased to
4000 and 500 tonnes respectively.
<p>
<a name="mor"><h3>More Cumulation for Regional Growth</h3></a>
<p>
        One innovation over the next five years is to allow other developing countries to
benefit from Lom&#233;'s 'cumulation clauses'. Thus, in the interests of more growth in
regional markets, 15% of the content of an ACP product can be 'cumulated' in a
neighbouring nation, yet still benefit from ACP preference. Some sensitive items including
canned tuna, rice, and certain textile products such as sweatshirts, are excluded from this
arrangement.
<p>
        EU and ACP ministers agreed at the 30 June meeting on a compromise list of
countries that will benefit from this system. In the Caribbean and Pacific areas, these are
Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Venezuela
and Nauru. In Africa, cumulation is extended to Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and
Tunisia, together with South Africa on an ad hoc basis pending the outcome of talks on its
possible 'qualified membership' of Lom&#233; IV. In this regard, the ministers also agreed
that South Africa will have automatic entry to the Convention  - on whatever terms are finally
agreed - once the negotiations have been completed, thereby avoiding the lengthy Lom&#233;
ratification process. 
<p>
<a name="two"><h3>Two Tranche Method</h3></a>
<p>
        With France keen to end its six-month period in the EU driving seat on a high note,
eleventh hour debate at the meeting on June 30, the final day of the French Presidency, also
resulted in compromise over the way in which funds are to be allocated under the 8th EDF.
The novelty is that 70% of the total will be distributed in an initial three-year tranche with
the remainder earmarked only after an assessment of how the first allocation has been spent.
<p>
        Development Commissioner, Professor Joþo de Deus Pinheiro, said that this method
was in keeping with the new Lom&#233; motto of 'efficiency and effectiveness' in promoting
aid: He added that the 'coordination and coherence' of aid with other donors and with
Member State bilateral programmes would also be watchwords for the coming five years. He
told journalists: 'The two-tranche procedure will give more to those who absorb money well.
There will be no more sterile funds in the Convention.'
<p>
<a name="deb"><h3>Debt, Forestry and Banana Declarations</h3></a>
<p>
        ACP states will be able to draw encouragement from a new declaration on debt in
Lom&#233; IV. There is, however, no formal commitment from the EU side to cancel debt.
The text reads: 'The Community reaffirms its willingness to contribute constructively and
actively to the alleviation of the debt burden of ACP States. In this context, it agrees to
transform into grants all the special loans of the previous Conventions which have not yet
been committed. The Community also confirms its determination to pursue the discussion of
these questions in the appropriate fora, taking account of the specific difficulties of the ACP
States.'
<p>
        Likewise, a general declaration on the protection of tropical forests will be inserted
in the Convention, but without the extra funds attached for their preservation which ACP
countries had requested at the outset. The new 'Protocol on Sustainable Management of
Forest Resources' refers to the use of 'relevant resources available under the Community
budget', notably funds from the national and regional indicative programmes, to halt
desertification and preserve forests.
<p>
        The protocol contains plenty of ideas of how funds can be used: conservation of
endangered forests shaped to the need of local populations, and 'buffer zones' to be set up
to assist the conservation, regeneration and sustainable development of tropical forests. Re-
afforestation, forestry management and the restoration of degraded forests could all attract
funding. So too can 'institution building', including training schemes for local people, forest
managers and researchers and support for organisations in the forestry sector.
<p>
        Most major ACP-EU meetings nowadays find it difficult to avoid discussion of the
thorny banana issue and the gathering on 30 June was no exception. Although no additional
funds were specifically set aside to improve the industry in the ACPs (notably in the
Caribbean) the ministers did agree a declaration on the subject. This stated that special
attention would be granted, 'when determining the volume of programmable assistance to
ACP banana suppliers to the EU, where external circumstances beyond their control have led
to the need for restructuring.'
<p>
<a name="hum"><h3>Human Rights Suspension Clause</h3></a>
<p>
        One of the most significant political changes was the introduction of a human rights
'suspension clause' in Article 366 of the Convention. This states that if any of the essential
human rights appearing in Article 5 are violated, the partial or total suspension of
development aid can follow. This can only happen, however, after prior consultation with
ACP nations and the abusing party, other than in particular 'emergency circumstances' which
are defined in a separate declaration. 
<p>
        The two sides also agreed that the ACP-EU political dialogue in the spheres of foreign
and security policy needed to be strengthened. Over the next five years, its is planned that
this should happen either with each of the three distinct Lom&#233; 'regions' or on a
thematic basis.
<p>
        Finally, mention should be made of the proposals concerning the Joint Assembly.
There was agreement that every effort should be made to have ACP countries represented
by parliamentarians - or at least by people designated by national parliaments - at the
Assembly's biannual meetings in order to emphasise the democratic nature of the institution.
Failing that, the participation of an ACP representative will have to meet with the prior
approval of the Assembly.
<p>
        The final stage in the 15-month-long 'mid-term review' will take place with the formal
signature of the amended Convention. Mauritius has offered to host the ceremony, which will
take place later this year.

<HR>
<P>
<B>Among the major principles of cooperation between the Community
and the ACP countries are acceptance of the sovereignty of the
partners and the design of projects in a dialogue of partners
with equal rights. Trade advantages are secure and predictable.</B>
<P>
Many former colonies achieved their independence in the 1960s.
The European Community perceived a duty to place trade and cooperation
with these states on new contractual foundations.
<P>
In 1964 it entered the first treaty of Yaounde with 17 African
states and Madagascar. Five years later followed the second Yaounde
Convention with a development budget of 843 million ecu. When
Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom joined the EC in 1973
there was agreement also to integrate their former colonies in
the joint trade and development policy. Apart from this historic
obligation, the cooperation between Europe and African, Caribbean
and Pacific states (ACP) was also driven by efforts to intensify
the North-South dialogue and promote the underdeveloped trade relations
among the ACP states.
<P>
<B>Lom&eacute; I</B>
<P>
A landmark in the cooperation of the European Community with the
ACP states is the Lom&eacute; Convention I signed on 28 February
1975. It made a major contribution to a new international economic
order. Special attention was given to the least developed countries.
For them Lom&eacute; I for the first time laid down precise regulations
in respect of the volume of aid and the acceleration of aid allocations.
Lom&eacute; I defined 24 of the 46 signatory states as least developed
countries. Five years later, in Lom&eacute; II, 35 countries were
so categorised, in Lom&eacute; III finally it was 43.
<P>
<B>Lom&eacute; II</B>
<P>
The number of Convention partners rose to 57 in Lom&eacute; II.
The European Community also modified the elements of its aid concept
and laid down certain focal areas.
<P>
<ul>
<li>Lom&eacute; II increasingly concentrated its technical
and financial aid on rural areas. The speed of approval and tying
of EDF grants slowed down. From these experiences the Community
drew conclusions for the Lom&eacute; III agreement and its support
instruments, signed in 1986.
<P>
<li>Africa was helped more than the Caribbean and Pacific states.
In Lom&eacute; I and 11 more than 70 per cent of the funds went
to West and East Africa. Aid for island and landlocked states
was also improved because they are especially disadvantaged by
geography.</ul>
<P>
<B>Lom&eacute; III</B>
<P>
The Lom&eacute; III Convention entered in 1986 increased the range
of ACP treaty partners by nine to 66 states. Lom&eacute; III ran
from 1985 to 1990 and disbursed 7.4 billion ecu in aid. The agreement
started a new trend:
<P>
<ul>
<li>More strongly than in the 70s the Community oriented itself
to focal aid sectors. In close exchange of views with each ACP
state one or two sectors were chosen for assistance. More emphasis
than under Lom&eacute; II was placed on rural development and
food security.
<P>
<li>In the infrastructure promotion sector the Lom&eacute;
aid shifted increasingly to projects serving the maintenance of
existing facilities (e.g. roads). This was because many of the
ACP states already possessed complete infrastructures, e.g. in
the transport sector. </ul>
<P>
Cultural cooperation was included in the agreement as a new field.
In 1986 the partners founded the ACPEEC Foundation in Brussels.
It receives funds from the European Development Fund and supports
studies, research and exchange projects in the cultural field
to advance intercultural dialogue.
<P>
<B>Lom&eacute; IV</B>
<P>
The most important innovation of the Lom&eacute; IV agreement,
which at the same time serves to consolidate successful policy,
is the extension of the term of the  agreement from five to 10
years. That means Lom&eacute; IV will run until the year 2000.
<P>
A big advance was also the increase of funds from 8.5 billion
ecu (Lom&eacute; III) to 12 billion ecu in the finance protocol
from 1990 to 1995. This not only took account of the devaluation
of money and the development of Gross National Product in the
Community, it was in fact a substantial increase in funding.
<P>
Lom&eacute; IV pays special attention to the debt problem of the
ACP states, even though the European Union is their smallest creditor,
which excludes it from directly influencing their debt status.
Many countries are already having to pay back more to the donor
countries than they received as support. Hence the Lom&eacute;
IV agreement contains measures to address the debt problem:
<P>
<ul>
<li> Almost all aid given (except that of the European Investment
Bank) is non-repayable.
<P>
<li>Loans became substantially cheaper. Interest of EIB loans
will in future be three to five per cent, instead of five to eight
per cent up to now.
<P>
<li>The European Union gives the ACP states finance-technical
aid, e.g. in debt management.</ul>
<P>
Into this context belongs the introduction of structural adjustment
aid which supports the economic recovery of the ACP states. This
aid is given in addition to the classical longterm development
projects.
<P>
Some completely new areas have been brought into the agreement:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Population pressure especially in Africa is increasingly
impeding development. Hence the agreement provides for population
policy measures: expansion of statistical services, information
and education campaigns. (For the first time the agree, ment also
contains a reference to voluntary family planning.)
<P>
<li>Promotion of the services sector.
<P>
<li>The importance of environmental protection is upgraded.
A special article on it bans the transport of toxic waste and
radioactive waste to the ACP states.
<P>
<li>Strengthening the private sector. Investments are protected
and promoted primarily with liable capital.</ul>
<P>
The development policy under Lom&eacute; IV increasingly supports
democratisation processes and respect for human rights. With funds
from the 7th EDF the EU supports young democracies in the ACP
states. Examples: In 1994 Mozambique received 13 million ecu to
buy materials for impending elections. The EU also supported the
organization of elections in Togo and Tanzania.
<P>
<B>European development policy in the 90s</B>
<P>
Meanwhile the world economy is undergoing important shifts in
emphases. An outstanding role is played by the results of the
GATT negotiations. The more trade barriers are removed worldwide,
the smaller the gain from the largely duty-free access of the ACP
states to the European internal market. Some ACP states are sceptical
whether they will be able to keep their already problematical
positions in the world market.
<P>
A second change concerns east Europe. More intensive EU relations
to the reforming states of east Europe have eased access to the
Single Market on the scale desired. In view of this, some ACP
states as early as 1990 voiced concern that the least developed
among them could fall even further behind. The European Union
must in future address these concerns and attempt solutions.
<P>
A third essential change for the development policy of the Union
arises from democratisation in South Africa. The responsible Commission
member Joao de Deus Pinheiro assigns to South Africa a key role
in the development policy of the European Union for the ACP states.
<P>
In the cooperation with the ACP states he intends consistently
to follow the maxims of his predecessor, Manuel Marin, and to
tie the allocation of aid to observance of human rights and democratisation.
The Commission is considering increasingly disbursing aid funds
in instalments and more strictly tying them to efficiency criteria.
<P>
<B>Development policy guidelines</B>
<P>
The European Commission continues to place special emphasis on
efficiency and transparency in implementing EU aid programmes.
<P>
Joao de Deus Pinheiro in March underlined his guidelines to representatives
of private European development organisations:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Governments should try to put in place fair competition
conditions for private enterprise. Their control activity in private
business decisions should be reduced to a minimum.
<P>
<li>The major foundation for a functioning market economy is
a viable capital market.
<P>
<li>Stronger growth of investments from home and abroad is
urgently needed.</ul>
<P>
<B>The future of ACP-EU cooperation</B>
<P>
In December 1994, the South African minister for trade and industry,
Trevor Manuel, took part for the first time in the joint ACP-EU
talks in Brussels. Manuel emphasised that his country felt more
comfortable surrounded by developing countries than in a club
of industrial countries.
<P>
South Africa is economically much stronger than the ACP states.
But its national economy is dependent on the export of mining
products and its industry is not internationally competitive.
The great majority of its black population, even after the end
of racial segregation, live in poverty.
<P>
Even before apartheid went, the European Union worked towards
political changes in South Africa. It stood by the victims of
racial segregation through international aid agencies. The EU
supports the democratisation process in two ways:
<P>
<ul>
<li>The Union promoted the April 1994 elections which made
Nelson Mandela president by helping with preparations and observation.
<P>
<li>The Union is aiding the transition to a democratic society
with a cooperation agreement. An interim agreement was signed
in October 1994 and approved by the Council in December. At the
same time negotiations began about comprehensive and longterm
relations.</ul>
<P>
In March 1995 the Council decided to take on guarantees for EIB
loans for projects in South Africa. At the same time it mandated
the Commission to negotiate further agreements with South Africa.
The EU is following a twopronged approach here:
<P>
<ul>
<li>A protocol added to the Lom&eacute; Convention will lay
down the conditions for South Africa's accession. The decision
on it will be made by the ACP-EU Council of Ministers. South Africa
will participate in all cooperations as laid down in the second
part of the Convention. For everything going beyond that (e.g.
Stabex and Sysmin) South Africa's special situation has to be taken into account.
<P>
<li>In addition the Union seeks a trade and cooperation agreement
with Sauth Africa. Its longterm aim is establishment of a free
trade zone.</ul>
<P>
The Commission will make available another 500 million ecu for
the years 1996 to 1999 in the framework of the European Programme
for Reconstruction and Development (EPRD).
<P>
South Africa's inclusion in the Lom&eacute; Convention primarily
is to serve the interests of the ACP states. In the view of the
European Commission South Africa could become the &quot;powerhouse&quot;
of the ACP states' development in its region and beyond.
<P>
<B>Perspectives of joint development policy</B>
<P>
The framework conditions for the cooperation between ACP states
and the European Union have changed. A meaningful partnership
must take that into account and adjust. Some areas in which modifications
will be needed are already becoming apparent.
<P>
<B>Trade. </B>Experience has shown that easing trade alone is
not enough to develop the ACP states. Rather, their export industry
has to become competitive. That requires the instruments of the
Lom&eacute; Convention to be expanded so as to stimulate investment
in the ACP states, support the private sector and so strengthen
competitiveness. 
<P>
<B>Politics. </B>Regional conflicts have proved the decisive impediment
to successful development of the ACP states. The agreement of
Lom&eacute; and the Treaty of Maastricht (strengthening joint
foreign and security policy of EU members) will make for more
effective policy in future to be able to address such conflicts
by diplomatic means. 
<P>
The Lom&eacute; Convention after 2000: The developing countries
have so far been perceived as a homogeneous group whose problems
could be solved with a few &quot;patent medicines&quot;. In reality,
country-specific problems and needs will have to be considered
more strongly.
<P>
It is also necessary to improve the interaction and coordination
of the various instruments. It is the only way to achieve highest
efficiency. In the view of the Commission, bilateral development
aid is a necessary complement, but it can never replace a multilateral
agreement like the Convention of Lom&eacute;.

<H3>Abstract:<P>
</H3>
This article surveys the so-called Mid Term Review of the Fourth Lomé Convention (between the European Union and some seventy developing countries), concluded in November 1995. Among the results are some of the most far-reaching changes in the relations between the EU and the Thirld World. Furthermore they provide an illustration of the current trends in European development cooperation policy, i.e. a more business-like approach; more emphasis on efficiency and effectiveness; a growing attention for countries in the own region; and application of stricter (political) conditions.

<P>
<B>Van oudsher onderhoudt
de Europese Gemeenschap/Unie<a href = "#1">(1)</a> betrekkingen met ontwikkelingslanden
in Afrika, het Caribisch gebied en de Stille Oceaan. Deze zg.
ACS-groep bestaat uit 70 voormalige koloni&euml;n en andere gebieden,
met Eritrea als laatst toegetreden land. De regelingen betreffen
handel en ontwikkelingssamenwerking en zijn sinds 1975 gedetailleerd
omschreven in steeds vernieuwde versies van het Lom&eacute;-verdrag.
Thans is dat in zijn vierde versie van kracht en beslaat het voor
het eerst in principe een periode van tien jaar (1990-2000).<a href = "#2">(2)</a></B>
<P>
<a name=inleiding></a><B>Inleiding</B>
<P>
Het
Financi&euml;le Protocol, waarin de EG-lidstaten zich vastleggen
een bepaald bedrag ter beschikking te stellen voor de uitvoering
van `Lom&eacute;', heeft echter nog steeds een looptijd van vijf
jaar, zoals voorheen voor het hele verdrag gebruikelijk was. In
plaats van heronderhandeling van het hele verdrag bood Lom&eacute;
IV (art. 366) partijen de mogelijkheid alleen bepaalde artikelen
v&oacute;&oacute;r afloop van de eerste vijf-jaarperiode voor
wijziging voor te dragen. Formele onderhandelingen hierover tussen
de ACS-landen en de EG, beter bekend als de Mid Term Review (MTR)
van Lom&eacute; IV, gingen in november 1994 van start.
<P>
 Als de
aandacht die nationale en internationale media aan de heronderhandelingen
hebben besteed een graadmeter zou zijn voor de toekomst van het
Lom&eacute;-verdrag, dan zag die er zeker niet rooskleurig uit.
Het MTR-proces zelf, zijn uitkomst (ook wel `Lom&eacute; IV-bis'
genoemd) en de ondertekening van de behaalde resultaten op 4 november
1995 op Mauritius zijn grotendeels in stilte voorbijgegaan. Dat
valt te betreuren. Enkele veranderingen die voor de tweede fase
van Lom&eacute; IV zijn overeengekomen, zijn namelijk de meest
v&eacute;rgaande tot nu toe in de betrekkingen tussen de ACS-landen
en de EG en zullen deze in verscheidene opzichten van aard doen
veranderen. Ook illustreren zij algemene trends in het Europese
ontwikkelingssamenwerkingsbeleid: grotere zakelijkheid, meer nadruk
op effectiviteit en doelmatigheid, stijgende aandacht voor landen
in de eigen regio en toepassing van steeds sterkere (vooral ook
`politieke') conditionaliteit.
<P>
<a name=mid></a><B>Het Mid Term Review proces </B>
<P>
Ten tijde
van de totstandkoming van Lom&eacute; IV eind 1989 dachten velen
dat de MTR vooral een pro-forma exercitie zou worden, en dat er
voor de tweede fase van het verdrag, behalve het Financi&euml;le
Protocol, weinig zou veranderen. Hoewel het bereiken van overeenstemming
binnen de EG over dat Protocol inderdaad een grote invloed op
het verloop van de MTR heeft gehad,<a href = "#3">(3)</a> werd echter steeds duidelijker
dat ook bepaalde fundamenten van de Lom&eacute;-samenwerking aan
de orde gesteld zouden gaan worden. Deze wijziging ten opzichte
van de oorspronkelijke verwachtingen, en wellicht bedoelingen,
heeft alles te maken met de veranderingen die zich de afgelopen
vijf jaar in de wereld hebben voorgedaan. Het klimaat voor internationale
economische en politieke samenwerking is na het einde van de Koude
Oorlog ingrijpend veranderd. Voor de Europese Gemeenschap c.q.
Unie in het bijzonder begon een nieuw tijdperk, gekenmerkt door
steeds intensievere banden met derde landen in de eigen regio,
zowel uit het voormalige Oostblok als rond de Middellandse Zee.
Het Zuiden, in het bijzonder Afrika, verloor sterk aan geopolitiek
belang. Hoewel de Commissie en Raad hun best doen te ontkennen
dat de ontluikende relaties met de nieuwe samenwerkingspartners
een negatief effect zouden hebben op die met de traditionele partners,
in het bijzonder Afrika c.q. de ACS, lijkt dit in de praktijk
wel het geval te zijn; al was het maar omdat het beschikbare budget
voor ontwikkelingssamenwerking en externe betrekkingen op het
niveau van de Europese Unie in het algemeen geen gelijke tred
houdt met mondiale en regionale veranderingen.
<P>
Andere factoren
die een rol spelen in de veranderende verhoudingen zijn het gebrek
aan concrete en grootscheepse resultaten van decennia Europees
ontwikkelingsbeleid, inclusief het Lom&eacute;-verdrag, en een
daaruit voortkomende druk de hulp effectiever te laten worden;
en de nieuwe titel met betrekking tot ontwikkelingssamenwerking
in het Verdrag van Maastricht, waarin nieuwe prioriteiten worden
gesteld, waarvan de precieze uitwerking en consequenties nog niet
helemaal helder zijn.<a href = "#4">(4)</a> Het moge duidelijk zijn dat onder deze
omstandigheden de Mid Term Review, vooral voor de Europese Gemeenschap,
een steeds welkomer gelegenheid ging vormen nieuwe inzichten ten
aanzien van ontwikkelingssamenwerking aan de orde te stellen.
<P>
De inhoudelijke MTR-onderhandelingen over belangrijke aspecten,
zoals striktere procedures voor en condities aan Lom&eacute;-ontwikkelingshulp,
verliepen in eerste instantie verrassend voorspoedig. Eind 1994
was er al overeenstemming op hoofdlijnen bereikt over essenti&euml;le
en ingrijpende wijzigingen, zoals het beginsel van tranchering
van hulp en het opnemen in het verdrag van een nieuwe mensenrechtenbepaling,
met daaraan gekoppeld een opschortingsclausule. De verwachting
dat de MTR begin 1995 zou kunnen worden afgerond werd echter doorkruist
door de grote onenigheid tussen EG-lidstaten over de bijdragen
aan het achtste Europees Ontwikkelings Fonds (EOF), het financi&euml;le
pakket dat uitvoering van de tweede fase van Lom&eacute; IV mogelijk
moet maken. Voor de eerste termijn van Lom&eacute; IV was destijds
een bedrag van 10,8 miljard ECU ter beschikking gesteld.<a href = "#5">(5)</a> De ACS-landen
vonden dat dit bedrag verhoogd moest worden tot 19 miljard ECU,
onder verwijzing naar hun algehele economische situatie, de inflatie,
de schuldenproblematiek, de toetreding van nieuwe landen tot de
ACS-groep, zoals Namibi&euml; en Eritrea, en de recente uitbreiding
van de Europese Unie.<a href = "#6">(6)</a> De Commissie, gesteund door Frankrijk,
dat het Voorzitterschap bekleedde, stelde ruim 14 miljard ECU
voor, mede in het licht van eerder toegekende bedragen ten gunste
van andere regio's in de wereld (Azi&euml;, Zuid-Amerika, het
Middellandse-Zeegebied en Oost-Europa).
<P>
De lidstaten kwamen in
eerste instantie echter niet eens aan het bedrag van het vorige
EOF. Vooral het Verenigd Koninkrijk en in mindere mate Duitsland
(samen goed voor bijna 40% van de Lom&eacute;-hulp)<a href = "#7">(7)</a> wilden hun
bijdragen aan het EOF verminderen ten gunste van hun bilaterale
hulp-programma's. Itali&euml; en Nederland leken niet bereid hun
bijdragen te verhogen. De elf andere lidstaten gingen akkoord
met het dragen van hun reguliere deel om het door de Commissie
en Frankrijk voorgestelde totaal te halen, maar waren niet bereid
meer te betalen om eventuele verminderde bijdragen van anderen
op te vangen. Toen er half februari 1995 nog steeds maar een krappe
12 miljard ECU leek in te zitten, werden de MTR-onderhandelingen
met de ACS zelfs opgeschort, omdat de Franse minister van buitenlandse
zaken Jupp&eacute; weigerde `met dat &quot;politieke signaal&quot;
bij de ACS-landen aan te kloppen'.<a href = "#8">(8)</a>
<P>
Daarna mengden andere actoren
zich in de discussie, onder meer een delegatie van de Paritaire
Vergadering en wat later haar twee co-presidenten, het NGO-Liaison
Comit&eacute; &#190; dat zeer sterk aandrong op een gullere houding
van Europa &#190; en natuurlijk de ACS-groep zelf. Uiteindelijk
werd echter pas tijdens de Europese Raad van Cannes op 26 en 27
juni 1995 overeenstemming bereikt over het nieuwe Financi&euml;le
Protocol. Dit verlossend besluit maakte hervatting van de MTR
mogelijk, wat dan ook vrijwel onmiddellijk gebeurde (op vrijdagmiddag
30 juni in Brussel). Twintig minuten voor het einde van het Franse
Voorzitterschap, even voor middernacht op 30 juni 1995, kon de
MTR dan toch worden afgerond. De compromis-uitkomst met betrekking
tot het achtste EOF houdt in dat voor de periode 1996-2000 het
EOF bijna 13 miljard ECU zal bedragen,<a href = "#9">(9)</a> ten opzichte van 1990
een nominale stijging van bijna 22%, net genoeg om de inflatie
te niet te doen, maar geen re&euml;le stijging.<a href = "#10">(10)</a> Voor het eerst
in de geschiedenis van Lom&eacute; zijn de ACS-landen er dus niet
in geslaagd een materi&euml;le verhoging van het hulpniveau te
bereiken. Een minimale uitkomst, die veel kritiek heeft gekregen,
bijvoorbeeld van het Europees Parlement, de Paritaire Vergadering
en uit de ACS-hoek.
<P>
<a name=handel></a><B>Handel
<P></B>
De handelsparagraaf van Lom&eacute;
lijkt bij uitstek een terrein voor verbetering. Ondanks het feit
dat handelsbevordering een belangrijke doelstelling van het verdrag
vormt, is immers maar een enkel ACS-land erin geslaagd zijn export
naar de EG of andere ACS-landen metterdaad te vergroten. In de
praktijk blijft het voor de meeste landen moeilijk goed gebruik
te maken van de preferenties van Lom&eacute;, in het bijzonder
voor zover het niet gaat om onbewerkte grondstoffen. Oorzaken
liggen gedeeltelijk aan de kant van de ACS en betreffen dan economische
structuur of een gebrek aan aandacht voor of succes met diversificatie,
en gedeeltelijk aan de kant van de EG en haar lidstaten. Vooral
het protectionistisch Europese landbouwbeleid en de regels van
oorsprong, die bepalen dat een produkt voor een groot deel in
het desbetreffend ACS-land moet zijn geproduceerd om in aanmerking
te komen voor preferenti&euml;le behandeling, blijken vaak een
barri&egrave;re. 
<P>
De MTR-onderhandelingen over de handelsvoorwaarden
voor landbouwprodukten van de ACS-landen verliepen grotendeels
volgens hetzelfde moeizame patroon dat zich in de onderhandelingen
voor Lom&eacute; III en IV (eerste fase) al had afgetekend. De
Noord-Zuidtegenstelling binnen de EG kwam weer sterk naar voren:
Itali&euml;, Griekenland en Spanje waren sterk tegen verdere concessies
voor ACS-landbouwprodukten vanwege de concurrentie met hun eigen
produkten. Duitsland, het Verenigd Koninkrijk, Nederland, Denemarken
en ook de nieuwe lidstaten Zweden, Finland en Oostenrijk waren
juist voor verdergaande preferenties. Het eindresultaat omvat
kleine verbeteringen in de regels voor toegang en eventuele tarieven
of quota voor ACS-landbouwprodukten. Gevoelige produkten, zoals
olijven, olijfolie, citroenen en wijn zijn hiervan uitgezonderd.
<P>
Ook met betrekking tot de regels van oorsprong werd lichte vooruitgang
geboekt. De ACS-landen hadden een verruiming voorgesteld om het
mogelijk te maken produkten die voor een substantieel deel van
oorsprong zijn in een willekeurig niet-ACS-ontwikkelingsland toch
als ACS-produkt te beschouwen en dus in aanmerking te laten komen
voor preferenti&euml;le behandeling. Volgens `Lom&eacute; IV eerste
fase' mocht in dat verband hooguit 10% van de waarde van het desbetreffende
produkt uit een niet-ACS-land komen. Deze beperking is nu (onder
bepaalde minimumvoorwaarden) volledig opgeheven voor produkten,
of onderdelen daarvan, uit `een tot een coherente geografische
eenheid behorend aangrenzend ontwikkelingsland dat geen ACS-land
is'.<a href = "#11">(11)</a> Hoewel de ACS-inzet van uitbreiding naar alle ontwikkelingslanden
niet gehaald is, is er toch sprake van een werkelijke verbetering,
die wellicht kan bijdragen tot groei van regionale markten en
samenwerking. 
<P>
Op een aantal andere, naar het lijkt iets minder
belangrijke, ACS-wensen is de EG schoorvoetend ingegaan: de fondsen
voor Stabex werden verhoogd van 1,5 tot 1,8 miljard ECU, terwijl
er een gemeenschappelijke ACS-EG-verklaring werd aangenomen over
het controversi&euml;le vraagstuk van bananen, waarin de Gemeenschap
zich vastgelegd heeft bij het bepalen van de omvang van de programmeerbare
steun voor leveranciers van ACS-bananen speciaal te letten op
de eventuele externe negatieve omstandigheden buiten hun wil.
<P>
<a name=hulp></a><B>Hulp</B>
<P>
Vaststelling van de omvang van het achtste EOF bleek dus een zeer
moeizaam proces, dat uiteindelijk slechts een minimale uitkomst
opleverde. De Mid Term Review zelf heeft op het gebied van ontwikkelingssamenwerking
tot een aantal wijzigingen geleid, waarvan de tranchering van
hulp ongetwijfeld de meest ingrijpende is. Aan het begin van ieder
nieuw Lom&eacute;-verdrag wordt normaliter het totale beschikbare
hulpbedrag voor elk ACS-land vastgesteld. In onderling overleg
wordt het zg. Nationaal Indicatief Programma (NIP) opgesteld,
dat in grote lijnen aangeeft hoe men Lom&eacute;-hulp denkt te
gaan gebruiken. Het NIP beschrijft o.a. de algemene ontwikkelingsdoelstellingen
en -prioriteiten, concentratiesectoren, en uit Lom&eacute;-hulp
te financieren projecten en programma's. Tot nog toe was het beschikbaar
hulpbedrag per ACS-land zo goed als onaantastbaar in de zin dat
het totaal als het ware uitgekeerd moest worden (op project- of
programmabasis) zonder serieuze evaluatie of er een bijdrage aan
verwezenlijking van de in het NIP geformuleerde doelstellingen
was geleverd of redelijkerwijs viel te verwachten. Het inspanningsniveau
en de houding van het desbetreffende ACS-land speelden nauwelijks
een rol. In de praktijk leidde dit tot situaties waar Lom&eacute;-hulp
niet altijd effici&euml;nt gebruikt werd. Als een ACS-land er
door wat voor omstandigheden dan ook niet in slaagde het volledige
hulpbedrag te absorberen, bijvoorbeeld door slecht bestuur, oorlogsomstandigheden
of bij opschorting van Lom&eacute;-hulp wegens schendingen van
mensenrechten, dan bleef het voor dat land beschikbaar gestelde
bedrag geblokkeerd onder het NIP en kon het dus niet voor andere
doeleinden, zelfs niet voor bijvoorbeeld noodhulp voor hetzelfde
ACS-land, gebruikt worden.<a href = "#12">(12)</a> Zo kon het gebeuren dat er in 1994
voor Rwanda geen noodhulp uit het EOF meer beschikbaar was, terwijl
het land nog wel recht had op grote bedragen onder andere EOF-begrotingsposten,
die echter niet aangesproken konden worden. 
<P>
Om deze rigiditeit
te doorbreken is nu voor de tweede fase van Lom&eacute; IV het
trancheringsbeginsel ge&iuml;ntroduceerd. Dit houdt in dat de
in principe beschikbare hulp per ACS-land in twee tranches wordt
verdeeld. De eerste tranche bedraagt 70% en komt onmiddellijk
na vaststelling van het NIP vrij. Uiterlijk drie jaar na het van
kracht worden van het tweede Financieel Protocol, of zoveel eerder
als een ACS-land eraan toe is, zal het NIP worden ge&euml;valueerd
en herzien. De tweede tranche zal alleen worden toegewezen bij
een positieve evaluatie van de uitvoering van het lopend NIP.
Na de herziening, of aan het eind van de looptijd
van het Financieel
Protocol, kunnen alle niet toegewezen programmeerbare middelen
volgens de zeer ruime formulering van art. 282(5) gebruikt worden
voor de financiering van activiteiten in het toepassingsgebied
van samenwerking inzake ontwikkelingsfinanciering.
<P>
Het trancheringsprincipe
vergroot de greep van de Commissie op de uitvoeringsprocedures
voor ontwikkelingssamenwerking onder het Lom&eacute;-verdrag en
behelst een zeker toezichtselement op ACS-beleid en de uitvoering
daarvan. Het zou in de praktijk echter nieuwe problemen kunnen
opleveren, bijvoorbeeld voor nationale langere-termijnplanning
aan de kant van de ACS en wat betreft de management- en evaluatiecapaciteit
binnen de Commissie. Toch lijken de voordelen van grotere flexibiliteit
en de nieuwe mogelijkheid goed beleid te belonen op te wegen tegen
de eventuele risico's. Tranchering van hulp, gekoppeld aan concrete
en in onderling overleg opgestelde NIP's, vormt een stap in de
richting van een meer contractuele aanpak. Mits inhoudelijk goed
en, voor zover mogelijk, in onderling overleg tussen ACS en EG
en politiek neutraal uitgevoerd, lijken de intensievere dialoog
en grotere duidelijkheid en voorspelbaarheid die deze mogelijk
zullen opleveren, in het voordeel van alle betrokken partijen.
<P>
<a name=politieke></a><B>Politieke dialoog, mensenrechten en democratie</B>
<P>
De wens tot een intensievere
ACS-EG-beleidsdialoog te komen loopt als een rode draad door alle
nieuwe bepalingen van `Lom&eacute; IV-bis'. Aan de preambule is
een overweging toegevoegd die uitbreiding van die dialoog voorstaat
tot buitenlands beleid en veiligheid, alsmede kwesties van algemeen
en/of gemeenschappelijk belang. Een ander voorbeeld is de nieuwe
ontwikkelingssamenwerkingsprocedure.
<P>
Een potentieel nog ingrijpender
serie veranderingen op dit gebied is te vinden in de nieuwe versie
van art. 5, dat de relatie beschrijft tussen samenwerking onder
het Lom&eacute;-verdrag en mensenrechten. De eerbiediging van
mensenrechten &#190; maar met ingang van Lom&eacute; IV-bis ook
van de democratische beginselen en die van de rechtsstaat &#190;
vormt nu een `essentieel onderdeel' van het verdrag. Behoorlijk
bestuur wordt wel genoemd als bijzonder doel van samenwerkingsmaatregelen,
maar is niet als `essentieel onderdeel' aangeduid. Hoewel wordt
benadrukt dat de Lom&eacute;-samenwerking vooral op positieve
wijze een bijdrage dient te leveren aan verwezenlijking van fundamentele
waarden en uitgangspunten, is voor het eerst ook een opschortingsprocedure
in het verdrag opgenomen (art. 366 bis). Die maakt het mogelijk
de toepassing van het Lom&eacute;-verdrag te schorsen bij schending
van art. 5. Dit kan alleen gebeuren wanneer een ACS-EG-consultatieprocedure
heeft plaatsgevonden, die aanhangig gemaakt kan worden door een
willekeurige verdragspartij die van mening is dat een andere partij
een uit art. 5 voortvloeiende verplichting niet is nagekomen.
Zowel de vertegenwoordiging van ACS en EG in als de duur van deze
procedure is nauwkeurig omschreven in het verdrag.
<P>
Het nieuwe
art. 5 legt gedeeltelijk schriftelijk vast wat al een ruime periode
het (ad-hoc) EG-beleid in de praktijk was. Uitbreiding van de
conditionaliteit van mensenrechten naar democratie en de rechtsstaat
was onvermijdelijk, en loopt geheel parallel met de ontwikkelingen
in de betrekkingen met andere derde landen. Het is verstandig
dat behoorlijk bestuur een minder sterke status heeft gekregen,
aangezien dit nog moeilijker te defini&euml;ren valt dan de andere
elementen en een veel te grote marge van subjectiviteit in zich
draagt. Ook wat betreft de invulling van de begrippen `mensenrechten',
`democratie' en `rechtsstaat' zullen de partijen bij het Lom&eacute;-verdrag
hun stevige discussie zeker voortzetten. De consultatieprocedure
is uniek in de internationale ontwikkelingssamenwerking. Hoewel
de verwachtingen wellicht niet hooggespannen zijn, hebben de ACS-landen
nu een formele mogelijkheid gekregen op dit soort besluiten invloed
uit te oefenen, wat zeker recht doet aan de partnerschapsgedachte
van Lom&eacute;.
<P>
<a name=toekomst></a><B>De toekomst</B>
<P>
De Mid Term Review heeft op een aantal
punten geleid tot een welkome aanpassing van het Lom&eacute;-verdrag
aan de eisen van deze tijd, zoals uitvoering van ontwikkelingshulp
en de rol van mensenrechten en democratie. Het MTR-proces heeft
echter ook op pijnlijke wijze duidelijk gemaakt dat de ACS-landen
niet meer in dezelfde mate als in het verleden kunnen rekenen
op hoge prioriteit van de kant van de EG, zowel wat betreft politieke
aandacht en beleidsprioriteit als middelen om de samenwerking
materieel vorm te geven. De onenigheid en gang van zaken rondom
het achtste EOF waren ronduit beschamend. Op een aantal voor de
ACS belangrijke terreinen, zoals de schuldenproblematiek, is nauwelijks
enige voortgang geboekt. Waar in het verleden de ACS-landen in
elke heronderhandeling van het Lom&eacute;-verdrag wel nieuwe
concessies van redelijk belang in de wacht wisten te slepen, lijkt
de uitkomst van de MTR vooral een succes voor de EG, die op zo
goed als alle punten weinig heeft hoeven inleveren ten opzichte
van haar oorspronkelijke voorstellen. Vanuit ACS-perspectief gezien
lijkt dit geheel een minimale uitkomst.
<P>
Tegelijkertijd worden
de (historische) banden tussen de twee groepen landen van beide
kanten kennelijk nog steeds belangrijk gevonden; het lijkt onwaarschijnlijk
dat deze na het jaar 2000 op een veel lager niveau zullen worden
voortgezet. De vraag of die relaties via een vijfde overeenkomst
van Lom&eacute; of op ander wijze vorm zullen krijgen, kan nog
niet beantwoord worden.
<P>
Een positief element voor de kracht en
het belang van de ACS-groep ligt misschien in de toekomstige toetreding
tot het Lom&eacute;-verdrag van Zuid-Afrika, waarover al enige
tijd wordt onderhandeld. Het gaat daarbij vooral om de toetredingsvoorwaarden.
Vanwege zijn economische structuur zullen er zeker uitzonderingen
worden gemaakt, bijvoorbeeld uitsluiting van het EOF, Stabex en
Sysmin. Politiek gezien zou toetreding van Zuid-Afrika een belangrijke
impuls kunnen betekenen voor de ACS-groep, terwijl het economisch
gezien relevant zou zijn vanwege het belang van dat land voor
regionale samenwerking in Oost- en Zuidelijk-Afrika. Vanuit procedureel
oogpunt is het interessant dat Lom&eacute; IV-bis al in die toetreding
voorziet.<a href = "#13">(13)</a>
<P>
Een duidelijk negatieve factor voor de toekomst van
het Lom&eacute;-verdrag ligt in de GATT/WTO-problematiek. Het
Lom&eacute;-verdrag geniet nu vrijstelling van de GATT-regels,
maar na het jaar 2000 zou de WTO die wel eens niet kunnen verlengen.
Een ander voorbeeld zijn de conflicten rondom het EG-beleid ten
aanzien van de voor de Caribische ACS-landen zo belangrijke bananen.
Onlangs dienden de Verenigde Staten hieromtrent een klacht in
bij de WTO.<a href = "#14">(14)</a> Deze problemen dienen zeker serieus genomen te worden,
maar hoeven niet te leiden tot niet-voortzetting of afschaffing
van het Lom&eacute;-verdrag als zodanig, wat politiek gezien en
natuurlijk in de eerste plaats voor de ACS-landen een zeer dramatische
beslissing zou zijn, maar de laatste tijd steeds vaker wordt gesuggereerd.
Via wijzigingen in vorm en inhoud zal men waarschijnlijk aan alle
kritiek en nieuwe internationale regels tegemoet kunnen komen.
Het Lom&eacute;-verdrag zou dan kunnen blijven voortbestaan. Dat
zou de politieke pijn voor de ACS als gevolg van de veranderingen
in de wereld misschien iets verzachten.
<P>
Hoewel het begrijpelijk
is dat de Gemeenschap haar banden met bijvoorbeeld economisch
veelbelovender of geografisch nabijer landen wil intensiveren,
en ook dat doelmatigheid en effectiviteit van internationale economische
samenwerking hoger in haar vaandel zijn komen te staan, valt het
desalniettemin te hopen dat de Gemeenschap, haar lidstaten en
de Commissie de ingeslagen weg niet ten koste van de ACS-landen
gaan bewandelen. De schrijnende ontwikkelingsproblematiek in vele
van die ACS-landen zou eerder het omgekeerde vragen: een intensivering
van de samenwerking en beter gefundeerde inspanningen om de samenwerkingsrelatie
en haar effectiviteit te vergroten. Het Nederlandse EU-voorzitterschap
in de eerste helft van 1997 zou een goede gelegenheid voor Nederland
zijn een positieve bijdrage te leveren aan de consolidatie en
zinvolle uitvoering van Lom&eacute; IV-bis en een stimulans te
geven aan de belangrijke discussie over de toekomst van de betrekkingen
tussen de Europese Unie en de ACS-landen.

de term `Europese Gemeenschap' (EG) als `Europese Unie' (EU) gebruiken.
Volgens het Verdrag van Maastricht ligt de competentie op het
gebied van ontwikkelingssamenwerking in Europees verband bij de
Europese Gemeenschap en de lidstaten (art. 130u). De term `Europese
Unie' zal worden gebruikt daar waar het (ook) gaat om de bredere
competentie op het gebied van buitenlands beleid, zoals vastgelegd
in titels I en V van het Verdrag van Maastricht. Dit betreft bijvoorbeeld
het beleid inzake mensenrechten.<P>

Texte int&#233;gral d'une actualit&#233; parue dans <i>le Courrier

<p>
La Commission a approuv&#233; le 14 f&#233;vrier une proposition au Conseil portant
r&#233;vision &#224; mi-parcours de l'Association des PTOM &#224; la CE telle que mise en
oeuvre par la d&#233;cision du 25 juillet 1991.
<p>
En ce qui concerne le r&#233;gime commercial, qui a donn&#233; lieu &#224; de difficiles
d&#233;bats, le texte confirme les tr&#232;s larges pr&#233;f&#233;rences tarifaires
accord&#233;es aux produits originaires des PTOM (les plus favorables jamais
n&#233;goci&#233;es par la Communaut&#233;) mais propose des am&#233;nagements visant
&#224; les rendre plus coh&#233;rentes avec les exigences de la politique agricole commune suite
aux probl&#232;mes importants constat&#233;s dans les secteurs du riz, des produits laitiers et du
sucre.
<p>
C'est ainsi que la transformation de produits agricoles provenant d'Etats ACP pourra &ecirc;tre
effectu&#233;e dans les PTOM et b&#233;n&#233;ficier du r&#233;gime lib&#233;ral d'acc&#232;s
au march&#233; communautaire qui leur est propre mais dans le cadre d'une proc&#233;dure au
cas par cas accordant une priorit&#233; aux PTOM les moins d&#233;velopp&#233;s et aux
op&#233;rations &#233;conomiquement justifi&#233;es, afin de pr&#233;venir les op&#233;rations
purement sp&#233;culatives.
<p>
A noter &#233;galement que les r&#232;gles d'origine sont compl&#233;t&#233;es, clarifi&#233;es
et mises &#224; jour.
<p>
Pour de qui est du droit des personnes et du statut particulier des ressortissants des PTOM (par
opposition aux ressortissants de pays tiers), la proposition de la Commission sugg&#232;re
plusieurs innovations.  Quant aux qualifications professionnelles, elle propose d'entamer les
processus de reconnaissance d'&#233;galit&#233; des dipl&ocirc;mes obtenus dans les PTOM.  En
ce qui concerne l'&#233;ligibilit&#233; des ressortissants des PTOM &#224; certains programmes
communautaires, elle s'engage dans  une d&#233;marche tout &#224; fait novatrice en proposant
d'&#233;tendre le b&#233;n&#233;fice de 22 de ces programmes aux ressortissants des PTOM
tenant compte du fait qu'ils sont, en tant qu'individus et dans leur grande majorit&#233;, citoyens
relevant de certains Etats membres.  Ainsi, par exemple, dans le cadre du programme
SOCRATES, un &#233;tudiant de Cura&#231;ao ou de Noum&#233;a pourrait, si son institut
remplit les conditions d'appartenance &#224; un r&#233;seau europ&#233;en, parfaire ses
&#233;tudes dans un Etat membre de l'Union.
<p>
La proposition de la Commission comprend &#233;galement la r&#233;partition des ressources
communautaires octroy&#233;es aux PTOM pour la deuxi&#232;me p&#233;riode de 5 ans
d'application de la d&#233;cision d'association (1995-2000) :
<p>
- 165 millions d'ECU au titre du VIII&#232;me FED, soit une augmentation de 18 % par rapport au
VII&#232;me, l'accent &#233;tant mis sur la masse programmable qu'il est propos&#233;
d'augmenter de 22 % ;
<p>
- 35 millions d'ECU au titre des interventions de la BEI sur ses ressources propres, soit une
augmentation de 40 % par rapport aux 5 ann&#233;es pr&#233;c&#233;dentes.
<p>
A noter que les pr&ecirc;ts sp&#233;ciaux non engag&#233;s au 31 d&#233;cembre 1995 au titre
des V&#232;me et VI&#232;me FED (partie PTOM) s'&#233;l&#232;vent &#224; 6 millions d'ECU
environ que la Commission propose au Conseil de transformer en subventions &#224; l'occasion
de la r&#233;vision &#224; mi-parcours.
<p>
<h3>Les 20 PTOM</h3>
<p>
Les PTOM sont au nombre de 20 avec une population totale de presque 900.000 habitants. Il
s'agit de territoires jouissant de diff&#233;rents degr&#233;s d'autonomie relevant de quatre Etats
membres de l'Union (11 relevent du Royaume Uni, six relevent de la France, deux relevent des
Pays Bas et un qui est une r&#233;gion autonome du Danemark)
<p>
Contrairement aux D&#233;partements d'outre-mer (DOM) et aux Canaries, Acores et
Mad&#232;re, les PTOM ne font pas partie du territoire de l'Union, ne rentrent pas dans le cadre
du marche int&#233;rieur et le droit d&#233;rive des Traites ne s'y applique pas directement. Leurs
ressortissants sont, cependant, pour la plus grande partie, des citoyens de l'Union.

Mid-term review of the association with the OCTs</h2>
<h4>
<p>
News Item from <i>The Courier ACP-EU</i><br>No. 157, May-June 1996</h4>
<h5>(Note: this text may differ slightly from the printed version)
</h5>
<a href="../index_uf.htm">EUFORIC Home Page</a><br>
<a href="http://europa.eu.int/en/comm/dg08/dgviii.htm" target="_top">DG VIII Home Page</a>
<br>
</center>
<hr>
On 14 February, the Commission approved a proposal to be submitted to the Council for the mid-
term revision of the association between the overseas countries and territories, and the European
Community, as set out in the decision of 25 July 1991.
<p>
On  the  trade  front,  the  Commission stands by  the  substantial  tariff preferences granted to
products from the OCT (which are more favourable than those accorded by the Community under 
other agreements). Nevertheless, in the light of major problems in the rice, dairy and sugar 
sectors, it is proposing some fine-tuning so that these preferences mesh better with the demands
of the Common Agricultural Policy.
<p>
This means that agricultural produce from ACP states may be processed in the OCTs and benefit
from the more relaxed market access rules applicable to  the latter, but only on a case-by-case
basis, and only if priority is given to the least developed OCTs and if the operations are 
economically justified. In this way, purely speculative moves will be prevented.
<p>
Furthermore, the rules of origin have been added to, clarified and updated.
<p>
As regards individual rights and the specific status of OCT nationals (as opposed to nationals of
third states), the Commission is advocating a number of innovations. Thus, in the field of
professional qualifications, it is proposing a  procedure to ensure that degrees obtained in the
OCTs are recognised as equivalent to those awarded in the EU. It also proposes extending the
eligibility for certain Community programmes to the inhabitants of the OCTs, in recognition of the
fact that, for the most part, they also hold the citizenship of the relevant EU Member State. 22
programmes for individuals have been identified. Accordingly, under the SOCRATES Programme
for example, students from Curacao or Noumea could come  to Belgium, Italy or another Member
State to complete their studies as long as their seat of learning meets the conditions for joining a
European network.
<p>
The Commission proposal also covers Community funding for the OCTs for the next five years of
the association (1995-2000), as follows:
<ul>
<li>ECU 165 million from the eighth EDF (18% up on the seventh) with an emphasis on
programmable aid which will rise by 22%;
<li>ECU 35 million from EIB's own resources (40% up on the previous five years).
</ul><p>
By the end of last year, around ECU 6 million in special loans under the fifth and sixth EDFs (OCT
part) had not been committed. The Commission is proposing that the Council take the opportunity
of the mid-term review to turn these loans into grants.
<p>
<h3>The twenty OCTs</h3>
<p>
There are  twenty OCT, which have a total  population of nearly 900 000. They enjoy varying 
degrees of autonomy  under one of  four EU Member States. Eleven are ruled by the United
Kingdom, six by France, two by the Netherlands and one is an autonomous region of Denmark.
<p>
Unlike the  French  overseas departments or the Canaries, the Azores and Madeira, the OCTs do
not form part of Union territory, are not in the single market and are not directly covered by 
Treaty-based  law. In the main, however, OCT nationals are citizens of the Union.

<h2>The Moving Pictures Bulletin</h2>
<font size=2 face=helvetica,arial>
A critical review of new environment and development films and videos, the Moving Pictures Bulletin
provides a unique information service to subscribers in both the developed and the developing world.
Published quarterly, the Bulletin has a global remit; to increase the flow of information between North and
South, East and West, on the latest productions dealing with environment, development, health,
human-rights and democratization issues, who distributes them, who is making them - and the context in
which they work. 
<p>

Over the years the Bulletin has developed a unique constituency among broadcasters, educationalists,
film-makers, festival organisers, and environment and development NGOs - growing from a simple listings
service to a specialist magazine, distributed in 120 countries. 
<p>

Each issue of the Bulletin is built around a specific theme, with contributions from writers, each experts in
their fields. Recent issues have featured: environmental programmes in North America, population, the
Indian environmental film and audio-visual outlook, indigenous peoples, the new challenges to
environmental film-making from the spread of cable and satellite broadcasting, the UN Conference on
Sustainable Development in Small Island Developing States (SIDS), the International Children's Day of
Broadcasting initiative, and the 1994 One World season to mark the International Conference on
Population and Development. 
<p>

The most recent issue of the Bulletin focuses on the issues surrounding the Fourth World Conference on
Women and has details of TVE's Women of the World series of programmes, as well as some of the best
films available elsewhere by and about women.

<h2>TVE's Distribution and Information Role</h2>

<font size=2 face=helvetica,arial>Helping to produce the programmes is only half the story. If
broadcasters in the South either don't know  what's available or don't have the hard currency to purchase
it, the programmes will never reach audiences in the developing world, and will be watched only in those
regions of the world where there is already a fairly high degree of environmental awareness. TVE's Moving
Pictures Service, launched in 1987, provided a way to reach out to audiences other commercial
distributors didn't bother with - particularly in the low income countries of the developing world.</font>
<p>

<font size=2 face=helvetica,arial>The only editorially-independent service of its kind, Moving Pictures
combines its function as a clearinghouse for information about environmental films with a subsidised
distribution service for developing countries, offering a wide range of quality programmes on
environment, development, health and human rights issues for broadcast and non-broadcast use.
Moving Pictures is made up of four components:

<h2>The Distribution Service</h2>
<font size=2 face=helvetica, arial>Each year, or as often as funding allows, TVE produces a catalogue listing
all the programmes it can make available to TV stations, NGOs and educational institutions in the South
as well as the CIS and Eastern Europe. Where TVE has the rights to distribute material to non-broadcast
users in the developed world, it charges commercial rates - allowing users in developing countries to
receive programmes on a subsidised basis. Catalogues are categorised thematically, as well as by genre
and geographical location. Southern broadcasters and NGOs worldwide select the programmes they want
and complete an order
form to TVE's Distribution Office in London, specifying the formats and languages they require. 
<p>

Language versioning is a critical element in ensuring Moving Pictures programmes are seen by the
maximum number of people worldwide. Wherever possible, TVE tries to provide programmes in the main
UN languages. Where TVE is unable to provide programmes in the language a Southern broadcaster
needs, it sends out an international master, with an English or French script, to enable  broadcasters to
dub  on their own language. 
<p>

Up to one third of the films are from programme-makers in the South or
North/South co-productions. Moving Pictures is the only distribution service promoting South-South
audio-visual exchange. Since it first started in 1987, the Moving Pictures service has distributed over
30,000 tapes to broadcasters, educational institutions and NGOs in developing countries and countries
with economies in transition.

<h2>Moving Pictures Information Services</h2>
<font size=2 face=helvetica,arial>
<b>The Moving Pictures Database</b><br>
Providing a complementary service to the Moving Pictures Bulletin, the Moving Pictures Database is a
directory of documentaries, dramas, children's programmes, animation and public service
announcements, in the areas of of environment, development, health and human-rights. All the films
reviewed for the Bulletin are added to  the database, together with further titles identified from film
festivals and distributors around the world and through exchanges with other databank operators. The
database contains details of approximately 1500 productions. 
<p>

The database is currently being updated to allow searches to be made by title, location, year, genre,
language, distributor and so on. On completion of this work, print-outs will be available free-of-charge to
users from developing countries: for film-makers or broadcast stations in the North, there is a charge of
US$30. The database is aimed at users like film-festival organisers, broadcast stations researching
environmental films, educational institutions and film-makers. 
<p>

<b>Round the World Crews</b><br>
The Round the World Crews database is part of TVE's policy of promoting film-making talent in the South.
It's a listing of over 300 film-making professionals - directors, producers, camera and sound technicians, as
well as fixers and post-production facilities in Africa, Asia, South America and the Caribbean and Eastern
Europe. The Service is primarily intended for broadcasters and independent production companies.
<p>

TVE has contacted all of the outfits listed and they have provided information on equipment, rates,
credits and references. A wide range of those listed produce work to what we believe is of international
broadcast quality and TVE has endeavoured as far as possible to check out the credentials for every
entry. However there will inevitably be differing views about 'professionalism'. In short Round the World
Crews should be seen as a reference directory and not necessarily as a TVE recommended list.

<h2>OUTREACH</h2>

<font size=2 face=helvetica,arial>The OUTREACH project was set up in 1986 to compile and distribute
health and environment information packs for use by NGOs and in primary school curricula in developing
countries. Operating through a network of national focal points, and with the approval of governments,
OUTREACH assists in the development, production and free distribution of children's health and
environment magazines. With a support unit funded by UNEP, the UK's Overseas Development
Administration (ODA) and WWF, OUTREACH packs, summarising up-to-date scientific information in the
fields of environment, development and health, are sent out on a monthly basis to over 300 individuals
and organisations in over 60 countries. Packs are available in English, French, Arabic, Spanish and
Portuguese versions, often linked to new programmes or series that TVE is distributing to broadcasters in
the developing world. Each pack includes materials suitable for adaptation by the media, teacher training
colleges and community centres. 
 <p>

Among the most notable successes inspired by the Outreach packs are 'Pied Crow', published by CARE
Kenya, and distributed to every primary school and secondary school in the country; a children's health
and environment magazine in Thailand, with over 100,000 copies distributed to over 13,000 institutions,
including hilltribe schools and municipal reading centres; and 'Action Magazine', with 80,000 copies
distributed in Zimbabwe, Botswana and Zambia.
<p>

Outreach information packs include radio scripts, adapted by a growing network of radio stations in the
South. A quarterly newsletter, summarising Outreach activities and successes, was introduced in the
summer of 1990.<p>

<html><head><title>NI Issue 268 - Heart and Soul</title><!!keys: New Internationalist+Africa></head><body><img width=100 height=88 border=1 src="ni_pix/nilogo.gif"><br><i>The material that follows has been provided by  <a href="NIinfo.html">  New Internationalist</a></i><hr><p><center><h1>New life for old: Coca Maloni</h1></center><p><hr width=80% size=4><p><font size=+1>I</font> was keen to see one particular yaaba, or wise old woman, because I remembered a story Mariama had told me 10 years before - how her third child, Aseta, had fallen into a raging fever that threatened to carry her away and she had taken her to see a yaaba called Coca Maloni. She said a great bird of evil omen had passed over Aseta and that the wickedness had to be let out. She made a small but deep cut beneath the right eye with a razor blade, just on the cheekbone. And within a week Aseta was playing again - though she still bears the scar today. <p>Coincidence? Probably. But it helped give Coca a rare power in my imagination even before I met her - no-one who is familiar with Africa would dismiss its traditional medicine out of hand. I conjured her up as a powerful conservative force in the village, a symbol of the old ways. Instead she turns out to be the most memorable of all the people I interview in the village precisely because she has been so prepared to change. <p>She is very old now - extraordinarily old in a country with an average life expectancy of 48. As she shambles painfully towards the concession from her once-weekly excursion beyond its confines, she cuts an extraordinary figure, bent almost literally double over her stick. Like many of the older people in the village she can't be sure of her exact age since she has never had a birth record. But the depth and ubiquity of the wrinkles all over her fascinating face bear out her sense that she is about 90 years old. She moved to Sabtenga to marry about 70 years ago but has been a widow for 40 years. Terrifyingly, of her nine babies only one survived - though that son did his best to make up for it by taking eight wives himself.<p><img width=158  height=158 align=right hspace=80 vspace=20 border=1 src="ni_pix/268_p14_coca.gif"><p>I ask her first one of my standard questions to the older people of the village - does she feel life is better now than in the old days? Given that the old days for Coca were those of the French colonizers, this is no contest. It is a magnificent tribute to the virtues of French colonialism that what everyone recalls of it is the system of forced labour which they imposed on the country, dragooning the able-bodied men into effective slave labour. <p>'But the other big improvement,' she says, ' is the clothes.' This is not the first time I have encountered this slightly strange answer - I spoke to an old man who thought that the main value of modern living was the superior quality and durability of modern trouser or pants material. But Coca is casting her mind much farther back to when, in her childhood, the people of the area wore nothing at all but a square of cloth around the genitals. I ask why she thinks it is so much better for people to wear clothes. Is it because they protect you from the sun? Or is it for reasons of modesty? 'No, it's not for that,' she answered. 'It's just that it's so much warmer. In my childhood we had to keep a fire going in the house all the time.' <p>In the latter part of her life Coca has, like other old women in the village, been a resource for both midwifery and medicine. The way she talks about it the yaabas form a kind of community of their own - Coca delivered babies but seemed to share the role almost interchangeably with other women. She would guess that she delivered nine out of every ten babies safely. In normal circumstances there was no religious or magical element to a delivery - only if the mother was having problems would she resort to seeking God's help by sacrificing a chicken. <p>The readiness to embrace the change in attitude to excision is even more evident in Coca's religious life: just last year she converted to Catholicism. Only a missionary would see this as a positive step in and of itself. But the readiness to give up a lifetime of animist practice and belief seems extraordinary - it's hard to imagine someone in the West changing their ideas so completely in the twilight of their life. <p>'Now I know God,' she says, 'before I didn't.' Does it make her feel different? 'Yes - it's given me new strength - I would never have had the strength to walk all the way to church before.' Now she is Catholic, does she regard her past sacrifices and actions as errors or even as sins? 'I've washed my hands of all that now.' But why convert to Christianity so late in life? 'I was the only one left in my concession. Everyone else in my family had become either Christian or Muslim. And I wanted someone to pray for me when I died.'<p>This very human answer rings true, as do her magnificently practical reasons for choosing Christianity over Islam. 'If I'd become a Muslim I would have had to get down on my knees five times a day. Look at my body - you can see why that would have been difficult. Whereas as a Christian I just have to make it to the church once a week.<p>'Besides, if I were Muslim I'd have to give up my dolo (sorghum wine) - and I couldn't do that. By the way, you couldn't buy me a calabash of dolo in return for all this chat, could you?'<p>©Copyright: New Internationalist 1995<hr><a href="index.html"><img width=35  height=30 src="ni_pix/nilogo3.gif"> NI Home Page</a> <a href="contents268.html"><img width=45  height=68 src="ni_pix/268_cover_thumb.gif"> Issue 268</a><hr><p></body></html>

<A NAME=A><hr></A><B>A. INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
<A NAME=A.1></A><B>A.1. The context</B>
<P>
The Caribbean's economic prospects are closely bound up with
the speed at which the region is able to anticipate and adjust
to the unfolding trends and events in global economic and political
relations and arrangements. In addition to being small, open and
trade-dependent, these economies rely on a relatively narrow range
of products for their export earnings, GDP and employment. Since
they are also dependent on foreign savings for a significant portion
of capital formation, changes in the international economy, particularly
as it concerns investment, aid flows and the global trading regime
including dispute settlement, would be of special interest to
them.
<P>
Major shifts in the ideology of development and international
political relations have already necessitated many adjustments
in Caribbean economic policies and in the structure of the regional
economy. Many of these policy changes will need to be accelerated
if the region is to maintain, let alone improve, the economic
well-being of its citizens. Economic policies in particular, 
will need to be fashioned so as to enable the economies to meet
the challenges. In order to do this, Governments need to have
both a long term vision of  where these trends are likely to lead
and a notion of the path along which their economies should evolve.
  
<P>
There is for any Government a task of balancing the revenues
available against the cost of the services which it or its supporters
would like to see provided by  the state. Due to the Caribbean's
small size and open nature,  managing that balance against the
foregoing background is likely to prove to be one of the greatest
challenges facing Governments in the 3rd millennium. It will need
to be effected without creating further imbalances of a macro-economic
nature, particularly as regards the balance of payments on current
account and price stability.  
<P>
Although that balancing of the mandate against the means is
often portrayed as being an economic exercise it is first and
foremost a political issue. 
<P>
<A NAME=A.2></A><B>A.2. Political imperatives</B>
<P>
On the one hand, there is a link between the wishes of the
electorate (or its more influential elements) and the mandate
which the political party or Government in office believes it
has. The nature of this link is the subject of a long-standing
controversy in public choice theory concerning how  social preferences
(a social welfare function) are  transmitted to, and interpreted
by, elected representatives. It involves the question of the appropriateness
of current voting 'rules' and the weight  allocated to the votes
of different constituents of the electorate. We cannot pursue
that controversy here but it is necessary to acknowledge its relevance
to the question as to what is an appropriate size for the public
sector.
<P>
In practice, there is no mechanism for converting the views
of voters into a set of specific economic policies or, better
still, a set of instruments by means of which to achieve them.
The components of the perceived mandate are arrived at by an iterative
process involving intuition, approximations and trial and error.
At the end of the day, a Government will be guided by a blend
of what is ideologically acceptable and what it thinks it can
'sell' to the public. This, rather than the inherent technical
virtues of any particular measure, will largely influence the
attitude of governments. The debate over, and the criticism or
support for, those policies will then influence incremental changes
in the basket of policies. 
<P>
The elements of the basket in the economic sphere which influence
the activities of the state and therefore its size may be grouped
as follows:
<P>
 i.  Equity and social considerations;
<P>
 ii.  Environmental protection;
<P>
 iii.  Inventorising resources, particularly, mineral and 
natural resources;
<P>
 iv.   Preserving internal law and order and national security;
<P>
 v.  Ensuring the availability of an appropriate range of infrastructure
<P>
 vi.  Regulating economic activities so as to ensure a framework
under which effective and competitive markets may flourish (handling
the problems of externalities, public goods, monopolies and asymmetrical
information) whilst at the same time protecting consumers and
workers :
<P>
   a) price,  licencing and import controls, for example;
<P>
   b) non-administrative competition policies;
<P>
 vii.  Prosecuting national interests in the international
arena particularly, in the critical area of economic diplomacy;
<P>
 viii. Promotion of private sector activities by way of extensive
de facto subsidies and protection (tax holidays, etc);
<P>
 ix.  Direct involvement in the production and delivery of
       services;
<P>
This list is not meant to be exhaustive nor to be analytically
elegant but it assists in demonstrating the changing focus of
public sector involvement. 
<P>
It seems to be increasingly the case that influential opinion
and trends favour a shift in the emphasis which the state is to
give to these different areas. A number of the more important
trends are mentioned below.
<P>
There is, in the context of the politics of development, a
growing consensus that economic policies, to be sustainable, should
 seek, in their formulation and implementation, to facilitate
structural change. Some of the necessary change can be facilitated
by widening and/or deepening the productive base and extending
the range of economic actors who constructively participate in
enterprise. In the latter context, policy should facilitate greater
mobilisation and utilisation of human resources by way of the
removal of barriers and restrictions on the contribution of different
groups to fully contribute their creative energies to economic
activities. The persistence of extensive pockets of poverty in
the region has often been attributed to the failure of policy-makers
to adequately take into account the needs of 'the poor', women,
marginalised communities, small farmers and the like. (Cf for
example Beckford, 1972, The West Indian Commission, 1992).  At
the same time there is something of a consensus that the priorities
of the 'middle classes' have tended to be given undue weigh in
the mix of Caribbean public policy over those of other socio-economic
categories including those mentioned earlier (cf Stone in Wedderburn,
1991, pp 10 for example, and Brewster 1995 memorial lecture in
the Beckford series).
<P>
The embrace of goals of social equity and decentralisation
of government will have implications for the nature and extent
of state involvement in the economy. In other words, regulation
or intervention to prevent the exclusion of specific and identifiable
social groups from particular economic activities or economic
activities in general appears to be warranted. These seem to find
favour over attempts to use the state apparatus to say create
jobs for a broad, or even less a narrow, swathe of employees.
In that sense pursuit of 'I' could imply a reduction in intervention
at 'ix' and possibly 'v'.
<P>
New political pre-occupations arising from concerns with protection
of the environment, preservation of bio-diversity, mean that Governments
will be increasingly called on to regulate and answer for the
status of environmental developments. This applies equally to
the tourist economies and mining economies where failure to maintain
acceptable standards would threaten foreign exchange revenues
and health. Two cases in point are Surinam and Guyana where natural
resources such as forests and fauna are regarded by some elements
of the environmental movement as mankind's common property. For
these countries a good deal of the pressure originates externally
and may not be viewed favourably by the populace as a whole who
see is as at best eccentric or at worst as a means of denying
them access to their national resources to earn a livelihood in
the interests of future generations of foreigners who are already
rich. Given the force of the pressure  from these overseas sources
however,  more and more resources will have to be devoted to monitoring,
gathering information on and defending utilisation of forestry
and ultimately fisheries resources. Though Government activities
may be largely defensive (at least initially)it will nonetheless
require resources.
<P>
The region is faced with a growing menace posed by the use,
trans-shipment, and to a lesser extent production of dangerous
drugs. At the same time, relatively high levels of unemployment
serve as a fruitful nursery for economic and other types of crime.
There are therefore growing calls for greater attention to be
paid to the restoration of law and order. This call will have
to be addressed because in addition to scaring off tourists and
local skills, it constitutes a disincentive to invest.
<P>
The experience of the Pacific Rim reinforces the general perception
that the existence of adequate infra-structural facilities is
a fairly crucial element in structural change and that the state
should be a pivotal role in ensuring the existence of such facilities.
It is worth dwelling on this point for a little while because
some changing trends need to be recognised. 
<P>
In the context of future trade developments, spokesmen in the
region seem reasonably united in the belief that the region has
a capacity and a competitive advantage in knowledge-based services.
Since services have become the driving force of a 'revolution'
in international trade, it would be just as well to be clear about
its requirements in terms of infrastructure.  The basic requirements
which Governments should seek to meet in relation to information
technology (information processing and long distance telecommunications),
for example, which many states in the region have already successfully
entered, include not only the availability of equipment but its
quality and efficiency; as well as its pricing. Indeed, a recent
study of the Eastern Caribbean suggested that non-competitive
pricing of telecommunications services in those states put them
at a disadvantage in the competitive market (IBRD, 1994).Finally,
all these areas require a population well enough educated to be
receptive to technological changes.
<P>
The changes in the international trade regime, in aid ideology,
and trends in investment which have already been highlighted are
affecting the region because of the latter's dependence on western
hemisphere markets and on a narrow range of commodity exports.
 Tourism, which has enabled some of the members of the region
to ride out past storms caused by adverse terms of trade movements
and the oil crisis, is not alone likely to suffice in the future.
It will be necessary to look for or continue to seek out new trade
and production opportunities and niches. In pursuit of those opportunities
Governments will have to play a prominent role. This is what was
referred to earlier as a vision of the future. They will need
to combine considerations of regional integration with focused
industrial programming  and support of private sector initiatives
in market research, product search, as well as restructuring and
retooling of enterprises and industries to exploit the markets
thereby unlocked. 
<P>
It is in this regard that one can safely challenge conventional
wisdom regarding the role of the state, especially as it pertains
to the Pacific Rim countries such as Singapore, Malaysia and South
Korea, to name but a few. In these countries experience has shown
what is possible with a state which is activist but focused, committed
to policies which are largely consistent, and which recognises
the need for continuity in policies over time.  Apart from 'inspired'
regulation and the provision of reliable and relevant infrastructure,
another key to their success has been their willingness and capacity
to influence the direction taken by the private sector by way
of high quality collaboration, research and diffusion of information
and, from time to time, subsidies which can be financed, are timed
bound and narrowly targeted to identified 'winners'.
<P>
Whilst political debate has favoured the state as a catalyst
in  raising the rate of economic growth, there has been considerable
disillusionment over the performance of the state as an entrepreneur.
This, it might be added, is in the last analysis an ideological
matter, although it is the case that in many, and possibly most,
LDCs and in many OECD states the operation of the public sector
has been considerably less efficient than had been hoped (and
than that of the private sector). Most of this can, however, be
put in context when the empirical analyses is taken into consideration.
Although the jury is not exactly in on this matter, the weight
of evidence suggesting that, 'where public sector agencies are
required to compete with the private sectors providers, the productivity
differences often largely disappear' (Trebilcock, 1995, pp 27).
<P>
Naturally, the different pressures for state involvement will
have to be answered. Each Government will have to examine the
menu of options open to it. But satisfying some of these demands
can be costly. Due to the influence of political and social factors,
expenditure is likely to be a most volatile element in the context
of fiscal imbalance. In Guyana, for example, post- 1980 regionalisation
contributed to a significant loss of control over expenditures
and declines in cost effectiveness due to  problems of procurement
and the award of contracts.   
<P>
But the new priorities need not define additional obligations
of the state. Equity, social considerations, environmental protection
and pre-occupations with law and order may well involve incremental
expenditure by themselves. But regulation is an old obligation
of Governments and some old pre-occupations in this area have
been made redundant by new managerial approaches and technological
developments. The demands can be met by changing emphases say
from external defence to internal law and order, for example,
and from price controls and other forms of regulation to dependence
on non-administrative competition policies. On the diplomatic
front, the emphasis should shift to economic diplomacy in keeping
with re-focusing on global rather than hemispheric markets and
new sources of economic cooperation and investment. The area in
which there should be an unambiguous net decline should be productive
activities (categories 'viii' and 'ix' on p. 3/4).
<P>
In seeking to meet the demands associated with new points of
emphasis it will also be necessary to search  for resources from
outside of the Government budget if old priorities would not be
displaced. Thus environmental protection/monitoring can be effected
and financed jointly with NGOs and the relevant private businesses
as occurs in fisheries, for example.
<P>
Additionally, in the struggle to keep the mandate within manageable
bounds the importance of informed public debate should not be
under-estimated. The formulation of the state's mandate is, as
was pointed out at the beginning of this paper, a political matter
involving the moulding of consensuses.
<P>
The striking of a manageable consensus is a function of information
and persuasion. The provision of adequate information by Governments
can contribute to reasoned analysis in this regard. And, a public
forum for debate in which the press, and more importantly, the
political parties seeking office are obliged to address the problem
of choice and the need to strike the necessary balance between
capacity and dreams,  would be very useful. Responsible politics,
in other words, also has a crucial role to play alongside innovative
management and sound economics.
<P>
Before leaving this section it would be useful to say word
on the process of political decision-making this context. Whilst
it is true that the existing constitutional framework of the region
does allow for control of and debate over the financial elements
of  public policy it is evident to all and sundry that both the
debate and control are inadequate. Without attempting a critique
of the Westminster-type constitutions a few comments are offered:
 Public control of expenditure by Parliament in the guise of the
Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and the bureaucracy in the form
of the Department of audit is handicapped by two considerations:
<P>
1. Executive control of the Legislature by way of the Party
Whip.
<P>
2. Pre-occupation of the Departments of audit with ex-post
administrative accountability.
<P>
These considerations result in the mechanisms of control being
 pre-occupied with restraint rather than guidance or stimulation
and loyalty over diagnosis and  audit over performance analysis.
 The processes need to be amended to permit:
<P>
1. More careful and timely consideration of measures not merely
on the basis of line items but the broader considerations of economic
policy such as inflation, monetary policy, debt fiscal policy
etc.  
<P>
2. Scope for recommendations and decisions by the legislature
which to be incorporated in the measures laid by the Executive
and not merely in relation to increasing expenditures but say
the modification of policies in the light of the lessons drawn
from the reviews of previous years' economic policies.
<P>
3. This means that the House will need to be provided not only
with some technical support but it should be given scope to develop
skills among legislators on both sides of the bench.
<P>
4. Whether or not Central Bank are made 'independent' they
may be required to submit impartial technical reports and summoned
to answer questions on critical parameters very much in the same
way that the Auditor General is required to do before the PAC.
<P>
<A NAME=A.3></A><B>A.3. The mandate and the appropriate size of the public sector</B>
<P>
Adequate recognition and pursuit of common interests is required
to maintain a consensus. The composition of the expenditure and
the revenue packages can be positive elements in the formulation
of the consensus.
<P>
Government having interpreted its mandate, has to decide on
what specific measures would enable it to acquit itself of the
mandate. The state may seek to enhance growth and employment by
a mix of regulation of economic activities, the operation of enterprises,
investment, financing and promoting development activities etc.

<P>
In arriving at those packages and mixes  of policies and measures
what limits should Caribbean Governments recognize regarding an
appropriate size of the public sector? What proportion of the
economy's resources should the state seek to take by way of taxes
and what proportion of GDP should the state exercise control over
in providing goods and services? 
<P>
In practice there can be no simple answers to these questions
as to what constitutes an appropriate size for the public sector.
The activities of the public sector may exert an important influence
on the workings of the economy and is in turn affected by the
rest of the economy. The goals it seeks to pursue are both economic
and social. From an economic perspective therefore, the size of
the public sector should be consistent with the macro- economic
and other objectives which the state is attempting to pursue.
<P>
W. Arthur Lewis was said to contend that the limit to the size
of  the Public sector is the state's capacity to finance it. 
In a sense this is a valid argument. There is no theoretical limit
to the share that the public sector can have in an economy once
the state can ensure that the economy is in balance. In practice,
 such balance has been achieved under a range of sizes of public
sector.
<P>
In the context of the region the main macro-economic objectives
would probably be to ensure tolerable price, output and balance
of payments levels. More explicitly, these would require that
Governments :
<P>
 i)   avoid BOP and exchange rate crises
<P>
 ii) control the level of inflation; <U>at the same time common
political objectives would be to seek to</U>
<P>
 iii) raise the level of real incomes
<P>
 iv)  enhance employment levels
<P>
 v)   facilitate the vibrancy and buoyancy of economic and
   social activities
<P>
Objectives i and ii would depend on appropriate macro-economic
policies. Attainment of objectives 'iii' and 'iv' over the longer
term would require that savings and, more precisely, savings/GDP
ratios, be significantly increased from their current relatively
low (international) levels of around 20% to close to 30%; a point
recently emphasized by the President of the CDB in a widely publicised
statement. 
<P>
All of these points suggest that the capacity of the state
to finance a given public sector size will be determined essentially
by its capacity to :
<P>
 (a) raise revenues on the basis of moderate tax increases.
Public revenues will need to meet the requirements of sustainable
growth and social targets and to service debt arising from conservative
domestic and external borrowing programmes;
<P>
 (b) raise non-inflationary domestic finance, i.e. there should
be little or no central bank credit and such credit as is extended
would be soon reversed;
<P>
 (c) raise domestic capital market finance without crowding
out the private sector through lack of liquidity and/or high interest
rates;
<P>
 (d) raise foreign capital without relatively large premia
over base rates.
<P>
<A NAME=B></A><B>B. FISCAL POLICY</B>
<P>
Whatever the broader objectives of fiscal policy, it has of
necessity to be managed so as to ensure that over the medium (and
preferably in the short term also) term  expenditures are kept
in line with the state's capacity to finance those expenditures.
 Failure to abide by this relatively simple rubric has been a
major cause of many of the economic imbalances and associated
difficulties experienced by some Caribbean states. Increasing
expenditures in response to revenue windfalls and grandiose political
goals against a background of inadequate fiscal effort and frantic
borrowing from the banking system and the like have led states
such as Guyana to a point where drastic and draconian policies
have had to be implemented in order to restore economic balance.
These rescue efforts have been especially severe in the face of
restricted international financial support (Greenidge, 1990).
<P>
<A NAME=B.1></A><B>B.1. EXPENDITURES</B>
<P>
An important question that should be addressed in considering
the level of expenditure is its efficiency ie. whether the expenditure
yields sufficient  value for money. Secondly, there is the question
of whether the composition and level of expenditure is consistent
with the state's role.  
<P>
<A NAME=B.1.A></A><B>B.1.a. levels</B>
<P>
It has been suggested that from the expenditure perspective
the  region's public sector with some 30 % of GDP is too large.
This  may be an accurate observation in comparative terms. However,
whether much significance should be attached to this figure as
such is a moot point. The appropriate level of expenditure is
best derived not from examining expenditure/GDP ratios in insolation
or even at all, but from examining the objectives of fiscal (and
ultimately macro-economic policy). 
<P>
The uses to which the resources are to be put will determine,
by and large, the volume of resources which the state seeks to
garner through its tax systems and other revenue sources. Expenditure
is undertaken to regulate (enhance or moderate) current consumption
or to create capital assets (Investment) for the objective of
raising future rates of economic growth. In this regard, the key
question is whether a given level of expenditure is consistent
with current rates of public savings (and on whether such expenditures,
capital and current, yield value for money).
<P>
Regarding the relationship between revenues and expenditure,
Parkinson has observed that, 'the public revenue is regarded as
limitless and..... expenditure not only rises to meet income but
tends to surpass it and always will...' (1960, pp11). It should
be added that if the objective of fiscal policy is to enhance
public savings - a current pre-occupation of most states in the
region - <U>current expenditures</U> should not be permitted to
increase faster than public revenues, in absolute terms. Furthermore,
this comparison should be viewed over a reasonable time period
so that windfalls, which are short-term and not sustainable, do
not stimulate or trigger long-term increases in expenditure which
subsequently can neither be reduced nor financed.
<P>
The appropriate levels of <U>capital expenditures</U> are dependent
on the growth target, the relative efficiency of public and private
investment (ICORs) and the influence of one on the other. In any
case, the levels should be consistent with rates of public savings.
<P>
<A NAME=B.1.B></A><B>B.1.b. composition</B>
<P>
This is problem just as important as that of the level of expenditure.
A considerable debate rages over whether the state should be providing
education, health, subsidies etc.. And, if so, which elements.
There is also a debate over the administrative or organisational
dimension ie. whether the proportion of resources devoted to the
different cost centres is appropriate. This latter debate which
is essentially a management problem can benefit from the theoretical
developments in the latter area as well as developments directed
at making public sector management systems more responsive to
flexible decision- making. The balance is a difficult one.
<P>
Current expenditures should be geared to meeting the provision
of goods and services. The question of exactly which goods and
services should be provided were explored in a preliminary way
in an earlier section.
<P>
There can be little dispute over the need for current expenditure
to be consistent with the capital investment programme. This means
that it should be distributed in a manner which ensures that capital
assets which are associated with services in demand are  kept
in good repair ie. maintenance and repairs votes should attract
a high priority. Secondly, the main element in current Government
expenditures is usually wages and salaries and the related employment
expenses and statutory charges. These expenditures should underpin
the drive for a highly trained, well-committed human resource
base including the Civil or Public Service.
<P>
Current Public Sector expenditures also cover the cost of providing
complementary inputs such as fuel, transport, stationery, etc..
(termed 'Other Charges' in some countries). The challenge is usually
one of providing enough of these elements to ensure that they
are truly complementary.
<P>
Socio-economic infrastructure such as transport and communications
(roads and ferries), potable water and basic health  services
have been long recognised as being important in underpinning efficient
and competitive industries. 
<P>
Over the years state intervention, particularly the provision
of goods and services, has been justified on the basis of the
nature of the industry or the market. I refer here to natural
monopolies (decreasing cost industries), publicness and the existence
of de- facto externalities or information barriers. We have seen
over the last decade, in particular, that these characteristics
are not  immutable; they are subject to technological change.
Thus, the structure of industries can change as can their cost,
the composition of their output, etc.. which may exhibit different
market features are answerable to different management techniques.
This has been most dramatically evident in the area of telecommunications
and information services.
<P>
In effect, the production frontiers of private/public sector
provision are being constantly shifted and expanded. As new needs
for state intervention arise old ones may contract, change form
or disappear. The bundle of state expenditures should reflect
those shifts over time and those who stand to benefit from the
expenditures should also be narrowed to correspond to those who
are intended to be beneficiaries.
<P>
In the light of these factors, Governments need to revisit
the areas in which they are currently involved as entrepreneur.
<P>
As a purely illustrative device Table 1 provides a schema of
some of the options and considerations that need to be taken into
account in considering how a public commitment to cause particular
goods or services to be provided, might be approached.

<P>
<A NAME=B.1.C></A><B>B.1.c. Expenditure reduction</B>
<P>
One clear principle to be observed in fiscal management is
the avoidance of excesses. Most of the countries which have found
themselves having to effect arduous and harsh programmes of adjustment
have been victims of policies which have ignored this simple rule.
<P>
Failing to adjust expenditures in line with capacity to finance
over a sustained period is one such policy can lead to very serious
consequences. In this regard 'the wages of sin is debt'. Fiscal
excises leading to extreme imbalances leave Governments with little
option but extensive and apparently indiscriminate expenditure
reductions. In such circumstances, 'crude cutting of expenditure
becomes the main attraction for harried Finance Ministers'.
<P>
The most common responses to budgetary imbalances have been
to restrain Government expenditures by across-the-board reductions.
This has been applied to capital expenditures by way of slowdowns
and occasionally modification or a scaling down of the existing
public sector investment programme. Additionally, new programmes
due to come on stream may be delayed or abandoned. This has sometimes
been problematic in that in many countries where there is a clear
need to restore physical infrastructure the effect of such an
approach has been to further hasten the decline in the stock.
<P>
Much of the effort at reduction has been directed at recurrent
expenditures, the most fruitful (or vulnerable) component of which
has been emoluments and the wages bill. As a consequence, the
bulk of the burden of such adjustment has fallen on the non- interest
recurrent expenditures such as : 
<P>
 i)   subsidies
<P>
 ii)  transfers to public enterprises
<P>
 iii) emoluments - restraining increases below current levels
of inflation
<P>
 iii) social services including education and health care 
  delivery
<P>
If the objective of development and industrial policies is
to improve the position of knowledge-intensive services it would
 not be appropriate  to impose heavy cuts in services such as
education and those which contribute to the efficiency of industry.
Among the latter are reliable energy and water supplies, transport
and communications as well as basic public health.  
<P>
The reductions in education and health may have been excessive
in many instances relative to growth needs. Additionally, these
measures may halt or reverse desirable trends such as socio- economic
mobility and social stability, less inequitable patterns of income
distribution. 
<P>
Not surprisingly, a considerable degree of dissatisfaction
has been generated by such efforts. In Barbados, Guyana and Jamaica
such policies have met with significant resistance from the labour
movement and other segments of society.
<P>
In recognition of the possible conflicts or contradictions
there have been calls for the targeting of expenditures.
<P>
Other options in relation to expenditure reductions should
be carefully explored in the region. There are fruitful possibilities
in this regard. Canada has been experimenting with the virtues
of amending their financial regulations to allow the Public Service
more leeway in pursuit of savings or more efficient use of resources.
Under these arrangements greater freedom is granted to the bureaucracy
to explore cost savings in their management of line item appropriations
in the budget (Cf Trebilcock, 1995). 
<P>
<A NAME=B.1.D></A><B>B.1.d. Targeting of expenditure</B>
<P>
Targeting involves attempts to restrict the total budgetary
cost of a particular policy measure by restricting the beneficiaries
to those intended. In a sense it is concerne with minimising the
cost of delivering a particular programme. Related to this is
the fact that transparent expenditure policies and the use of
expenditure to counteract the undesirable side-effects of  tax
policies can help to make adjustment worthwhile and burden sharing
fair. 
<P>
The persistence of poverty in the region in spite of relatively
rapid growth rates in some countries is a matter of general concern
and carries with it considerable risks for the stability of these
small states. Judging from the interventions during the course
of the last CGCED meeting, the growing incidence of poverty during,
is the source of great concern within and outside of the region.
<P>
There are many causes of this poverty alongside extensive adjustment
and / rapid growth. It should be noted however, that price movements
are among the most pervasive. A World Bank study has noted that
in the context of ESAFs, 70% of exchange rate policy conditions
were met by a number of countries under review, compared with
55% of trade. So it is hardly a surprise to find that changing
relative prices tended to be more successfully implemented than
those requiring institutional change' (IBRD, 1990, pp1). In Guyana,
for example, he high inflation rates experience in the 1980s have
created an especially large cadre of 'retired' poor and aged migrants
in addition to new working poor. 
<P>
Some time ago, in response to such challenges, the IBRD launched
a series of studies on the impact of adjustment and the design
of programmes of poverty alleviation. In implementing its findings
they proposed to redirect social expenditures to more equitable
causes and to make such expenditures more  and to finance and
support compensatory programmes (IBRD, 1988; 1990).  There can
be no dispute with this approach. 
<P>
However, the difficulty of designing expenditure programmes
which would target all critically affected groups is much underrated
(Greenidge, 1994). Indeed, targeting becomes increasingly difficult
the more severe the expenditure reductions especially if it has
to implemented amid calls for simplicity in programmes. A lot
more work therefore needs to be undertaken on this approach of
targeting expenditure. Additionally, much higher rates of growth
than those currently being achieved are needed to support effective
targeting.
<P>
Measures to redistribute incomes by way of direct taxes and
provisions subsided goods and services through the public sector
are out of favour in the mainstream of political ideas and economic
thought but their perceived disincentive on savings and on work
effort, as well as their encouragement of tax evasion should be
assessed against the impact of better rewards on the labour supply
of poor households. 
<P>
<A NAME=B.1.E></A><B>B.1.e. Privatisation</B>
<P>
Properly managed, privatisation can certainly relieve  expenditure
burdens and the likelihood of future claims on the public purse
occasioned by the need to cover operating losses, the provision
of equity and/or subsidized loans to public enterprises. It may
also facilitate more efficient provision of the service in question.
The claims on the Treasury can be reduced by full or partial divestment
of enterprises which would be more profitably run in the private
sector. Privatisation is, however, an option which needs to be
explored more dispassionately in the region than has been the
case so far. Many of the concerns which have been used to rule
it out of consideration as a viable option can be addressed to
the satisfaction of those with genuine complaints. 
<P>
As observed earlier one of the important elements of public
expenditure pertains to public enterprises. In considering the
size and composition of the public sector, it is therefore appropriate
to examine the appropriateness of these transfers. The options
arising from a political mandate requiring the  provision of a
service or some set of goods are not usually restricted to state
provision or supply.
<P>
It is now widely accepted that a range of options may be available
to meet any given goal. Improving the quantum and quality of education
or health, for example, does not give a defined set of associated
and specific policies from which the share of the state and the
private sector automatically emerge.
<P>
It needs to be stressed that extensive privatisation needs
to be supported by an efficient public service and a supportive
framework of regulatory agencies. This requirement runs counter
to adjustment policies under which these services have been starved
of resources and denuded of much-needed skills. The result has
in many cases been problematic post-privatisation experiences.
<P>
<A NAME=B.1.F></A><B>B.1.f. Recapitulation</B>
<P>
In looking at expenditure the main points, of note are :
<P>
 i)  that expenditure should be managed comprehensively;
<P>
 ii) that Governments should pursue the restructuring of the
composition of expenditures more imaginatively and with an eye
to developmental priorities including the need to keep income
distribution patterns within tolerable and politically acceptable
levels;
<P>
 iii) the need to avoid across-the-board reductions of expenditure
which ignore industrial and developmental priorities;
<P>
 iv) other avenues for savings and improved efficiency should
be explored. 
<P>
Expenditure composition should be constantly reviewed because
those services/activities which at one point in time make Government
intervention imperative are themselves changing over time as managerial
and technological boundaries and opportunities are being developed.
<P>
<A NAME=B.2></A><B>B.2. TAXATION</B>
<P>
Assuming for the moment that the question of  the efficiency
and composition of expenditure are satisfactorily addressed, the
fiscal system will determine the availability of resources for
financing the goods and services which the state seeks to provide.
Indeed, since the 1970s, capacity to raise revenues, other than
in the short term or by unsustainable borrowing has been the main
restraint on long term public sector expansion in most Caribbean
states.
<P>
If, as has been observed, a major requirement in the region
is to raise levels of savings, if current expenditures cannot
be sufficiently restrained. considerable attention will have to
be devoted to increasing revenues.
<P>
For present purposes it is useful to bear in mind the following
revenue sources :
<P>
  1) Taxation
<P>
  2) Royalties rents and levies
<P>
  3) Privatisation proceeds, dividends and related transfers
<P>
<A NAME=B.2.A></A><B>B.2.a. Selected features of Caribbean tax regimes:</B>
<P>
The structure of each economy influences the types of taxes
which may be effective. Tax effort for many Caribbean states can
be considered to be low. In 1991/2, for example, only in 8 countries
was the ratio of tax receipts to GDP in excess of 25%.   For much
of the Caribbean the range of significant economic activities
and the number of economic actors is relatively narrow. In any
one country the main contributors to GDP, ignoring Government
services, are :
<P>
 - agriculture
<P>
 - tourism/manufacturing and
<P>
 - mining
<P>
For most Caribbean states the import of these sectors is not
even matched by their contribution to the tax take. 
<P>
Given their open nature, trade-based taxes are easiest to administer.
It is worth recalling that some of these sectors need to be transformed
if the challenges mentioned earlier are to be met.
<P>
If fiscal, and more especially tax, policies are to be consistent
with development and industrial policies, taxes ought to facilitate
the expansion of priority sectors. Relative prices should favour
the expansion of economic activities - tradeables - on which these
small, open economies must depend for viability. Taxes (and related
economic measures) should therefore leave the industries facing
relative prices that favour new activities. In this context, the
Caribbean is likely to be looking to activities such as skill-intensive
(including information) services, tourism, resource-based manufacturing
and mining for future growth.
<P>
This means that the traditional, non-traded activities including
agriculture should, other things being equal, attract relatively
higher taxes. This is especially the case where agricultural sectors
are large.
<P>
Furthermore, the premia (or terms of trade windfalls) arising
from the preferential arrangements, of which Lome is the most
extensive, should be taxed heavily enough to allow them only an
incentive to undertake cost-saving investments which can protect
their market shares. Bananas, rice and sugar, for example, will
face market problems of one kind or another in the longer term.
It would be prudent therefore not to permit the economic rents
that their producers currently enjoy to block diversification
of enterprise and output (further processing for domestic use
or expert) or diversification of land use (into alternative economic
activities).
<P>
Additionally, Governments need to ensure that the tax net captures
industries which benefit from economic rents, including, windfalls
associated with poor policies. The  problem of taxing parallel
market operators when the state is unwilling or unable to remove
the conditions giving rise to parallel markets, is very relevant
in this context. Apart from anything else, failure to effectively
tax such activity  tends to create hostility towards the tax system
as a whole because of its contribution to visibly inequitable
burden-sharing.  
<P>
Three points arising from these observations should be borne
in mind in relation to future fiscal policy. These are the need:
<P>
 i) to equip the tax administration to adequately raise   taxes
from the traditional areas of economic activity;
<P>
 ii) for Governments to face squarely the need to treat their
favoured constituencies in a manner consistent with the country's
developmental imperatives.
<P>
 iii) to carefully explore the utility of fees and user charges,
whilst not unproblematic, are relevant in this latter regard once
they can be employed in tandem with practical (rather than theoretical)
measures for either exempting the poor or for providing them directly
or otherwise with access.
<P>
<A NAME=B.2.B></A><B>B.2.b. Tax Reforms</B>
<P>
Turning now to the specific attempts at tax reform in the region
we notice that most of the attempts have been prompted by the
need to raise or to protect revenues and more particularly to
create or restore current budget surpluses for stabilisation purposes
or to increase capital accumulation. 
<P>
In the implementation of tax reform two approaches can be discerned:
<P>
 i)  radical changes in the tax regimes by way of wholesale
      replacement of major taxes such as  income taxes by    
  turnover taxes, or  
<P>
 ii) a more gradualist approach within which three or four
      trends (mentioned below) can be isolated.
<P>
The most radical efforts at tax reforms were attempted in Grenada
and Dominica and involved switches from one set of tax imposts
to another. Barbados' efforts in 1986 and 1987, involving first
a sharp decrease in tax rates and later equally sharp imposts,
could be deemed to fall into this category also. The results of
these experiments have been analysed elsewhere and we shall look
at the problems associated with the specific taxes later. 
<P>
The general assessment has been that the results were very
disappointing in that all of these experiments failed to deliver
the expected revenue benefit. The main lesson to be had from them
is that 'sweeping changes are likely to work best when the tax
administration system is itself properly organised'. Indeed, resource
limitations and the low priority which revenue collection agencies
attract have led one commentator to conclude that, 'the whole
question of tax reform for economic purposes seems somewhat premature.'
<P>
In most states of the region reforms have been less radical
than those of the three states mentioned earlier and have taken
the form of incremental new taxes or the modification of existing
tax regimes.  The reforms have usually centred on :
<P>
 i)  simplification of the tax system especially by way   
    of fewer, and preferably single, rates and tax bands
<P>
 ii) liberalisation of personal and corporate income tax  
 regimes involving additionally, attenuation of their  progressivity
<P>
 iii) the increasing utilisation of indirect, particularly
        sales, taxes of which the value added tax has been the
      most popular and/or 
<P>
 iv) the establishment of a single revenue agency
<P>
The most popular approach to reform in the region has included
<U>the simplification of tax regimes</U>. This applies to both
corporate taxation and personal taxes. It has been a feature of
reform in Jamaica and Guyana. Guyana's personal income tax bands
have been reduced to three and that of Jamaica to one. Additionally,
in keeping with the new positions in the fiscal community, high
marginal rates have been frowned on leading to a closing of the
gaps between marginal and average rates.  
<P>
Elsewhere, there have been moves to reduce the discrimination
between corporate entities - commercial, non-commercial and long-
term insurance companies in the case of Guyana. Indeed, in Jamaica
personal and corporate income tax rates were for a time made the
same.
<P>
Simplification has advantages for both the taxpayer and the
tax authority. In Guyana the Inland Revenue Department was especially
wedded to this process because it freed resources for work on
priority and more fruitful areas. It also reduced the scope for
fraud. It should also be said that a prevailing view was that
simplicity appeared to be more important in the context of stimulating
private investment (especially local) investment than fiscal incentives.
 <P>
Over the last two decades the importance of <U>indirect taxes</U>
has increased significantly in Caribbean tax regimes. This has
been so notwithstanding the theoretical advantages of direct over
indirect taxes. The latter include the scope for progression.
In reality however, Caribbean Governments have proven to be unable
and/or unwilling  to tailor direct taxes well enough to exploit
their revenue potential and equitable characteristics so increased
reliance has been placed on indirect taxes. 
<P>
In the literature it has been argued that these shifts need
not imply increasing regressiveness of the fiscal system as a
whole (Tanzi, 1989, for example). It is true that an acceptable
 assessment would have to include an examination of the incidence
of expenditures also. If equity is a major consideration, it may
be met by a combination of revenue and expenditure measures. 
In other words, what matters is whether the fiscal system <U>as
a whole</U> is managed with the equity objective in mind. 
<P>
The combined effect of these measures tell their own story.
The move to indirect taxes lead to greater horizontal equity but
since they have been implemented in conjunction with reduced rates
of personal and profit taxes, the overall result has been a decline
in the equity of the system as a whole. In effect therefore, (direct)
taxes on higher incomes have fallen while the burden of increases
in the number of indirect taxes has been borne by low and middle
incomes. 
<P>
At the same time, restrictions on expenditures and the absence
of effective safety nets have meant that there has been little
or no scope to address, or more appropriately, to redress, adverse
income distribution effects. These scissors can be seen in its
most dramatic form in Guyana (Greenidge, 1994). It is not however,
a peculiarity of that country as the work of Rodriguez, (1993)
attests. Latin America's Structural Adjustment efforts have been
characterised by the same features. Elsewhere in the Caribbean,
other than Guyana, few Governments exert sufficient control over
expenditure to compensate for the adverse consequences of taxes
which increase the fiscal burden on the poor.  
<P>
At the same time, there is little evidence to support the assertion
that <U>rate reductions</U> foster significant improvements in
incentives to invest or compliance.
<P>
The conventional wisdom among the multi-lateral financial institutions
strongly favours <U>sales taxes and the value-added tax</U> (VAT)
in particular. The discussion on the merits of the VAT is well
enough documented for it not to be necessary for us to dwell on
it here. As far as the VAT is concerned the experience has been
instructive. A study of its impact in 23 countries found some
evidence that its introduction contributed to an increase in the
tax ratio but not to the rate of growth of the ratio. The effect
could be said to be once-and-for-all. Furthermore, the same result
might have been achieved by combining a broad-based income tax
with a consumption tax (Nellor, 1987). 
<P>
In the region the imposition of this tax has led to no dramatic
impact on the tax/GDP ratio. It seems that a tax of this type,
whatever the promise, could not be expected to dramatically increase
the tax take without effort to ensure that the tax is tailored
to meet the subjective situation in which it is to be levied.
In the words of Farrel, 'a good VAT is a country-specific VAT'
(Theodore, pp 101). 
<P>
Given the characteristics of the region, the increased urgency
being shown towards regional integration and the likely consequences
of the Uruguay Round, it is imperative that trade tariff and tax
reforms be coordinated. It is frequently assumed that trade liberalisation
will broaden the tax base more than enough to offset the revenue
losses resulting from the tariff reduction. Frequently, such offset
have not occurred elsewhere. 
<P>
Finally, judging from the public debate, many countries seem
to be persuaded of the efficacy of a <U>single revenue agency</U>
in place of Departments of Inland Revenues, Customs and Excise
Departments and the like. There can be little doubt as to the
potential advantages of a single unified revenue agency. If nothing
else, it ought to reduce political interference or constraints
on implementation of fiscal policy and to act as a restraint on
the exercise of  state power. However, while part of the problem
arises from inefficiencies due to overlapping responsibilities
and duplication of effort (and therefore waste of scarce human
and material resources) these are not by any means the main or
the only main problems. 
<P>
A major problem has been the unwillingness of some Governments
to raise taxes or to adjust exchange rate regimes to ensure that
net foreign exchange earners can earn adequate profits in domestic
currencies. 
<P>
Where external imbalances are permitted to continue for extended
periods it is important to recognise that an exchange rate movement
can by itself have a far more significant impact on tax effort
than tax reform. Guyana's structural adjustment experience  is
witness to that as may be seen between 1991 and 1993. An over-
valued currency, in addition to anything else, will result in
taxes on foreign trade being collected at exchanges rates which
are below those at which the transactions is conducted. Few taxes
have proven to be flexible enough to permit capture of this windfall.
<P>
In such a situation, it is hardly surprising that many commentators
have been seduced by the prospect of an independent, powerful
revenue agency which would be responsible for collecting revenues
and setting tax rates, etc. The revenue agency can be a foil in
such situations. Taking this approach a step further, Hausmann
of the IDB proposed the establishment of <U>independent</U> <U>national
fiscal councils</U>, somewhat along the lines of Central Banks,
which would have the responsibility for managing fiscal policy,
and more to the point, powers to fix levels of public debt and
the fiscal deficit. 
<P>
It is unlikely that taxpayers would  accept this for very long,
however. Some political animal has to take the decision to levy
taxes on some of those sectors currently not bearing burdens commensurate
with national savings needs and some fair notion of burden sharing.
A quasi-Government, unelected, non-accountable agency is not likely
to be able to save Governments for long from the firing line since
electorates traditionally require representation for their taxation.
In this vein, Summers of the US has validly observed that fiscal
issues are more political than those handled by Central Banks.
For this reason, there could be no 'silver bullet' whether by
way of independent national revenue agency or fiscal council.
In the absence of some semblance of social consensus major fiscal
issues cannot be resolved by these institutional silver bullets.
<P>
If the Caribbean reforms were intended to increase the rate
of savings and/or to reduce the cost of administering the tax
system at a given level of revenues then neither the gradualist
nor the more radical approaches to reform have been very effective
in the region. The efforts of Grenada and Dominica encountered
serious problems as have those of Jamaica and Barbados, for example.
<P>
<A NAME=B.2.C></A><B>B.2.c. Recapitulation</B>
<P>
This brief review of the experience of tax reform leads to
several interesting guides for the future. First of all, there
appears to be no panacea. The regimes which appear to have the
greatest potential have to be<U> carefully adapted</U> to country
needs  if they are to realise that potential. That means implementation
and design of such regimes will mitigate against simplicity.
<P>
In any case,  the greatest prospect of returns in the future
appears  to lie with <U>thorough-going reform of tax administrations</U>
within existing fiscal systems. Such reform could include net
worth or what may be called investigative auditing and the thoroughgoing
review of (leading to stiffer) penalties including those for evasion.
Complementary reforms would include presumptive taxation aimed
at bringing the informal sector, particularly agriculture, in
some cases within the tax net. Additionally, broadening of the
property tax base by re- valuations in line with inflation and
in market values will also help to ensure that the well-off also
contribute at levels more consistent with their ability to pay.
<P>
If such challenges are first tackled, more demanding regimes
may be more effectively managed subsequently. Jamaica and Dominica
appear to have been persuaded by the virtue of this route and
have embarked on this type of reform with the financial support
of IBRD and CIDA, respectively.
<P>
In so far as rates of growth are not expanding fast enough
to adequately ameliorate concerns about problems of poverty, careful
consideration should be given to a revitalised role for taxes
based on property (owned and disposed of). This means that another
look should be taken at<U> capital gains/acquisitions taxes and
death duties</U>, inter alia.
<P>
Additionally, since much of the capital generated in the region
is currently held abroad, each country should invest time and
resources to attenuating and reversing capital flight. Three points
of attention may merit attention in this context i.e stable macro-economic
policies, the harmonisation of capital tax regimes and the political
climate.
<P>
Finally, there is the question of political will as regards
revenue efforts. Some years ago Northcote-Parkinson followed his
well-known and popular book on Parkinson's law with a second less
successful but nonetheless interesting book, 'The Law and the
Profits'. In that amusing work on fiscal issues and taxation he
contended that, 'there are limits to the collection of revenue
and that evils multiply when these limits are ignored. However,
the tendency to cross these limits appears to be universal, eternal
and all but irresistible' (1960, pp9).
<P>
In effect, the state's capacity  to raise taxes is not only
limited by technical considerations of tax design and collection
but by <U>political factors</U> such as attitudes towards paying
taxes which are in turn  dependent on the transparency  and the
incidence of imposts and expenditures as well as perceptions about
the regime's fairness. The challenge is to raise that political
ceiling and/or to spend that which is collected , more efficiently
and effectively.
<P>
We shall return to this political dimension.
<P>
<A NAME=B.3></A><B>B.3. FINANCING AND DEBT ISSUES</B>
<P>
<A NAME=B.3.A></A><B>B.3.a. Financing</B>
<P>
Some of the resources needed for financing the new priorities
may be found in the private sector. Some may be found in the NGO
element of civic society.  The efficacy of a search in the latter
area will depend in part on the existence of active and financially
well-endowed actors in civic society such as NGOs and civic-minded
businesses. Their existence is not to be taken for granted. Where
they do not exist Governments need to consider whether any specific
policy/ies may be a discouragement to their establishment. 
<P>
During the 1990s there was a substantial decline in the net
flow of official capital into the region. In the light of the
factors mentioned earlier this situation can be expected to persist
into the third millennium.  The region will need to meet some
of its new resource needs from increased domestic savings and
private investment (portfolio and direct). Measures to facilitate
the mobilisation of small savings and the legal and institutional
framework for effective trade in stocks should be actively pursued.
Finally, it is necessary to widen the region's horizons for purposes
of concessional aid and investment. The growing global import
of the Pacific Rim states in this area should not be overlooked
although, for the region as a whole, there is little reason to
expect that such flows would be dramatically high over a sustained
period.
<P>
Increased rates of savings can enhance growth rates as may
be seen in the case of East Asia. Savings rates may be enhanced
by financial sector reform, especially as regards measures to
reduce crowding-out, social-security reform (which has virtues
in its own right as was mentioned earlier) and, positive real
interest rates.
<P>
<U>Financial reform  and liberalisation</U>, its has
often been asserted, has a very great potential for enhancing
the link between interest rates and growth. However, recent research
points to the need to handle financial liberalisation with caution
because in certain circumstances it may actually cause a decrease
in net private savings 'liquidity effect' by stimulating a boom
in consumer credit and household borrowing (Ogaki, 1996).
<P>
At the IBRD's Annual Conference on Development Economics which
examined, inter alia, the role of government in financial markets,
Stiglitz argued that, whilst various forms of government intervention
could be beneficial and welfare-enhancing in the context of ensuring
solvency and stability, intervention involves problems. Examination
of those problems argues for <U>simple regulatory structures</U>
with relatively little scope for discretion.
<P>
Whilst there has been a great deal of debate as regards the
 exact import of the different factors influencing private investment
there is reasonable certainty that additional consideration will
have to be given in future to the role of the macro-economic environment,
establishing a clear and comprehensible investment framework as
well as an appropriate and  supportive legal framework and practices.
<P>
There has been a long simmering controversy as to extent of
wasteful tax competition by LDCs in relation to attracting investment.
Attention needs to be paid in the Caribbean to devising common
and <U>appropriate income attribution rules</U> to circumvent
the shifting of income to low tax home bases or to tax havens.
<P>
The manner of meeting expenditures is quite important. There
is some evidence, although not definitive, that deficit financing,
for example, contributes to increased real government spending.
(Diamond, 1988). At the same time few  tax regimes in the region
have proven to be flexible enough to enable Treasuries to avoid
borrowing. One very important lesson to be had from the debt crisis
is the need for the careful management of both external and internal
borrowing. 
<P>
<A NAME=B.3.B></A><B>B.3.b. Borrowing</B>
<P>
Traditionally, debt management in some parts of the region
has been more concerned with debt recording rather than management.
The latter involves a both an overview of all Government guaranteed
borrowing (including non-Central Government) as well as a capacity
to realistically assess  limits to capacity to service in the
light of likely revenue trends (and risks). Failure to respect
this requirement has led to problems for some countries. In this
context, 'the wages of sin is debt'.
<P>
In the region, two countries in the middle income category
are moderately indebted (Antigua and D.R) and another severely
indebted (Jamaica). One of the two low income states (Guyana)
is severely indebted.
<P>
Over the years too little attention has been devoted to the
adverse impact of a large debt overhang on fiscal and expenditure
options. Onerous debt service obligations adversely affect expectations
about the future and trends in private investment. Measures which
could reduce the quantum of resources devoted to external debt
service would be of special benefit to the heavily indebted in
the region because it could have a relatively direct and quick
beneficial impact on the poor by relieving pressure to cut expenditure
on those activities which are easy to cut but which have a disproportionately
large impact on the well-being of poorer households (Greenidge,
1990). 
<P>
<A NAME=B.3.C></A><B>B.3.c. Privatisation</B>
<P>
In the present context the importance of privatisation lies
in privatisation proceeds. The first claims on the proceeds of
the divestment should be to reduce the stock of debt (starting
with high cost debt) especially where such debts may have accrued
from the operation of the public enterprise. For obvious reasons
the proceeds should not be used to facilitate recurrent expenditure.
In circumstances where tax, rents, royalties and other revenues
are realised from privatisation there could be no objection in
considering their utilisation for the latter purposes. In that
case an assessment should be made of the probability of them being
sustained over the long term.  
<P>
<A NAME=C></A><B>C. CONCLUSIONS</B>
<P>
The economic future of the Caribbean is very much bound up
with the speed at which the region is able to gear itself to meet
the changes taking place around the globe. The state needs to
have a vision around which the economy can evolve. Although much
of liberalisation and reform is directed against economic statism,
it is government which will need to provide leadership in the
reform process. The role of the former should, in the face of
these far-reaching and unpredictable changes, be primarily that
of creating the environment within which a wide-range of economic
and social actors can have an opportunity to compete, far more
than has been the case in the past, in the provision of a changing
bundle of goods and services. The policy framework would need
to be flexible enough to permit timely evolution of productive
structures. 
<P>
It would therefore be imperative for the basic prerequisites
for efficient industry to be provided and provided in as timely
a manner as possible.  Expenditure rather than revenue management
 may well turn out to be the more problematic course politically
because in many countries electorates are primarily concerned
about improving their material well-being. And, also because once
there have been fiscal excesses the 'easiest' correction is expenditure
reduction. Fiscal excesses are however harder to correct than
is the maintenance of initial conservative fiscal policies/balance.
<P>
The point attributed to Lewis suggests that the populace needs
to appreciate that if a government is not to find itself having
to force its citizens to pay taxes and user charges for utilities,
the role of the state must of necessity be restricted in a fiscal
sense. And, for the state to be more effective within that budget
constraint, it has to shed some current activities. Without sufficient
of, the latter, the public will be provided with less service
for its buck or tax dollar.
<P>
Frequently, Governments come to power on the wings of 'unfulfillable'
promises to provide more and cheaper services without so much
as a whisper about the means of financing. When they do address
the latter, the promises can be similarly problematic, as has
been seen in some of the attempts at radical reforms. Yet, elsewhere
the politicisation of taxation has left some communities with
a view that they have a right to be tax exempt. It has therefore
become difficult even for their own parties in Government to tax
them. Apart from the need for responsible politics, this phenomenon
may point to the fact that although many countries have relatively
high per caput incomes their electorates suffer from inadequate
access to basic services. 
<P>
Then again, it may have to do with the adequacy of the electoral
mechanism and the interpretation of mandates. Multi-party politics
and the Westminster system concern majority decision- making not
necessarily consensus making. There is a tendency for the instruments
of power to be appropriated by sub-groups within a majority. There
can be no guarantee that the system will not yield an outcome
under which the burden of taxes is borne by the poor whilst the
benefits of Government services are directed disproportionately
to those already relatively well-off.
<P>
The challenge even in the UK today is to devise a system which
facilitates discussion and negotiation. For either system to work
effectively, some (a considerable amount in most cases) effort
will have to be devoted to information dissemination and analysis
perhaps with development support communications.  In other words,
the political limits may need to be constrained or at least informed
by a conscious effort at education and transparent consensus building.
 We have already adverted to the utility of a well-informed public
service in the context of raising revenues and managing expenditures.
Some countries have already taken the critical steps in this regard
as may be gleaned from some of the debates in the press and elsewhere.
In others, debate remains shrouded by sectional political considerations.
The debate needs to recognise that there are a growing number
of institutional options and that the appropriate mix of state
and public is time bound. It is therefore appropriate to constantly
explore the ever-changing frontiers of public/private sector 'comparative
advantage' or efficiency in order to inform policy.

<B>This is a representation of the leaflet handed out at the Unemployed Workers Centre in Hammersmith on 5/5/96 before going on to occupy the Pure Genius!! site in Wandsworth, London.</B>

<CAPTION>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>WHAT'S HAPPENING?</B></FONT>

</CAPTION>

<TR>
<TD>
<B>WELCOME to this URBAN OCCUPATION.  It's a unique action and maybe a bit different from things we've done before.  Here's a few practical things you should know.  But first, a big THANK YOU to Hammersmith Unemployed Workers Centre for letting us meet here.  They'll feel most appreciated if we don't leave their place in a shit heap.  </B>
<P>
<B>WHERE ARE WE GOING?</B>
<P>
Can't say just yet.  Somewhere near Croydon.  The actual site will be revealed just before we get there.  
<P>
<B>THE PLAN.</B>
<P>
Might not seem like it now, but there is one - honest!  We will be setting off together in one - or maybe two or there -groups.  If we can't occupy our first site, we have another one to go to, and there are other contingency plans for various things that might go wrong.  Wherever you are on the way, there should be people with mobile phones who are in touch with what's going on.  If we need to come back here to reorganise and go of again, that won't be a defeat - just adapting to circumstances.  If there are too many people for the coaches, a group will need to stay behind here and either the coaches will come back and pick you up or you'll be able to go to the site by public transport.  
<P>
<B>ARRIVING AT THE SITE</B>
<P>
At site 1- our first objective - coaches will pull up in the land.  Tat lorries and travellers' vehicles will drive through the site gate.  Please get out as quick as you can and get onto the site, following the vehicles.  Then we can shut the gate and we've done it ! If the site gate is blocked, travellers vehicles will go to another place (they'll know where) and wait.  Tat lorries will approach the site another way and unload just of it.  If this happens, lots of help will be needed quickly to hump all the tat on to site.  If we have to go to site 2, people on foot will find it easier to enter the site by a different gate than vehicles.
<P>
<B>WHAT NEXT? </B>
<P>
Let's take 10 mins to look around then have a SITE MEETING. From then on, the people who knew where it was have finished their job and now WE'RE ALL IN CHARGE OF EVERYTHING.  No more wannabe field marshals.  The obvious first decisions will be: Where's the best place on site for travellers to park?  What gate will we use as site entrance?  The important first jobs will be getting the tat unloaded, erecting a reception structure near our chosen gate, and leafleting the neighbourhood.
<P>
<B>NEIGHBOURS.</B>
<P>
People will be living on at least one side of the site.  WHEN WE TAKE OUR SITE, PLEASE CELEBRATE QUIETLY.  It's bank holiday Sunday and the neighbours won't appreciate being blasted out of bed by us.  Please consider them in everything you do while we're on site.  We're here to gain there support and to work with them to make the local eyesore into a decent place for all of us.  
<P>
<B>THE LAW </B>
<P>
LEGAL DEFENCE AND MONITORING GROUP are monitoring the occupation today (but probably not on later days).  They are wearing bright orange bibs.  Their role is not to take part in the occupation or intervene in any incidents involving the police, but to observe and gather evidence which will help the defence of anyone charged.  They also have a BUST NUMBER which is 0171-837-6687.  Legal help for anyone arrested or assaulted will be available from this number.  Ring if you are arrested or assaulted or witness either of these things happening.  Make sure you take one of their <a href="bustcard.html">BUST CARDS</a> which explains your legal rights in more detail.  THANKS to LDMG for their support today.  They are always glad of donations to help continue their work.  
<P>
Apart from LDMG, we also have a POLICE LIAISON TEAM.  It includes several lawyers.  Their job is to talk to the police so you don't have to.  They will be contacting senior officers as soon as we're on site.  Tell any police who approach you that the Police Liaison Team is in touch with their superiors.  PLEASE AVOID WINDING UP THE POLICE.  It's not what we're here for.  We've got much better things to do.
<P>
If you are order to leave the site by the police under section 61 of the Criminal Justice & Public Order Act, you may be liable for arrest if you don't do so.  Even if the police are wrong in law (which is quite likely) you may still be arrested.  
<P>
<B>MEDIA</B>
<P>
There will be loads of them!  A special posse of people has volunteered to "chaperone" the media, show them around, give them press releases and interviews, make sure they don't get to cheeky with cameras, etc.  The media posse aren't "leaders" or "spokespeople" any more or less than you are.  They're not thereto stop you talking to the media if you want - or ignore them if that's what you prefer.  Its up to you.  
<P>
<B>TRAVELLERS</B>
<P>
This stuff has been suggested by travellers involved in planning the occupation, so it isn't motivated by any anti- travellers crap.  Because the main idea of this occupation is to demonstrate what can be done to build houses, create community facilities and cultivate urban wasteland, the planning meetings thought it would be best to set aside one part of the site for travellers' vehicles.  This will prevent the view of what we're doing from outside the site being blocked and avoid it seeming like "just another park up".  Which part of the site is best for that is up to you, the travellers.  At site 1, the people who sussed it have a suggestion to make, but it's your decision. Where you chose may affect which entrance we use and how we arrange other things, so it needs to be sorted soon after we arrive.  
<P>
If we find a situation where we can get bodies, rucksacks etc. on site, but access for vehicles is blocked, several places have been sussed where you should be o.k. to go and park up for a while and wait for a phone call or message to say we've got access sorted.  If we can't get vehicle access at all we'll have to aim for an alternative site, but we don't think that'll happen.  One or two of the Legal Observers will stay with you all the time until you're safely on site.  When waiting at the park-up, best to stay in your vehicles if possible, ready to move quickly.  Your legal observer(s) should be on the pavement beside you.
<P>
We're aiming not to get roadblocked on the way.  It would cause traffic chaos in London, anyway.  But if it does happen, you might want to break off immediately and head for one of the park-ups mentioned above.  You will know where they are by then.  The rest of us can deal with old bill.
<P>
Please make sure you get a call sheet before we leave.  It will have mobile numbers for other people involved.  You should also make sure YOUR mobile numbers (hope you've got a few) are on other people's call sheets.
<P>
<B>MONITOR WELLS. </B>
<P>
What are they? site 1 was polluted by its previous industrial uses. The pollution should have been removed when the buildings were demolished, and looks like it has been.  But there is at least one - and probably more -monitor wells.  They are small, very deep holes through which the ground water is sampled to make sure no pollution is left.  They have small rectangular metal covers and look like the water board ones you see in the street.  Just leave them alone and don't build anything over the top of one, please. 
<P>
<B>CARS.</B>
<P>
All the big planning meetings have decided we don't want any cars or vans on site (except travellers' living vehicles and the tat lorries which are hired and will be off site as soon as they've unloaded).  SO IF YOU HAVE A CAR OR VAN PLEASE LEAVE IT HERE IF POSSIBLE. and get on the coaches with everyone else.  You can come back and collect it by public transport.  If you have more gear than you can take on the coach, load it onto the tat lorries.  If you must bring a car or van, please follow the convoy behind the last travellers' vehicle.  Please don't park in residential roads near the site.  There are some industrial ones which will be better. 
<P>
<B>KIDS</B>
<P>
Site 1 has a feature which could be dangerous to small children (under 6 or 7).  You'll see what it is as soon as we arrive.  Some of the construction we'll be doing could also be dodgy.  IF YOU HAVE SMALL CHILDREN WITH YOU, PLEASE KEEP THEM CLOSE TO YOU.  	Actually, this site won't be very suitable for small children at first.  It'll improve as the week goes on and we're hoping to have a children's day towards the end of the first week.
<P>
<B>FIRES</B>
<P>
We haven't got a lot of firewood and worthwhile wood runs are long and difficult in London.  Fires could annoy our neighbours.  We'll get a kitchen fire going and another gathering one - at least in the evenings.  Please try to keep other fires to a minimum and only on parts of the site well away from neighbouring houses or flats.
<P>
<B>EVACUATION</B>
<P>
A special message to all bowel and bladder proprietors: Within an hour of getting in site, we'll have commodious compost bogs rigged up.  Another hour or less and we'll have a cunning pisser arranged.  Meantime, find a corner of the site to piss in (out of site of neighbours).  In case of delays, best place to have your morning dump is here.  Now. There won't be anywhere to crap on site until the compost bogs are sorted.

If the 1893 forecasters had been right the workday would now last only three hours; transcontinental mail would be transmitted in pneumatic tubes; laws would be so simplified that there would be no work for lawyers; all forests would have gone; there would be state-run colleges for servants; and, most bizarre of all, marriages would be happy because couples unsuited to each other would be executed!<p>Chicago Senator John J Ingalls predicted that by the 1990s 'It will be as common for the citizen to call for his (sic) dirigible balloon as it is now for his buggy or his boots'.<p>Journalist Walter Wellman confidently predicted that there was no future in subway trains and travel would be by elevated trains moving along glass-enclosed tracks.<p>None of the forecasters anticipated the automobile which was to revolutionize travel in the decades just ahead. Thiswas in spite of thefact that gasoline-powered cars were successfully run in Germany in the 1880s. One forecaster was certain, however, that the 1993 traveller would be able to ride by rail all the way from Chicago to Buenos Aires - something which is still not possible.<p>Lawyer Van Buren Demnslow predicted longevity would so increase that a life span of 120 would not be unusual. Baptist Minister Thomas Dixon Jnr declared:'Democracy will reign triumphant to the farthest  limits of civilization.' <p>Meanwhile, in France, journalist and illustrator Albert Robida was regularly publishing his visions of the future and contributing to the growing popularity of this kind of speculation. He had some quite accurate foresights - the television, for example. But he also depicted airborne hotels as a solution to overcrowding in holiday resorts and saw the Egyptian Sphinx in the middle of a lush garden thanks to a gigantic engineering project to control the climate.<p>In 1922 Swiss architect Le Corbusier proposed a city in which airplanes were the answer to traffic congestion. In the 1930s machines that were half-car and half-aircraft were built and communities were prepared to build Ôair parks'. According to one wartime survey, one out of every three car dealers also planned to sell aircraft after World War Two.<p>Ironically, some more fanciful fiction writers have come closer to the mark than their more 'realistic' counterparts in the worlds of business, politics and journalism. HG Wells, for example, foresaw nuclear power, Aldous Huxley genetic engineering.Perhaps the safest forecast we can make for the year 2025 is that it won,t be like whatever we think it will be like.   <p>We trust that examples from this issue of <b>NI </b>will find their deserved place in a similar article in 2025.<p><hr>	<font size=-1><b>Sources: </b>The Futurist, May/June 1993.

<p><font size=+1><i>When an egg goes missing the fault-lines in Mary's family grow
deeper. A short story from Pakistan by <b>Maria del Nevo.</b></i></font><hr width=90%><p>
Three fresh eggs lay in a small bowl on the top shelf in Freda's
kitchen. She stood frowning furiously at the bowl as if it had
insulted her. 'Yesterday Naseem gave me one piece of meat only.
And it was this small!' she said to her daughter Mary, making a
tiny circle with her thumb and forefinger and screwing up her
eyes for further emphasis. 'And now,' she went on in a whisper,
'an egg has gone and I can guess who has taken it!' Freda
glanced accusingly out the window to the room across the yard
where Naseem, her daughter-in-law, lived.<p>
Mary was the youngest of four. Her elder sister had married and
moved to her in-laws. Her elder brothers had a room each for
their families in her mother's house. When her father was alive
things were different because Mary and her mother were dependent
upon him and he was a kind and generous man. In those days her
mother never had to question her status in the house and her
sisters-in-law would not have dared question it either. But
after her father's death, Mary and her mother were left to the
mercy of Mary's brothers and then the rumblings of conflict
vibrated through the walls and divisions appeared between the
three families of the house.<p>
Mary made no comment to her mother about the egg. She was tired
of the endless bickering over food. She was often hungry
herself. The pains in her stomach woke her up in the night and
most mornings she got up feeling light-headed. Sometimes she
stood before the mirror and inspected the bones which protruded
offensively from her shoulders and ribs and then she closed her
eyes and prayed to God that He might make her disappear
altogether.<p>
As Christians, arranged marriages were not customary in Mary's
family. Her brothers and sister had chosen their own spouses,
and when Mary was 18 she became desperate in her search for a
husband. Only when she married would she belong and, like her
sisters-in-law,  be valued and looked after for being a mother. <p>
Having failed to find a suitable Christian boy Mary fell in love
with Ahmed, a Muslim. They dated a few times but when she fell
pregnant Ahmed abandoned her. During the pregnancy Freda became
anxious. Mary was so small that sometimes she wondered if her
daughter would survive childbirth. And when she gave birth to an
eight-pound baby boy the whole family expressed amazement at
such a miracle.<p>
Ahmed immediately reappeared. He wanted his son in his parents'
home and Mary there to look after them. Even though her mother
disapproved of a mixed marriage, Mary converted to Islam,
changed her name to Hafza and moved to her in-laws.<p>
Her mother-in-law kept a watchful eye on Mary and, terrified of
being thrown out of the house, she obeyed her every command and
dared not become a burden on the family resources. Although,
when she awoke at dawn, the hunger pangs gnawed at her stomach,
she waited until midday for a bowl of dal and always refrained
from taking meat at the evening meal. While she watched her
pampered son grow more healthy each day, Mary's own unhappiness
seemed to be reflected in her increasing loss of weight.<p>
After months of complete isolation from the outside world Mary's
sister visited her. They were allowed a few minutes precious
privacy before Ahmed's family crowded round to offer customary
hospitality. 'You know what these people are planning to do?'
whispered her sister, and at Mary's blank expression she went
on. 'They have to put up with you until Imran is seven only.
Don't you see? When he reaches that age they can get custody of
him, and then they will throw you away like a dirty dish rag.' <p>
But Mary was parted from her son when he was only three. Her
husband, who had quickly tired of his emaciated and moody wife,
kicked her out of the house and threatened her with never being
allowed to see Imran again if she attempted to fight for custody.<p>
Initially Mary's family were pleased to have her back. They took
every opportunity to remind her that she should have known
better than to marry outside her own community. But when it
became clear that she would remain an added burden on them and
arguments over the cost of living became more frequent, they
began to resent her presence in  the house. Then it dawned on
Mary how her situation in her mother's house differed little
from that in her in-laws'.<p>
As she did most afternoons, Mary went across to Naseem's room to
help look after her nephews and nieces. She watched Naseem as
the older woman fed her baby son. She was tall and well-built,
just like Nadia her younger sister-in-law. Mary's brothers often
joked about Naseem and Nadia's weight which had increased since
their marriages. But secretly they were proud of their wives and
satisfied that they could never be accused of neglecting the
mothers of their sons. Mary only hoped that her brothers lived
long lives for she would never wish her mother's sad fate on
either Naseem or Nadia.<p>
'Did you hear that one egg has gone from the kitchen?' Naseem
asked her in a whisper. 'Mummy thinks I gave it to my son. But
you know who took it?' Naseem tilted her head in the direction
of the room where Nadia lived. 'Did you see how much chicken she
took last night? A pile as big as this! And the breast she took
too, which I was saving for my husband.'<p>
Mary listened to Naseem in silence. She didn't doubt that when
Naseem and Nadia talked together they would accuse her of eating
the egg. The thought made her cringe with shame.<p>
That evening as Mary and her mother sat together on the bed with
their evening meal placed before them, Mary looked out across
the yard into the kitchen opposite. Her nephews and nieces were
all gathered around the table chattering happily over their
food. She watched as Naseem and Nadia piled their husbands'
plates high with boiled rice and even higher with lumps of
beautiful lean lamb. She glanced at her mother who was poking at
a piece of gristle disdainfully and she looked down at her own
bowl of gravy for a while, before forcing herself to raise the
spoon to her lips.<p>

<h2>
THE ISSUES: Women's Hunger</h2><p>
Mary's story would sound familiar to most women of the Indian
subcontinent.<p>
Behind the data on poverty and hunger lies the assumption that
everyone within a family is affected equally. This is clearly
not the case - women in general work more than men, get paid
less if they get paid at all, and, when food is an issue, they
get less to eat. In South Asia 64 per cent of pregnant women are
anaemic, passing on a legacy of malnutrition to the infants they
bear.<p>
Increasingly amongst the poorest of the poor, women find
themselves abandoned by men, working without respite just to
keep the family together. Into a typical day they fit caring for
their children, working in the house and working for a wage.
They are also the most vulnerable - 80 per cent of the world's
refugees are women and their dependent children.<p>
Undervalued though it may be, women's work is responsible for at
least half of all the food grown in the world. Yet they own no
more than one per cent of the world's farmlands.<p>
Whether it is access to food, land, credit or paid work, women's
decisions tend to be controlled by those in power - usually men.<p>
Women's hunger is the most basic reflection of their unequal
position in society. Most major development agencies working in
the Majority World now have goals to encourage women's
self-sufficiency. <p>

Linking Relief and Development</h2>
<h4>Full text of an article from <i>APRODEV Bulletin</i><br>April 1996: pages 10-12<p></h4>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
In December 1995, the Commission finished its internal discussion
document on "Linking Relief, Rehabilitation and Development". It
has subsequently been discussed with experts from the academic
world, the Member States and the NGOs. A revised document, taking
account of comments made, is now going through a consultation
process within the Commission. The aim of the discussions could be
a Resolution or a Common Position by the Council of Ministers,
meeting in May. In the meantime, the Commission has decided to test
the new approach in its dealings with Liberia, Angola, Somalia,
Haiti and the Great Lakes region.
<p>
The issue of linking relief and development is on the EU agenda
because: "During 1995, important decisions on long-term development
cooperation relationships have been taken: negotiations on the
Lom&#233; IV Mid Term Review..., a new EU-Mediterranean policy...,
periodic conferences with Latin American (San Jos&#233; and Rio
groups) countries,... and new framework agreements with Asian
countries (Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos).... At the same time, a series
of legal bases/draft regulations have been proposed, regarding a
number of instruments ranging from short-term relief and
rehabilitation to longer-term development." This has led the
Commission to realise that better coordination between all these
instruments was called for. Key words are: complementarity,
coherence and efficiency. The aim being the strengthening of
linkages between the various fields of activity.
<p>
<h3>Linkages</h3>
<p>
The paper starts from the assumption that: "better 'development'
can reduce the need for emergency relief; better 'relief' can
contribute to development; and better 'rehabilitation' can ease the
transition between the two." It says that "the explicit aim of
humanitarian aid is to save the lives of victims of emergency
situations... Although in such situations, the long-term
perspective must come second to saving life, it is nevertheless
extremely important to keep sight of the longer-term view. Indeed,
the short-term and long-term perspective can sometimes be
conflictive."
<p>
According to the discussion document, there are two main ways to
deal with this conflict: improved awareness of the impact of
humanitarian actions and organisational coordination. "A solid
long-term perspective of relief operations can only be assured if
a clear impact analysis is made before relief actions are
implemented." There is a need for country-specific impact analyses.
<p>
The Commission has not managed to apply the proposed "holistic"
approach to the document, which breathes the spirit of a
"continuum" approach. It says that rehabilitation and
reconstruction primarily concern the re-establishment of rule of
law and political dialogue, and that rehabilitation efforts should
be of limited duration, not aiming for restoration but rather for
the resumption of development.
<p>
In the section about development, the terms "Risk" and
"Vulnerability" play an important role. The Community should take
vulnerabilities into account in programming its assistance. This is
then illustrated for two fields: food security and health. 
A fourth section deals with man-made emergencies. "Conflict
prevention should be an intrinsic element of development
cooperation policy.... A policy of crisis prevention should
adequately combine political, economic, legal, military, social and
environmental stabilisation measures. The challenge lies in the
mobilisation of efforts, their coordination and their direction
towards a common goal." According to the document, EU policies
should be captured in an overall policy framework, aiming at
"structural stability" i.e. "sustainable economic development,
democracy and respect for human rights, viable political
structures, healthy social and environmental conditions, with the
capacity to manage change without resort to violence."
<p>
The paper therefore concludes that:
<ul>
<li>"The approach to the economic, political and social development
of developing countries should be more holistic than is the case
until now." The EU has a need for strategic planning policies, set
out in global policy frameworks that need to be developed. These
frameworks need to describe vulnerabilities and set out the
linkages between conflict prevention, development planning,
rehabilitation, relief and disaster preparedness for each country
and region.
<li>More attention should be paid on coordination, between donors
as well as internally between different Commission services.
Internal EU coordination could be improved by the creation of
country Task Forces, consisting of officials from departments
dealing with relief, rehabilitation, development and political
relations.
<li>Political analysis capacity must be enhanced. The EU
Delegations in-country will play a more important role in this
respect. "Country-specific relief impact studies" and
"rehabilitation planning strategies"  must be developed, and
"disaster preparedness programmes should be given increased
prominence."
</ul>
<p>
<h3>NGO comments</h3>

The Commission discussion document is one of many papers recently
published on this issue. NGOs welcome the document as it is a
genuine effort to translate the insights from the debate into
workable recommendations for the EU organisational lay-out. At the
same time, the Commission's text needs strengthening on several
points, as was pointed out by the NGOs who participated in the 23
February meeting. 
<p>
Most importantly, the text presented in February made little
reference to the importance of the societies the EU aid is meant to
assist. There is no clear commitment to investing in civil society
in those countries. While mention is made of vulnerabilities, the
document takes no account of the capacities that are available in
the countries concerned. This makes the document too theoretical,
as it lacks direction from the people that are most closely
affected by EU policies. If the Union is able to change its
management culture in such a way that its aid policies are defined
to a large degree by the people it strives to  aid, then that would
be a major step forward. There should be much clearer reference to
the pivotal role played by local organisations.
<p>
In this context, it needs to be said that the first draft did not
take account of the gender issues: in trying to develop new models,
the document missed out on the importance of analysing the
structures that make certain groups more vulnerable, or place
others in key positions. Assistance is fundamentally a dialogue
with people. International aid often ignores existing coping
mechanisms and structures, forgetting the human aspect of
development.
<p>
Thirdly, in defining humanitarian aid as "saving lives" rather than
"saving lives and livelihoods", and by insisting on the limited
duration of rehabilitation efforts, the Commission keeps the
separation between the two fields of activity alive. NGOs pointed
out that international donors should define their humanitarian aid
efforts in such a way that they focus on development from the
start: Programming relief for development. In other words, making
development principles an integral part - the aim - of relief and
rehabilitation.
<p>
<h3>Conflict Prevention</h3>
<p>
The document makes reference to the need for greater efforts in the
field of conflict prevention. The Commission is presently defining
its strategy towards the prevention of conflicts in Africa as well.
The approach the Commission is advocating is that, without having
to change financial arrangements or the division of competencies,
the EU could achieve much more than at present, simply by targeting
its existing assistance programmes more firmly towards the
"structural stability" of countries.
<p>
According to the Commission, the basic condition for such "targeted
assistance" is the enhancement of political analysis of root causes
of conflict. At present, the EU's capacity to fully assess the
power relations, historic backgrounds and the existence of
effective mechanisms for peaceful conciliation of different
interests are not sufficient. It is also argued that the EU needs
to focus more on closing the gap between early warning and
preventive action.
<p>
APRODEV is of the opinion that, at present, in the debate about
conflict prevention too little attention is paid to the role of
local civil society and for the bottom-up approaches to conflict
management and conflict prevention. The top-down approach, with its
stress on international military and diplomatic intervention is
necessary, but overlooks the contribution that small-scale, grass-
roots organisation can have on the growth of a climate of peace,
respect for human rights and non-violent ways of dealing with
conflict.
<p>
Furthermore, the EU has to realise the delicacy of being involved
in conflict prevention. It could be argued that many of the
conflicts in Africa today, are at least partly due to policies
promoted and followed by EU Member States. EU trade policies,
WB/IMF/EU Structural Adjustment programmes and the foreign policies
of the individual member states play a role that cannot be over-
emphasised. This is particularly relevant when mention is made of
increasing the EU's capacity to analyse the root causes of
conflict. The crucial question is who will do this analysis and
with what theoretical reference frame, as the reference frame of
the researcher largely determines the result of the research.
Also, there is the confusion about the term "Conflict Prevention".
In reality it is the prevention of violent conflict that is our
concern. Conflict is a normal aspect of any society. The issue is
to find ways and means of dealing with them in a non-violent way:
"conflict transformation" or "conflict management".

Richer countries can choose: they have ample access to food and
are less dependent on agriculture. The US is the world's second
largest producer of cereals and meat and comes third in fruit
and vegetable production - yet agriculture accounts for only
2.3% of its GDP. European Union countries import twice as many
agricultural products from the Majority World as they export to
them.1 Poorer countries have little or no choice (see map).<p><ul><ul>SHARE OF AGRICULTURE IN GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT<font size=-2>[2]</font><p></ul></ul>

The number of hungry people has actually fallen in recent years,
despite overall population increases - though the numbers in
Africa and Latin America have increased. But nearly 800 million
people still face persistent, everyday hunger. Much larger
numbers suffer from malnutrition and seasonal or temporary
hunger. <p><ul><ul>NUMBER OF UNDERNOURISHED PEOPLE IN MILLIONS<font size=-2>[3]</font>

The rich world has a glut of excess food and obese citizens: in
the US about a third of the population is overweight - $33
billion is spent each year in attempts to lose weight. In the
poor world millions subsist on an amount of food that is simply
inadequate for good health. An estimated 190 million children
under the age of five are chronically malnourished.<font size=-2>[4]</font><p><pre><ul><ul><b>The feast</b>

Shocking as they may be, these figures are only averages. There
are hungry people in rich countries and those who can afford
more than they need in poorer ones which makes the contrast

<h3>Fair trade</h3>

The terms of international trade favour wealth absolutely. The
rich world keeps the South wedded to commodity production by
putting up tariff  barriers to manufactured goods. Barriers to
textiles and clothing alone cost poor countries $53 billion a
year in lost trade - this equals the total of all Western aid to
the South. Ironically, maintaining poverty in the Majority World
means poor countries can buy less of the manufactured goods the
rich are so eager to supply. There is no such thing as a 'free'
market; what we have to strive for is one that is fair. The
first step is to get informed and use our choices as consumers
and investors wisely. As citizens we can oppose unfair trade and
voice that opposition to our political leaders.<p>
<h3>Environmental protection</h3>

Overpopulation in the Majority World has often been blamed for
ecological catastrophe. In fact poor people have more at stake
in preserving the resources they depend on. It is ruthless,
short-sighted commercial exploitation by the rich which is
levelling the Amazon forests for furniture, narcotics and beef
steak.  Plantations  grow the same crop repeatedly, earmarking
their produce for the West. Such practices supply the whims of
'developed' nations, leaving all the costs in the South. To
preserve a common future the environment must take priority.. We
can help by encouraging green produce and questioning our own
consumption.<p>
<h3>Appropriate agriculture</h3>

There is no quick fix for areas with food shortages - the
answers for each region are specific to it. The Green Revolution
got hijacked by rich elites who priced small farmers out of the
market. In industrial countries commercial farming, propped up
with subsidies, continues apace with its arsenal of polluting
chemicals, itspesticide-resistant pests and declining yields.
The real answers lie elsewhere, with the farmers who make the
best use of their lands, fighting pests with pests, growing a
variety of crops to keep the soil fertile, saving the best seeds
for the future. For their efforts to succeed they must be able
to make their own decisions, instead of having governments, big
agribusiness companies and policy makers on the other side of
the globe (such as the World Bank and the IMF) setting out
chapter and verse.  <p>
<h3>Equal rights for women</h3>

Women inherit every disadvantage and none of the power. They
work more hours than men - yet 70 per cent of the world's adult
poor are women. Four hundred million women of childbearing age
weigh less than 45 kilograms - their malnutrition is passed on
to their infants. In 'developed' countries women earn half as
much as men. Often their work may not even be counted as work.
Women produce half the world's food but own only one per cent of
its farmland. Equality with men is the basic issue. The best way
to attack women's hunger is by improving access to fairly-paid
work and to land. Education also improves women's control over
their fertility, health and standard of living.<p>
<h3>Land reform</h3>

A billion people living in the villages of the Majority World
have no land of their own to farm. Two-thirds of them live in
India and Bangladesh. In Guatemala and Peru 85 per cent of rural
workers are landless. Wherever the problem exists there is
usually a history of thwarted land-reform movements - thwarted
by the bigwigs who own the land and have political clout. Giving
land to poor farmers so they can grow their own food would not
work on its own. It would have to be backed by improved access
to credit and the means of production, like machinery. But land
reform could create the jobs which poor people from rural areas
seek in city slums. <p>
<h3>Peace</h3>

War causes hunger - whether in Iraq reeling under economic
sanctions after the Gulf War or in Afghanistan where 15 years of
fighting have wrecked food production. Conflict robs people of
homes and livelihoods - refugees have no land to grow food and
no work to enable them to buy it. The world spent $767 billion
in 1994 on its military might - more than the total income of
the poorest 45 percent of the world's population. The 'peace
dividend' has yielded $935 billion since 1987 through reduced
arms spending, but none of it has gone towards international
development aid. We need to lobby our leaders to work for peace
and to use its dividends wisely. Greater stability would give
poorer nations the opportunity to reduce their own military
expenditure. <p>
<h3>Sharing the wealth</h3>

More than a billion people live on less than a dollar a day. The
wealthiest one-fifth of the world's people control about 85 per
cent of the money, the poorest fifth about 1.4 per cent. Cant
about the free market creating opportunities for poor people is
meaningless when wealth calls all the shots. Filthy-rich
individuals apart, the politics of greed makes no economic sense
for the wealthy countries that pursue it. Economic success in
the Majority World would mean increased trade and more rather
than less jobs in the West. By sharing wealth we could actually
be safeguarding it. <p>
<h3>Building community</h3>

Gross inequality is not just about economics, it is about moral
choice. We need to replace the harmful myth of the individual
making a killing - so important to modern imperialism - with the
idea of the individual within a community. People aware of their
connectedness can build both compassion and strength. Many poor
communities with little to spare are working towards this ideal - whether it's poor women running communal soup kitchens in Peru
and Bolivia, or farmers across Latin America involved in a
programme to exchange knowledge. The real New World Order starts
here.<p><hr>©Copyright: New Internationalist 1995<hr><a href="index.html"><img width=35 height=30 src="ni_pix/nilogo3.gif"> NI Home Page</a> <a href="contents267.html"><img width=48 height=40 src="ni_pix/nicover267_thumb.gif"> Issue 267</a><hr></body></html>

No African country is typical - and Burkina Faso has the second lowest rating in the world on the UN Human Development Index.1 But even in Burkina they continue to move forward.</font><p><img width=434  height=341 hspace=10 src="ni_pix/268_burkino.gif"></center><p><h3><img width=35 height=31 src="ni_pix/star.gif">HISTORY</h3><ul><li><b>1400 </b>The Mossi people came to the region from what is now Ghana and established 19 separate kingdoms, each depending on the most powerful central kingdom of Wogodogo (today's Ouagadougou).  <br><li><b>1600 </b>They created what was effectively a centralized state with a strong administrative system that resisted conquest by neighbouring African empires. <br><li><b>1900 </b>This independence lasted until the French arrived in 1896, setting up a protectorate over Ouagadougou and making it part of the colony of Haut-Senegal-Niger in 1904.<br><li><b>1930 </b>In the first half of the century the French used the country as a pool of forced labour serving their more prosperous coastal colonies. All young men were dragooned into this virtual slavery. 1960The territory was reconstituted as the separate colony of Upper Volta in 1947 and was eventually granted independence in 1960. The modern era has been dominated by fraudulent elections and military coups. <br><li><b>1970 </b>France retains significant economic control to this day, not least through the CFA franc, the currency which Burkina shares with other former French African colonies and which is tied to the French franc. <br><li><b>1980 </b>This French influence survived the Sankara Revolution of 1983, which mounted a major challenge to neo-colonialism and changed the name of the country to Burkina Faso (Land of the Incorruptible) in 1984.<br><li><b>1990 </b>Current President Compaore came to power by coup d'etat but has since been elected and is an increasing favourite of both Paris and the IMF.<p></ul><h3><img  width=35  height=31 src="ni_pix/star.gif">PEOPLE</h3><b>Burkina Faso's population is increasing fast - it has grown by around 50 per cent over the last ten years.2</b><p><img width=227 height=145 align=left hspace=10 src="ni_pix/268_people.gif">Burkina's population density of 35 people per square kilometre is relatively low - closer to the US's 27 than the UK's 235.1 But as with many African countries its soil is particularly fragile.

<b>
The originality of the European Union's treaty relationship with the ACP
countries lies, above all, in its multilateral nature. Successive Lom&#233; accords
have been the standard bearers of this kind of cooperation - which should, in
principle, be the optimal form of link between developing and developed
countries. When money is tight and aid budgets are under pressure, the case
for the multilateral approach as set out in the Lom&#233; Conventions is further
strengthened.</b>
<p>
     In the first place, multilateral cooperation injects a greater degree of equality
into the relationship with its focus on partnership. Bilateral arrangements, particularly
those involving ex-colonies and the former metropolitan power, are more likely to be
influenced by their historical context.
<p>
     On a more practical level, the main goals of development cooperation, which
most people would accept as the alleviation or eradication of poverty, and the
improvement of quality of life through economic and social advances, are less likely
to be subverted in a multilateral system. There is no question for example, of
Lom&#233; funds being used by ACP countries to buy weapons from EU
manufacturers. Nor can there be an indirect link between the grant of development
funds and arms purchases.
<p>
     In many bilateral projects, the recipient is obliged to purchase the necessary
goods and services from the donor state. It is true that restrictions also apply in
Lom&#233; contracts. In most cases, tenders are limited to companies or nationals
from one of the Convention's contracting parties but since there are 85 of these, this
is obviously a great deal less restrictive. It naturally follows that the greater the
number of tenders for projects, from companies of various nationalities, the higher are
the chances of obtaining value for money. This applies to the whole gamut of
contracts from technical assistance to works and supplies.
<p>
     Sectoral policies such as structural adjustment programmes, which now have
a higher profile in the Lom&#233; Convention, can only be implemented successfully
in a multilateral forum. In this context, the EU works in close collaboration with the
World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF). There would be little point in one
donor suggesting changes to monetary policy, for example, only to be contradicted
by another donor. And it can be argued that the simple pooling of ideas in areas such
as structural adjustment has led to better quality projects. EU officials stress that
frequent dialogue with the Bretton Woods institutions has improved the design of
projects, with closer attention now being paid to avoiding the negative social effects
of adjustment.
<p>
<h3>National 'solutions' no longer practicable</h3>

     A multilateral approach is also increasingly indicated as we seek to tackle the
major issues of the end of the millenium. In fields as diverse as environmental
protection, the AIDS crisis, population movements and the burgeoning information
society, national 'solutions' are no longer practicable.
 
     Trade is another area where the national flag is increasingly irrelevant.
Liberalisation, which is speeding up, effectively means globalisation. The new World
Trade Organisation (GATT's successor) is branching out into new areas including
services and agriculture. It is also now looking at subjects such as the environment
and labour standards, and their link with trade. And the regional groupings which are
emerging and consolidating across the globe are becoming the hubs of global
liberalisation.
<p>
     It can also be argued that the multilateral path is the only fair and effective way
to implement relatively new aspects of development policy relating to matters such
as good governance and human rights. The Lom&#233; mid-term revision includes
a strengthening of the human rights clauses, with provision for negative measures to
be taken, such as the suspension of aid as a last resort, if respect for human rights,
democratic principles and the rule of law, is flouted. An aid freeze by a single bilateral
donor will obviously have much less impact.
<p>
     A new paper drafted by the European Commission, setting out a general
human rights policy, calls on EU institutions to work in the field of human rights with
other players such as the United Nations and the Council of Europe, 'in order to
maximise the effectiveness of its own actions.'
<p>
     It would seem only sensible for donors to pool the available resources in the
interests of more effective development cooperation programmes. During the mid-
term review negotiations, the European Development Commissioner, Jo&#254;o de Deus
Pinheiro, spoke frequently about the need for greater 'complementarity and
coherence' of aid between Member States' national aid budgets and those of the
European Union. He also emphasised cooperation with other international donors.
<p>
     As the Lom&#233; Convention moves into its next five year phase, it is
important that the many benefits of its multilateral nature are recognised and
nurtured. And in conclusion, it is worth emphasising one of the simplest and most
overlooked benefits of Lom&#233; multilateralism, which is the coming together of
representatives of 85 countries in a relationship based on partnership. All the
Lom&#233; 'players' appreciate this aspect and they are keen to ensure that it
continues beyond the life of the present Convention.

<p>
<B>The articles on the future of European development policy,
which appeared in issue no. 154 of <I>The Courier</I>, provided
a timely opportunity for reflection on this important issue. The
reference to 1995 as a 'watershed between two eras' in development
cooperation, was particularly appropriate. It was a year of key
events, and not just in the specific context of the EU's relations
with developing countries. Major UN conferences were held in Beijing
and Copenhagen, there were international meetings organised on
the critical subject of food security and, throughout Europe,
NGOs and academics came together to discuss the future of North-South
relations. There were also several smaller meetings and brain-storming
sessions, conducted among practitioners and policy-makers, with
a view to reaching practical conclusions about how to tackle some
of the most urgent problems facing developing countries. One of
the most important events was the Global Coalition for Africa
(GCA) meeting in Maastricht, featured in issue no. 156 of The
Courier.</B>
<P>
 With the wealth of knowledge and experience shared at all these
gatherings, we should now be in a good position to intensify efforts
at institutionally consolidating and redesigning the relationship
between Europe and Africa. But before embarking on grandiose policies
designed to meet the development challenges of the turn of the
century, a brief pause to reflect on the political priorities
might be useful. This might then make it easier to embark on the
crucial next steps associated with the management of dynamic new
policies that are beginning to take shape.
<P>
<B>Political priorities</B>
<P>
 In all EU countries, with the possible exception of the Nordic
states, development cooperation is not a high political priority.
While it is understandable that domestic issues should dominate
national politics, it is sad to observe that, in international
relations, Africa in particular finds itself low on the political
totem pole. This reflects, in part, the fact that Europeans tend
to perceive 'external policy in the light of their own everyday
concerns'. But perceptions can often be created or manipulated,
and there needs to be a more complex analysis of why external
politics in general, and cooperation with Africa in particular,
are politically rated so low. An important element mentioned by
one of The Courier's contributors is that Europe 'appears paralysed
by its own internal growth problems and its strong emphasis on
the two <I>new frontiers</I> - Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean'.
This trend can be seen in the growth of aid to the Mediterranean
region (from 12% of the size of the EDF in 1991-1995 to 32% in
1995-1999). Investment and trade patterns, alliances with Eastern
European states and migration arrangements with the Maghreb region,
may soon completely dominate the EU's international agenda. Without
a well-organised, articulate political constituency within the
EU for stronger cooperation with Africa, further political marginalisation
of that continent must be expected.
<P>
 While public interest in developing countries has diminished
in recent years, it is also the case that few governments or opposition
parties in Europe have seriously attempted to reverse this trend.
In fact, many have reinforced it through their policies and actions.
The unclear strategic vision of Africa-Europe relations among
Europe's professional 'developmentalists' - whether in universities
or aid administrations - is partly to blame. But the failure of
leading European policy-makers to project a progressive vision
of Europe-Africa cooperation must also be seen as a root cause
for the low priority now attributed to such cooperation. Furthermore,
sensationalist media coverage of crises has strongly contributed
to widespread negative perceptions of Africa. The media rarely
portrays the continent in an objective manner, and usually ignores
the many positive facets of life there.
<P>
 Unfortunately, non-state actors only partially succeed in correcting
this bleak picture. Their resources and political influence are
too limited. Individuals or agencies who are convinced of the
need to strengthen cooperation with Africa, and are committed
to pushing political priorities in that direction, frequently
find themselves preaching to the converted in policy debates.
Reaching out to a broader public and, at the same time, influencing
European policy-makers, has proved a tremendous uphill struggle.
<P>
 With the important exception of responses to humanitarian crises,
the general European public takes only a marginal interest in
Africa's problems. With the attention of voters increasingly geared
to domestic issues (such as unemployment and the dismantling of
welfare systems), international themes invariably lose out. The
danger in this situation is that reforms to development cooperation
systems will remain largely determined by the interests of the
donors instead of being inspired by country-specific, developmental
needs.
<P>
<B>Economic aspects</B>
<P>
 At present, Europe's trade and investment links with Africa are,
at best, secondary to those that exist with other regions. EU
development cooperation <I>is</I> important to most African countries
(often more important than private economic interactions) but
from a European perspective, official relations with Africa tend
to be seen as less significant than those with other developing
regions.
<P>
 Inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Africa still lag
far behind those to other developing regions. In 1993, Africa
attracted $9.6 for every $1000 of GDP. The figures for Latin America
and Asia were $13.2 and $23.1 respectively. As one of the authors
in The Courier's special feature noted, 'the ever-growing role
of FDI in national economies is not necessarily favourable to
the most disadvantaged countries' and there is a real need for
corrective action. This should involve better investment promotion
and improved opportunities for private sector involvement in ACP-EU
cooperation. Coordinated action by the EU Member States in international
fora, especially the Bretton Woods institutions, on issues such
as investment support and debt relief for the most disadvantaged
countries in Africa, would certainly be a welcome start.
<P>
<B>The democratic imperative</B>
<P>
 Efficient governance and democracy are now generally seen as
crucial preconditions for sustainable social and economic development.
At November's GCA conference, the need for Africa itself to focus
on 'improvements in governance, emphasising accountability, transparency
and inclusion of civil society in the policy-making process',
was underlined in the closing declaration delivered by Robert
McNamara. Such an emphasis should go hand in hand with a further
strengthening of capacities to plan and manage development policies,
resources and information.
<P>
 In addition to capacity improvements at the technical level,
many African countries need to perfect their ability to engage
effectively in dialogue with donors. If modes of development cooperation
continue to be defined largely by the latter, the African countries'
viewpoint, in terms of determining their own development strategies,
will remain sidelined. Traditionally, ACP-EU cooperation has offered
added value in this respect, involving recipients to a larger
degree than most other forms of development cooperation. Policy
debates in bodies such as the Joint Assembly are certainly useful
in creating trust and ensuring a 'basis of genuine partnership,
in pursuit of mutual interest'. However, like other cooperation
systems, the ACP-EU relationship has been affected by a series
of new or reformulated priorities. The ranking of such priorities
is not always clear and they sometimes lack precision.
<P>
<B>Reshaping the model</B>
<P>
 Looking to the future, it is reasonable to assume that EU-ACP
relations will soon undergo considerable redefinition and reorientation.
The Lom&eacute; framework is likely to be redesigned - mainly
to take account of the shifting priorities and approaches of the
EU members. It is the ACP countries and their people, however,
who will be most affected. They should have a decisive say in
how the future cooperation framework is to be fashioned. One may
well speculate on the outcome of the debate but perhaps even more
important, if success is to be achieved, is for civil society
in the widest sense (both in Europe and Africa), to be involved
in the process. Lom&eacute; has repeatedly been praised for its
partnership concept and for the comprehensive nature of the development
instruments it offers. But little is known about its success in
reaching out to impoverished populations and involving them in
approaches designed to improve local living conditions. Likewise,
it is not clear how effective the system has been yet in conveying
the principles and objectives of the policy to the European public.
This is essential if Europe's commitment to work with Africa is
to be maintained.
<P>
 It is clear that a turning point in Africa-Europe development
cooperation is rapidly approaching. Few in Europe, and fewer still
in Africa are well prepared for this change. I have argued that
cooperation between North and South has long been low on the list
of European priorities. This must change and the role of EU policy-makers
in giving a higher priority to development cooperation is crucial.
Public awareness that focuses on the achievements of and potential
in Africa must be drastically improved. A wider array of actors
needs to be involved in development cooperation while greater
attention must be paid to making it more effective. Non-official
forms of cooperation, notably private sector investments, will
also probably play a larger role. This is fundamentally profit-oriented,
of course, and there is a danger that it may ignore the human
development priorities of poor countries. But this is not to understate
the importance of additional private resource flows to the least-developed
countries. At current levels, official assistance is unlikely
on its own to bring about a significant improvement. We also urgently
need to see a reorientation of affluent European lifestyles -
something which should go hand in hand with the provision of more
resources for the South.
<P>
 Finally, post-Lom&eacute; IV relations between Africa and Europe
must reach beyond formal aid structures and mechanisms. On both
sides, civil society, in the broadest sense, needs to be engaged.
European political decision-makers must start to take a genuine
interest in cooperating with Africa, advocating policy-frameworks
that build on the strengths of existing arrangements. They must
also design and implement more effective modes of cooperation,
involving a wider section of society. This entails improving public
awareness of the challenges and opportunities inherent in cooperation
with Africa, and in this respect, the media has an essential role.
And then there is the private sector - not just the business world
- but the whole range of individuals and groups who are the economic
actors in a democratic civil society. They too need to play a
larger part in development cooperation. Lasting solutions to the
global problems that concern us all - in Africa and in Europe
- may well depend on such a successful fusion of public, individual
and commercial interests in cooperating with Africa and the South.

<H5>Dossier da publicaç&#227;o bimestral OIKOS n&#176;29, mar&ccedil;o-abril 1996</H5></CENTER>
<P>
<HR>
<B>As altera&ccedil;&otilde;es pol&iacute;ticas ocorridas no mundo
em fins dos anos 80 impuseram um ampla e profunda reflex&atilde;o
sobre os mecanismos destinados a dar resposta aos problemas mais
prementes que se colocam &agrave; Humanidade.
<P>
A queda do muro de Berlim e o fim da<I> guerra fria</I> desenharam
um novo mapa geopol&iacute;tico que implica, desde j&aacute;
a formula&ccedil;&atilde;o de novas estrat&eacute;gias no relacionamento
entre os povos, tendo em vista o desenvolvimento de pol&iacute;ticas
de coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o que, libertas dos velhos esquemas
do passado possam tornar-se mais eficazes e duradouras.
<P>
Por esta raz&atilde;o na 1&#186; Sess&atilde;o da Assembleia
Parit&aacute;ria<A href="#note1">(1)</a> deste ano, deu-se j&aacute; inicio a uma discuss&atilde;o
em torno do futuro de Lom&eacute;, cujo debate se inicia oficialmente
em Setembro de 1988, tendo em vista uma nova negocia&ccedil;&atilde;o
entre a Europa e os ACP para preparar o quadro no qual se situar&atilde;o
as rela&ccedil;&otilde;es entre as duas partes a partir de 1 de
Mar&ccedil;o do ano 2000.</B> 
<P>
Esta negocia&ccedil;&atilde;o tem como pano de fundo a nova realidade
emergente quer na Europa comunit&aacute;ria, quer nos pa&iacute;ses
ACP subscritores de Lom&eacute;.
<P>
A primeira constata&ccedil;&atilde;o que importa fazer radica
no facto de entre 1975, data da assinatura de Lom&eacute; I, e
o momento actual, a situa&ccedil;&atilde;o mundial ter passado
por modifica&ccedil;&otilde;es substanciais. Por outro lado, a
Uni&atilde;o Europeia que &eacute; um dos parceiros de Lom&eacute; 
tomou uma fisionomia diferente, fruto do seu alargamento para
15 pa&iacute;ses e das perspectivas que, a breve trecho se levantam
para abarcar no seu seio outras na&ccedil;&otilde;es, especialmente
do Centro e Leste do continente europeu.
<P>
Esta realidade faz com que que as rela&ccedil;&otilde;es da Europa
tenham agora outras coordenadas e horizontes que j&aacute; n&atilde;o
se compadecem com estruturas passadas pois h&aacute; novas prioridades
e diferentes caminhos a seguir.
<P>
A entrada de Portugal e sobretudo da Espanha na UE veio colocar
ainda mais interroga&ccedil;&otilde;es sobre a dimens&atilde;o
da coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o europeia e os seus destinat&aacute;rios
j&aacute; que o n&uacute;mero de imigrantes oriundos dos PVD,
sobretudo do Magrebe e da &Aacute;frica aumentou significativamente
ap&oacute;s a entrada dos pa&iacute;ses ib&eacute;ricos na comunidade. Acresce
que Portugal e a Espanha n&atilde;o podem alhear-se dos pa&iacute;ses
da Am&eacute;rica Latina no novo quadro da coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o
da Uni&atilde;o
<P>
Tudo isto leva a repensar o &acirc;mbito da coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o
europeia que agora tem de repartir a sua aten&ccedil;&atilde;o
entre os pa&iacute;ses do ex-bloco sovi&eacute;tico, os pa&iacute;ses
da Bacia do Mediterr&acirc;nio, e pa&iacute;ses de outros continentes.
<P>
<H3><B>O essencial e o acess&oacute;rio</B></H3>
<P>
Fruto duma filosofia adoptada aquando da sua cria&ccedil;&atilde;o, 
a Conven&ccedil;&atilde;o de Lom&eacute; tem dado particular destaque
&agrave;s antigas col&oacute;nias da Fran&ccedil;a e da Inglaterra
seguindo-se-lhes os pa&iacute;ses africanos que foram colonizados
por Portugal. De fora ficaram todos os pa&iacute;ses com fortes
la&ccedil;os hist&oacute;ricos com Espanha, ou seja, os pa&iacute;ses
latino-americanos e tamb&eacute;m outros que n&atilde;o tendo
sido colonizados se encontram numa situa&ccedil;&atilde;o de sub-desenvolvimento.
<P>
Esta situa&ccedil;&atilde;o considerada por alguns analistas como
&quot;aberrante&quot; levantou v&aacute;rias quest&otilde;es criando
um clima prop&iacute;cio &agrave; revis&atilde;o de toda a estrat&eacute;gia
de coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o de Lom&eacute;.
<P>
Come&ccedil;am assim hoje a debater-se cada vez com maior profundidade
no seio de algumas institui&ccedil;&otilde;es da Uni&atilde;o
Europeia, com especial destaque para o Parlamento Europeu (PE),
a Comiss&atilde;o da Uni&atilde;o Europeia (sobretudo as Direc&ccedil;&otilde;es-Gerais
I e VIII) e o Comit&eacute; de Liaison das ONG's europeias que
n&atilde;o sendo uma estrutura oficial tem uma rela&ccedil;&atilde;o
privilegiada com as inst&acirc;ncias europeias, a nova arquitectura
de Lom&eacute; o que implica logo &agrave; partida e no quadro
actual das rela&ccedil;&otilde;es UE-ACP separar o acess&oacute;rio
do essencial, mantendo aquilo que foram aquisi&ccedil;&otilde;es
resultantes dos Acordos de Lom&eacute; e que basicamente se resumem
a tr&ecirc;s aspectos:
<P>
<UL><B>1)</B> O car&aacute;cter de parceria que Lom&eacute; envolve,
ou seja, a coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o em resultado duma negocia&ccedil;&atilde;o
e dum acordo entre parceiros e n&atilde;o uma decis&atilde;o imposta
apenas por um dos lados.</UL>
<P>
<UL><B>2)</B> A aten&ccedil;&atilde;o aos pa&iacute;ses do Sul porquanto
a Conven&ccedil;&atilde;o assumiu o compromisso que a Europa jamais
votaria ao abandono os pa&iacute;ses em desenvolvimento. Desta
forma, ficou consagrado o principio duma coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o
de partilha de bens e recursos com os pa&iacute;ses do Sul.</UL>
<P>
<UL><B>3) </B>A Conven&ccedil;&atilde;o de Lom&eacute; estabeleceu
mecanismos que tocam em quest&otilde;es fulcrais para o desenvolvimento
como, por exemplo, os mecanismos reguladores do com&eacute;rcio
internacional, o Stabex<B><A href="#note2">(2)</a></B>, o Sismin<B><A href="#note3">(3)</a></B>, entre
outros e que ainda s&atilde;o v&aacute;lidos para minorar as lacunas,
as necessidades e os desafios que se colocam ao desenvolvimento
dos povos.</UL>
<P>
Para a maior parte dos analistas, estas linhas de actua&ccedil;&atilde;o
inscritas na Conven&ccedil;&atilde;o de Lom&eacute; devem ser
salvaguardadas independentemente das linhas-mestras que venham
a ser adoptadas no futuro.
<P>
<H3><B>O fim do estigma colonial</B> </H3>
<P>
Independentemente das falhas que podem ser apontadas &agrave;
pol&iacute;tica de coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o definida por Lom&eacute;, 
s&atilde;o raros aqueles que defendem o seu desaparecimento.
<P>
Em regra, todos aqueles que se debru&ccedil;am sobre esta problem&aacute;tica
defendem que a conven&ccedil;&atilde;o deve ser reformulada para
melhor responder aos novos ventos da hist&oacute;ria mantendo,
no entanto, o espirito que presidiu &agrave; sua constitui&ccedil;&atilde;o
e que b&aacute;sicamente passa pelos tr&ecirc;s principios atr&aacute;s
enunciados.
<P>
Assim, n&atilde;o est&aacute; em causa o futuro das rela&ccedil;&otilde;es
de coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o entre a Europa e os pa&iacute;ses
do Sul mas t&atilde;o s&oacute;mente uma nova configura&ccedil;&atilde;o
que dever&aacute; ter sobretudo em aten&ccedil;&atilde;o os seguintes
par&acirc;metros:
<P>
<UL><B>a)</B> O alargamento dos parceiros da Uni&atilde;o Europeia
que poder&aacute; seguir dois caminhos: o alargamento da coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o
a todos os pa&iacute;ses do Sul que se considerem em desenvolvimento,
ou a assun&ccedil;&atilde;o por parte da UE duma &uacute;nica
pol&iacute;tica de coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o que abranja todos
os parceiros extra-comunit&aacute;rios como por exemplo os pa&iacute;ses
da Europa Central e Oriental.
<P>
A segunda hip&oacute;tese &eacute; fortemente contestada por alguns
sectores de opini&atilde;o que consideram demasiado &quot;for&ccedil;ado&quot;
considerar a Hungria e a Pol&oacute;nia como pa&iacute;ses subdesenvolvidos.
<P>
Para os cr&iacute;ticos da segunda via os pa&iacute;ses de Leste
s&atilde;o desenvolvidos e t&ecirc;m potencialidades que v&atilde;o,
certamente, desabrochar numa economia sustentada de mercado.
<P>
Apesar dos v&aacute;rios cen&aacute;rios poss&iacute;veis e duma
gama de opini&otilde;es por vezes diversificada, o novo acordo
de coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o entre a Uni&atilde;o Europeia e o
Sul dever&aacute; ser alargado a outros continentes contemplando
os pa&iacute;ses da Am&eacute;rica Latina e da &Aacute;sia , eliminado-se
o estigma da coloniza&ccedil;&atilde;o que ainda marca as rela&ccedil;&otilde;es
entre as antigas pot&ecirc;ncias coloniais e os novos pa&iacute;ses
independentes.
<P>
&Eacute; que de acordo com observadores, Lom&eacute; ainda n&atilde;o
se conseguiu libertar deste fantasma, esse <I>mea culpa</I> que
foi criando obst&aacute;culos a uma renova&ccedil;&atilde;o mais
eficaz de alguns pressupostos contidos na Conven&ccedil;&atilde;o
de Lom&eacute;.
<P>
Para estes at&eacute; j&aacute; nem faz muito sentido falar-se
do Pac&iacute;fico e das Cara&iacute;bas como zonas subdesenvolvidos
porque j&aacute; existem muitos pa&iacute;ses nestas regi&otilde;es
com um desenvolvimento socio-econ&oacute;mico muito apreci&aacute;vel.</UL>
<P>
<UL><B>b)</B> &Eacute; importante saber qual o peso real no futuro
da coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o das integra&ccedil;&otilde;es regionais
que se foram fazendo ao longo dos &uacute;ltimos anos nos diversos
continentes.
<P>
Para tanto &eacute; preciso reflectir sobre quais ser&atilde;o
os parceiros mais adequados para um di&aacute;logo de coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o
com a Europa j&aacute; que esta &eacute; tamb&eacute;m uma realidade
regional.
<P>
Perante este quadro cabe perguntar se num trabalho de coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o
&eacute; mais importante continuar a falar com uma s&eacute;rie
de pa&iacute;ses que se reunem sob o signo de Lom&eacute; mas
que pouco t&ecirc;m em comum ou, ao inv&eacute;s, n&atilde;o ser&aacute;
mais prof&iacute;cuo ter em conta as integra&ccedil;&otilde;es
regionais e privilegiar uma nova configura&ccedil;&atilde;o que
contemple as realidades regionais como o Mercosul, a Comunidade
Andina, a ASEAN, a SADC para estruturar uma nova coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o
mais eficaz porque estar&aacute; baseada em entidades regionalmente
integradas?
<P>
Parece claro que a segunda hip&oacute;tese &eacute; mais cred&iacute;vel
j&aacute; que &eacute; por esse caminho que poderemos melhorar
as rela&ccedil;&otilde;es de coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o entre o
mundo industrializado e os pa&iacute;ses mais carenciados.</UL>
<P>
<UL><B>c)</B> H&aacute; que repensar as estruturas que entretanto
foram sendo montadas no quadro de Lom&eacute; como sejam a Assembleia
Parit&aacute;ria que funciona como elo de liga&ccedil;&atilde;o
entre Parlamento Europeu e os Parlamentos nacionais dos ACP.
<P>
&Eacute; necess&aacute;rio reformar o quadro institucional para
que o di&aacute;logo seja s&eacute;rio e consequente, o que n&atilde;o
se consegue enquanto os pa&iacute;ses n&atilde;o se dotem dum
Parlamento representativo dos seus pa&iacute;ses equivalente ao
PE. (Nas actuais condi&ccedil;&otilde;es, os embaixadores dos ACP
fazem o papel de deputados o que dificulta, por vezes, a tomada
de posi&ccedil;&otilde;es).
<P>
Importa igualmente que as institui&ccedil;&otilde;es da Uni&atilde;o
Europeia e aquelas que sa&iacute;rem da nova estrtutura de coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o
tenham a mesma adequa&ccedil;&atilde;o, natureza, valor de participa&ccedil;&atilde;o,
etc.</UL>
<P>
<UL><B>d)</B> A emerg&ecirc;ncia da sociedade civil &eacute; um ponto
inovador porque quando, em 1975, a Conven&ccedil;&atilde;o de
Lom&eacute; foi instituida, o Comit&eacute; de Liaison das ONG
n&atilde;o existia.
<P>
A import&acirc;ncia crescente das ONG como interlocutores privilegiados
entre os cidad&atilde;os e os detentores do poder pol&iacute;tico
confere-lhes um papel que os agentes do poder j&aacute; reconhecem,
o que pode ser comprovado pelo facto da &uacute;ltima Assembleia
Parit&aacute;ria ter consagrado pela primeira vez, uma manh&atilde;
para dialogar com os representantes das ONG sobre o estado do
desenvolvimento dos pa&iacute;ses da &Aacute;frica Austral j&aacute;
que a Nam&iacute;bia se situa naquela regi&atilde;o africana.</UL>
<P>
<H3><B>Aprofundar a coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o</B> </H3>
<P>
A revis&atilde;o intercalar da Conven&ccedil;&atilde;o de Lom&eacute;
IV assinada em 1995, nas Maur&iacute;cias, foi sobretudo uma tentativa
de proceder a alguns ajustamentos nos mecanismos de coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o
entre a UE e os ACP para melhor enfrentar os desafios que se
colocam at&eacute; ao fim da sua vig&ecirc;ncia, no ano 2000.
<P>
No entanto, esta revis&atilde;o ficou aqu&eacute;m das expectativas
j&aacute; que muitas quest&otilde;es de fundo ficaram por abordar,
optando-se antes pela adop&ccedil;&atilde;o de medidas que, em
face dos grandes desafios que se colocam num futuro pr&oacute;ximo,
n&atilde;o passam de simples paliativos<B> </B>que s&oacute; em
termos imediatos conseguir&atilde;o esconder as debilidades e
o anquilosamento em que cairam muitos aspectos que d&atilde;o
corpo a Lom&eacute;.
<P>
Como disse o Comiss&aacute;rio respons&aacute;vel pela coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o
entre a Uni&atilde;o Europeia e os ACP, Jo&atilde;o de Deus Pinheiro,
em Windhoek, &quot;&eacute; preciso ter a no&ccedil;&atilde;o de
que as muta&ccedil;&otilde;es que se verificaram nas rela&ccedil;&otilde;es
ideol&oacute;gicas a n&iacute;vel planet&aacute;rio, a r&aacute;pida
mundializa&ccedil;&atilde;o dos sistemas internacionais, comerciais
e financeiros, uma certa perda de sensibilidade dos pa&iacute;ses
do Norte relativamente &agrave; Ajuda P&uacute;blica ao Desenvolvimento
(APD), contribuem para marginalizar os pa&iacute;ses mais pobres.&quot;

&quot;&Eacute; este o contexto em que se situa a reflex&atilde;o

Particularmente atentas &agrave; problem&aacute;tica dos mecanismos
de coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o, as ONG europeias consideram que
o car&aacute;cter de parceria nas negocia&ccedil;&otilde;es, a
aten&ccedil;&atilde;o especial dedicada aos pa&iacute;ses do Sul,
bem como os sistemas reguladores do com&eacute;rcio, o Stabex
e o Sismin, s&atilde;o aquisi&ccedil;&otilde;es fundamentais
para a melhoria dos mecanismos da coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o devendo,
por isso, permanecer no futuro figurino da Conven&ccedil;&atilde;o.
<P>
O alargamento dos pa&iacute;ses signat&aacute;rios de Lom&eacute;
e o incremento do papel da sociedade civil no universo da coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o
merecem igualmente a concord&acirc;ncia das ONG que atrav&eacute;s
do Comit&eacute; de Liaison vai constituir um grupo de trabalho

aspectos mais relevantes do futuro das rela&ccedil;&otilde;es

<P>
Une <a
href="../../ecdpm/lome/conf_fr.htm">conf&#233;rence sur ce th&#232;me s'est
d&#233;roul&#233;e &#224; Maastricht</a> le
12-14 juin sous les auspices du Centre
europ&#233;en de gestion des politiques de
d&#233;veloppement (ECDPM). Elle regroupait
des participants tant ACP qu'Europ&#233;ens,
en particulier de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile
(ONG, secteur priv&#233;, etc.) Quatre grands
th&#232;mes ont &#233;t&#233; abord&#233;s :
<p>
<H3>Comment construire une nouvelle relation
commerciale EU-ACP ?</H3>
<p>
     Un consensus s'est fait autour de l'id&#233;e
qu'une certaine forme de r&#233;gime
commercial pr&#233;f&#233;rentiel devrait
continuer apr&#232;s l'an 2000. Certains
participants ont insist&#233; sur la
n&#233;cessit&#233; de favoriser un "commerce
&#233;quitable" qui contribuerait non seulement
&#224; la croissance mais aussi au
d&#233;veloppement. L'impact des
pr&#233;f&#233;rences n'est pas toujours clair.
Mais il est &#233;vident qu'il ne peut y avoir une
solution unique pour traiter tous les
probl&#232;mes dans tous les pays ACP. Enfin
une analyse des contraintes n&#233;gatives a
constat&#233; les difficult&#233;s de faire co-
exister les r&#232;gles de la Convention de
Lom&#233; avec celles de l'Organisation
mondiale du commerce.
<p>
<H3>Comment impliquer le secteur priv&#233; dans
le d&#233;veloppement ?</H3>
<p>
     Le principal aspect &#224; prendre en
compte consiste &#224; savoir comment
&#233;tablir un environnement favorable et
"business friendly" pour permettre au secteur
priv&#233; de jouer son r&ocirc;le et comment
l'Union europ&#233;enne pourrait-elle contribuer
&#224; ce processus ? Le secteur priv&#233; a
&#233;t&#233; d&#233;fini comme &#224; la fois
formel et informel, regroupant grandes ainsi que
petites et moyennes entreprises,
soci&#233;t&#233;s locales ou
&#233;trang&#232;res. On a cependant
insist&#233; sur l'importance d'un secteur
priv&#233; local fort pour assurer la
stabilit&#233; &#224; long terme. A cet
&#233;gard, le r&ocirc;le de l'Etat et de ses
rapports avec la Commission europ&#233;enne
doivent &ecirc;tre red&#233;finis. Il est
n&#233;cessaire de formaliser un espace pour
un dialogue effectif et un partenariat entre les
secteurs public et priv&#233;. Le r&ocirc;le du
Conseil &#233;conomique et social doit &ecirc;tre
&#224; la fois &#233;largi et pr&#233;cis&#233;.
Sur un point particulier, il a &#233;t&#233;
signal&#233; que la privatisation ne pouvait
&ecirc;tre consid&#233;r&#233;e comme une
panac&#233;e et devait &ecirc;tre con&#231;ue
sur une base sp&#233;cifique pays par pays.
<p>
     En ce qui concerne les instruments
actuellement disponibles, leur objectif est de
r&#233;pondre essentiellement aux besoins du
secteur public. Le r&ocirc;le du CDI a
&#233;t&#233; partiellement critiqu&#233;. Le
secteur priv&#233; doit &ecirc;tre pratiquement
impliqu&#233; dans la pr&#233;paration et
l'ex&#233;cution des programmes de
coop&#233;ration avec la Communaut&#233;
europ&#233;enne. Un soutien financier direct au
secteur priv&#233; est souhaitable, y compris de
la part de la Banque europ&#233;enne
d'Investissement.
<p>
<H3>Quel partenariat ?</H3>
<p>
     Pendant vingt ans la notion de partenariat
s'est &#233;rod&#233;e, allant parfois jusqu'au
paternalisme, sous pr&#233;texte
d'efficacit&#233;. Il faut trouver des
m&#233;canismes permettant de concilier les
priorit&#233;s de l'Union europ&#233;enne et les
pr&#233;rogatives des Etats ACP. Il a
&#233;t&#233; enfin rappel&#233; la nature
politique de l'origine du partenariat et la
n&#233;cessit&#233; de trouver une nouvelle
raison d'&ecirc;tre politique pour ce type de
relation. Le probl&#232;me de la coh&#233;sion
du groupe ACP, au-del&#224; de ses relations
avec l'Union europ&#233;enne, a &#233;t&#233;
pos&#233;. Le choix d'une r&#233;gionalisation
de la Convention a &#233;t&#233;
consid&#233;r&#233;e avec r&#233;serve.
<p>
     Du c&ocirc;t&#233; europ&#233;en, deux
lacunes ont &#233;t&#233; mises en avant : la
coordination entre les donateurs et la
coh&#233;rence entre Lom&#233; et les autres
politiques communautaires (y compris les
rapports avec les institutions de Bretton Woods).
<p>
     Au del&#224; du principe de partenariat,
certains souhaitent insister sur les motivations de
la coop&#233;ration : solidarit&#233; et
int&#233;r&ecirc;ts communs, au-del&#224; des
interd&#233;pendances n&#233;gatives. Si le
partenariat doit se limiter &#224; la
coop&#233;ration financi&#232;re et technique,
le terme est inad&#233;quat. La politisation de la
Convention de Lom&#233; est &#224; l'ordre du
jour, &#224; travers le passage du partenariat
&#224; une v&#233;ritable approche de "contrat",
au moyen d'un dialogue politique.
<p>
     En ce qui touche au r&ocirc;le du partenariat
dans la gestion de la politique de
coop&#233;ration, l'implicatiton de la
soci&#233;t&#233; civile et du secteur priv&#233;
est indispensable. Le probl&#232;me de la dette
a enfin &#233;t&#233; rappel&#233;.
<p>
<H3>Comment am&#233;liorer la coop&#233;ration
financi&#232;re et technique ?
</H3><p>
     Comme &#224; l'accoutum&#233;e, la
n&#233;cessit&#233; de simplifier et de
diff&#233;rencier la gestion des instruments de la
Convention de Lom&#233; a &#233;t&#233;
rappel&#233;e, en particulier dans le processus
de programmation. Concernant le r&ocirc;le des
actions non-&#233;tatiques, une approche
prudente a &#233;t&#233; retenue. Enfin de
nouveaux instruments ont &#233;t&#233;
r&#233;clam&#233;s concernant la
pr&#233;vention des conflits.
<p>
<H3>Conclusions</H3>
<p>
     Cette conf&#233;rence, intervenant
apr&#232;s plusieurs autres du m&ecirc;me type,
a &#233;t&#233; essentiellement
caract&#233;ris&#233;e par la revendication du
secteur priv&#233; et des ONG &#224; une plus
grande participation dans la politique de
coop&#233;ration communautaire. En outre, la
n&#233;cessit&#233; d'une "politisation" de la
politique de Lom&#233; pour passer d'une aide
financi&#232;re et technique &#224; un
v&#233;ritable contrat de coop&#233;ration,
semble b&#233;n&#233;ficier d'un large
consensus de l'ensemble des participants. Nul 
ne doute que ces questions figurent dans le
"Livre vert" sur "Lom&#233; au-del&#224; de
2000" que la Commission europ&#233;enne va
rendre public avant la fin de l'ann&#233;e.

Les avantages d'une approche multilat&#233;rale</h2>

<b>
L'originalit&#233; de la relation entre le Trait&#233; de l'Union europ&#233;enne
et les pays ACP r&#233;side avant tout dans son caract&#232;re
multilat&#233;ral. Les accords successifs de Lom&#233; sont devenus les
piliers de ce type de coop&#233;ration - laquelle devrait constituer, en principe,
le lien optimal entre les pays en d&#233;veloppement et les pays
d&#233;velopp&#233;s. L'approche multilat&#233;rale d&#233;finie dans les
Conventions de Lom&#233; trouve d'ailleurs une justification
suppl&#233;mentaire &#224; l'heure o&ugrave; les ressources financi&#232;res
se tarissent et o&ugrave; les budgets de l'aide se r&#233;duisent.</b>
<p>
     Tout d'abord, la coop&#233;ration multilat&#233;rale conf&#232;re &#224; la
relation un caract&#232;re plus &#233;galitaire puisqu'elle met l'accent sur le
partenariat. Les arrangements bilat&#233;raux, en particulier lorsqu'ils sont conclus
entre les ex-colonies et leur ex-m&#233;tropole, comportent effectivement un risque
d'influence du contexte historique.
<p>
     Sur un plan plus concret, on peut ajouter qu'un syst&#232;me multilat&#233;ral
comporte moins de risque de subversion des grands objectifs de la coop&#233;ration
au d&#233;veloppement, &#224; savoir le soulagement ou la suppression de la
mis&#232;re et l'am&#233;lioration des conditions de vie gr&#226;ce au progr&#232;s
socio-&#233;conomique. Il est exclu, par exemple, que des pays ACP utilisent les
fonds de Lom&#233; pour acheter des armes &#224; des fabricants europ&#233;ens.
Il ne peut davantage exister de lien indirect entre l'octroi de fonds pour le
d&#233;veloppement et des achats d'armement.
<p>
     Les projets bilat&#233;raux stipulent souvent que le b&#233;n&#233;ficiaire
doit acheter les biens et services concern&#233;s aupr&#232;s du pays donateur. Et
il est exact que certaines restrictions s'appliquent &#224; la passation de
march&#233;s dans le cadre de Lom&#233;. Les appels d'offres sont
g&#233;n&#233;ralement r&#233;serv&#233;s aux entreprises ou ressortissants de
l'une des parties contractantes de la Convention; &#233;tant donn&#233; toutefois
que celles-ci sont au nombre de 85, on peut consid&#233;rer &#224; juste titre que
cette restriction est beaucoup moins rigoureuse. Il va &#233;galement de soi que plus
les offres &#233;manant d'entreprises de diff&#233;rents pays en vue d'un projet
particulier sont nombreuses, plus les chances d'une rentabilisation optimale de
l'investissement sont grandes. Cette affirmation  se v&#233;rifie pour tous les types
de contrats, qu'il s'agisse d'assistance technique ou de travaux et fournitures.
<p>
     Les politiques sectorielles telles que les programmes d'ajustement structurel,
qui occupent d&#233;sormais une place plus importante dans la Convention de
Lom&#233;, ne peuvent atteindre leurs objectifs que dans un contexte
multilat&#233;ral. Aussi l'UE travaille-t-elle dans ce domaine en &#233;troite
concertation avec la Banque mondiale et le FMI (Fonds mon&#233;taire
international). Il ne servirait effectivement &#224; rien qu'un donateur propose
certains am&#233;nagements de la politique mon&#233;taire, par exemple, s'il est
contredit par un autre donateur. Sans compter que la simple mise en commun
d'id&#233;es a certainement rehauss&#233; la qualit&#233; des projets dans un
domaine tel que l'ajustement structurel. Les responsables de l'UE soulignent que leur
fr&#233;quents &#233;changes avec les institutions de Bretton Woods ont
am&#233;lior&#233; la conception des projets dans la mesure o&ugrave; l'on veille
d&#233;sormais davantage &#224; &#233;viter les r&#233;percussions
n&#233;gatives de l'ajustement sur le plan social.
<p>
<h3>Les "solutions" nationales ne sont plus r&#233;alistes</h3>

     L'approche multilat&#233;rale s'impose avec une &#233;vidence accrue
tandis que nous abordons les grands d&#233;fis de cette fin de mill&#233;naire -
 aucune "solution" nationale ne permettant plus d'agir efficacement dans des
domaines aussi divers que la protection de l'environnement, l'&#233;pid&#233;mie
de SIDA, les mouvements de population et l'&#233;mergence de la
soci&#233;t&#233; de l'information.
<p>
     Le commerce est un autre domaine dans lequel le drapeau national perd peu
&#224; peu son sens: la lib&#233;ralisation, qui s'acc&#233;l&#232;re, est
synonyme de globalisation. L'Organisation mondiale du Commerce, qui
succ&#232;de au GATT, &#233;tend son action &#224; de nouveaux secteurs
d'activit&#233; tels que les services et l'agriculture. Elle s'int&#233;resse aussi
aux th&#232;mes de l'environnement et des normes de travail dans la perspective
de leurs liens avec le commerce. Tandis que les regroupements nationaux qui
s'op&#232;rent et se consolident sur l'ensemble de la plan&#232;te deviennent
les pivots du processus mondial de lib&#233;ralisation.
<p>
     On peut &#233;galement faire valoir que la voie multilat&#233;rale est la
seule qui permette de concr&#233;tiser de mani&#232;re &#233;quitable et
efficace certains aspects relativement nouveaux de la politique du
d&#233;veloppement, tels que la bonne gestion des affaires publiques et le respect
des droits de l'homme. La r&#233;vision &#224; mi-parcours de Lom&#233;
pr&#233;voit un renforcement des clauses relatives aux droits de l'homme, assorti
de mesures n&#233;gatives - allant jusqu'&#224; la suspension de l'aide en dernier
ressort - en cas de non respect des droits de l'homme, des principes
d&#233;mocratiques et de la r&#232;gle de droit. Un blocage de l'aide par un seul
donateur bilat&#233;ral aurait, de toute &#233;vidence, beaucoup moins d'impact.
<p>
     Un document r&#233;cent de la Commission europ&#233;enne,
d&#233;crivant une politique globale en faveur des droits de l'homme, demande
aux institutions de l'UE d'agir dans ce domaine en concertation avec d'autres
acteurs tels que les Nations Unies et le Conseil de l'Europe en vue d'optimiser la
port&#233;e de ses propres actions.
<p>
     La simple logique commanderait aux donateurs de mettre les ressources
disponibles en commun afin d'accro&icirc;tre l'efficacit&#233; des programmes de
coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement. Tout au long des n&#233;gociations
de la r&#233;vision &#224; mi-parcours, le Commissaire europ&#233;en
charg&#233; du d&#233;veloppement, Joao de Deus Pinheiro, n'a cess&#233;
d'&#233;voquer la n&#233;cessit&#233; d'une plus grande
"compl&#233;mentarit&#233; et coh&#233;rence" de l'aide entre les budgets
nationaux des Etats membres et ceux de l'Union europ&#233;enne affect&#233;s
&#224; ce domaine. Il a &#233;galement soulign&#233; l'importance de la
coop&#233;ration avec d'autres donateurs internationaux.
<p>
     Il est essentiel, &#224; l'heure o&ugrave; la Convention de Lom&#233;
aborde une nouvelle &#233;tape quinquennale, de reconna&icirc;tre et d'entretenir
les nombreux atouts li&#233;s &#224; sa nature multilat&#233;rale. Tout comme
il est imp&#233;ratif de souligner, en conclusion, l'un des avantages
extr&ecirc;mement simple et trop souvent ignor&#233; du multilat&#233;ralisme
de Lom&#233;: le regroupement des repr&#233;sentants de 85 pays au sein d'une
relation bas&#233;e sur le partenariat. Les "acteurs" de Lom&#233; sont unanimes
&#224; appr&#233;cier cet aspect et tiennent &#224; le maintenir au-del&#224;
de l'actuelle Convention.

<p>
Le m&#233;canisme d'&#233;valuation de la Convention de Lom&#233; s'est peu &#224; peu mis en
marche. La Convention a-t-elle un avenir et comment se pr&#233;sentera-t-il, telles sont les questions
br&ucirc;lantes.
<p>
La Commission europ&#233;enne travaille &#224; un nouveau document politique et les pays en voie
de d&#233;veloppement sont inquiets. Pourtant, malgr&#233; toutes les discussions, on pense que le
sc&#233;nario d'apr&#232;s 1999 pourrait &#224; peine changer. Certains observateurs consid&#232;rent
que reconcevoir la coop&#233;ration europ&#233;enne au d&#233;veloppement serait peut-&ecirc;tre plus
difficile que de laisser les choses plus ou moins telles quelles.
<p>
La Convention de Lom&#233; est un partenariat &#233;tabli entre 70 pays d'Afrique, des Cara&iuml;bes
et du Pacifique (ACP) et l'Union europ&#233;enne, qui inclut les &#233;changes et l'aide. Cette
Convention date de 1975 et nul ne sait avec certitude si elle existera apr&#232;s son 25e anniversaire en
l'an 2000.
<p>
Lorsque l'ECDPM a invit&#233; les Etats ACP &#224; entreprendre les pr&#233;paratifs de la poursuite
de la Convention de Lom&#233;, le Centre a essuy&#233; des r&#233;actions d'agacement. Les
d&#233;cideurs &#233;taient fatigu&#233;s apr&#232;s les n&#233;gociations difficiles de la
r&#233;vision &#224; mi-parcours de Lom&#233; IV et ils ne voulaient pas entendre que leur
t&#226;che &#233;tait loin d'&ecirc;tre termin&#233;e. Ces derniers mois, toutefois, le climat a
chang&#233;.
<p>
Au cours de l'ann&#233;e &#233;coul&#233;e, l'ECDPM a suscit&#233; une prise de conscience parmi
les groupes d'int&#233;r&ecirc;t ACP en les encourageant &#224; proc&#233;der &#224; une
&#233;valuation critique et &#224; d&#233;battre l'avenir de la Convention de Lom&#233;. Selon Louk
de la Rive Box, directeur de l'ECDPM, la "conclusion principale constitue un paradoxe. Les Etats ACP
sont inquiets pour leur relation avec l'Europe, mais l'ignorance en ce qui concerne Lom&#233; est totale."
<p>
<h3>Un myst&#232;re pour la plupart des gens</h3>
Cette conclusion se fonde sur d'importantes consultations de l'ECDPM avec des gens de toutes les
r&#233;gions ACP. Geert Laporte a l'impression qu'en dehors d'un cercle restreint de repr&#233;sentants
du gouvernement, la Convention demeure un "myst&#232;re absolu" dans les pays ACP.
<p>
Cette ignorance est en partie due &#224; la fa&#231;on dont les ressources de Lom&#233; sont
g&#233;r&#233;es au niveau du pays - un ordonnateur national dans chaque pays ACP,  un haut
repr&#233;sentant du gouvernement, dirige les activit&#233;s. Cette situation r&#233;sulte
&#233;galement de l'opinion, que Lom&#233; est une affaire concernant les gouvernements.
<p>
A cet &#233;gard, Box sugg&#232;re qu'une "critique de la Commission pourrait &ecirc;tre qu'elle n'a
pas fait intervenir, assez t&ocirc;t dans le processus, d'autres groupes d'int&#233;r&ecirc;t, tels que les
chambres de commerce." Il critique &#233;galement les gouvernements ACP qui n'ont pas fait grand-
chose pour encourager la formation d'un groupe de tenants de Lom&#233; dans leurs pays. Avec un si
petit groupe impliqu&#233; dans la Convention, il n'est gu&#232;re &#233;tonnant que la prise de
conscience du public soit si faible.
<p>
La connaissance de la Convention est une chose, son utilisation en est une autre. La Convention est
tr&#232;s complexe et compte plus de 369 articles, ainsi qu'une s&#233;rie de protocoles. "Il est
d&#233;j&#224; difficile pour un bureaucrate qui l'utilise tous les jours de comprendre Lom&#233;, alors
ne parlons pas des repr&#233;sentants de gouvernement ACP qui sont peu motiv&#233;s," explique
Laporte. Le Centre esp&#232;re "entretenir le d&#233;bat en apportant des informations, de sorte que
lorsque les n&#233;gociations sur l'avenir de Lom&#233; commenceront en 1998, toutes les parties
sauront quelles sont les difficult&#233;s. Notre objectif est de susciter un vrai d&#233;bat sur l'avenir
de Lom&#233;," d&#233;clare Box. "C'est une convention unique qui &#233;tait tr&#232;s progressiste
&#224; l'&#233;poque de sa mise au point. Mais elle n'est pas utilis&#233;e de mani&#232;re
ad&#233;quate."
<p>
<h3>Un instrument efficace?</h3>
Une grande partie du d&#233;bat sur Lom&#233;, du moins en Europe, concerne la pr&#233;tendue
inefficacit&#233; de l'aide europ&#233;enne. Alors que des &#233;valuations compl&#232;tes n'ont pas
encore eu lieu, certaines &#233;tudes montrent que la performance de l'aide europ&#233;enne n'est pas
plus mauvaise que celle d'autres bailleurs de fonds, estime Laporte.
<p>
Le minist&#232;re n&#233;erlandais des affaires &#233;trang&#232;res n'a pas encore de vision
compl&#232;te des r&#233;sultats de Lom&#233;. Ernst Noorman, repr&#233;sentant du gouvernement
charg&#233; des affaires de l'UE au d&#233;partement de la coop&#233;ration internationale, signale
une d&#233;cision prise l'ann&#233;e derni&#232;re par les ministres europ&#233;ens de la
coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement, consistant &#224; &#233;valuer les programmes d'aide de
l'UE. "C'est un point important, bien que les dirigeants de la Commission, qui se sentaient menac&#233;s,
aient fait preuve de beaucoup de r&#233;sistance," explique Noorman. Il pense que l'&#233;valuation sera
pr&ecirc;te d'ici deux ou trois ans. "Donc, pour le moment, nous ne sommes pas en mesure de dire si
l'aide europ&#233;enne a &#233;t&#233; efficace ou non." N&#233;anmoins, l'exp&#233;rience montre,
selon Noorman, que l'UE est tr&#232;s bonne dans les domaines de l'ajustement structurel, de
l'int&#233;gration r&#233;gionale et des projets de s&#233;curit&#233; alimentaire mais qu'elle est plus
faible en mati&#232;re d'environnement.
<p>
Paul Hoebink, ma&icirc;tre assistant au centre du tiers-monde de l'universit&#233; catholique de
Nim&#232;gue, constate que l'un des &#233;l&#233;ments positifs de Lom&#233; est la fa&#231;on
dont la r&#233;partition des fonds est li&#233;e &#224; des crit&#232;res pr&#233;cis de pauvret&#233;
et de besoins. D'apr&#232;s Hoebink, les int&#233;r&ecirc;ts politiques et &#233;conomiques sont moins
dominants que dans d'autres formes de coop&#233;ration internationale.
<p>
L'autre versant du soutien "de l'aide et des &#233;changes" de Lom&#233; fut de pr&#233;voir un
acc&#232;s pr&#233;f&#233;rentiel des exportations ACP aux march&#233;s europ&#233;ens. 
<p>
Toutefois, en d&#233;pit de ces pr&#233;f&#233;rences, la plupart des pays ACP n'ont pas
&#233;t&#233; capables de progresser sur le plan &#233;conomique. Leur part de march&#233; est en
fait pass&#233;e de 6,7% en 1976 &#224; 3,4% en 1993. "On pourrait dire que sans Lom&#233; ces pays
auraient perdu bien davantage, mais ce n'est pas tr&#232;s satisfaisant," remarque Paul Hoebink,
chercheur &#224; l'universit&#233; de Nim&#232;gue.
<p>
Le tableau n'est cependant pas tout &#224; fait sombre. Quelques pays ont tir&#233; profit de l'accord
mais ils constituent des exceptions &#224; la r&#232;gle.
<p>
Les d&#233;tracteurs des pr&#233;f&#233;rences attirent l'attention sur les exp&#233;riences de certains
pays non ACP qui, avec moins de pr&#233;f&#233;rences commerciales, ont renforc&#233; leur position
sur le march&#233; europ&#233;en. "Les pays ACP n'ont pas utilis&#233; les possibilit&#233;s
commerciales qui leur &#233;taient propos&#233;es en partie du fait de leurs proc&#233;dures assez
complexes," reconna&icirc;t Noorman. "En outre, les pr&#233;f&#233;rences commerciales sont, en fait,
tr&#232;s limit&#233;es et peu int&#233;ressantes pour les soci&#233;t&#233;s plus importantes."
<p>
Noorman cite Maartje van Putten, membre n&#233;erlandais du Parlement  europ&#233;en, qui a
d&#233;clar&#233; que la quantit&#233; d'oignons pouvant &ecirc;tre export&#233;e &#224; des
conditions pr&#233;f&#233;rentielles dans l'UE &#233;quivalait &#224; la production annuelle d'oignons
de deux agriculteurs n&#233;erlandais.
<p>
Comme les bases industrielles des pays ACP sont g&#233;n&#233;ralement faibles, certains
d&#233;clarent que les exportations agricoles devraient constituer l'une de leurs forces. "Il est important
que leurs productions agricoles b&#233;n&#233;ficient d'un acc&#232;s aussi large que possible. Mais
c'est pr&#233;cis&#233;ment l&#224; un secteur sensible que l'Europe garde ferm&#233; autant qu'elle
peut," explique Noorman.
<p>
<h3>Int&#233;r&ecirc;ts diff&#233;rents</h3>

Lorsque les n&#233;gociations sur la deuxi&#232;me partie de Lom&#233; IV ont eu lieu l'ann&#233;e
derni&#232;re, il devint &#233;vident que l'int&#233;r&ecirc;t manifest&#233; par la partie
europ&#233;enne avait diminu&#233;. Le Royaume-Uni a r&#233;duit sa contribution d'un tiers;
l'Allemagne n'a jamais &#233;t&#233; une fervente partisane et seule la force motrice de la France a
permis d'arriver &#224; une conclusion heureuse de la r&#233;vision &#224; mi-parcours.
<p>
Une partie de la d&#233;fiance europ&#233;enne peut s'expliquer par l'histoire de la Convention de
Lom&#233;. Les pays ACP sont pour la plupart d'anciennes colonies fran&#231;aises et britanniques. La
France surtout est tr&#232;s attach&#233;e &#224; ses anciens liens coloniaux. "En principe, Lom&#233;
&#233;tait un trait&#233; n&#233;o-colonial impliquant les anciennes colonies de l'Union. C'&#233;tait
un mauvais d&#233;but," remarque Hoebink. Ces liens ont &#233;t&#233; affaiblis au cours des ans par
l'adh&#233;sion de nouveaux membres &#224; l'UE. Ces nouveaux membres ont des histoires coloniales
diff&#233;rentes ou n'en ont pas du tout (Autriche). D'autres raisons sont les budgets d'aide plus
restreints et la crainte que des engagements de cinq ans envers Lom&#233; entra&icirc;nent une restriction
des fonds destin&#233;s &#224; des objectifs bilat&#233;raux. En particulier lorsque les budgets
nationaux diminuent, Lom&#233; prend une proportion croissante de l'ensemble du budget national de
l'aide. Cette motivation &#233;tait particuli&#232;rement forte au Royaume-Uni o&ugrave; les
responsables de l'aide ont tenu &#224; ce que leurs engagements envers le cadre multilat&#233;ral de
Lom&#233; soient r&#233;duits.
<p>
<h3>Plus de discrimination &#224; l'avenir?</h3>
Des forces internes et externes sont &#224; l'origine du climat houleux qui entoure actuellement le
d&#233;bat sur Lom&#233;. S'il est encore trop t&ocirc;t pour que des plans d'action &#233;mergent,
le d&#233;bat s'anime &#224; mesure que les questions se font plus claires.
<p>
L'un des probl&#232;mes essentiels &#224; aborder est la discrimination, dans les deux sens du terme.
Premi&#232;rement, comment faire une discrimination entre les pays ACP, de mani&#232;re &#224; ce
que leurs diff&#233;rences se refl&#232;tent dans leurs relations avec l'Europe. Deuxi&#232;mement,
comment &#233;viter la discrimination envers les pays tr&#232;s pauvres qui sont actuellement exclus
des accords.
<p>
Bien qu'il ne veuille pas tirer de conclusion maintenant, Geert Laporte, de l'ECDPM, consid&#232;re une
approche plus diff&#233;renci&#233;e comme l'une des options. Laporte a "l'impression que l'on
travaille &#224; une sorte de r&#233;gionalisation. L'id&#233;e de base est qu'il est impossible de garder
soixante-dix pays ensemble parce qu'ils sont trop diff&#233;rents." Puisqu'il est clair que les pays ACP
sont confront&#233;s &#224; des probl&#232;mes diff&#233;rents, il est possible, &#224; son avis, que
Lom&#233; se transforme en un "accord global couvrant tous les pays en d&#233;veloppement,
doubl&#233; de sous-accords pour des pays et  des r&#233;gions sp&#233;cifiques."
<p>
On pourrait ainsi aboutir &#224; une r&#233;gion d'Afrique australe b&#233;n&#233;ficiant d'un soutien
diff&#233;rent de celui accord&#233; &#224; l'Afrique centrale, au Pacifique ou aux Cara&iuml;bes.
Hoebink constate qu'alors que "tout le monde parle de r&#233;gionalisation," il plaide pour un
trait&#233; incluant &#233;galement les pays en d&#233;veloppement d'Asie. "Le point capital d'une
nouvelle coop&#233;ration sera [d'inclure] un pays tel que l'Inde," pr&#233;voit-il, "parce que c'est une
force potentielle importante sur le march&#233; europ&#233;en."
<p>
Toutefois, pour Noorman, il n'est pas exclu que le cadre de Lom&#233; reste intact. Les difficult&#233;s
seront peut-&ecirc;tre tout simplement trop grandes. "Ce que nous avons &#233;tabli est le r&#233;sultat
de n&#233;gociations de plusieurs ann&#233;es entre des Etats membres qui tous ont des
int&#233;r&ecirc;ts diff&#233;rents. On est arriv&#233; &#224; un &#233;quilibre et il ne sera pas
ais&#233; d'en trouver un nouveau." "Quand on dit "Lom&#233;, c'est fini", il faut proposer d'autres
solutions", poursuit-il.
<p>
Ceci constitue un grand d&#233;fi pour l'avenir.

<P>
<b>Les cadres europ&#233;ens de coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppement avec plusieurs ensembles de pays en 
d&#233;veloppement  sont actuellement en pleine r&#233;vision.
C'est le cas avec la r&#233;vision &#224; mi-parcours de la
convention de lom&#233; IV ou avec le  renforcement des liens
avec les pays m&#233;diterran&#233;ens et de l' Am&#233;rique
Latine. C'est aussi le cas avec le r&#233;examen des liens 
commerciaux avec certains pays de l'Asie. Comme d'habitude, les
modifications envisag&#233;es refl&#232;tent l'&#233;volution
&#233;conomique des pays en voie de d&#233;veloppement
concern&#233;s, ou traduisent des changements sous-jacents qui
sont intervenus durant ces derni&#232;res ann&#233;es au niveau
de la situation g&#233;opolitique des ces pays par rapport &#224;
l'Europe ainsi que l'&#233;volution de l'Europe elle-m&ecirc;me.
<p>
En outre, il y a la conf&#233;rence Intergouvernementale, l'IGC,
qui constitue le grand &#233;pisode de la p&#233;riode post-
Maastricht. Dans le domaine du  d&#233;veloppement, parmi les
questions qui  sont les plus susceptibles d'y &ecirc;tre
discut&#233;es figurent toujours le d&#233;ficits d&#233;j&#224;
identifi&#233;s de  coordination entre les politiques des Etats
membres de l'Union et celle de la Communaut&#233;, et
d'articulation avec les autres politiques communes de l'Union.</b>
<p>
<h3><a name="fau">Faut-il encore une politique communautaire de
d&#233;veloppement?</a></h3>
<p>
1995 est donc une ann&#233;e de pr&#233;paration et de gestation
de celles qui risquent de marquer profond&#233;ment le futur de
la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement. Mais quelles sont les
grandes questions qui pourraient influencer la forme et le
contenu de la coop&#233;ration de la Communaut&#233;
europ&#233;enne au d&#233;veloppement avec les diff&#233;rents
groupes des pays concern&#233;s? Sous le prisme de la
compl&#233;mentarit&#233; pr&ocirc;n&#233;e par Maastricht et au
vu des insuffisances relev&#233;es, est-ce qu'il y a vraiment
encore de la place pour une politique Communautaire au
d&#233;veloppement? 
<p>
Les europ&#233;ens m&ecirc;me lorsqu'ils reconnaissent
l'importance de la politique Communautaire de d&#233;veloppement,
souvent ils ont du mal &#224; en saisir la vraie mesure et les
dimensions. L'Europe a &#233;t&#233; victime  de la crise
&#233;conomique et des bouleversements mon&#233;taires de 1992
et de 1993. En cette p&#233;riode d'amorce de croissance, les
europ&#233;ens restent encore perplexes devant la proximit&#233;
de la guerre en ex-Yougoslavie et la parfaite impuissance de l'
Europe de donner une fin &#224; ce massacre qui continue &#224;
ravager des europ&#233;ens d' ethnies ou de religion
diff&#233;rentes dans une r&#233;gion du vieux continent
o&ugrave; ont d&#233;j&#224; &#233;t&#233; &#233;crites quelques-
unes des pages les plus sanglantes de l'histoire europ&#233;enne. 
Ces m&ecirc;mes europ&#233;ens n'ont, en outre, pas encore eu
assez de temps pour assimiler les  bouleversements qui ont
secou&#233; l'Europe &#224; l'Est. Ainsi, m&ecirc;me lorsqu'ils
se disent convaincus de l'importance de l'aide au
d&#233;veloppement, quelque part ils se demandent quand
m&ecirc;me si ce discours sur le d&#233;veloppement n'a pas un
peu besoin d'&ecirc;tre mis au go&ucirc;t du jour. Cette
impression est s&ucirc;rement aussi accentu&#233;e par les
&#233;checs des efforts de d&#233;veloppement des ann&#233;es 80
et la stagnation du niveau &#233;conomique de la plupart des pays
ACP. Ainsi, en d&#233;pit de tous les efforts consentis, en une
dizaine d'ann&#233;es la part des exportations des pays ACP sur
le march&#233; europ&#233;en a chut&#233; de 7% &#224; moins de
5%.
<p>
Les europ&#233;ens per&#231;oivent les divers aspects de la
politique ext&#233;rieure selon leurs pr&#233;occupations de la
vie quotidienne. Ainsi, c'est surtout les priorit&#233;s internes
qui conditionnent leur attitude sur le plan ext&#233;rieur. L'
immigration dans cinq pays de l'Union Europ&#233;enne l'
Allemagne, la Gr&#232;ce, l' Espagne, la France et l'Italie a
tr&#232;s fortement progress&#233; entre 1991 et 1993. Les
in&#233;galit&#233;s sociales, l' emploi et la pauvret&#233;, la
s&#233;curit&#233; et la sant&#233; constituent autant des
pr&#233;occupations et, partant, des filtres &#224; travers
lesquels les europ&#233;ens jaugent les questions li&#233;es
&#224; la politique ext&#233;rieure de l'UE comme le dossier des
&#233;changes commerciaux, ou celui de l' &#233;largissement
futur ou encore celui de la coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppement .
<p>
Le d&#233;veloppement est une composante op&#233;rationnelle de
la politique ext&#233;rieure. L' action humanitaire aussi. Mais
les r&#233;sultats de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement
ne se manifestent pas tout de suite.  Ainsi, la coop&#233;ration
au d&#233;veloppement, m&ecirc;me lorsqu'elle est efficace et
produit des r&#233;sultats, n'aura jamais un effet imm&#233;diat
et visible comparable &#224; celui de l'action humanitaire.
<p>
En 1994, la Communaut&#233; et les Etats Membres qui ensemble
sont la plus grande source d'aide au d&#233;veloppement au monde,
ont consacr&#233; au d&#233;veloppement 23.7 milliards d'
&#233;cus correspondant &#224; 0.41% de son PNB. La part de la
Communaut&#233; en tant que telle est de 15%. Si l'on se basait
sur le seul  crit&#232;re de la productivit&#233; et exception
faite de certains groupes de pays, notamment en Asie, les
r&#233;sultats n'inciteraient pas les europ&#233;ens &#224;
maintenir au m&ecirc;me niveau le  financement de  la politique
&#224; la coop&#233;ration dans les ann&#233;es &#224; venir. Par
ailleurs, depuis le d&#233;but des ann&#233;es 90 la tendance
&#224; la baisse du niveau  de l'aide au d&#233;veloppement est
constante  aux Etats-Unis, l' autre grand donateur, o&ugrave; en
1993 le total de l'aide n'a pas d&#233;pass&#233; les 8 milliards
d' &#233;cus, soit 0.15% de leur PNB, deux fois moins que la
norme du Comit&#233; d'aide au d&#233;veloppement (CAD) de l'
OCDE qui est de 0.30% du PNB. En 1994, ce montant est rest&#233;
pratiquement inchang&#233;, pla&#231;ant ainsi les Etats Unis
derri&#232;re le Japon. Sous l'influence d'un congr&#232;s &#224;
majorit&#233; Republicain, la tendance risque encore de
s'accentuer durant  les ann&#233;es suivantes. 
M&ecirc;me en ce d&#233;but de reprise pour l'Europe &#224;
quinze, il est &#233;vident que l' &#233;ch&#233;ance de
convergence des &#233;conomies nationales et la discipline
budg&#233;taire inh&#233;rente &#224; l'objectif de la monnaie
unique avant l'horizon 2000 ne permettent pas beaucoup de
gaspillages.
<p>
Dans ces circonstances,  les europ&#233;ens et les Etats membres
de l'Union peuvent &ecirc;tre particuli&#232;rement
vuln&#233;rables &#224; la tentation de r&#233;cup&#233;rer une 
partie de la coop&#233;ration de l'UE au d&#233;veloppement qui
est actuellement g&#233;r&#233;e par la Communaut&#233;. Pour les
gouvernements des quinze cela peut para&icirc;tre comme un moyen
de contr&ocirc;ler un peu mieux les d&#233;penses notamment dans 
la coop&#233;ration avec des  pays o&ugrave; &#231;a a l'air
d'aller moins bien.  Apr&#232;s tout, il peut para&icirc;tre
normal aux europ&#233;ens qu' entre des pays ou groupes des pays
diff&#233;rents de notre plan&#232;te il y ait des
diff&#233;rences de niveau importantes; m&ecirc;me &#224;
l'int&#233;rieur de l'Europe on constate que les r&#233;gions les
plus prosp&#232;res  ont un niveau de vie cinq fois plus
&#233;lev&#233; que celui des r&#233;gions les moins
favoris&#233;es. 
<p>
<h3><a name="con">Le contexte actuel</a></h3>
<p>
Quels sont les principales mutations qui affectent le cadre des
relations des diff&#233;rents groupes des pays avec l'UE et qui
risquent d'avoir  une incidence sur la redefinition de la
coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement de la Communaut&#233;
europ&#233;enne?
<p>
Les interd&#233;pendances qui avaient  longuement
conditionn&#233; les relations entre les pays  les plus
avanc&#233;s et les pays en d&#233;veloppement ont &#233;t&#233;
profond&#233;ment transform&#233;es ces derni&#232;res
ann&#233;es.  Affranchis de leur liens politiques avec l'une ou
l'autre des superpuissances plusieurs pays du Sud ont au
m&ecirc;me temps perdu les avantages d&#233;coulant de leur
position strat&#233;gique. Cette lib&#233;ration a souvent
lib&#233;r&#233; d'autres forces qui restaient jusqu'alors
opprim&#233;es par la crainte des incidences potentielles sur
l'ordre international et a permis la consommation
d'animosit&#233;s jusque l&#224; refoul&#233;es. Malheureusement
pour eux, plusieurs pays ACP ont pendant la m&ecirc;me
p&#233;riode perdu aussi leur importance strat&#233;gique en tant
que fournisseurs de mati&#232;res premi&#232;res.
<p>
Parall&#232;lement, les diverses &#233;conomies nationales
deviennent de plus en plus d&#233;pendantes les unes des autres
au niveau mondial ainsi que des d&#233;bouch&#233;s
ext&#233;rieures pour leur production. Dans ce contexte, les
investissements directs &#233;trangers (IDE) grandement
aid&#233;s par la globalisation des m&#233;canismes financiers
et des communications jouent un r&ocirc;le de plus en plus vital
dans l'&#233;conomie des pays .
<p>
Cette mondialisation n'est pas forcement favorable aux efforts
de d&#233;veloppement des pays les moins favoris&#233;s qui sont
pourtant cit&#233;s comme des pays prioritaires parmi les
b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires de la coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppement de l' Union. En effet, la contrainte de
performances sur le plan ext&#233;rieur peut parfois ne pas
&ecirc;tre compatible avec les priorit&#233;s de
d&#233;veloppement des pays concern&#233;s. 
<p>
Malheureusement, les conflits qui se sont multipli&#233;s
apr&#232;s la fin de la guerre froide n'ont rien fait pour
arranger les choses, car, entre autres, ils ont eu comme effet
d'augmenter l'ins&#233;curit&#233; et de repousser les
investissements &#233;trangers directs tellement importants pour
les &#233;conomies des pays en d&#233;veloppement.
<p>
La mondialisation de l' &#233;conomie et du commerce et
l'importance plan&#233;taire de certaines questions comme
l'environnement, la sant&#233;, la population et la
s&#233;curit&#233; se profilent d&#233;j&#224; &#224; l'horizon
comme des nouvelles interd&#233;pendances pouvant affecter la
politique &#224; la coop&#233;ration dans les ann&#233;es &#224;
venir.
<p>
<h3><a name="ten">Les grandes tendances</a></h3>
<p>
La politique de coop&#233;ration de l'Union n'est pas con&#231;ue
ni appliqu&#233;e de mani&#232;re isol&#233;e. Les nouvelles
interd&#233;pendances que nous &#233;voquons plus haut sont aussi
d&#233;terminantes pour l'UE et impliquent une coordination
encore plus renforc&#233;e que par le pass&#233; avec les autres
grands donateurs. Dans ce cadre, la politique de la
Communaut&#233; est, entre autres, guid&#233;e par les
exp&#233;riences communes et les tendances  g&#233;n&#233;rales
qui predominent au niveau des politiques appliqu&#233;es par les
autres acteurs du d&#233;veloppement. A ce titre, la
coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement de l'Union est
impr&#233;gn&#233;e par une s&#233;rie d'&#233;l&#233;ments qui
paraissent constituer  une assiette minimale pour le succ&#232;s
des efforts de d&#233;veloppement.
<p>
Pour tous les ensembles des pays en d&#233;veloppement, les
progr&#232;s dans le processus de d&#233;mocratisation ou la
situation des droits de l'homme constituent d&#233;sormais des
conditions sinequanon  pour le maintien d'une coop&#233;ration
active entre l'Union et les Etats b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires. Il
s'agit l&#224; d' ingr&#233;dients &#233;l&#233;mentaires
incontournables qui engagent la responsabilit&#233; politique des
Etats b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires de l'aide et &#224; travers eux la
responsabilit&#233; politique de l'Union .
<p>
Mais les interf&#233;rences entre la politique et le
d&#233;veloppement sont plusieurs.  Ainsi il y a toujours moyen 
de renforcer le fonctionnement d&#233;mocratique des pays
b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires de l'aide, dans le respect de leur
souverainet&#233; et de leurs sp&#233;cificit&#233;s culturelles.
A cet effet, les principaux donateurs ont commenc&#233; depuis
quelque temps &#224; appuyer activement les efforts de
responsabilisation des populations b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires en les
associant aussi directement que possible &#224; la gestion de
l'aide. Les synergies de coop&#233;ration sont &#224; rechercher
&#224; des niveaux  aussi diff&#233;rents et
d&#233;centralis&#233;s que possible. Ce type de
d&#233;veloppement participatif n'est pas incompatible avec la
responsabilisation des instances politiques et d&#233;mocratiques
des pays b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires.  Bien au contraire, il doit
fonctionner en tant que m&#233;canisme d'envoi des signaux de
r&#233;gulation dans les deux sens entre l'UE et les pays
b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires.
<p>
La d&#233;centralisation des m&#233;canismes d&#233;cisionnels
contribuera aussi &#224; instaurer le climat de confiance
n&#233;cessaire au renforcement du secteur priv&#233; et attirera
des investissements &#233;trangers directs. Les pays
concern&#233;s qui font preuve d'ouverture &#224; cet &#233;gard
devraient b&#233;n&#233;ficier d'un capital de confiance qui leur
sera n&#233;cessaire pour &ecirc;tre en mesure de qualifier aux
diff&#233;rents fonds sp&#233;ciaux et programmes et tirer un
profit effectif des avantages  qui leur sont ainsi ouverts.
<p>
Pour ce qui concerne plus particuli&#232;rement les pays ACP, il
semble d&#233;sormais &#233;vident que la programmation des aides
se fera de plus en plus par tranches successives et que le niveau
effectif de l'aide d&#233;pendra du succ&#232;s des tranches
pr&#233;c&#233;dentes. Ainsi seront r&#233;compens&#233;s les
pays qui font preuve de leur engagement &#224; un
d&#233;veloppement durable et seront p&#233;nalis&#233;s les pays
plut&ocirc;t enclins &#224; vivre au jour le jour ou qui ont des
priorit&#233;s qui ne sont pas de nature &#224; convaincre les
donateurs internationaux sur l'utilit&#233; de l'aide.
<p>
Par ailleurs, les donateurs parall&#232;lement aux  canaux
traditionnels d'aide bilat&#233;rale ou multilat&#233;rale,
disposent d' autres moyens de coop&#233;ration sectorielle, comme
les swaps de dettes des pays surendett&#233;s contre des efforts
de d&#233;veloppement consentis par les pays concern&#233;s dans
certains domaines prioritaires. L'environnement et sans doute
encore l' &#233;ducation ou la sant&#233; constituent des
domaines ou de telles  approches de coop&#233;ration peuvent
&ecirc;tre utilement exploit&#233;es. Bien entendu, avec les
swaps la conditionnalit&#233; trouve une de ses formes
d'expression les plus directes dans les relations avec les pays
en d&#233;veloppement. Il s'agit l&#224; d' un domaine o&ugrave;
les op&#233;rateurs d'aide des pays industrialis&#233;s les
organisations des Nations Unis et, pourquoi pas, les ONG peuvent
trouver un terrain qui reste encore &#224; exploiter. 
<p>
La proximit&#233; physique et culturelle d&#233;termine les
relations de l'Union avec les pays du pourtour
m&#233;diterran&#233;en. Ainsi, l'am&#233;lioration des
conditions d' acc&#232;s de  produits m&#233;diterran&#233;ens
au march&#233; de l'Union et la r&#233;duction de l'immigration
clandestine constituent des &#233;l&#233;ments essentiels du
d&#233;cor de la coop&#233;ration entre l'Union et ces pays. 
<p>
Le nouveau syst&#232;me des Pr&#233;f&#233;rences Tarifaires
g&#233;n&#233;ralis&#233;es  assure d&#233;j&#224; de meilleures
conditions d'acc&#232;s sur le march&#233; de l'Union aux
produits en provenance de l'Am&#233;rique Latine et de l'Asie.
L'aide aux investissements et l'appui aux petites et moyennes
entreprises est actuellement vitale pour une s&#233;rie des pays
de ces deux groupes afin de consolider leur avanc&#233;e. Les
progr&#232;s d&#233;j&#224; accomplis par plusieurs des  pays de
cette zone offrent &#224; l'Union un large &#233;ventail des
possibilit&#233;s de coop&#233;ration qui au del&#224; des
caract&#233;ristiques classiques de l'aide pr&#233;senteront de
plus en plus d'&#233;l&#233;ments de coop&#233;ration entre
partenaires paritaires. Tel est, entre autres,  le cas des
&#233;changes technologiques multiples et des investissements
communs.
<p>
<h3><a name="com">La Communaut&#233; garde un r&#244;le &#226;
jouer</a></h3>
<p>
Alors, compte tenu des mutations spectaculaires intervenues ces
10 derni&#232;res ann&#233;es y a-t-il encore de la place pour
une politique communautaire au d&#233;veloppement, et si oui,
pour couvrir quels besoins en mati&#232;re de coop&#233;ration
par rapport aux politiques des Etats membres individuels de l'UE,
pour quels groupes de pays, et quoi faire et comment? 
<p>
Et si on retournait la question pour la poser non pas &#224; la
Commission Europ&#233;enne en tant qu' &#233;xecutif de l'Union
mais aux Etats membres eux m&ecirc;mes? En d'autres  mots, dans
le contexte actuel de globalisation de la production et des
&#233;changes ainsi que des nouvelles interd&#233;pendances et 
tenant compte des mutations intervenues, l'action des Etats
membres individuels est-elle suffisante pour r&#233;pondre aux
besoins de coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement actuels?
<p>
La r&#233;ponse nous para&icirc;t assez &#233;vidente: le nouveau
contexte des relations internationales, la n&#233;cessit&#233;
d'adapter la politique aux sp&#233;cificit&#233;s propres &#224;
chaque ensemble diff&#233;rent des pays en d&#233;veloppement,
les nouvelles tendances dans la coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppement notamment dans les domaines prioritaires de
coop&#233;ration, d&#233;passent les capacit&#233;s de
r&#233;ponse individuelles des Etats membres de l'Union. Il nous
para&icirc;t, en effet, difficile m&ecirc;me  pour les grands de
l'Union d' &ecirc;tre en mesure de g&#233;rer efficacement seuls
tout l'&#233;ventail de la coop&#233;ration avec  toutes les
contraintes d'analyse de mise en oeuvre de suivi et
d'&#233;valuation et surtout de coordination qu'une telle gestion
impliquerait avec une multitude d'autres intervenants. 
<p>
La r&#233;gionalisation et la globalisation des rapports entre
les pays en d&#233;veloppement eux m&ecirc;mes et entre les pays
industrialis&#233;s appellent non seulement la confirmation mais
aussi le renforcement du r&ocirc;le le de l'Union dans la
coop&#233;ration pour les ann&#233;es avenir. L'action de la
Communaut&#233; semble plus appropri&#233;e pour r&#233;pondre
aux besoins de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement en
prenant en consid&#233;ration les priorit&#233;s qui
pr&#233;occupent les europ&#233;ens dans leur vie au jour le
jour.
<p>
Toutefois, il est vrai aussi que la politique Communautaire n'est
pas non plus exempte de reproches, voire de critiques, notamment
en ce qui concerne la coordination de son action avec les Etats
membres de l'Union et la coh&#233;sion avec les autres politiques
de l'Union. Il s'agit l&#224; des questions qui devront
&ecirc;tre approfondies lors de la Conf&#233;rence
Intergouvernementale. 
<p>
<h3><a name="lom">Lom&#233; IV: un parcours avec
obstacle</a></h3>
<p>
La dotation globale du Fonds Europ&#233;en de D&#233;veloppement
pour couvrir les besoins de financement de  la premi&#232;re
p&#233;riode 1991-1995 de l'actuelle convention de Lom&#233;
&#233;tait de 12 milliards d'&#233;cus. Apr&#232;s la conclusion
des n&#233;gociations intra-Communautaires le 30 juin 1995 &#224;
Cannes, le protocole financier "Lom&#233; IV bis" pour les cinq
ann&#233;es &#224; venir a finalement &#233;t&#233; fix&#233;
&#224; 14.625 milliards d'&#233;cus, y compris les fonds de la
BEI. Le niveau  de cette augmentation de pr&#232;s de 22% doit
cependant &ecirc;tre relativis&#233;, car il est inf&#233;rieur
&#224; celui pr&#233;conis&#233; par la Commission
europ&#233;enne pour tenir compte de l' arriv&#233;e de trois
nouveaux Etats membres dans l'Union. Les difficult&#233;s
significatives qui ont marqu&#233; la conclusion de cet accord
t&#233;moignent de la tendance &#224; la r&#233;cup&#233;ration
de l'aide au D&#233;veloppement qui caract&#233;rise certains
Etats membres de l'Union. M&ecirc;me si  cette position  cache
le souhait pour certains Etats membres de soumettre davantage
leur coop&#233;ration &#224; des objectifs nationaux en
favorisant ainsi certains b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires par rapport
&#224; d'autres ou en la soumettant &#224; des contraintes peu
favorables aux b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires, cette tendance vers
l'aide bilat&#233;rale pourrait se g&#233;n&#233;raliser et
s'accentuer davantage dans les ann&#233;es &#224; venir si l'aide
Communautaire ne  produisait pas assez de r&#233;sultats
tangibles en termes de d&#233;veloppement durable des Etats
b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires dans les ann&#233;es &#224; venir.
<p>
Entretemps, les n&#233;gociations pour ce "changement dans la
continuit&#233;" qui devraient confirmer l'accent d&#233;j&#224;
mis sur le d&#233;veloppement des ressources humaines durant la
premi&#232;re phase de la Convention actuelle, se sont
d&#233;roul&#233;es dans le climat favorable &#224; la
globalisation grandissante des &#233;changes qui a &#233;t&#233;
renforc&#233; avec la conclusion des accords de l'Uruguay round
de GATT dont elles portent quelque peu la marque. Ainsi, les deux
parties se sont  convenues de  placer le commerce au centre de
la coop&#233;ration ACP-CE.
<p>
En effet, apr&#232;s la r&#233;vision &#224; mi-parcours de la
convention de Lom&#233;, les r&#232;gles d'origine pour les
produits en provenance des pays ACP ont encore &#233;t&#233;
assouplies et des avantages suppl&#233;mentaires seront
accord&#233;s aux pays ACP pour la quasi totalit&#233; des
produits agricoles &#224; l'exception des olives, des produits
d&#233;riv&#233;s du vin et des citrons . Dans le cadre de
l'Uruguay round la Convention de Lom&#233; a, par ailleurs,
obtenu une d&#233;rogation (waiver) pour ce qui concerne les
pr&#233;f&#233;rences tarifaires qui sont accord&#233;es
unilat&#233;ralement par la Communaut&#233; aux pays ACP.  Ces
avantages suffiront-ils &#224; garantir aux produits des pays ACP
un meilleur acc&#232;s sur le march&#233; europ&#233;en par
rapport aux produits de certains parmi leurs concurrents?
M&ecirc;me si ces derniers sont-ils moins favoris&#233;s sur la
plan des avantages dont ils jouissent dans leur relation avec
l'UE par rapport aux pays ACP, souvent ils arrivent &#224;
exporter des produits de meilleure qualit&#233; et &#224; des
prix plus avantag&#233;s.  Ainsi, &#224; cot&#233; des
dispositions visant &#224; accro&icirc;tre le volume des
exportations des pays ACP, des mesures seront  &#233;galement
prises pour en renforcer la comp&#233;titivit&#233;.
<p>
Par ailleurs, les Etats ACP ont accept&#233; le principe d'une
programmation en deux tranches de l'enveloppe financi&#232;re
quinquennale des programmes indicatifs des pays ACP. Enfin,
d'autres dispositions concernant la promotion du
d&#233;veloppement du secteur priv&#233;, le renforcement de la
coop&#233;ration industrielle, la coop&#233;ration r&#233;gionale
et d&#233;centralis&#233;e ont aussi &#233;t&#233; convenues.
<p>
Ainsi, m&ecirc;me si les conditions de l' accord entre les quinze
pour le financement de la deuxi&#232;me p&#233;riode de
l'actuelle convention Lom&#233; IV ont &#233;t&#233;
p&#233;nibles, le plus grand accord de coop&#233;ration qui au
d&#233;but des ann&#233;es 1990 a absorb&#233; pr&#232;s de la
moiti&#233; de l'aide au d&#233;veloppement de la
Communaut&#233;, para&icirc;t maintenant sensiblement mieux
arm&#233; face aux futurs d&#233;fis  du d&#233;veloppement  dans
les r&#233;gions du monde concern&#233;es.
<p>
Parall&#232;lement aux n&#233;gociations pour la r&#233;vision
de la Convention &#224; mi parcours, les n&#233;gociations d'un
nouveau cadre de coop&#233;ration avec l' Afrique du Sud
constitue en soi un &#233;v&#233;nement qui risque de marquer
consid&#233;rablement l'avenir de la convention de Lom&#233; en
tant que telle. Pour ses relations avec L'Afrique du Sud la
Communaut&#233; a, en effet, propos&#233; en mars 1995 une
approche double: un protocole additionnel &#224; la Convention
de Lom&#233; concernant les conditions sp&#233;cifiques
d'adh&#233;sion de l'Afrique du Sud &#224; la convention, et un
accord de commerce et de coop&#233;ration entre l'Union
europ&#233;enne et l'Afrique du Sud.
<p>
Ind&#233;pendamment des modalit&#233;s d&#233;finitives du cadre
de coop&#233;ration avec l'Afrique du Sud, qui font l'objet d'une
n&#233;gociation entam&#233;e depuis le 30 juin 1995, l'
adh&#233;sion de ce pays &#224; double visage &#224; la
Convention de Lom&#233; ne manquera pas d'avoir des effets
significatifs sur la comp&#233;titivit&#233; des pays de la
r&#233;gion et peut-&ecirc;tre aussi sur la
comp&#233;titivit&#233; de l'ensemble de l'Afrique subsaharienne.
<p>
<h3><a name="pri">Les priorit&#233;s actuelles</a></h3>
<p>
La notion du d&#233;veloppement a une connotation d'ensemble qui
est parfaitement justifi&#233;e. Parvenir &#224; un rythme de
d&#233;veloppement soutenu dans un secteur &#233;conomique
pr&#233;suppose, entre autres, le d&#233;veloppement harmonieux
et parall&#232;le des domaines sociaux et politiques
concern&#233;s. Ainsi, il est par d&#233;finition exclu pour les
grands donateurs de  s&#233;lectionner certaines secteurs
o&ugrave; serait consacr&#233; l'essentiel de l'aide au
d&#233;veloppement. 
<p>
Cependant, m&ecirc;me en l'absence de domaines "culte," la
programmation de l' aide depuis d&#233;j&#224; le d&#233;but des
ann&#233;es 90 se faisant de plus en plus selon de crit&#232;res
de performance, il peut para&icirc;tre dans une certaine mesure
imp&#233;ratif pour les principaux donateurs de concentrer un peu
plus leurs efforts sur certaines domaines d'importance
strat&#233;gique qui conditionnent la r&#233;ussite des efforts
pour le d&#233;veloppement de l'ensemble des secteurs du pays. 
<p>
Bien entendu, les domaines d'importance strat&#233;gique n' ont
pas toujours &#233;t&#233; les m&ecirc;mes.  Ils sont choisis
selon des crit&#232;res qui refl&#232;tent les secteurs
prioritaires dont le fonctionnement  est consid&#233;r&#233; par
les pays donateurs et b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires comme vital en vue
d'assurer un d&#233;veloppement durable pour les pays
b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires. Bien entendu, la s&#233;lection est
faite sur des crit&#232;res qui ne  sont  pas les m&ecirc;mes
pour chaque p&#233;riode de la Coop&#233;ration. Les
modifications dans l'ordre des priorit&#233;s sont surtout
dict&#233;es par l'exp&#233;rience et la pratique des
p&#233;riodes pr&#233;c&#233;dentes en rapport avec le
d&#233;veloppement relatif des secteurs concern&#233;s. Ainsi,
pendant les ann&#233;es 70, premi&#232;re p&#233;riode de la
coop&#233;ration la priorit&#233; des priorit&#233;s &#233;tait
le d&#233;veloppement des grandes infrastructures. Vint ensuite
le d&#233;veloppement du secteur agricole, alors que le
succ&#232;s mitig&#233; de la pratique du d&#233;veloppement
pendant ces deux p&#233;riodes respectives et les nouvelles
interd&#233;pendances ont  conduit les pratiquants du
d&#233;veloppement &#224; s'int&#233;resser depuis le d&#233;but
des ann&#233;es 90 davantage &#224; l'importance strat&#233;gique
de l'&#233;quilibre institutionnel et financier et &#224; des
domaines de plus en plus proches au  d&#233;veloppement des
ressources humaines.
<p>
A ce titre, l' appui aux r&#233;formes institutionnelles pour
privil&#233;gier la d&#233;centralisation et la
lib&#233;ralisation du fonctionnement des circuits de production
et de commercialisation  et l'appui &#224; l'ajustement
structurel visant &#224; &#233;quilibrer les finances des pays
concern&#233;s ont incontestablement la primaut&#233;. Les 1.150
millions d'Ecus qui ont &#233;t&#233; affect&#233;s &#224;
l'ajustement structurel durant la premi&#232;re p&#233;riode
(1989-1994) de l'actuelle convention de Lom&#233; IV refl&#232;te
l'importance relative de ce secteur pour les pays ACP.
<p>
L'appui au secteur priv&#233; est un autre domaine de
coop&#233;ration qui devrait continuer &#224;
b&#233;n&#233;ficier du support des grands donateurs. A cet
&#233;gard, outre l'appui direct &#224; des projets priv&#233;s,
l'appui aux structures  financi&#232;res et des institutions qui
offrent des services collectifs ( chambres de commerce et
d'industrie etc.) constitueront indiscutablement des secteurs de
coop&#233;ration privil&#233;gi&#233;e.
<p>
Dans un monde o&ugrave; plus d'un milliard de personnes vivent
avec moins d'un Ecu par jour, la lutte contre la pauvret&#233;
sera toujours une priorit&#233; dans l'aide au
d&#233;veloppement. Par ailleurs, comme nous l'avons
d&#233;j&#224; mentionn&#233;, la pauvret&#233; constitue  un des
indicateurs principaux pour d&#233;terminer les pays les plus
d&#233;favoris&#233;s dont le d&#233;veloppement constitue un des
principaux objectifs de la coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppement. Ce domaine correspond aussi, nous semble-t-
il, &#224; la vocation et au r&ocirc;le de la Communaut&#233;
dans les programmes d'appui &#224; la r&#233;forme
institutionnelle et &#224; l'ajustement structurel afin de
r&#233;duire l'impact de l'aust&#233;rit&#233; budg&#233;taire
et l'appauvrissement des larges couches de population qui peuvent
se produire pendant les premi&#232;res phases de la mise en
oeuvre de telles reformes.
<p>
Alors qu' en Asie et en Am&#233;rique Latine les quinze
derni&#232;res ann&#233;es le nombre des malnourris  tend &#224;
se stabiliser, en Afrique Subsaharienne il a tendance &#224;
augmenter. Ainsi, de 112 millions dans les ann&#233;es 1975 le
nombre de malnourris en Afrique subsaharienne est pass&#233;e
&#224; 175 millions en 1990. Cette augmentation rappelle la
permanence d'un risque de famine r&#233;currente dans ce
continent et la n&#233;cessit&#233; de trouver des r&#233;ponses
structurelles au probl&#232;me d'ins&#233;curit&#233;
alimentaire.
<p>
Contrairement &#224; ce que peuvent penser les partisans
inconditionnels de la globalisation des &#233;changes et des
relations multilat&#233;rales, le renforcement de la
coop&#233;ration r&#233;gionale de pays en d&#233;veloppement
peut &#224; terme contribuer &#224; lib&#233;raliser  le commerce
plus rapidement que la participation &#224; des n&#233;gociations
multilat&#233;rales et peut m&ecirc;me servir d'antichambre
&#224; la globalisation des &#233;changes des pays y participant.
Il est en effet, parfois plus facile de cerner pour les pays
concern&#233;s les avantages tangibles et plus imm&#233;diats
d'une coop&#233;ration r&#233;gionale concernant certains
domaines pr&#233;cis par rapport aux avantages plus complexes et
parfois indirects d'un accord multilat&#233;ral.
<p>
Dans cette p&#233;riode d'incertitudes l'existence des structures
r&#233;gionales peut aussi pr&#233;senter des avantages non
n&#233;gligeables sur le plan de la stabilit&#233;
g&#233;opolitique de la r&#233;gion et, partant, contribuer
&#224; la pr&#233;vention effective des conflits r&#233;gionaux
par des acteurs, hommes et femmes qui ont pris l'habitude de
travailler ensemble et trouver des solutions &#224; des
probl&#232;mes communs. 
<p>
Par cons&#233;quent, l'appui &#224; la coop&#233;ration
r&#233;gionale, qui pendant la premi&#232;re p&#233;riode de la
Convention de Lom&#233; actuelle a b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; de
1250 millions d'&#233;cus, est un domaine dont le renforcement 
pour des raisons multiples pr&#233;sente une importance
strat&#233;gique  dans les ann&#233;es &#224; venir.
<p>
Comme il r&#233;sulte de plusieurs exp&#233;riences, le
d&#233;veloppement est, entre autres, grandement conditionn&#233;
par la mentalit&#233; des intervenants &#224; tous les niveaux. 
A ce titre, la formation et l' &#233;ducation jouent un
r&ocirc;le central dans le d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique et
social des pays en d&#233;veloppement. Les deux resteront donc
parmi les domaines prioritaires pour les interventions des
donateurs. 
<p>
Tr&#232;s &#233;troitement li&#233; &#224; la question de
l'&#233;ducation, le planning familial, notamment en Afrique
subsaharienne a &#233;galement une importance strat&#233;gique
lorsque l'on sait qu'une des  caract&#233;ristique principales
de ces pays est que le taux de croissance de l'&#233;conomie
m&ecirc;me lorsqu'il est relativement satisfaisant, reste
syst&#233;matiquement inf&#233;rieur &#224; celui de la
croissance de la  population. 
<p>
D'une mani&#232;re g&#233;n&#233;rale, le r&ocirc;le de la femme
et l'encouragement de sa participation dans les activit&#233;s
du d&#233;veloppement deviennent de plus en plus une des
consid&#233;rations essentielles des op&#233;rateurs du
d&#233;veloppement. 
<p>
Le montant de l'aide consentie aux actions de d&#233;veloppement
de la sant&#233; dans les pays ACP a augment&#233; de
mani&#232;re spectaculaire de 125 millions d' &#233;cus pour la
p&#233;riode 1980-1985 &#224; pr&#232;s de 300 millions
d'&#233;cus pour la seule ann&#233;e 1993. Au del&#224; de
l'importance relative de la part des fonds de lutte contre le
SIDA, cette augmentation des d&#233;penses m&ecirc;me si elle ne
s'est pas traduite par des r&#233;sultats imm&#233;diatement
tangibles t&#233;moigne de l' importance de cette question et
refl&#232;te la sensibilisation de la Communaut&#233; &#224; un
domaine qui constitue une des nouvelles interd&#233;pendances
plan&#233;taires.
<p>
Les activit&#233;s visant la protection de l'environnement
interviennent d&#233;j&#224; pour plus de 10% dans la facture
totale de la coop&#233;ration Communautaire au
d&#233;veloppement, faisant ainsi de ce domaine une des
composantes essentielles du d&#233;veloppement. Ici aussi l'
importance accord&#233;e &#224; ce domaine est une
cons&#233;quence directe de la conscience de
l'interd&#233;pendance existant entre les pays
industrialis&#233;s et les pays en d&#233;veloppement.
<p>
Les derniers signes encourageants concernant les indicateurs de
croissance des pays en voie de d&#233;veloppement, portent &#224;
croire que ces priorit&#233;s continueront &#224;
b&#233;n&#233;ficier de l'appellation d'importance
strat&#233;gique tout au long de la seconde moiti&#233; des
ann&#233;es 90.
<p>
Parall&#232;lement, la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement est
en train de filtrer les le&#231;ons du pass&#233; pour affiner
son approche. Elle perd ainsi progressivement son caract&#232;re
d'aide au d&#233;veloppement au profit d' une "approche contrat".
Que se soit sous forme  d' accord bilat&#233;ral, de contrat de
part&#233;nariat, de protocole ou de convention collective, les
relations de la Communaut&#233; se baseront de plus en plus sur
un contrat de confiance avec un cahier de charges qui liera les
parties entre elles. Cela est le cas avec les pays qui ont fait
r&#233;cemment des avanc&#233;es significatives et avec lesquels
la Communaut&#233; commence &#224; traiter en vrais partenaires
&#224; la recherche de l' int&#233;r&ecirc;t mutuel. Cela est
&#233;galement le  cas avec les pays les plus
d&#233;favoris&#233;s o&ugrave; l'aide sera de plus en plus
li&#233;e &#224; l'obligation de r&#233;sultats. Au del&#224; de
l'obligation de r&#233;sultats, cette approche contrat
refl&#232;te aussi et  encore plus des pr&#233;occupations d'
hommes et de femmes des pays en d&#233;veloppement et des pays
europ&#233;ens dont les sorts seront de plus en plus li&#233;s
et interd&#233;pendants.

<B>1 PARLIAMENTARY AGENDA</B>
<P>
When the European Parliament meets in full plenary session on
20 to 24 May in Strassbourg they will find the agenda packed with
aid-related issues.  Included for discussion are
<UL>
<LI>The agreement for cooperation between the EU and MERCOSUR
<LI>A report on rehabilitation and reconstruction in developing
countries (already approved by the development committee this
week)
<LI>A report on the management of food aid and the development
of food security (already approved by the development committee
this week)
<LI>A report on humanitarian aid outside of the EU (already approved
by the development committee this week)
<LI>A communication from the commission to the parliament concerning
the future of economic aid to Jordan and the Ghaza strip
<LI>A report on the fisheries agreement between the EU and Mauritania
<LI>A report on aid for population programmes and policies in
developing countries
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<B>2 BANANAS ESCALATION OF THE CONFLICT</B>
<P>
Controversy still surrounds the commissions proposals for reform
of the banana importation quotas to take account of the accession
of Austria, Finland and Sweden to membership of the union.  The
commission has proposed that the quota be increased by 353,000
tonnes, and that this additional quota be given exclusively to
dollar banana importers.  This denies any of the new quota to
ACP producers and reduces the ACP share of the overall quota (2.553
million tonnes) from 30% to 26%.  The proposal has managed to
please no one.  For the Germans, who are supported by Belgium,
Denmark, Holland and Luxembourg, the increase in quota is not
enough.  They also want to see even more of the overall quota
going to cheap Latin American producers.  On the other side of
the argument, the UK, France, Spain and Portugal are fighting
to maintain the ACPs share of the banana quota.  
<P>
The stalemate is now overshadowed by the fact that the United
States, which has for a long time been complaining about the system
of preferences offered by the EU to ACP banana producers, has
started proceedings to refer the issue to a panel of the World
Trade Organisation.  The American complaint is similar to that
of the Germans.  They want to see a larger quota - up to 2.9 million
tonnes - and greater access for American producers.  Between the
German desire for cheap bananas and the American insistence of
access to the EU market, the ACP quota is looking increasingly
vulnerable.  Mickey Cantor, the United States Trade Representative,
is reported to be very confident of winning at least part of its
complaint.  This would leave the EU liable to pay compensation
to the USA if it did not comply with the ruling of the WTO panel.
<P>
<B>3 FUTURE OF LOME CONVENTION</B>
<P>
The discussions on the future of the Lom&eacute; Convention are
taking place in many different forums.  Some more open than others.
 On the weekend of May 4 to 5 a small group from DGVIII, the development
Commission of the European Union, will travel to Abidjan for a
48 hour informal discussion on what happens after 1999.  They
will spend their weekend in intense conversation with leading
members of the African business and political community in a spirit
of exploring all possible avenues.  Hopefully those of us who
are not members of such elite circles will have a chance to input
to the discussions before everything is signed and sealed.
<P>
<B>4 EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE</B>
<P>
The development committee of the European Parliament met in Brussels
this week for two days.  The committee adopted three major reports
on humanitarian aid, food security, and rehabilitation and reconstruction
<UL>
<LI>Humanitarian aid<BR>
The committee adopted the position of the council, which defines
the scope of humanitarian activities and the legal basis
<LI>Food Security<BR>
All food aid should seek to encourage the future self-sufficiency
of the populations in current need
<LI>Rehabilitation and Reconstruction<BR>
covering all areas of rehabiltation and reconstruction, which
should be seen as preparing the way for future development work
in the medium to long term
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Emma Bonino, Commissioner with responsibility for ECHO, spoke
to the committee.  In response to a question about ECHOs approach
to the question of women in emergencies, Ms Bonino said that ECHO
would be producing a report on the subject but that it would only
cover women in refugee situations.  
<P>
<B>5 RWANDA NEGATIVE NGO EVALUATION</B>
<P>
The Rwandan government's project to assess the work of all international
NGOs in Rwanda is nearing completion.  We have seen an early draft
of their report which takes a decidedly negative tone.  NGOs are
criticised for being wasteful, for not achieving their stated
objectives, and for working outside of the government structures,
particularly communal and provincial authorities.  Individual
NGOs are dealt with in detail in the report.  However, the quality
of the criticism is not always very high.  One NGO running a centre
for unaccompanied children is criticised for not sending a child
to a specialist hospital in USA where he could have undergone
intensive heart surgery.
<P>
The committee which produced the report contains a representative
from UNDP and from one international NGO.  However, the process
of research and reporting was largely dominated by the official
Rwandese members of the committee.  Given the recent history of
expulsion of NGOs from their operations in Rwanda, there is some
concern over the use which the RPF government will make of such
a negative report.  Meanwhile <I>Eurostep</I>'s own position paper
on the Great Lakes crisis will shortly be released, following
official endorsement.

<html><head><title>British ODA - Aid for the former Yugoslavia</title><!!keys: ODA></head><body><img src="oda_pix/oda_logo.gif"><br><i>The material that follows has been provided by  <a href="oda_info.html">  Overseas Development Administration</a></i><hr><center><h2>UK BILATERAL HUMANITARIAN AID FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA</h2></center><h3>GENERAL</h3>Britain is the third largest donor of humanitarian aid to the former Yugoslavia and through the Overseas Development Administration (ODA) has contributed over £271 million so far in aid:  £136 million bilaterally and £135 million through the European Community (EC).  In addition, the RAF has taken part in the currently discontinued Sarajevo airlift and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Ministry of Defence contributions to the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) amount to £280 million.<p> Need is greatest in central Bosnia, where most of the fighting has taken place and around 2.7 million people are at risk.  The British bilateral aid programme aims to alleviate some of this suffering, by getting food and medical relief into the country and assisting with infrastructure and utilities works.<p>The ODA's bilateral aid consists of:<p><h3>DISTRIBUTION OF RELIEF</h3>An ODA fleet of over 30 British trucks, plus drivers and support staff, is operating as the largest contributor to the UNHCR road delivery operation, running convoys to Sarajevo and other areas, when possible.  The fleet plays a vital role in the delivery of relief supplies, particularly during suspensions of the airlift. Working from bases in Zagreb, Zenica and Metkovic, the ODA civilian drivers have braved shelling and gunfire to get aid through to central Bosnia and UN-protected areas.  So far over 2,060 ODA convoys have delivered over 152,000 tonnes of supplies. The ODA also manages a vehicle workshop at Metkovic for UNHCR which is one of the main centres for distribution operations to central Bosnia, including Sarajevo.<p>The ODA operated an Ilyushin-76 aircraft from Ancona in Italy as part of the UNHCR airlift to Sarajevo.  It delivered over 15,000 tonnes in over 450 flights.<p><h3>POWER</h3>The ODA is undertaking a £13.0 million programme to restore basic electricity supplies in central Bosnia.  ODA engineers have made vital repairs to power stations and transmission lines and maintained coal output to fire the power stations to provide electricity for local communities.  Maintaining power supplies has been made difficult by fighting and deliberate blocking of essential spare parts for repair work.<p><h3>DIRECT SUPPLIES</h3>The ODA has provided supplies such as winter stoves for the RedÊCross, sleeping bags, Land-Rovers - including armoured LandRovers for Sarajevo - and warehouse equipment.<p> High protein biscuits worth more than £6 million have been donated to the World Food Programme's supplementary feeding plan which targets particularly vulnerable groups such as small children, pregnant women and the elderly.<p><h3>EXPERTS AND TECHNICIANS</h3>Nearly £4 million has been spent on experts for UNHCR including:<ul><li>radio operators, convoy fitters, telecommunications experts and logisticians working for UNHCR throughout Bosnia and Croatia;<li>interpreters for the relief experts and road convoys.</ul><h3>EMERGENCY ENGINEERING UNIT (EEU)</h3>Originally part of the European Union Task Force, the EEU has been an independent programme since August 1993 and employs 46 engineers, technicians and support staff.  The unit has completed over 500 infrastructure and public utilities repair projects, from district heating systems and bridge repairs, to vehicle maintenance, refuse collection services and even stray dog catching.<p><h3>SARAJEVO GAS PROJECT</h3>War damage to gas pipes and home-made heating installations in Sarajevo have resulted in over 60,000 homes that are vulnerable to gas explosions.  The ODA has a team of gas engineers with specialist equipment repairing the system and training local staff.<p><h3>MEDICAL SUPPLIES AND HEALTH CARE</h3>The ODA is the largest donor in the medical sector, contributing £15 million in medical aid, including over £7 million in medical supplies, £3 million in experts and £3 million in grants to medical NGOs. Among the experts have been trauma specialists, brain surgeons, plastic surgeons, pediatricians, nurses, hospital engineers and logisticians.  For the rehabilitation of Sarajevo's health service and two main hospitals, the ODA funded 'Operation Phoenix', a health programme that provided visiting teams of up to 15 specialists at a time for emergency work and in areas like reconstructive plastic surgery, training and health service management.<p>The ODA has also funded the emergency evacuation of urgent medical cases.  ODA's substantial programme of medical aid within Bosnia remains the priority.  The ODA also gives assistance for local pharmaceutical production and packaging.<p>  <h3>WINTER SHELTER</h3>Winter shelter has been provided in central Bosnia for up to 20,000 refugees at a cost of £2.5 million.  An ODA team identified where help could best be provided and the vitally needed shelter and sanitation facilities were constructed in and around Zenica.  In addition ODA is funding NGOs such as ScottishÊEuropean Aid who are providing roofing tiles to assist with the repair of damaged homes.<p><h3>NGO PROJECTS</h3>The ODA sponsors the work of many non-governmental organisations like Oxfam, Save the Children and Marie Stopes International in social programmes such as trauma counselling, winter clothes distribution and family tracing.  Smaller specialist agencies, like War Child and Feed the Children, are also funded to run projects such as mobile bakeries and orphanage repairs.<p><h3>MACEDONIA</h3>£4 million has been spent on emergency assistance to Macedonia of which about £1.7 million has been provided for medical supplies urgently needed by the Ministry of Health.  For example, existing stocks of insulin were virtually exhausted in the Republic.<p><h3>AIRDROPS</h3>£600,000 for food supplies as the UK's contribution to the USAF airdrop operation.<p>  <h3>SUPPORT FOR EUROPEAN UNION INITIATIVES</h3>The ODA has also organised and supported several EU initiatives:<ul><li>   taking the lead in establishing and heading the EU Task        Force;<li>	providing thirteen British EU task force engineers to repair vital public utilities, including water supplies, district heating and sanitation in central Bosnia;  <li>	funding the Dame Warburton investigation into rape and other abuses against women. The ODA is the major EU contributor to the women's support groups and counselling programme run by Marie Stopes International (MSI), and the reproductive health care programme implemented by WHO and MSI;<li>	repairing a major bridge between the east and west sides of Mostar;<li>	providing specialists to the European Union Administration of Mostar to repair infrastructure;<li>	providing financial and technical assistance for the WEU policing initiative in Mostar.</ul><p><h3>RECONSTRUCTION</h3>In March 1994, a joint UK/US mission of 20 experts carried out an assessment of Sarajevo's infrastructure and social services. Full reconstruction will depend firstly on a sustained peace and then substantial financial support from the international community. <p>The ODA committed £5 million to the rehabilitation of several sectors identified as priorities by the mission.  These include: the health service, electrical power, gas supplies, central heating, hygiene and waste disposal, public transportation and rail transport.<p><h3>REFUGEE CAMP - TUZLA</h3>The ODA has reacted swiftly to the current crisis in Tuzla, where the refugees from Srebrenica have gathered.  We have made available to UNHCR all our resources and manpower currently in the former Yugoslavia, to be used as they think best.<p>We have also contributed over £300,000 in grants towards Oxfam's and the British Red Cross' emergency relief programmes in the Tuzla refugee camp.<p><h3>AID STATISTICS</h3>Bilateral allocations consist of:<p><pre>Cash Grants to UN Organisations	             	         £34.50mCash Grant to IOM for refugee transport- for up to 1000 detainees and families			 £ 0.50mWinter Shelter - building rehabilitation                 £ 2.50mto accomodate 20,000 peoplePower supplies - maintaining coal production and         £13.00m repairing power stations						Direct supplies - vehicles, stores,                      £ 1.50msleeping bags, etc							Experts - logisticians, radio operators,                 £ 6.0mmanagers, etc - includes satellite communicationscostsSarajevo Airlift                                         £ 3.50mRoad convoys - 50 plus trucks and support                £27.50mstaff - includes warehouse operationsMedical assistance - supplies, doctors and               £19.60memergency and family evacuations - includesemergency aid to Macedonia			     						Grants to non-governmental organisations                 £ 9.90m-  Red Cross, Oxfam, etc						Agricultural support - seeds for central                  £ 0.60m Bosnia									Contribution to US air drops - 364,000 meals,ration packs, high nutrition biscuits, etc		 £ 0.60mEU initiatives - EU task force engineers,                £ 2.70mWarburton mission, rape and women's supportcounselling, EU administration of Mostar, etc	UK/US Initiative in Sarajevo                             £ 5.50mEmergency Engineering Unit - Central Bosnia              £ 8.10m						</pre>(Also contributed £6.5m worth of high nutrition biscuits not included in these figures because donated from MAFF surplus stock)<p>TOTAL BILATERAL ASSISTANCE - 					£136.00m<br>							                                                    UK SHARE OF EU AID - 					 	     £135.00m<p><h3>TOTAL UK ASSISTANCE  -                		    £271.00m</h3><hr>©Copyright: ODA, July 1995<hr><a href="index.html"><img src="oda_pix/oda_logo2.gif"> ODA Home Page</a> <hr></body></html>

<html><head><title>NI Issue 269 - Back to the Future</title><!!keys: New Internationalist+technology+NI+energy+buildings></head><body><h3><img width=100 height=88 border=1 src="ni_pix/nilogo.gif">New Internationalist Issue 269</h3><br><i>The material that follows has been provided by  <a href="NIinfo.html">  New Internationalist</a></i><hr><center><img width=478 height=30 alt="Techno Passion" src="ni_pix/269_technopassion.gif"></center><p><font size=+1><i>New technology arouses strong passions.  Will it solve our problems, create new ones or make a very little difference at all? Here's a view or two on the technology that's likely to be shaping human life in the year 2025...</font></i><p><hr width=75%><center><h2>EASY DRIVING </h2></center><img width=152 height=113 align=right hspace=10 src="ni_pix/269_h2.gif">Lean, clean, lightweight vehicles powered by hydrogen or electricity and which can drive themselves will get the 2025 traveller from A to B. Hydrogen cars have already been developed by several companies and vehicles can be equipped with sensors to monitor the road and surrounding vehicles. The'driver' will be able to sit back and read a book while a computer accelerates, breaks and steers. A single lane of an automated highway could carry at least 6,000 vehicles per hour, three times more than a conventional highway. Accidents would be reduced by at least half. Fuel-saving initiatives -like car pooling and fast tracks for cars with four or more passengers - already exist and could be extended. The gas-guzzling, fossilfuel burning vehicles that wreaked environmental havoc in the twentieth cewntury will be consigned to the museum.<p><img width=92 height=96 align=left hspace=10 src="ni_pix/269_grumpy.gif"><i>Fat chance! If motor companies already have the technology for eco-friendly vehicles why aren't they making them? 'cos it's more profitable not to change. They'll use fossil fuel till world resources run dry! And by then we can say goodbye to the ozone layer....</i><hr width=80%><br clear=left><center><h2>FRIENDLY BUILDINGS </h2></center><img width=111 height=95 align=right hspace=10 src="ni_pix/269_happy.gif">The buildings in which the 2025 citizen will live and work are likely to be eco-friendly and quiet. Reflectors, skylights and high-tech systems that pipe sunlight deep inside will reduce the need for artificial lights. The sun will be the main source of energy. Electricity will be produced by solar photo-voltaic cells, integrated into facades or roofs. People will be able to buy power from the local utility and sell power back to it, depending on need and the time of day. Super-insulated buildings will be able to heat themselves, making use of waste heat from occupants, lights and appliances. Simple remedies will make a comeback: like planting vegetation around buildings to retain heat in the winter and cool in the summer.<p><img width=97 height=90 align=left hspace=10 src="ni_pix/269_unhappy.gif"><i>Excuse me, but how are homeless people in Bombay, Manila, London or New York going to benefit from your lovely eco-friendly architecture? Perhaps the arches will have eco-friendly under-bellies? Perhaps the 2025 street will have plusher gutters?</i><hr width=80%><br clear=left><center><h2>SMART INFORMATION</h2></center><img width=98 height=91 align=right hspace=10 src="ni_pix/269_happy2.gif">There will be a worldwide, broadband network of networks based on fibre optics. All kinds of communication -face to face, voice to voice, person to data, and data to data -will be available to any place at any time from anywhere. Education on a worldwide basis will be at a higher level and more accessible. Hand-held computers will be the norm. Money in the form of physical currency will have long been replaced by'smart' cards. Communications vocabulary will be part of the language as people'televote','teleshop','telework', tele-everything and mind their 'netiquette' during virtual encounters. Crime will be increasingly sophisticated, economic and computer-based.<p><img width=98 height=91 align=left hspace=10 src="ni_pix/269_screwy.gif"><i>And what about direct human contact? What about maintaining real, physical communities? Are we all going to be E-dropping, E-mail-swapping computer nerds, surfing in cyberspace instead of spending time on our real relationships, in our real communities? And is everyone going to have equal access to this information? Pull the other one!</i><hr width=80%><br clear=left><center><h2>DIET FOR HEALTH</h2></center><img width=128 height=93 align=right hspace=10 src="ni_pix/269_chopsticks.gif">Genetic engineering will have had a profound effect on medicine. By 2025 all human ailments that have a genetic link will be identified and mapped. Direct targeted interventions for disease control will be the norm. But controversy is likely to rage over whether genetic engineering should be used to change or'enhance' people's capacities, and those in favour will be up against the powerful holistic medicine movement. Foods for human consumption could be more diverse as a result of agricultural genetics, with crop plants developed so that each part is usable. But the prospect of dangerous, genetically-engineered organisms being accidentally released into the environment is a hazard 2025 citizens will have to live with. In the richer countries vegetarianism will ahve become the norm - for health, environmental and ethical reasons. For carnivores with a conscience, 'Nanotechnology' will have provided the answer: by redesigning the cellular structures it will be possible to turn hay into steak without involving a cow.<p><img width=92 height=96 align=left hspace=10 src="ni_pix/269_grumpy.gif"><i>'Controversy is likely to rage'. Too bloody right! What multinational corporations are going to control biotechnology? And who is going to control them? They are already richer and more powerful than national governments. And now we are going to let them take control of the genetic stuff of life itself? You can keep your veggie beef, thankyou!</i><hr width=80%><br clear=left> <center><h2>SENSITIVE CITIES</h2></center> <img width=98 height=91 align=right hspace=10 src="ni_pix/269_happy2.gif">The city of 2025 could be'sensitive', almost biological. Built into its structures -bridges, roads, buildings -will be'sensors' that respond to changes in heat, light, noise or electromagnetic fields. A bridge, for example, would have sensitive fibre'nerves' that could feel structural deterioration, cry out a warning and even take reparative action. It might be made of self-repairing concrete, for example. Noise pollution could also be combated. As sound travels in waves it could be cancelled out by superimposing on it an identical wave of opposite phase. Acoustic wallpaper could cut out the sound of noisy neighbours. This will be useful as the cities of 2025 are likely to follow the traditional European models with high densities combined with plenty of green space rather than the low-density, automobile-dependent sprawling cities of US and Australia.<p><img width=98 height=91 align=left hspace=10 src="ni_pix/269_screwy.gif"><i>So are we to get our bridges and walls to have our feelings for us as we live in our quiet, solipsistic cocoons, oblivious to neighbours and other'disturbances'? What if the neighbours are calling out for help -or warning us of danger? Is the artificial to become more biological, at the cost of the biological (us humans, for example) becoming artificial?</i><hr width=80%><br clear=left><p><center><h2>NATURAL ENERGY</h2></center><img width=111 height=95 align=right hspace=10 src="ni_pix/269_happy.gif">Wind farms and solar ranches will appear in the landscapes of the 2025 world. The Thar Desert in India, the Sahara in North Africa, La Ventosa in Mexico and the US Great Plains will be ideal locations. The electricity they generate will be fed into grids when demand is high and used to produce hydrogen when low. But most people will produce their own energy locally, using photo-voltaic cells. Hydrogen will replace natural gas as supplies of the latter level off or are kept in the ground to reduce carbon emissions. Hydrogen is light, abundant and when combined with oxygen to produce heat or electricity the main emission is water. The technology to produce hydogen -electrolosis- has been around since the nineteenth century. By 2025 the idea that energy should be produced from non-renewable and pollution sources will be anathema.<p><img width=97 height=90 align=left hspace=10 src="ni_pix/269_unhappy.gif"><i>What about the resistance? Governments and industry have such a huge vested interest in using non-renewable energy sources that they subsidize these to the tune of billions. And if households do generate their own energy, what's that going to do to energy jobs?</i><hr width=80%><p><br clear=left><center><h2>SAFE AND SOUND</h2></center> <img width=152 height=113 align=right hspace=10 src="ni_pix/269_h2.gif">Remote-sensing will warn of impending natural disasters, earthquakes, landslides and flooding. Worldwide weather reporting will be routine, detailed and accurate. Biotechnology -which will be a booming industry by 2025 -may be used to help break down the awful residue of hazardous wastes left by the twentieth century. 'Smart' non-lethal weapons that halt aggressive acts will have replaced lethal weapons for peace-keeping and policing.<p><img width=98 height=91 align=left hspace=10 src="ni_pix/269_screwy.gif"><i>Biotechnology will be a source of danger -not security! Sure, non-lethal weapons are nicer -but there will always be people wanting to use lethal ones. The real issue is: what are we going to do about inequalities of power? What are we going to do about a worldwide culture of militarism? What answers has technology got for  that, I ask you?!!!</i><hr width=80%><br clear=left><p>©Copyright: New Internationalist 1995<hr><a href="index.html"><img width=35 height=30 src="ni_pix/nilogo3.gif"> NI Home Page</a> <a href="269contents.html"><img width=45 height=60 src="ni_pix/269_coverthumb.gif"> Issue 269</a><hr></body></html>

OutThere news service's guest today is SarbastHussain, London spokesman of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK),one of the two main Kurdish groups which have controlled much ofnorthern Iraq since the end of the Gulf War in 1991.</P><P>PUK forces were driven out of the city of Arbil on Saturday(August 31) by Iraqi government forces supporting the rival KurdishDemocratic Party (KDP), sparking an international crisis. The UnitedStates launched cruise missiles against Iraqi military targets topunish Baghdad for intervening in the Kurdish area, which isprotected by a UN-sponsored "no fly zone".</P><P>Mr Hussain, thank you for being with us today. First of all, wewould like to ask what are your personal feelings are about thisrenewed conflict in Kurdistan?</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain:</B> My personal feeling is that we are facinggreat human suffering which is hard to tolerate in modern life. Bythis I mean the suffering of nearly 28 million Kurds worldwide. Ifeel that the Kurdish people are now living a historic moment - thesafe haven is challenged, the United Nations resolution 688 is beingviolated, and I believe something should be done about it.</P><P><B>Starr Baroth:</B> Why in your opinion do you believe Saddam hasmade this move against the Kurds?</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain:</B> Mainly for two reasons. First, he istesting now and then the Western appetite to protect the Kurdishpeople in Iraq. Secondly, it is of his character to be in the newsand be seen that he is doing something, no matter what it is. Hewants to be seen in charge at least in the eyes of his own oppressedpeople in Iraq.</P><P><B>Peter Thompson, contributing writer to "Kurdish Life" in NewYork:</B> What was the quid pro quo for Talabani to act as thego-between between Washington and Tehran over the past year?</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain:</B> I'm not clear about the question.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> I think Peter is suggesting that the PUK hasbeen acting as a messenger between the United States and the Iraniangovernment.</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain: </B>What's wrong with that?</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> If it is true that the PUK has been playingthis role, what is the benefit to the PUK of doing so?</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain:</B> I asked you to rephrase and explain yourquestion more. But if you are suggesting that Mr Talabani is actingas a messenger between Washington and Tehran, I'd like you to explainwhat sort of messenger do you mean? Do you mean a negotiating thirdparty between them? If that's what you mean, I don't see anythingwrong with that. Iran is a neighbouring country to Kurdistan. It hasan important role in the area, this cannot be denied. We needfriendly relations with all our neighbouring countries, apart fromthe Iraqi regime. I say apart from the Iraqi regime because he isguilty of killing a quarter of a million Kurds using the nastiestweapons and methods and because we are directly affected by hisoppression.</P><P><B>Peter Thomson: </B>Mr Hussain, you have suggested that theIraqi people should be protected in Northern Iraq but Talabani (PUKleader) has worked with Tehran to shell and attack the Iranian DPIKin northern Iraq.</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain:</B> There have been limited acts of violationby Iran inside the Kurdish area. We condemned it, we still do, butthis has never been approved or orchestrated by the PUK.</P><P><B>Starr Baroth:</B> Do you agree with how President Clinton hasreacted to this crisis by having the US bomb them?</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain:</B> As one step a a series of steps, yes. ButI believe there are other measures to follow. First is to expand theno-fly zone in the north southwards to the 34th parallel to cover theprovince of Sulaimaniya with nearly a million population. Secondly,there has to be a clear definition of the safe haven and its bordersso that Saddam Hussein will not exploit any ambiguity about it</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> The PUK's leader, Jalal Talabani, warned thatthe PUK would seek help from Iran if the US did not intervene againstthe Iraqi government. Now that the US has intervened militarily, willthe PUK stop any dealings with Iran?</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain:</B> We are not only after a tokenintervention. Our aim is a secure reassurance to the Kurdish peopleto lead a normal life. We basically demand arrangements that willmake the Kurdish people believe again that a safe haven really meansSAFE HAVEN... I have to say that this latest event has made a largenumber of Kurds suspicious and worried about the West and theirpromise of protection to the Kurds. Their confidence has to beregained again.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> What arrangements would satisfy you?</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain:</B> A good question.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle</B>: But what would be required - Western groundtroops?</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain:</B> Ultimately, something that would reassureus that Saddam would not find it possible to decide at night and sendhis troops the day after to terrorise millions of people. Thisdemands creating some kind of balance of power. Kurdistan needsdefence weapons against tanks and armoured vehicles, not necessarilyWestern personnel, but hardware, or a more determined signal toSaddam - such as expanding the no-fly zone further south, lifting thesanctions against the Kurdish people to allow them to import thetools that let them rebuild the infrastructure in the country. It isvery ironic to find that while the Kurdish people are victims ofSaddam Hussein, they are now being punished by these sanctions for areason that is of Saddam Hussein's making.</P><P><B>Mark Lynas, News Editor of OneWorld Online:</B> How can theKurds ever succeed in establishing an independent homeland if theycan never sort out their differences?</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain:</B> There ARE differences and there have beendifferences in every nation. These differences do not make usinferior to any other sovereign nation However it might be bad luckto have a faction, and a corrupt ruling family of that faction, thathave chosen to prefer Saddam over another rival faction from theirown people. To me, this is the same as asking Hitler to protect theJews from Hitler himself. What the KDP leaders have done is an act oftreason. They represent themselves only and the Kurdish people,including their ordinary members, have nothing to do with them. Thisdoes not mean that the Kurdish people do not deserve sovereignty. Iwould like to add something here. You can read of many peoples'revolutions that had to fight against an occupier as well as aninternal mercenary force - for example Vietnam, China, Algeria etc.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> In the past, the PUK also had dealings with theBaghdad government. Why is what the KDP is doing different?</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain:</B> It is very, very different. First, we haveALWAYS negotiated with Baghdad by sending delegates to them orreceiving their delegates and TALKING. We believe in negotiations. Weprefer it to killing.. What makes this act of treason by the KDP sodifferent is not the negotiation, it's the fact that they haveAPPEALED to Saddam Hussein to come and 'liberate' Arbil for them.They have shown no agreement, there have been no talks, no assurancefor the Kurdish people. All they have done is to bring back, with noreturn at all, the tyrant against whom the Kurdish people have beenfighting for 23 years.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Richard Trafton has a question about theAssyrians in Kurdistan. What is the PUK's position on the Assyrians?Richard has a report that a rocket fired from a PUK position hit achurch in or near the village of Diana and killed two clergymenyesterday.</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain:</B> Assyrians are the genuine original peopleof Mesopotamia along with Kurds, long before Arabs came. They havecontributed to the civilisation of Mesopotamia. They have every rightto be safe and proud of their country. However, as a minority,regrettably, they have become victim of the big fire in the area. Thetragic incident you mention should not have occurred, but civilians,clergy, mosques and churches are destroyed in wars and this is thenasty part of the tragedy of every war.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Would the PUK be prepared to negotiate with theBaghdad government at present?</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain:</B> NO. He has scarred UN resolution 688. Hehas up to this moment got away with violating international law.</P><P><B>Peter Thompson:</B> Is there an agreement between the PUK andTehran in assisting the destroying of the DPIK HQ in northern Iraq?And what role does Washington play?</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain:</B> There is no agreement between the PUK andIran. The PUK has never and will not interfere or facilitateinterference of neighbouring countries. But we plead to our brothersin the other parts of Kurdistan, not to exploit the safe haven as abase to launch an attack against their own regimes.</P><P><B>Mark Lynas:</B> I don't think Mr Hussain answered my questionabout the possibility of eventual unity among the Kurdish people.Just calling the opposing faction 'traitors' isn't going to end thedifferences surely?</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain: </B>We have no problem with KDP members andsupporters, the problem is with the heads. We are prepared to solvethe problems with the KDP after the heads are punished.</P><P><B>Starr Baroth:</B> Other than being uplifted in the eyes of hisfollowers, what other benefit does Saddam have to gain by thesecurrent acts of brutality?</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain:</B> It's part of Saddam's personality to havedifferent definitions to the terms 'gain' and 'loss' to what ordinarypeople like me and you have for these words. There was nothing to begained by invading Kuwait and losing the sovereignty and revenue ofIraq for years to come, but he did it. There are personal drives forhim that are different from ordinary civilised leaders of nations.</P><P><B>Peter Thompson:</B> Mr Hussain, do you know the precise formulaof the recent UN oil deal in splitting the proceedings between PUKand KDP (if it goes ahead)?</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain:</B> I do not have this exact detail, but theUnited Nations signed with Iraqi delegates in New York to sell $2billion worth of oil over six months. It was meant that the Kurdsshould have their share. I have no more details than that,unfortunately.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Selim Guncer asked, so I presume the PUK isagainst the operation of the PKK for example?</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain:</B> We are against making the safe haven abase for military actions against any of the neighbouring countries.The area simply cannot risk it. We ask all the faithful Kurds inKurdistan to understand the sensitivity.</P><P><B>Starr Baroth:</B> And what would that risk be? If you couldclarify?</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain:</B> Last year, for example, the PKK gaveTurkey the excuse to overrun villages in Iraqi Kurdistan.</P><P><B>Selim Guncer:</B> Mr Hussain, there is a big outcry in theTurkish community against Operation Provide Comfort, because it isbasically allowing a "safe haven" for the PKK. The PUK shoulddemonstrate that PKK's actions can not be tolerated.</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain:</B> At this very moment, there is no member orbase of the PKK in the safe haven and we have asked them to respectthis demand.</P><P><B>Peter Thompson:</B> Mr Hussain, did you sit in the recentmeetings in London with the US? And what was resolved in that meetingbetween the KDP and the PUK?</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain:</B> These meetings were interrupted suddenlyby Saddam's onslaught on Arbil. That was at the introductorymeetings, before any serious matter was discussed. These talks wereencouraged by the US. However, it appeared that while responding toit, the KDP had another agenda. They simply walked out.</P><P><B>Peter Thompson:</B> Are you receiving custom tax from theTurkey-Iraqi border controlled by Barzani; what percentage; and isthis the basis for disagreement with the KDP, excluding recentevents.</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain:</B> No we do not get any percentage, becausethe area has been controlled by the KDP for over three years. I haveto admit that this is part of the problems between the KDP and thePUK simply because the revenue of these customs is nearly $20 millionper month, which we believe would help substantially for thereconstruction of Kurdistan. However, the KDP have confiscated itsince, and didn't hand it over to the democratically electedparliament, in which they had half the seats.</P><P><B>Richard Trafton:</B> If the PUK were to receive Americanassistance as you desire it (troops equipment, etc) would you attemptto create a separate state from Iraq? Reestablish Kurdistan?</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain:</B> Our aim at this moment is a federal Iraqin which we are treated equally. If this is too much for successivegovernments in Iraq, a separate Kurdish state will be inevitable. Weare not proud to be part of a country in which we haven't seenanything but oppression, discrimination, and destruction of theculture, language and Kurdish heritage. We are, however, happy tolive with our brothers in Iraq as equal citizens, no less.</P><P><B>Selim Guncer:</B> How can you achieve this goal when even theUS is refraining from toppling Saddam? A weak Iraq ruled by a madmanseems to serve U.S. interests better.</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain: </B>You are right in the scenario you quote,but peoples have GAINED sovereignty not offered to them. We believethere will be a day that the world community finds it unacceptable toturn a blind eye on millions of people who are so willing to be free.</P><P><B>Peter Thompson:</B> Mr Hussain, does the INC exist any longergiven recent events?</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain:</B> Yes, the INC is an elected organisation.But sadly, they encountered huge losses in numbers after the treasonof KDP leadership in Arbil these past few days. But as a politicalorganisation, the INC is still a hope for the Iraqi people. They haveto take sides in this conflict and they have condemned the KDPbitterly and made sacrifices towards a democratic Iraq.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Thank you very much, Mr Hussein, for joining usthis evening. This crisis looks far from over. Iraqi President SaddamHussein has ordered his armed forces to shoot at Western planesenforcing the "no-fly zones" and there are reports of fightingcontinuing in Kurdistan itself. We're hoping to have a session with aKDP representative tomorrow at the same time - check on our Web pageat http://www.oneworld.org/outthere/ot_debate.html tomorrow fordetails.</P><P><B>Sarbast Hussain:</B> I JUST HAVE ONE THING TO SAY. I want tomeet the KDP representative tomorrow and I will certainly do my best.</P><P>(Ends)</P><P><HR><A HREF="ot_debate.html"><IMG SRC="ot_pix/ot_logo.gif"ALT="OutThere logo" WIDTH=83 HEIGHT=30 ALIGN=middle></A>Back to<A HREF="ot_debate.html">'How to take part'</A> ...

Despite their feuding, both parties have much thesame demands: they want the West, which gave them limited autonomyfrom the Baghdad government in 1991 by establishing a no-fly zoneover their mountainous area of northern Iraq, to go further and takeaction to ensure that the Kurds are free of Saddam Hussein forever.</P><P>"We are not disturbed at all by what happened," said<A HREF="kdp.html">Burhan Jaf of the KDP</A>, the party whichenlisted Saddam Hussein's help to oust the rival PUK from the city ofArbil on Saturday and so sparked this week's American strikes. "Wecontributed to bringing the Kurdish situation to the world again," hesaid. "The KDP felt that the Iranian threat has been neglected by ourWestern allies, and we are tired of regional intervention in ouraffairs, and yet there is no Western response to that."</P><P>For <A HREF="puk.html">Sarbast Hussain of the PUK</A>, similarly,a week at the top of the world's foreign affairs agenda was just thestart. Asked by Internet user Starr Baroth if he agreed withClinton's strikes, he replied: "As one step a a series of steps, yes.But I believe there are other measures to follow... Kurdistan needsdefence weapons against tanks and armoured vehicles, not necessarilyWestern personnel, but hardware, or a more determined signal toSaddam - such as expanding the no-fly zone further south, lifting thesanctions against the Kurdish people to allow them to import thetools that let them rebuild the infrastructure in the country."</P><P>Both sides said they were keen to take part in U.S.-sponsoredtalks, announced by State Department officials on Tuesday. They hadjust started to meet in the U.S. embassy in London last week when theoffensive by the KDP and the Iraqi army on Arbil happened.</P><P>Burhan Jaf said that the rival Kurdish parties agreed on manypolitical issues. Asked whether he supported Hussain's call for theno-fly zone to be extended south to the 34th parallel and for the UNsanctions on Iraq to be lifted for the Kurds, he said: "Yes, I agree.I would add that we agree on many points, it's just unfortunate thatwe fight each other."</P><P>During two hours of discussions on the Internet, the officialsalso faced close questioning by users from Turkey, the United Statesand elsewhere on the relations of their two parties with Iran and theanti-Turkish Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK), and their own disputesover money and power-sharing arrangements.</P><P>For fuller details, please see our edited transcripts of thediscussion with <A HREF="puk.html">Sarbast Hussein</A> and<A HREF="kdp.html">Burhan Jaf.</A></P><P><B><HR></B></P><P ALIGN=CENTER>Reporting by John West.

The city lies in a UN "no-fly zone" imposed on Kurdishareas of northern Iraq after the Gulf War in 1991 to protect Kurdsfrom the Baghdad government, and the United States reacted bylaunching cruise missile attacks on Iraqi military installations.</P><P><A HREF="kopietz.html">Hans-Heino Kopietz</A>, a political riskanalyst who has worked with the International Institute of StrategicStudies, said: "The Americans had known for at least the last year,that is the summer of 1995 until now, and I stress at least, aboutcontacts between (KDP leader Massoud) Barzani and (Iraq's DeputyPrime Minister) Tareq Aziz. I know personally the go-between inthis."</P><P>He was speaking the day before Britain's Independent newspaperpublished what it said were extracts of leaked correspondence betweenthe KDP and Washington in recent weeks.</P><P>Kopietz, who visited Kurdistan earlier this year and knows IraqiKurdish leaders from all factions, also predicted that inter-Kurdishfighting, intense interest by Iraq's neighbours Turkey and Iran, anda renewed Iraqi government presence in northern Iraq could eventuallycreate another refugee exodus like the one in 1991 which originallyprovoked the Gulf War allies to make the area a "safe haven".</P><P>"The Kurdish population is so frightened and so insecure," saidKopietz, who in 1990 advised Kurdish parties on establishing a systemof parliamentary democracy. "We will have another crisis, humanrights crisis, if the Americans will push the confrontation with ArabIraq further... The Kurds will flee again and the Kurds will yetagain suffer but this will not only be due to Western powers but toKurdish leaders."</P><P>The picture that emerged that from three Internet discussionsorganised by OutTherethis week was of a local conflict that suddenlyspiralled out of control when the KDP tried to force Washington'shand by appealing to Iraq to enter the no-fly zone.</P><P>The KDP's <A HREF="kdp.html">Burhan Jaf</A> said on Wednesday thatthe party was "not disturbed at all" by the crisis because "wecontributed in bringing the Kurdish situation to the world again". Hesaid the two Kurdish factions agreed on many points and the KDP waswilling to take part in US-sponsored peace talks. His rival,<A HREF="puk.html">Sarbast Hussein</A> of the PUK, appealed onTuesday for the West to extend the no-fly zone further south and liftthe UN economic sanctions on Iraq for the Kurdish areas. Jaf said heagreed with the demands.</P><P>But now that the Iraqi government has re-established a presenceinside Kurdistan, it may be difficult for the United States torestore the largely independent administration the Kurds had enjoyedunder Western protection. Hussain's call for the leaders of the KDPto be "punished" before a full reconciliation can be reached betweenthe two parties does not bode well for any peace talks.</P><P>Answering a question from an Internet user called Pushdaree, Jafsaid the KDP was happy to restrict its gains to the city of Arbil andwould not extend the fighting further south to the PUK stronghold ofSulaimaniya. But there are already reports of fresh fighting outsideArbil and Kopietz estimated that although Iraq has now withdrawn itsuniformed troops, it will have left behind a heavy contingent ofintelligence officers who will now fan out across the autonomousareas to reestablish Baghdad's influence.</P><P>For full details, please see the transcripts of OutThere's livediscussions with <A HREF="puk.html">Sarbast Hussein</A>,<A HREF="kdp.html">Burhan Jaf</A> and<A HREF="kopietz.html">Hans-Heino Kopietz</A>.</P><P><B><HR></B></P><P ALIGN=CENTER>Reporting by John West.

Fightingbetween the two groups has sparked an international crisis. Iraqigovernment forces invited by the KDP drove the rival Patriotic Unionof Kurdistan (PUK) out of the city of Arbil on Saturday. The UnitedStates responded by launching cruise missiles against Iraqi militarytargets to punish Baghdad for intervening in the Kurdish area, whichis protected by a UN-sponsored "no fly zone".</P><P>Mr Jaf, What is the latest news from Kurdistan? Is fighting stillgoing on, and are Iraqi troops still involved?</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf:</B> No, there is no fighting for the last 72 hoursbetween the KDP and the PUK. The fighting took only 10 hours andafter that the city is totally in control of the KDP. The city isnormal, people are back to work as normal. There is not a singleIraqi troop in Arbil. As far as we know, the Iraqis have gone back totheir previous line.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Outside Arbil, though, there are reports thatthe Iraqi forces are shelling Chamchamal on the road to Sulaymaniyah.</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf: </B>I cannot confirm this information but Iwouldn't be surprised. I would add they shell this city every yearthree or four times. Since 1992, Chamchamal has been shelled severaltimes a year. IT'S NOTHING NEW.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> But it would mean Iraqi forces are still inaction inside Kurdish territory in support of the KDP.</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf:</B> There is no Iraqi support for the KDP. We don'thave any political alliance with the Iraqi regime. As far as we areconcerned, the Iraqis would be doing this for their own reasons.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> So it is not true that you appealed to theIraqi government for help against the PUK?</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf:</B> We certainly took advantage of Iraqi shellingof part of Arbil because at the time, when the Iraqi army wasshelling, the KDP was storming the city, so indirectly, yes, webenefited. Certainly the government did it for three reasons. Firstto send a message to the PUK not to be too close to the Iranians;second, to test the ground, how would the Western allies react; andthird, to show the KDP that they were doing us a favour, takingaccount that the KDP called for help to counter the PUK and Iranianforces alliance against them</P><P><B>Richard Trafton: </B>Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) PresidentAbdullah Ocalan stated on the Kurdish satellite station MED-TV inEurope on September 1, 1996: "We hear that there is talk of autonomyfor the Kurds in northern Iraq [South Kurdistan], but this brings tomind the 1974 negotiations between the KDP and the regime in Baghdad.Those talks resulted in the inglorious end of Mullah Mustafa Barzani[founder of the KDP]. If his son, Mesut Barzani, plays the same game,he will meet the same end." </P><P>Does Mesut Barzani fears for his life at the hands of Saddam? </P><P><B>Burhan Jaf:</B> I don't think there will be at the moment anyscope for negotiation with the present regime or Iraq simply becauseit would have to be approved by the parliament and therepresentatives of the Kurdish people. We don't have politicalalignment with Baghdad. This is a one-off indirect militarycooperation and that's it. The KDP today responded to the US StateDepartment call and the British call for the US to play a role tobring the two factions to continue their talks, and Barzani todaysent a reply to Warren Christopher and the British as well that hewelcomed their statement and he would like a comprehensive peacesettlement with Talabani.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Is the KDP disturbed by the way in which theseevents have escalated into an international crisis?</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf:</B> We are not disturbed at all by what happened.We contributed to bringing the Kurdish situation to the world again,and that the KDP felt that the Iranian threat has been neglected byour Western allies, and we are tired of regional intervention in ouraffairs, and yet there is no Western response to that.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle: </B>What was the origin of this most recentconflict with the PUK?</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf:</B> The origin is that for the first time aregional power like Iran invaded the territory of the KDP, supportingmilitarily the PUK. This is the first time this happened.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> There have been reports for some time, though,about disputes between the PUK and KDP over money, specificallysharing the revenue from customs dues on the border with Turkey.</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf:</B> This is a naive and simple analysis to theconflict. It's not about money, it's about power, who takes control.</P><P><B>Siamak Rezaei:</B> Why don't you fight against Saddam whois/was killing the Kurds?</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf: </B>Politically, we are still fighting Saddam'sdictatorship. Militarily we cannot match his power, so we needsophisticated weapons in order to stand any chance.</P><P><B>Peter Thompson:</B> You mention Iran as "interfering', but whatis your response to claims Barzani has aided Turkey in fighting thePKK in northern Iraq?</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf:</B> Barzani and the KDP NEVER helped Turkey tofight the PKK in the way that the PUK is helping Iran against us.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> In 1992, the Kurdish people of northern Iraqheld elections and set up an autonomous administration. Protected byWestern air forces enforcing the "no fly zone", the Kurds achievedthe autonomy they had wanted for many years. Why did they allowdifferences between the PUK and the KDP to put all this at risk?</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf:</B> Simply - first, we wanted to run the regime bydemocratic means, while the other faction wanted to run it bydictatorship. The KDP resisted dictatorship by the PUK, who occupiedthe parliament twice, in 1993 and 1994. The other thing is we have tomention the outside powers, the Allies. There is no status for thisentity, the autonomous entity, in the international arena. There isno economic support for it and we became dependent on NGOs andsurrounded by hostile governments, and I'm afraid the West didn't doenough to consolidate this democratic experiment in 1992.</P><P><B>Peter Thompson:</B> Mr Jaf, why do you believe Washingtonallowed Talabani to win control of Arbil over a year ago in fighting. And, do you believe Washington favours Talabani?</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf:</B> No, I don't believe Washington favoursTalabani. I don't think they allowed them or anything like that. Itwas just a coup d'etat, never expected to be executed by a partner ingovernment, and the KDP at the time didn't wish to bring the conflictinto the cities.</P><P><B>Siamak Rezaei: </B>What  is the position of KDP towards Democratic Party of  Iranian Kurdistan? What has happened to thoseIranian Kurdish refugees in this conflict?</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf:</B> Our position about the Iranian Kurds is that wecondemn the Iranian government offensive against the DPIK inKoysenjaq. This was under the PUK control. Most of the refugees fledto Arbil. Some of them fled to Salahuddin, where they were welcomedby the KDP. We have a good relationship with them and we supporttheir struggle in Iranian Kurdistan. There were over 3,000 refugeesin that camp.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle: </B>When and where do you expect the KDP-PUK peacetalks organised by the US to take place?</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf:</B>  We hope the PUK will respond as soon aspossible. It depends on them.</P><P><B>Selim Guncer:</B> Latest news is that Turkish troops aregetting ready to strike PKK positions in northern Iraq, which iscontrolled by KDP.  What is the relation of KDP with the PKK?</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf:</B> We have no conflict with the PKK and we hopethat will remain for the future, although they have attacked us inthe past.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> What should the main points of a peaceagreement be?</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf:</B> It would be a return to the Drogheda agreement,establishing a new government and resuming parliament, and all thecustoms agreements would be back to the hands of the government. Wewould have a common policy towards our neighbours and the centralgovernment of Iraq.</P><P><B>Siamak Rezaei: </B>What is the relation  of your party with theparty headed by Adham Barzani. Isn't it supported by Iran?</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf: </B>They are another political party. We havenormal relations with them.</P><P><B>Pushdaree:</B> Mr Jaf, you mentioned that the fight is a caseof one party being in control. Since KDP took over Howlar, isSulaymaniyah the next target?</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf:</B> We have no intention to expand the fight beyondArbil and we hope that we could come to a peace settlement.</P><P><B>Selim Guncer:</B> What is your position on the actions of thePKK? By saying you have no conflict with them, do you support thePKK?  Since they can live in KDP-controlled areas, I am curious ofyour position.</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf:</B> I support the right of the Kurdish people intheir struggle in Turkey for their national and democratic rights andwe support all the political parties in Turkey which struggle toachieve this peacefully.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> How could a peace agreement on the lines youdescribed be guaranteed or enforced? Would it require outsidemonitors - if so, who would pay for them?</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf:</B> It would absolutely require outside monitors.</P><P><B>Peter Thompson:</B> Does Barzani and the KDP feel 'abandoned'by Washington? </P><P><B>Burhan Jaf:</B> That is our feeling, yes.</P><P><B>Siamak Rezaei:</B> What is your relationship with Iran?  PUKclaims that you have many centers in Iran and KDP representative wasin Iran for the anniversary of Khomeini's death.</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf: </B>We have an office in Tehran, certainly, but theother offices have been all closed don by the Iranian authorities.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Who do you think the outside monitors of apeace agreement should be?</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf:</B> Ideally it should be the United States, France,Britain, and certainly the U.N.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Do you agree with the PUK's call for the no-flyzone to be extended south to the 34th parallel and for the UNsanctions on Iraq to be lifted for the Kurds?</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf:</B> Yes, I agree. I would add that we agree on manypoints, it's just unfortunate that we fight each other.</P><P><B>Peter Thompson: </B>In today's Jerusalem Post, it suggestedTalabani was the "winner".  But, it also recalled Mustafa's closeties with Israel and asked how could "Hebrew-speaking" Barzaniassociated with Saddam.  Do you agree that Talabani was a "winner"?</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf:</B> Never, he's a short-sighted politician thinkingof himself first and the Kurdish people second.</P><P><B>Peter Thompson:</B> Is the KDP still involved with the INC?</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf:</B> Yes, Peter, we are still a member of the INC.</P><P><B>Siamak Rezaei:</B>  What has happened to the PUK  officialsarrested by PDK in  the conflict?</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf:</B> There are about 60, they are being well treatedand have been visited by the Red Cross. But I add it's difficult toknow exactly who they are and it's very confusing. For example,Talabani's wife was reported by the PUK to have been captured by usand they campaigned for her release, and after two days she turnedout to be in Sulaymaniyah with her husband.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Our time's up. Thank you very much, Mr Jaf, forjoining us. We heard the PUK side of events last night so it wasimportant that we had the chance to hear the KDP's position.</P><P><B>Burhan Jaf:</B> Thank you, goodnight.</P><P>(Ends)</P><P><HR><A HREF="ot_debate.html"><IMG SRC="ot_pix/ot_logo.gif"ALT="OutThere logo" WIDTH=83 HEIGHT=30 ALIGN=middle></A>Back to<A HREF="ot_debate.html">'How to take part'</A> ...

Today's guestis Hans-Heino Kopietz, one of the world's leading experts on Kurdishaffairs.</P><P>Mr Kopietz is an independent international and securityconsultant. He has had a long career as an academic and analyst. Hehas lectured at the American University of Beirut, Ahmadu BelloUniversity in Nigeria and the School of Oriental and African Studiesin London. He has worked as a researcher and analyst at theInternational Institute of Strategic Studies in London and as aninternational affairs and security consultant at Control Risk Group.</P><P>Mr Kopietz's work and study have involved him closely in Kurdistanfor the last 15 years. He knows the key players personally and metthem all earlier this year during a visit to Iraqi Kurdistan when hewas reporting for German television.</P><P>Mr Kopietz, why do you think the Kurdish Democratic Party took therisk of appealing for military help from the Iraqi government, whichit has been fighting on and off for nearly 30 years?</P><P><B>Heino Kopietz: </B>This was not a risk. The KDP had negotiatedsince August September 1995 with the central government of Iraq andMr Massoud Barzani's principle intention always has been to eliminatethe stronghold of the PUK led by Jalal Talabani. Without Iraqimilitary assistance he could not do it. Further, Mr Barzani was wellaware of the US policy. He had advised the United States nine daysbefore the Iraqis came into Arbil, and he was told that he would notin any way be bombarded by American aircraft. Instead the UnitedStates would give comfort to him and to Baghdad.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle: </B>Are you suggesting that the US connived inBarzani's action against the PUK, then?</P><P><B>Heino Kopietz: </B>Absolutely, absolutely.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle: </B>Why - because the PUK had invited Iraniansupport?</P><P><B>Heino Kopietz:</B> The Iranian political and military presenceis minimal. Ideologically and religiously, the Iranians have nevermade a big impact into Kurdistan because nearly 90 percent ofKurdistan is Sunni, but four or six percent are Christians andrelated faiths,and Iran doesn't have a chance of ever getting areligious foothold in Kurdistan. It's a question of the Iranianswanting to use political influence, which has nothing to do withreligion. It's a question of the PUK being identified as beingsupported by Iran. So I would say yes, that's why the Americanconnived at Barzani's action. But there are other reasons too. It'sbetter for America to have ONE leader of Kurdistan and they havedecided to nominate Barzani because the Barzani family has an oldname in the 20th century as leaders of Kurdistan. The Americans aremore comfortable with traditions and traditional authority.Talabaniis so-called 'progressive'. He originally was a communist, a radical.He's taciturn, unpredictable and vociferous. It's very difficult tonegotiate with Jalal and I have known him for many years. For anygovernment in the world it would be difficult to deal with himbecause he's a radical.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> So the KDP's action in Arbil had been preparedover many months, and the KDP appeal to Iraq was not a sudden act ofdesperation?</P><P><B>Heino Kopietz: </B>Indeed, it was not a sudden act ofdesperation. Barzani had an agreement with Mr Talabani since 1992 andthe proof of the pudding is that Mr Barzani agreed for the Iraqi oilminister to cross KDP-held territory in January 1996 for the expresspurpose to reopen the pipelines between Baghdad and Turkey. In returnfor this permission, Mr Barzani received at the minimum 18 armouredpersonnel carriers, unknown quantities of ammunition and someintelligent military personnel. I do not know what else he obtained.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle: </B>And the Americans knew about these contactsbetween the KDP and Baghdad?</P><P><B>Heino Kopietz:</B> Yes. The Americans had known for AT LEASTthe last year, that is the summer of 1995 until now, and I stress ATLEAST, about the contacts between Mr Barzani and Mr Tareq Aziz. Iknow personally the go-between in this. His meeting took place inFebruary 1996. And considering there is a station of some 50 CIAagents in Salahuddin, it would be almost criminal if they had notknown - a station that is 100 metres from Mr Barzani's compound.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle: </B>What was the benefit to the Iraqi government ofthe agreement with the KDP?</P><P><B>Heino Kopietz: </B>The benefit was very simple. It gave alicence under the cover of the KDP to reenter legitimately northernIraq above the 36th parallel.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> What sort of a person is Massoud Barzani?</P><P><B>Heino Kopietz:</B> Massoud Barzani, it must be remembered, isthe head and senior son of the legendary Mullah Barzani. He himselfis very quiet, a non-drinker, non-smoker. That is his outwardappearance. What he is in public is essentially a conspirator in thetradition of Kurdish politics. He himself had lived in Iran until1991. .. and he himself had to learn what he is leading. He was a manwho did not know his own people but had to learn very fast. He is avery shy man, a very elegant man in Kurdish terms, and importantly,he wears always traditional clothes, unlike Jalal Talabani. He alwayspresents himself as the leader of the traditional families ofKurdistan. His brother died at the end of the 80s and he inheritedthe mantle of Mullah Barzani. There are other sons from other women,but his mother is the one that counts and he inherited the mantlewhen his brother died.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> After the Gulf War ended in 1991 the Kurds wereenabled by the West to set up an autonomous administration with anelected parliament. Why do you think this experiment collapsed?</P><P><B>Heino Kopietz: </B>The Kurds are their own worst enemies.Indeed, the Kurds were given the chance to present themselves as aso-called democratic experiment and I was one of the advisers from1990 before the war in that experiment. There are deep-seatedconflicts within Kurdish society, you may call it tribal, religious,ideological differences, but the basic contest between Jalal Talabaniand Massoud Barzani is over money and power. It is very sad for me tosay that as one of those involved but the families of the leaders arenepotistic. Every single adviser to each leader are relatives and itis sad they could not produce a consensus. The basic problem is alack of institutions and that is the fault of the Iraqi politicalsystem.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> The KDP's Burhan Jaf said last night his partywanted a peace agreement with the PUK and a return to theparliamentary democracy set up after the Gulf War. Do you think thiscan be achieved, and if so, how?</P><P><B>Heino Kopietz:</B> Unfortunately the leaders persist in livingin a never-never land and have not yet been able to come out of theirmisperception of international politics. So there can be no return todemocracy. In fact democracy never really existed.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> The Turkish government said today that it wouldlike to establish a 'security zone' inside northern Iraq to preventcross-border attacks by the Turkish Kurds of the PKK. What is therelationship between the PKK and the Iraqi Kurdish groups?</P><P><B>Heino Kopietz:</B> The Turkish Kurdish problem is far removedfrom the Iraqi, Iranian and Syrian Kurds. The PKK under Mr Ocalan hastaken a very different route to autonomy, independence or whateveryou may want to call it. He has decided to take a violent course...Turkey looks at all Kurds as interrelated, as one ethnicgroup,therefore they see Kurds in Iraq, Iran and Syria as the same asthe PKK. The PKK's ties to Iraqi groups vary from time to time.Sometimes they're close to the PUK, sometimes to the KDP but they allfight each other. There are tactical alliances. It all depends on theregional political constellation at any one time.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> How will the Iraqi oil-for-food deal affect theKurds in northern Iraq? Which groups stand to benefit from it?</P><P><B>Heino Kopietz: </B>I will be very cynical. No group in Iraqwill benefit because all oil for food contracts will be delivered toTikrit. That's why the United States, Britain and many others areholding back. About 70 percent of all past humanitarian aid to Iraqalways ended up in the city of Tikrit, from where Saddam comes.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle: </B>Could you already see this crisis brewing whenyou visited Kurdistan earlier this year? What were the signs on theground then?</P><P><B>Heino Kopietz:</B> It became very clear to me as far back asJanuary 1995 when the PUK decided unilaterally to invade and adoptArbil. Later the fighting between these groups, be it for tribalreasons or ideological reasons, was a very clear sign. In January1996 it also became clear that the American confrontation with Iranwas heading towards a crescendo. We knew that the Kurds have been andwill be the football of Middle Eastern power struggles.Unfortunately, the Kurds permit themselves to be in that role.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle: </B>Now that Saddam's forces have been able toenter the Kurdish areas, do you think they will stay permanently? Forinstance, do you believe reports that Iraqi intelligence agents arestill in Arbil in force and likely to remain there?</P><P><B>Heino Kopietz:</B> First, Iraqi Arab intelligence agents alwayshave been in north Iraq. Second, if one has a division of uniformmilitary personnel of whatever number and size, then half of themwill be intelligence services. When the tanks and the uniformregiments return they will leave behind half of their men andequipment. There's no doubt that half of those who came in were leftbehind as intelligence. These men have very specific tasks, to rootout the opposition to the KDP, say PUK supporters, and in myknowledge there will be at least 2-5,000 intelligence officers in theKDP's regions in order to finish the PUK. The whole purpose of theexercise was to eliminate Jalal Talabani and his PUK and that theywill do now with a vengeance and great ruthlessness.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> How do you predict that the situation willdevelop over the next three to six months?</P><P><B>Heino Kopietz: </B>Kurdistan is a political vacuum right nowand it has been a vacuum for at least five years if not before. I'mnot a prophet, I cannot say what will happen. I can only say whatcould happen. Turkey and Iran both have strategic reasons to be inthe region. Iraq will resist this, and as a member of the UnitedNations, Saddam Hussein has every right to defend the territorialintegrity of Iraq. Yet it is very possible that Turkey and Iran willinterfere with this because they see the oil and gas advantages. Thegame is all about money and power in this region.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle: </B>Do you think there is a risk of a refugeecrisis like that of 1991 caused by the present conflict in Kurdistan?</P><P><B>Heino Kopietz: </B>The Kurdish population is so frightened andso insecure, the answer to your question is definitely yes. We willhave another crisis, human rights crisis, if the Americans will pushthe confrontation with Arab Iraq further... The Kurds will flee againand the Kurds will yet again suffer but this will not only be due toWestern powers but to Kurdish leaders.</P><P><B>Paul Eedle: </B>Thank you very much indeed, Mr Kopietz, forjoining OutThere today for this live interview.</P><P>(Ends)</P><P><HR><A HREF="ot_debate.html"><IMG SRC="ot_pix/ot_logo.gif"ALT="OutThere logo" WIDTH=83 HEIGHT=30 ALIGN=middle></A>Back to<A HREF="ot_debate.html">'How to take part'</A> ...

15.10.96.
<BR>
To the Manager of Guinness.
<P>
My name is Zoe Snell, and I'm a 13 year old who lives in London.
<P>
I'm just writing to say that I think what you had done to the Eco. Village in 
Wandsworth was totally unacceptable. I've been to the village quite a few times, 
and it was really nice to get away from all the normalities of life, like ovens 
and microwaves, and really tidy and neat houses etc. All the people who lived 
there had made a real go of things, and you took that away from them. I mean, you hadn't used that piece of land for 7 years, and when someone comes along and does something useful with it, well, that's what you can't hack isn't it? Just because someone doesn't use it as a factory, to make stuff that's just another load of crap that no human being would ever need, you say, Oh, that's our land, you can't use it, I mean we've never used it before, but you can't anyway! What's the point of it huh? I mean, I think some people could understand if you'd actually used the land, but since you didn't, you had absolutely NO right to chuck them out.
<P>
Well, I'll leave you to think about what I've just written, and remember that it 
all came from a 13 year olds head.
<P>

Sincerely Zoe Snell.
<BR>

P.S. Please write back.

Standing on Wandsworth Bridge with a pair of binoculars, you can just make out the splintered remains of what were, until four weeks ago, the homes and possessions of London's only eco-villagers. Little else marks the scene. The bailiffs employed by the site's owners, Guinness, destroyed everything, even the plane trees growing beside York Road, and now the wind from the river sweeps up the contaminated dust their diggers exposed and drives it through the corridors of the neighbouring estates. Guinness' scorched earth policy looks like spite. It has no use for the site at present, but it'll be damned if anyone else can enjoy it.
<P>
Looking over this land now, I can see just what an astonishing thing was achieved at the Pure Genius village. Four weeks ago, depressed by the eviction, I catalogued the things that went wrong there. I owe the other settlers a major apology. Pure Genius survived - in many ways prospered - in the face of conditions which should have been insuperable. 
<P>
It had to cope not only with the pressures of writs and possession orders, but also with Wandsworth Borough Council's closure of almost every other facility that might have been able to help the drunk, the drugged and the deranged. This was the only community able to care. It also had to survive the strange circumstances of its birth. It's not hard to see how difficult it is to build a sustainable settlement from a spectacular political statement.
<P>
What Pure Genius achieved does not end on this piece of blasted land. Both the evicted settlers and the people living in the neighbouring estates are rustling with ideas. They will execute them, when they do, without public fanfare. They need no help from noisy people like me,who are likely, in truth, to be more of a hindrance. 
<P>
What is brewing in Wandsworth is part of a much wider transformation. All over Britain, communities are waking up to the fact that neither the government nor conventional developers are going to help them. Credit unions, LETS schemes, self-build projects, city farms and gardens, permaculture and community education remain almost invisible to the people who think they are running this country. While the government watches the dead leaves blown across the water by the wind, quietly, beneath the surface, Britain has begun to flow the other way. This is the way the world begins again: not with bang, but a whisper.

<B>On Tuesday 15th October 1996  </B>I was woken by hundreds of police and bailiffs(the night before they'd told us they were coming, I'd spent hours packing, and hours in the last meeting in the Roundhouse, such a great atmosphere that night; Shane had offered me some wine but I said no, I'm driving, and forced myself to bed.
<P>
Then I got up again to buy some milk at the garage because muesli and tea would be invaluable.
<P>
Orange/yellow flames burst into my consciousness as I tried to rest - poeple were burning their wooden houses, but I stayed in bed calming myself.  I peeped out when riot police arrived at first light; John and Susan, and then Suzana, knocked to tell me, but I said to go away I'm asleep.
<P>
When it was light, around 7a.m., I got up, made tea, climbed onto my roof and took a photo of the scene.  20 or 30 people were on the roof of the roundhouse - I wished I could have been there. Others had padlocked themselves to their houses, and to the jetty. I started dismantling my swings, scaffold, and bicycle-powered generator.
<P>
A bailiff said hello, where had I been the last few years - he remembered evicting me from Camberwell and New Cross and Hackney...  I'd been a few places and done a few things - inside my mind and outside in the world.
<P>
I was loading my bus, tying things on the roof, and so on when I heard the noise of chainsaws -they were cutting down trees.  I walked over, 'What are you doing?' They said they were cutting the trees because someone had climbed one. They were ten big trees.
<p>
Up till then the eviction had been (perhaps) fair but firm.  But felling those trees down was petty spite- they know we like trees. But it's their property, their right, makes the land more valuable to their accountants' way of thinking.  But trees are the lungs of London.
<P>
Those trees had been there for 30 or 40 years. We'd been there five months, and were gone in five hours. I used to drink Guinness, but no more.
<P>
If every night I'd written down what had happened that day, well, what a book I'd have! But observing and writing like that would have altered reality, altered how we behaved, whether they'd known I was doing it or not, the observation affecting the observed (is that Heisenberg's uncertainty physics) - I didn't, and I'm glad I didn't, but I also regret that I didn't.  For years I've done a monthly newsletter, DiceNews, just 20 photocopied A4s (I'm an introvert), but while at Wandsworth I didn't do one, too busy living a life.

Deputy Secretary General of the ACP Group<BR>
at the <A HREF="../liaison/ln17e.htm">1996 General Assembly for European NGOs</A><BR>
Brussels, 18-19 April 1996</H3></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
Distinguished Guests,
<P>
President Agostinho Jardin Gonzales,
<P>
Honourable Commissioner,
<P>
Ladies and Gentlemen,
<P>
It is a profound honour for me to have the opportunity to address
members of this 22nd General Assembly of the Liaison Committee
of Development NGOs to the E.U. It is also a great pleasure for
me to be able to start by congratulating this Forum for the continuing
interest it and its constituents have shown in the evolution of
ACP-EU relations over the years and in the assiduous and tenacious
manner in which it has worked on this issue and collaborated in
the struggle to negotiate and implement a better and more effective
Convention of Lome.
<P>
The work of NGOs is especially important and welcome in a world
which could be aptly portrayed by Albert Camus' observation that
&quot;too many people have decided to do without generosity in
order to practice charity&quot;. How fitting that quip is in the
world of development aid today.
<P>
Being specially appreciative of the work of the NGOs I am heartened,
although not surprised, to find that the programme for the meeting
includes a Workshop on the Future of the Lome Convention. That
debate is one of many being conducted among and between the Lome
partners. Some of these debates also concern the IGC which will
set the scene for much of Europe's future policies.
<P>
In this regard, I wish to commend the Liaison Committee of European
NGOs for the analysis and recommendations conveyed in the Position
Paper which it presented to the Reflection Group.
<P>
Our own work on the Future of Lome in this area is at a very preliminary
stage but several factors can already command a general consensus.
<P>
The Convention, in spite of its weaknesses, has been of great
benefit to ACP States. They would have been considerably worse
off without it. The financial transfers  and Commodity Protocols
constitute the most obvious testimonies to this assertion.
<P>
In response to a number of changing trends within Europe and elsewhere,
some elements of the Convention will have to be modified after
the year 2000. The Group recognises this and is prepared to contribute
to helping to fashion and implement pertinent modifications which
will help to keep the Convention &quot;alive&quot;.
<P>
Having said that, it also needs to be observed that the ACP Group
is not of the view that the Convention has to be radically re-written
or reconceived. Since there have been assessments of implementation
and constraints to implementation the future Agreement should
adequately reflect these as should the workings of the Institutions
and Organs of the Convention.
<P>
Liberalisation and globalization per se need to be supported by
resources to ACP countries because without it those States with
inadequate infrastructure, low educational levels, inappropriate
technology and limited managerial capacity will find themselves
increasingly marginalised. Poor countries attempting to cope with
liberalised market conditions need to be supported with adequate
levels of aid, technical assistance, improved market access and
debt relief.
<P>
The tendency to declining levels of official aid flows runs contrary
to this imperative. Coherence between aid policy and liberalisation
conditionalities is necessary if inequalities are not to be a
by-product of policies.
<P>
The need for additional aid for those countries such as net food
importers, which are likely to be losers as a result of the Uruguay
Round was recognised in the final report of the GATT. However,
the proposed modality for addressing the problem is far from satisfactory.
One cannot help feeling in this context that Bagehot was right
when he observed that, &quot;poverty is an anomaly to rich people.
It is very difficult to make out why people who want dinner don't
ring the bell&quot;.
<P>
The priorities of the ACP, the  like international trends, will
be changing too. In the light of African experiences since the
1980s there is a growing pre-occupation with food security and
political stability. Mr Chairman, the policies of some EU States
and some of the policies embraced by the EU as members of some
multi-lateral financial institutions have contributed to both
of the foregoing problems.
<P>
And yet in other spheres and at the Community level there has
been a commitment to food security and political stability in
ACP States. There is, in other words, a lack of coherence in some
policies. It is necessary to ensure that development policies
are not always require to give way to strategic and foreign policy
considerations as well as defence industry needs.
<P>
Mr Chairman, the position paper to which I have already made reference
dealt quite appropriately with the problem of human rights and
democracy. I would only wish to endorse the need for the Lome
partners to consider and agree on clear criteria concerning breaches
and consistent rules for tackling those countries infringing the
accepted standards. The rules should seek not merely to penalise
States but to facilitate movement along the broad and complicated,
spectrum of practices representing acceptable behaviour.
<P>
It has been said that &quot;creditors have better memories than
debtors&quot;. When we look at the debate on external indebtedness
it is hard not to conclude that this is the main reason for international
failure to resolve the problem of indebtedness of least developed
countries. In this regard, it is instructive to juxtapose the
EU treatment of debt during the course of the recent Mid-Term
Review of the Lome Convention alongside the plight of ACP debtors
as portrayed by the IBRD/IMF. In the course of the latter's analysis
of debtors they identified 20 States which have unsustainable
or near unsustainable debt burdens. Of those 20 countries classified
as heavily indebted poor countries with such burdens only 2 were
non-ACP.  18 of the 20 countries with unsustainable or nearly
unsustainable debt burdens were ACP States.
<P>
This, I might add, should be considered against a background in
which Africa alone undertook some 8,000 rescheduling between 1980
and 1992.
<P>
Mr Chairman, I believe it was William Blake who contended that,
&quot;one law for the lion and the ox is oppression&quot;. The
weak or specially disadvantaged need, in other words, appropriate
programmes, even in the case of debt.
<P>
Mr Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, the ACP Group recognises the
significance of two related factors in the process of development,
namely the import of investment in trade and growth and the imperative
of competitiveness in international markets. Some ACP countries
have been able to identify and exploit  niche markets and new
product lines thereby expanding their share of trade with the
E.U. This success has enabled some ACP countries to embark on
the diversification of their economies.
<P>
That economic diversification depends on further investment if
it is to be sustainable. If investment in many of our countries
is to be expanded significantly and rapidly foreign, savings will
need to be attracted so as to supplement domestic savings. However,
Europe's investment in ACP has tended to be problematic because
it is generally :
<P>
 i) very narrowly concentrated by country;
<P>
 ii) and by sector and in this regard usually focuses on the supply
of raw materials such a soil; and is
<P>
 iii) not attracted to the production of manufactured and processed
goods especially if they are directed at the EU market.
<P>
This brings us back to the issue of coherence : at one level in
the Convention there is a very wide range of  instruments for
facilitating investment; at the private level there is concentration
of investment, which further accentuates differentiation among
the poor countries. Yet EU policy is supposed to have a poverty
focus.
<P>
At the same time some States are seeking to reclaim aid policies
for national governments. Many national aid policies are increasingly
concerned to channel aid to regions and countries where trade
(meaning export) prospects are greatest and where returns on investment
is most lucrative.
<P>
Again the result is to channel resources to the few areas where
resources are already flowing and to further marginalise those
without.
<P>
It would seem then, Mr Chairman, that these are six of the areas
in which improvements can be effected in EU policies so as to
be of benefit to ACP States.
<P>
We hope that with the support and understanding of the NGOs the
importance of these points can be brought to bear on the EU so
that the necessary changes can be effected.
<P>
Like the famous beer adverstisement, NGOs are in a position &quot;to
reach parts which others cannot reach&quot;. We have had over
the last 20 years dramatic evidence not only of how effective
NGOs can be in both informing and influencing public opinion in
donor countries but in dragging unwilling governments to fashion
and implement policies. The best examples have been in the field
of humanitarian aid and disaster relief.
<P>
That capacity of the NGOs to influence opinion in donor countries
is to date employed in only a limited way to influence opinion
on aid ideology. The potential is there to help stem the tide
of so-called aid fatigue.
<P>
Mr Chairman, latterly the role and significance of NGOs have enjoyed
an enormous boost as a result of new thinking in aid ideology.
The latter recognises the virtue of other partners in civil society
and places great weight on the desirability of NGOs as a channel
for assistance to developing countries. This trend, which almost
constitutes euphoria, is evident if one looks at the financial
resources flowing to NGOs. In recent years NGOs involved in international
emergency relief  received some us $ 8 b. Annually. Through these
NGOs, funds were channeled to some 300 million victims. In 1995
relief agencies bought more than 7,000 vehicles and chartered
over 500 ships and 1,000 aircraft. In 1995, there were an estimated
165 NGOs attempting to operate in Kigali alone. When one realises
just how much political power such resources places in the hands
of a few hundred individuals it is sobering. Few commercial enterprises
have control over such a large quantum of resources.
<P>
Yet, in the words of World Aid, &quot;few business of this size
are run as incoherently&quot;.
<P>
NGOs therefore need to put their houses in order. Chaotic rivalry,
lack of coordination, the absence of enforceable rules and supervision,
all threaten their viability.
<P>
I do not propose to dilate on these problems or pitfalls here
Mr Chairman; many are well-known especially after the dramatic
events surrounding the  case of Rwanda. Suffice it for me to urge
that NGOs seek to bear in mind the following points. I trust that
you will not find these observations presumptious, Mr Chairman,
they are intended to facilitate good organisational relations
:
<P>
 i) NGOs are not substitutes for governments. If conflict with
recipient governments is to be avoided and tensions minimised
there is virtue in recognising a division of labour between NGOs
and governments. That division of labour should be informed by
the fact that governments have a mandate to an electorate or a
constituency other than that of the ngo, in the recipient country;
<P>
 ii) NGO &quot;agendas&quot; should be generally non-political
and politically non-partisan in sensitive situations or those
characterised by conflict so that their activities may be most
effective;
<P>
 iii) NGOs should not try to manage their activities without respecting
some basic principles about organisational management  including
the deployment of  qualified/experienced/appropriate human resources.
If they are to survive  the euphoria phase therefore they should
avoid biting off more than they can chew however tempting the
prospect of more responsibilities and easy resources may be. Be
modest in your ambitions.
<P>
Mr Chairman, Honourable Commissioner, Ladies and Gentlemen, please
allow me in closing to once more express my sincere wishes for
fruitful deliberations during the 22nd General Assembly.
<P>
I thank you.

The grant will enable Save the Children to continue their work with Kurdish families returning to their native villages. An estimated 4,000 villages have been destroyed in northern Iraq since 1975.</b><p>The grant is designed to help villages become self-sustaining: services such as feeder roads, irrigation, drinking water, latrine blocks, schools and clinics will be provided.  Where appropriate flour mills, smithies and mechanical services will also be rehabilitated.  The project will target over 1,770 families, offering each family a voucher worth £150 to be exchanged against goods.  <p><h3>NOTE FOR EDITORS</h3>The ODA's total expenditure on humanitarian aid to Iraqi civilians is over £70 million since April 1991.

<hr>
<P>
Les participants &agrave; ce groupe de travail ont abord&eacute;
un large &eacute;ventail de questions. Nous nous limiterons ici
&agrave; une s&eacute;lection de conclusions int&eacute;ressantes.
<P>
<H3><B>1. Simplifier la gestion des instruments de Lom&eacute;</B></H3>
<P>
Lom&eacute; est dot&eacute; d'une grande diversit&eacute; d'instruments
de coop&eacute;ration financi&egrave;re et technique. En th&eacute;orie,
cette diversit&eacute; devrait permettre une grande flexibilit&eacute;
dans l'adaptation de l'aide aux besoins g&eacute;ographiques sp&eacute;cifiques.
Dans la pratique cependant, de grandes difficult&eacute;s surgissent
lorsqu'il s'agit d'utiliser cette collection d'instruments de
la mani&egrave;re la plus efficace et la plus coh&eacute;rente
possible. 
<P>
Aux yeux du groupe de travail, il n'y a rien &agrave; redire &agrave;
ce grand assortiment d'instruments de coop&eacute;ration financi&egrave;re
et technique de Lom&eacute;. Plut&ocirc;t que de supprimer des
instruments, il faudrait les simplifier afin d'en assurer une
meilleure gestion tant par le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire que par
la Commission. Ces derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es, l'&eacute;tude
Post-Fidji a d&eacute;j&agrave; attir&eacute; l'attention sur
d'importantes faiblesses au niveau de la mise en oeuvre des ressources
de Lom&eacute;. En particulier dans les petits pays ACP souffrant
d'une insuffisance de capacit&eacute;s, le syst&egrave;me ne fonctionne
pas dans la pratique. Dans bien des cas, cela a d&eacute;bouch&eacute;
sur un poids croissant d'individus (par ex. des conseillers techniques
europ&eacute;ens) qui disposent de beaucoup de discr&eacute;tion
dans le d&eacute;ploiement du FED. Bien que cette discr&eacute;tion
puisse en favoriser certains, elle a &eacute;galement &eacute;t&eacute;
consid&eacute;r&eacute;e comme l'une des v&eacute;ritables faiblesse
du syst&egrave;me.
<P>
<H3><B>2. Le PIN doit demeurer un pilier des instruments de Lom&eacute;</B></H3>
<P>
Malgr&eacute; l'augmentation rapide des ressources non programmables
au cours des derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es, plusieurs participants
pensaient que le PIN devrait rester au centre de tous les instruments
de Lom&eacute;; c'est en effet l'instrument 'par excellence' du
dialogue politique. La programmation reste importante puisqu'elle
garantit la pr&eacute;visibilit&eacute;, la flexibilit&eacute;,
un niveau assez faible de conditionnalit&eacute; et une certaine
ad&eacute;quation entre l'offre et la demande. D'autres participants,
par contre, ont critiqu&eacute; 'l'attention obsessionnelle' accord&eacute;e
&agrave; la programmation afin de satisfaire principalement les
exigences de la bureaucratie. Le processus de programmation pourrait
&ecirc;tre am&eacute;lior&eacute; de mani&egrave;re &agrave; assurer
davantage de coh&eacute;sion entre tous les instruments. La valeur
pratique et l'efficacit&eacute; du PIN d&eacute;pend dans une
large mesure de la fa&ccedil;on dont il a &eacute;t&eacute; int&eacute;gr&eacute;
dans une vison de d&eacute;veloppement globale du pays ACP. A
l'avenir, la base de programmation devrait &ecirc;tre &eacute;largie
par le partage du PIN avec le secteur priv&eacute; et les ONG.
L'exemple a &eacute;t&eacute; donn&eacute; en C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire
o&ugrave; l'on a cr&eacute;&eacute; un comit&eacute; national
de gestion du PIN r&eacute;unissant des acteurs du secteur priv&eacute;
et de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile. On a &eacute;galement soulign&eacute;
le fait que la coh&eacute;rence entre PIN et PIR devrait &ecirc;tre
renforc&eacute;e et surtout, que ni l'un ni l'autre ne devrait
se contredire.
<P>
<H3> <B>3. Controverses en ce qui concerne la programmation par tranches/allocations
incitatives</B></H3>
<P>
Les derni&egrave;res innovations en mati&egrave;re d'utilisation
de la coop&eacute;ration technique et financi&egrave;re (par ex.
programmation par tranches, allocations incitatives) ont provoqu&eacute;
une controverse importante. L'impression g&eacute;n&eacute;rale
&eacute;tait que ces innovations mineront les caract&eacute;ristiques
positives de l'exercice de programmation de Lom&eacute; (par ex.
pr&eacute;visibilit&eacute; des fonds, autonomie du gouvernement
b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire, ...). Si le syst&egrave;me avait fonctionn&eacute;
correctement, ces innovations n'auraient pas &eacute;t&eacute;
n&eacute;cessaires. Les participants ont mentionn&eacute; un certain
nombre de risques encourus du fait de ces nouvelles approches:
<P>
* augmentation de l'influence de la Commission sur le dialogue
politique;
<P>
* manque de transparence sur la mani&egrave;re dont la seconde
tranche sera d&eacute;cid&eacute;e. Des crit&egrave;res ad&eacute;quats
n'ont pas encore &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;finis;
<P>
* risque que des partenaires ACP soient tent&eacute;s de soumettre
des projets &agrave; court terme &#171;simples&#187; (approche
de la d&eacute;pense rapide) plut&ocirc;t que des projets qualitatifs
durables &agrave; long terme afin d'&ecirc;tre s&ucirc;rs de remplir
les conditions requises pour l'acc&egrave;s &agrave; la deuxi&egrave;me
tranche;
<P>
* augmentation des probl&egrave;mes de gestion des deux c&ocirc;t&eacute;s.
<P>
Il faudrait &eacute;viter les approches standardis&eacute;es pour
expliquer l'utilisation insuffisante des fonds du FED par les
pays ACP. Il faudrait essayer d'identifier, pour chaque pays,
les principales raisons de cette situation (probl&egrave;mes politiques?
probl&egrave;mes de capacit&eacute;s? du c&ocirc;t&eacute; ACP
ou au niveau de la DG VIII ou encore &agrave; celui de la d&eacute;l&eacute;gation?,
etc.). Le groupe de travail pense &eacute;galement qu'il faudrait
accorder davantage d'attention &agrave; la mesure de la 'performance'
des pays ACP. Il ne faudrait en tout cas pas se contenter de d&eacute;finir
des cibles purement quantitatives (par ex.: niveaux de d&eacute;boursement)
mais aussi des objectifs qualitatifs (par ex. r&eacute;forme &eacute;conomique,
bonne gestion des affaires publiques - ou bonne gouvernance, etc.).
<P>
<H3><B>4. Approches diff&eacute;renci&eacute;es de la gestion des
instruments de Lom&eacute;</B></H3>
<P>
Si la co-d&eacute;cision (c.&agrave;.d. la programmation conjointe
des ressources de Lom&eacute;) a &eacute;t&eacute; consid&eacute;r&eacute;e
comme un pr&eacute;alable indispensable &agrave; une coop&eacute;ration
efficace, la co-gestion des programmes d'aide au niveau de la
mise en oeuvre n'a pas, quant &agrave; elle, &eacute;t&eacute;
jug&eacute;e souhaitable. Les exp&eacute;riences avec le syst&egrave;me
de co-gestion actuel ont &eacute;t&eacute; assez d&eacute;cevantes
et caract&eacute;ris&eacute;es par des retards importants dus
en grande partie &agrave; une r&eacute;partition floue des fonctions
et des responsabilit&eacute;s. Pour venir &agrave; bout de ces
goulots d'&eacute;tranglement, le groupe a propos&eacute; une
approche diff&eacute;renci&eacute;e. Dans les pays ACP incapables
(en raison de probl&egrave;mes politiques ou de capacit&eacute;s)
de bien g&eacute;rer les ressources de Lom&eacute;, une  intervention
plus importante de la CE &agrave; divers stades du cycle du projet
pourrait se justifier. Si le probl&egrave;me r&eacute;side uniquement
dans la capacit&eacute; d'absorption (par ex. les petites &icirc;les
du Pacifique), il est n&eacute;cessaire de pr&eacute;voir un soutien
institutionnel pouvant contribuer &agrave; la cr&eacute;ation
des conditions n&eacute;cessaires &agrave; une mise en oeuvre
efficace des programmes de d&eacute;veloppement par le pays ACP.
Cela devrait en tout cas se faire dans le cadre des structures
administratives locales et non par le biais de la cr&eacute;ation
d'unit&eacute;s de gestion sp&eacute;ciales ou d'un usage excessif
de la Coop&eacute;ration Technique. Dans les pays o&ugrave; les
relations entre l'UE et le gouvernement central ne sont pas des
meilleures pour des raisons politiques, la coop&eacute;ration
d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e pourrait &ecirc;tre indiqu&eacute;e.
<P>
Dans un autre groupe (de plus en plus grand) de pays ACP, o&ugrave;
le dialogue est bon et o&ugrave; r&egrave;gne la confiance, le
groupe de travail a vivement d&eacute;fendu le principe selon
lequel les pays ACP devraient &ecirc;tre seuls responsables de
la gestion des fonds du FED ('gestion totale'). Cela pourrait
&eacute;galement impliquer que les instruments puissent &ecirc;tre
adapt&eacute;s &agrave; l'apport d'un soutien budg&eacute;taire
direct avec programmation limit&eacute;e. On a &eacute;galement
beaucoup insist&eacute; sur le fait que, dans le m&ecirc;me esprit
que la Banque mondiale, il faudrait &eacute;tablir des crit&egrave;res
permettant de distinguer les diff&eacute;rentes cat&eacute;gories
de pays ACP pour lesquels diff&eacute;rents types d'instruments
peuvent &ecirc;tre d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s (par ex. pays bien gouvern&eacute;s,
pays en cours de r&eacute;forme, pays en crise, ...).
<P>
<H3><B>5. Utilisation coh&eacute;rente et int&eacute;gr&eacute;e des
instruments</B></H3>
<P>
Tant les instruments programmables que ceux qui ne le sont pas
conservent leur validit&eacute;. Cependant quelques pr&eacute;occupations
ont &eacute;t&eacute; exprim&eacute;es quant &agrave; l'importance
croissante des instruments non programmables par rapport aux instruments
programmables. L'utilisation int&eacute;gr&eacute;e des deux types
d'instruments d&eacute;pendra dans une large mesure de toute une
s&eacute;rie de facteurs propres &agrave; chaque pays.
<P>
Quelques exemples furent donn&eacute;s d'utilisation bien int&eacute;gr&eacute;e
d'instruments de Lom&eacute; tant programmables que non programmables
(par ex. Ethiopie, Guyane, C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, etc.). Parmi les
ingr&eacute;dients de base d'une approche bien int&eacute;gr&eacute;e
de l'utilisation des ressources de Lom&eacute;, citons:
<P>
* appropriation bas&eacute;e sur d'importantes contributions du
pays ACP dans la confection du programme. A cet &eacute;gard,
il fut clairement dit que 'les pouss&eacute;es de l'organisme
donateur ne peuvent rien changer. Seul le pays ACP peut faire
la diff&eacute;rence';
<P>
* environnement institutionnel dans le pays ACP. On a donn&eacute;
l'exemple de la C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire o&ugrave; la coh&eacute;rence
entre les diff&eacute;rents instruments avait &eacute;t&eacute;
consid&eacute;rablement am&eacute;lior&eacute;e depuis que le
premier ministre coordonne les instruments du FED et les ressources
de la Banque mondiale;
<P>
* capacit&eacute; d'absorption. On a cit&eacute; l'exemple de
quelques pays du Pacifique o&ugrave; cette capacit&eacute; faisait
totalement d&eacute;faut;
<P>
 * qualit&eacute; du dialogue entre le gouvernement ACP et l'UE.
Si une bonne 'entente r&egrave;gne au sein du trio' (responsable,
d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;, ON), tout est possible.
<P>
<H3><B>6. Aide directe aux acteurs non-&eacute;tatiques?</B></H3>
<P>
Le groupe de travail a pleinement reconnu la validit&eacute; des
acteurs non-&eacute;tatiques dans Lom&eacute;. De nouvelles conditions
n&eacute;cessiteront de nouveaux instruments mais le groupe de
travail a vivement d&eacute;conseill&eacute; d'agir de mani&egrave;re
improvis&eacute;e en la mati&egrave;re. Plusieurs avertissements
ont &eacute;t&eacute; lanc&eacute;s:
<P>
* ne pas se fonder sur des doctrines. Au cours de trente-cinq
ann&eacute;es de coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement, nous
avons &eacute;t&eacute; confront&eacute;s &agrave; trop de doctrines
(par ex.: autrefois, doctrine de planification du gouvernement
central; aujourd'hui, coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e);
<P>
* examiner la question sous divers angles. Avec qui travaille-t-on?
Comment mesure-t-on la repr&eacute;sentativit&eacute; et la l&eacute;gitimit&eacute;
d'entit&eacute;s autoproclam&eacute;es non &eacute;lues? Comment
les rendre responsables?
<P>
Afin d'&eacute;viter les risques potentiels d'une collaboration
directe avec ces nouveaux acteurs du d&eacute;veloppement, le
groupe a propos&eacute; une approche en trois &eacute;tapes:
<P>
* l'UE doit d'abord adopter, vis-&agrave;-vis de ces acteurs non-&eacute;tatiques,
une strat&eacute;gie ayant &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;battue avec
les gouvernements ACP;
<P>
* deuxi&egrave;mement, il faudrait proc&eacute;der &agrave; une
'analyse de l'&eacute;lectorat' avec d&eacute;sagr&eacute;gation
des acteurs non-&eacute;tatiques (un 'annuaire de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;
civile', des organisations commerciales et &agrave; but non lucratif
avec analyse des risques et des possibilit&eacute;s). Il est d&egrave;s
lors important de contr&ocirc;ler la responsabilit&eacute; et
de garantir la transparence des acteurs non-&eacute;tatiques (par
ex., il faudrait veiller &agrave; ce que les ONG du Nord ne &#171;d&eacute;tournent&#187;
pas les fonds de l'UE qui devraient &ecirc;tre allou&eacute;s
&agrave; des ONG locales);
<P>
* troisi&egrave;mement, il faudrait mettre au point des m&eacute;canismes
pour que les acteurs non-&eacute;tatiques puissent acc&eacute;der
et g&eacute;rer les fonds de Lom&eacute;. Une proposition a &eacute;t&eacute;
faite dans ce contexte afin de cr&eacute;er un fonds sp&eacute;cial
pour la gestion de la coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e,
par lequel transiterait toute l'aide de l'UE destin&eacute;e aux
acteurs non-&eacute;tatiques.
<P>
<H3><B>7. De nouveaux instruments pour pr&eacute;venir les conflits
et assurer la coh&eacute;rence</B></H3>
<P>
Le groupe n'a pas vu de raison fondamentale d'&eacute;quiper les
futures Conventions de Lom&eacute; de nouveaux instruments de
pr&eacute;vention des conflits. Avant que les conflits n'&eacute;clatent,
les institutions existantes (Assembl&eacute;e paritaire) pourraient
jouer un r&ocirc;le utile. Les d&eacute;l&eacute;gations pourraient
&eacute;galement &ecirc;tre plus pro-actives. Toutefois, on a
eu l'impression que d'autres  forums (tels que OUA, NU) &eacute;taient
plus indiqu&eacute;s pour r&eacute;gler ces probl&egrave;mes.
On a &eacute;galement vivement pr&ocirc;n&eacute; une participation
accrue de l'UE aux mesures d'all&eacute;gement de la dette qui
entrave consid&eacute;rablement le champ de manoeuvre des gouvernements
ACP.

Faiblesses et arrogance dans la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement</h3>
par <i>Jos&#233; Filipe Fonseca</i>

<H3>Des torts partag&#233;s</H3><p>

La responsabilit&#233; de la d&#233;ception tant des pays bailleurs de fonds que des
pays r&#233;cipiendaires face au manque d'efficacit&#233; de l'aide au d&#233;ve-
loppement doit &ecirc;tre partag&#233;e. Toute critique devrait &ecirc;tre
accompagn&#233;e d'un examen de ses propres processus et institutions. Je voudrais
citer deux des probl&#232;mes que rencontre la mise en oeuvre d'un v&#233;ritable
partenariat: les faiblesses des r&#233;cipiendaires et l'attitude fr&#233;quemment
arrogante des bailleurs de fonds.
<p>
<H4><I>Les pays r&#233;cipiendaires</I></H4>
<p>
Quand je parle de faiblesses, je ne me r&#233;f&#232;re pas seulement aux faiblesses
&#233;conomiques et technologiques des pays africains. Elles sont bien s&ucirc;r
essentielles, mais il y en a d'autres qui p&#232;sent davantage sur les rapports entre le
Nord et le Sud: les faiblesses institutionnelles, c'est-&#224;-dire les r&#232;gles de
fonctionnement de la soci&#233;t&#233; &#224; tous les niveaux. Celles-ci sont avant
tout le r&#233;sultat d'un manque de volont&#233; r&#233;elle d'am&#233;liorer
l'organisation et la gestion en profondeur. On les trouve dans les relations avec les autres
pays, mais &#233;galement dans les questions internes. Sans la volont&#233; de prendre
les mesures requises, tous les autres facteurs deviennent secondaires.
<p>
Il est important d'observer que ces faiblesses institutionnelles conduisent
n&#233;cessairement &#224; une faiblesse morale de ceux qui occupent des postes
&#224; responsabilit&#233;s. Ceux-l&#224; m&ecirc;mes qui sont appel&#233;s
&#224; g&#233;rer et &#224; am&#233;liorer, de la part de leur pays, la
coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement trouvent souvent leur int&#233;r&ecirc;t
dans l'immobilisme. Ces faiblesses expliquent pourquoi les pays africains ont besoin de
ressources de plus en plus importantes pour atteindre leurs objectifs de croissance et de
lutte contre la pauvret&#233;. En effet, elles conduisent &#224; un gaspillage des
ressources et &#224; une situation dans laquelle les ressources propres sont toujours
insuffisantes, quelle que soit l'action entreprise. 
<p>
<H4><I>Les bailleurs de fonds</I></H4> 
<p>
L'arrogance des bailleurs de fonds n'est pas un ph&#233;nom&#232;ne rare. Tous les
Africains qui ont eu &#224; n&#233;gocier ou &#224; ex&#233;cuter un projet
savent &#224; quel point ce facteur est pesant. Naturellement, les bailleurs de fonds ne
sont pas tous arro- gants. Les individus ont des comportements divers, et cela s'applique
&#233;galement aux repr&#233;sentants sur le terrain et autres responsables des
organisations donatrices. N&#233;anmoins, l'exp&#233;rience en Afrique est trop
g&#233;n&#233;rale pour &ecirc;tre ignor&#233;e.
<p>
Il va de soi que les relations de partenariat et l'efficacit&#233; de l'aide externe auraient
&#233;t&#233; nettement meilleures si, d&#232;s le d&#233;part, les bailleurs de
fonds avaient eu la modestie d'&#233;couter ce que les autres avaient &#224; dire; s'ils
n'avaient pas &#233;t&#233; tellement convaincus d'&ecirc;tre les seuls &#224; avoir
de bonnes id&#233;es et de bonnes solutions &#224; tous les probl&#232;mes.
<p>
Cette arrogance est d'autant plus grande que les bailleurs de fonds pr&#233;tendent
&#233;galement que la responsabilit&#233; de la r&#233;ussite ou de l'&#233;chec
d'un projet incombe enti&#232;rement aux r&#233;cipiendaires. Ainsi, l'emprunteur
est enti&#232;rement responsable des futures retomb&#233;es financi&#232;res de
l'aide. En outre, le bailleur de fonds impose des sanctions lorsque les r&#233;sultats
obtenus restent en-de&#231;&#224; des attentes.
<p>
Il n'existe pas de sanctions correspondantes pouvant &ecirc;tre impos&#233;es par
l'emprunteur au bailleur de fonds, m&ecirc;me si celui-ci se rend responsable de fautes
dans la conception ou la mise en oeuvre du projet. Je n'ai jamais entendu parler d'un pays
qui aurait &#233;t&#233; d&#233;dommag&#233; parce que l'organisation donatrice
a pouss&#233; le pays en question &#224; faire des choix qui n'&#233;taient pas
judicieux ou qu'elle n'a pas ex&#233;cut&#233; correctement les clauses de l'accord.
<p>
<H3>La d&#233;cision de passer &#224; l'action</H3>
<p>
On tend facilement au pessimisme quand on voit l'absence de volont&#233; ou
l'incapacit&#233; des bailleurs de fonds et des gouvernements africains d'affronter les
probl&#232;mes qui g&#233;n&#232;rent l'impossibilit&#233; d'&#233;tablir une
relation efficace de partenariat. Eliminer l'arrogance des uns et les faiblesses des autres est
certainement une t&#226;che longue et complexe. Je crois que l'on peut y parvenir,
&#224; condition toutefois de d&#233;cider de passer &#224; l'action.

Clarifier les concepts en pr&#233;lude &#224; l'action</h3>
par <i>Rogerio Pinto</i>
<p>
Texte int&#233;gral d'un article paru dans le <i>Bulletin DPMN</i>, 2(3) d&#233;cembre 1994:

<p>
<H3>Engagement, appropriation 
et participation</H3>
<p>
La Banque mondiale ainsi que la plupart des autres organismes bailleurs de fonds
soulignent combien il est vital pour l'am&#233;lioration de la qualit&#233; de leurs
projets d'aide, que le b&#233;n&#233;ficiaire s'engage et d&#233;veloppe un sens de
l'appropriation. Mais lorsqu'il s'agit de distinguer clairement entre ces deux termes,
l'&#233;chec est complet. Il y a donc danger que les processus requis pour arriver
&#224; un plus grand engagement et &#224; un sens accru de l'appropriation soient
moins efficaces que pr&#233;vu. Les deux concepts sont, bien s&ucirc;r,
apparent&#233;s. Mais la diff&#233;rence entre eux doit &ecirc;tre reconnue comme
une base pour l'action.
<p>
L'engagement dans un projet est li&#233; &#224; la volont&#233; d'en prendre la
direction tandis que l'appropriation est associ&#233;e &#224; la participation de ceux
qui, sur le terrain, ont un impact plus direct sur les activit&#233;s de mise en oeuvre.
<p>
<H4><I>Engagement</I></H4>
<p>
Dans le contexte de la pr&#233;paration et de la mise en oeuvre du projet, des
consultations et des &#233;changes de haut niveau assurent l'engagement des dirigeants
politiques des pays emprunteurs. Cet engagement prend la forme de d&#233;clarations
d'intention de la part du gouvernement. Il peut aussi se refl&#233;ter dans des actes
politiques ou dans des communiqu&#233;s gouvernementaux.
<p>
Mais si engagement implique volont&#233; de contribuer &#224; l'obtention de
r&#233;sultats tout en demandant &#224; d'autres d'en rendre compte, il n'assure pas
n&#233;cessairement l'appropriation, ni m&ecirc;me la responsabilit&#233; du projet.
<p>
<H4><I>Appropriation</I></H4><p>

Lorsqu'il y a appropriation d'un projet, on se sent responsable et on a &#224; coeur
d'obtenir des r&#233;sultats. Si le projet r&#233;ussit, on a gagn&#233;; s'il
&#233;choue, on a perdu. 
<p>
L'appropriation va au-del&#224; d'un simple engagement. Tandis que l'engagement se
limite &#224; des d&#233;clarations, l'appropriation s'acquiert gr&#226;ce &#224;
une interaction intensive entre les personnes concern&#233;es et le projet.
<p>
Bien trop souvent, les donateurs pensent &#224; tort que l&#224; o&ugrave; il y a
engagement au plus haut niveau, les ex&#233;cutants d&#233;velopperont
automatiquement un sentiment d'appropriation. N&#233;anmoins, si l'on admet que
l'appropriation est une participation d'ordre sup&#233;rieur &#224; l'engagement et
qu'elle n&#233;cessite des r&#233;sultats plut&ocirc;t que de simples
d&#233;clarations, le besoin de participation dans la pr&#233;paration d'un projet
devient alors plus &#233;vident.
<p>
<H4><I>Participation</I></H4>
<p>
La participation est, d&#232;s lors, le moyen d'assurer l'appropriation d'un projet. Il
rapproche la pr&#233;paration du projet des personnes qui, &#224; l'int&#233;rieur
et &#224; l'ext&#233;rieur du gouvernement, d&#233;termineront le bon
aboutissement de la mise en oeuvre.
<p>
L'importance de l'engagement r&#233;side dans le fait qu'il permet d'entamer la
pr&#233;paration du projet, et ainsi d'en obtenir l'approbation. Mais engagement ne
veut pas dire mise en oeuvre r&#233;ussie. Celle-ci demande une pr&#233;paration de
type participatif, qui d&#233;bouchera sur l'appropriation. 
<p>
En d'autre termes, il peut y avoir engagement sans appropriation responsable, mais il ne
peut y avoir appropriation responsable sans engagement.
<p>
<H3>Evaluation institutionnelle 
de l'environnement</H3>
<p>
Le processus d'&#233;valuation institutionnelle de l'environnement (IEA) s'est
d&#233;velopp&#233; au sein de la Banque mondiale; il s'agissait pour les
gouvernements africains de proc&#233;der &#224; des diagnostics qui serviraient de
pr&#233;paration aux programmes de r&#233;formes de la fonction publique.
Cependant, ce processus pourrait s'appliquer &#224; toutes les activit&#233;s du
projet. 
<p>
Les IEA sont le r&#233;sultat d'un engagement au plus haut niveau, mais elles visent
&#224; faire appa- ra&icirc;tre un sentiment d'appropriation chez toutes les personnes
concern&#233;es. Donc, l'IEA procure un cadre participatif &#224; la
pr&#233;paration du projet qui r&#233;unit &#224; la fois des fonctionnaires gouvern-
ementaux des niveaux sup&#233;rieur et moyen. Cela fournit l'occasion de comprendre
pleine- ment les objectifs du projet et de les formuler. 
<p>
Le point de d&#233;part du processus de participation, con&#231;u pour faire
na&icirc;tre un sens de l'appropriation, est d'engager des acteurs de niveau moyen dans
des activit&#233;s de diagnostic. C'est l&#224; l'objectif central d'un atelier IEA qui
permet &#224; ces acteurs et &#224; d'autres fonctionnai- res ex&#233;cutants
d'&ecirc;tre mobilis&#233;s pour la collecte et l'analyse des informations sur l'environne-
ment qui devra &ecirc;tre la cible du projet. Les par- ticipants interviennent donc
d&#232;s les tout d&#233;buts de la pr&#233;paration du projet et contribuent donc
r&#233;ellement &#224; l'&#233;laboration de celui-ci.
<p>
La participation a n&#233;anmoins son prix &#224; payer, m&ecirc;me si elle contribue
&#224; une meilleure appropriation et &#224; une meilleure ex&#233;cution du
projet. La participation augmente les attentes et les projets peuvent devenir plus
complexes. En outre, il faut maintenir le niveau de participation des acteurs
impliqu&#233;s dans la pr&#233;paration du projet; de l&#224; un processus plus long
et, donc, plus co&ucirc;teux. 
<p>
La participation implique que les donateurs travaillent avec les fonctionnaires, et non plus
seulement avec les dirigeants politiques qui ont donn&#233; un engagement initial au
projet. Mais c'est pr&#233;cis&#233;ment avec ces dirigeants que la Banque mondiale
et les d&#233;l&#233;gu&#233;s des donateurs interagissent. Avec la
proc&#233;dure d'IEA, il est demand&#233; aux donateurs d'examiner leurs propres
proc&#233;dures internes appliqu&#233;es au cycle du projet, de fa&#231;on
&#224; s'assurer que les co&ucirc;ts et les b&#233;n&#233;fices de l'appropriation
de la pr&#233;paration du projet seront enti&#232;rement assimil&#233;s par les
emprunteurs. La Banque mondiale introduit actuellement des changements dans ses
proc&#233;- dures de r&#233;vision afin d'harmoniser le cycle du projet et de le rendre
plus compatible avec la participation de l'emprunteur, ce qui devrait conduire &#224;
une r&#233;elle appropriation des projets.
<p>
<H4><I>Une IEA en pratiqu</I>e</H4>
<p>
Une IEA a &#233;t&#233; men&#233;e en Gambie dans le contexte de la
pr&#233;paration d'un pr&ecirc;t d'ajustement sectoriel. Engagement et appropriation
ont &#233;t&#233; dans une tr&#232;s large mesure r&#233;alis&#233;s. Les hauts
fonctionnaires ont immanquablement montr&#233; un niveau &#233;lev&#233;
d'engagement et les cadres gestionnaires moyens ont continu&#233; &#224; participer
&#224; la pr&#233;pa- ration du projet afin d'en assurer l'appropria- tion. Il faut
s'attendre &#224; ce que l'engagement et l'appropriation soient maintenus tout au long
de la mise en oeuvre du projet.<p>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
<p>
La coop&#233;ration entre les bailleurs de fonds et les pays en voie de
d&#233;veloppement les plus pauvres est devenue un domaine o&ugrave; le
m&#233;contentement et les d&#233;sillusions se remarquent des deux
c&ocirc;t&#233;s. Les bailleurs de fonds se penchent sur la coop&#233;ration et
observent un engagement r&#233;serv&#233; envers les r&#233;formes, des
institutions faibles, une mise en oeuvre rat&#233;e ou partielle, des r&#233;sultats
limit&#233;s par rapport aux fonds qui ont &#233;t&#233; d&#233;pens&#233;s.
Les pays remarquent que les proc&#233;dures de reddition de comptes sont lourdes; ils
voient le manque de souplesse des objectifs ambitieux, des solutions techniques
impos&#233;es et peu de compr&#233;hension pour les r&#233;alit&#233;s
politiques.
<p>
Et pourtant &#224; aucun autre moment du pass&#233;, les besoins du monde en
d&#233;veloppement n'ont &#233;t&#233; aussi grands, ni les ressources provenant
des pays industrialis&#233;s et disponibles pour y r&#233;pondre, plus rares. En outre,
l'&#233;poque de l'apr&#232;s-guerre froide a introduit toute une s&#233;rie
d'int&#233;r&ecirc;ts et d'acteurs dans l'&#233;quation de l'assistance au
d&#233;veloppement, ce qui a un effet tr&#232;s marqu&#233; sur le partenariat
entre les donateurs et les b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires. Le fait que l'on admette de plus en
plus que de nombreux probl&#232;mes sont globaux et interconnect&#233;s ajoute
encore &#224; cette complexit&#233;. Personne ne nie que la coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppement a besoin de devenir plus efficace, la question critique &#233;tant
de savoir comment.<p>
Bien &#233;videmment il n'existe pas de solutions simples et cet article ne
pr&#233;tend pas en donner. Les probl&#232;mes de la coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppe- ment ont de multiple facettes et sont complexes. Nous avons besoin
de continuer la recherche des vraies questions, ainsi d'ailleurs que de leurs
r&#233;ponses. Nous proposons ici une r&#233;flexion active sur les r&#233;formes
des politiques et certaines suggestions sur la mani&#232;re dont cette perspective peut
am&#233;liorer la coop&#233;ration du donateur &#224; la mise en oeuvre de ces
politiques.
<p>
<H3>Les r&#233;formes des politiques 
en tant que processus</H3>
<p>
De nombreux analystes ont fait remarquer qu'un facteur cl&#233; des difficult&#233;s
que conna&icirc;t la coop&#233;ration du donateur aux r&#233;formes des politiques
r&#233;side dans la perception imparfaite que poss&#232;de celui-ci du processus
politique m&ecirc;me. Les technocrates des institutions financi&#232;res internationales
et des minist&#232;res des finances ou de la planification dans les pays en
d&#233;veloppement ont tendance &#224; consid&#233;rer le processus comme
m&#233;canique et lin&#233;aire plut&ocirc;t que politique et interactif.
<p>
Cette vue lin&#233;aire met l'accent sur des prescriptions techniques de premier ordre
et sur la pr&#233;paration de plans d&#233;taill&#233;s qui suivent les &#233;tapes
pr&#233;d&#233;finies une fois que la d&#233;cision d'aller de l'avant a
&#233;t&#233; n&#233;goci&#233;e. Ces &#233;tapes deviennent alors la base de
la lib&#233;ration des fonds, de l'&#233;valuation de la r&#233;ussite et de la
fa&#231;on de d&#233;terminer qui devra rendre des comptes. Lorsque les
probl&#232;mes se posent, on cherche les rem&#232;des en affinant le contenu
technique des politiques et des programmes ou en cherchant &#224; cr&#233;er des
capacit&#233;s techniques et analytiques. La priorit&#233; donn&#233;e aux aspects
techniques est renforc&#233;e par la position officiellement apolitique des bailleurs de
fonds multilat&#233;raux et par les pr&#233;occupations de souverainet&#233; des
gouvernements b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires.
<p>
L'exp&#233;rience a pourtant montr&#233; que le processus est au moins aussi
politique que technique et qu'il est multidirectionnel et hautement interactif. En dehors
des prescriptions et analyses techniques, le processus des politiques demande l'obtention
d'un consensus, la participation des principales parties prenantes l'&#233;laboration de
plans d'urgence et de la souplesse. Au lieu d'identifier des solutions id&#233;ales a
priori, le processus souligne combien il est important de d&#233;velopper de
mani&#232;re r&#233;p&#233;titive des solutions de second ou troisi&#232;me ordre
sur lesquelles les parties prenantes peuvent se mettre d'accord pour toute la dur&#233;e
d'application de cette politique. En r&#233;pondant &#224; des probl&#232;mes, on
d&#233;clenche une analyse partag&#233;e et une action conjointe, &#224; la fois
&#224; l'int&#233;rieur et &#224; l'ext&#233;rieur du gouvernement; on
d&#233;veloppe &#233;galement une planification strat&#233;gique et des
capacit&#233;s de gestion en m&ecirc;me temps que des aptitudes techniques. Dans le
contexte de lib&#233;ralisation politique de nombreux pays en d&#233;veloppe- ment,
l'aptitude des bailleurs de fonds ou des gouvernements &#224; imposer des limites
techniques aux r&#233;formes &#233;conomiques se trouve grandement r&#233;duite.
<p>
L'adoption d'une vision interactive du processus de r&#233;forme des politiques modifie
la nature du partenariat entre le bailleur de fonds et le pays r&#233;cipiendaire, l'accent
&#233;tant mis non plus sur les conditions impos&#233;es, mais sur la
r&#233;ciprocit&#233;. Ce changement entra&icirc;ne des possibilit&#233;s et des
responsabilit&#233;s nouvelles pour les deux partenaires. Du c&ocirc;t&#233; du
bailleur de fonds, il s'agit de s'assurer que les politiques et les programmes ont de
r&#233;els champs d'application ainsi que les capacit&#233;s pour commencer leur
mise en oeuvre, ce qui exige une plus grande s&#233;lectivit&#233; dans les
interventions, une participation plus large aux discussions des buts et des actions des
programmes potentiels, une attention plus grande &#224; la sp&#233;cification
d'objectifs clairs et approuv&#233;s, ainsi qu'une volont&#233; de suspendre ou de
retirer toute assistance en cas de contraintes trop fortes. 
<p>
Du c&ocirc;t&#233; du pays r&#233;cipiendaire, cette &#233;volution requiert que
le gouvernement se montre plus responsable et qu'il rende davantage de comptes sur les
r&#233;sultats, non seulement au bailleur de fonds mais &#233;galement &#224; ses
propres citoyens, qu'il ouvre de larges secteurs au changement et qu'il g&#232;re
activement la mise en oeuvre afin que des r&#233;sultats soient obtenus de
mani&#232;re cr&#233;ative, et qu'il ne se contente pas de suivre le mouvement pour
atteindre des objec- tifs. Des deux c&ocirc;t&#233;s, une relation mutuelle de partenariat
en vue d'une coop&#233;ration au d&#233;ve- loppement donne plus de temps pour
atteindre les objectifs, ce qui met l'accent sur la super- vision, l'information en retour et
l'adaptation.
<p>
<H3>Renforcer les capacit&#233;s en vue 
d'une r&#233;forme des politiques</H3>
<p>
Ces quatres derni&#232;res ann&#233;es, l'Agence am&#233;ricaine du
d&#233;veloppement international (USAID) a apport&#233; son soutien &#224;
l'assistance technique et &#224; la recherche appliqu&#233;e. Ce soutien &#233;tait
destin&#233; &#224; formuler des approches et &#224; trouver des instruments qui
aideraient les d&#233;cideurs et les responsables de la mise en oeuvre dans les pays en
d&#233;veloppement &#224; cultiver une vision plus strat&#233;gique dans leur
conception et leur fa&#231;on d'appliquer les r&#233;formes des politiques.
<p>
Le projet de mise en oeuvre des changements des politiques (IPC) a fonctionn&#233;
avec des gouvernements, le secteur priv&#233; et avec des ONG dans plus d'une
douzaine de pays sur divers aspects de la gestion des politiques. L'IPC utilise pour sa
gestion strat&#233;gique une structure en plusieurs &#233;tapes:
<UL>
<LI>d&#233;veloppement d'une strat&#233;gie de mise en oeuvre des politiques;
<LI>analyse de l'environnement politique et op&#233;rationne;
<LI>strat&#233;gie de mise en oeuvre;
<LI>processus pour superviser les progr&#232;s et proc&#233;der aux ajustements
n&#233;cessaires
</UL>.

L'aide apport&#233;e aux gestionnaires des pays de d&#233;veloppement pour
comprendre et appliquer cette structure et les instruments qui l'accompagnent a
contribu&#233; &#224; renforcer le sens local de l'appropriation &#224;
l'&#233;gard des change- ments des politiques. En outre, elle a augment&#233; les
capacit&#233;s pour r&#233;pondre &#224; l'obligation de rendre des comptes aux
bailleurs de fonds. L'exemple suivant illustre un cas de renfor- cement des capacit&#233;s
de gestion strat&#233;gique.
<p>
<H3>Une &#233;tude de cas -- la Zambie</H3>
<p>
En Zambie, l'IPC a &#233;t&#233; sollicit&#233; pour mettre sur pied une division
d'analyse et de coordination des politiques (PAC) qui serait attach&#233;e aux services
du Cabinet. La mission de la PAC est de conseiller le Cabinet sur des d&#233;cisions
relatives aux politiques et d'aider le Cabinet &#224; mettre ces d&#233;cisions en
application. La PAC et les services du Cabinet dans sa nouvelle formation sont
cens&#233;s contribuer &#224; l'effort du gouvernement zambien pour
d&#233;velopper une attitude plus orient&#233;e sur la performance et plus sensible
au client.
<p>
La Zambie met actuellement en oeuvre un programme d'ajustement structurel de la
Banque mondiale et du FMI qui lui impose des objectifs budg&#233;taires serr&#233;s.
Dans la r&#233;alisation de ces objectifs, le pays se heurte au fait que les
minist&#232;res sectoriels pr&#233;sentent souvent au Cabinet des propositions qui
demandent des d&#233;penses extra-budg&#233;taires. En l'absence de
m&#233;canisme pour revoir ses priorit&#233;s et les communiquer d'une
mani&#232;re efficace, le Cabinet ne pouvait r&#233;pondre que de mani&#232;re
inad&#233;quate &#224; ces demandes et ses d&#233;cisions &#233;taient souvent
ignor&#233;es, cr&#233;ant d&#232;s lors des probl&#232;mes de justification des
d&#233;penses vis-&#224;-vis des bailleurs de fonds de la Zambie. L'IPC devait
&ecirc;tre ce m&#233;canisme.
<p>
L'&#233;quipe de l'IPC travailla avec le Cabinet, parla avec eux de leur vision du
gouvernement et de ce qui en emp&ecirc;chait la r&#233;alisation. Ils &#233;tablirent
ensemble les attributions et la charte d'organisation de la PAC qui furent finalement
approuv&#233;s par le Pr&#233;sident. Un mois plus tard, la formation de la division
&#233;tait officiellement annonc&#233;e. 
<p>
Les quatres missions principales de la PAC sont les suivantes: revoir les propositions
soumises au Cabinet; pr&#233;parer les proc&#232;s-verbaux des r&#233;unions du
Cabinet, superviser la mise en application des d&#233;cisions prises par le Cabinet; et
faciliter la mise en application de ces d&#233;cisions.
<p>
Un atelier destin&#233; au personnel de la PAC et aux hauts fonctionnaires des services
du Cabinet a &#233;t&#233; organis&#233;; il avait pour but de d&#233;tailler les
missions de la PAC et de d&#233;crire les liens entre la PAC et les autres services du
Cabinet. D'abord nous avons aid&#233; les participants &#224; conduire une analyse
se rapportant aux parties prenantes. Puis nous avons aid&#233; les participants &#224;
pr&#233;parer un plan d'action pour mettre en oeuvre les quatre missions de la PAC.
Nous avons men&#233; deux autres ateliers avec les secr&#233;taires permanents des
minist&#232;res. Ces ateliers pr&#233;sent&#232;rent les missions et le plan d'action
de la PAC et abord&#232;rent la question de savoir comment la PAC et les
minist&#232;res hi&#233;rarchiques pourraient travailler ensemble de mani&#232;re
efficace.
<p>
Apr&#232;s un an de fonctionnement de la PAC qui introduisit graduellement de
nouvelles proc&#233;dures, un atelier, qui s'adressait aux membres du Cabinet, permit
d'&#233;valuer les r&#233;sultats de la PAC. Cet atelier mit &#224; jour les attentes
du Cabinet &#224; l'&#233;gard de la PAC, et la discussion porta sur les
m&#233;thodes innovatrices que le Cabinet pourrait utiliser dans la conduite de ses
affaires. L'IPC continue &#224; travailler avec le personnel de la PAC afin de mettre sur
pied des syst&#232;mes de supervision de la performance de la PAC et de l'impact des
d&#233;cisions du Cabinet relatives aux politiques.
<p>
Bien qu'il soit trop t&ocirc;t pour &#233;valuer l'institutionnalisation de cette approche
strat&#233;gique de la gestion, quelques progr&#232;s ont &#233;t&#233; accomplis
quant &#224; l'accroissement des capacit&#233;s du gouvernement zambien &#224;
mettre en oeuvre son programme d'ajustement structurel. Les r&#233;unions
incoh&#233;rentes que le Cabinet tenait l'an pass&#233;, qui duraient souvent
jusqu'&#224; minuit et &#233;chouaient n&#233;anmoins &#224; trouver des
solutions, ont fait place &#224; des r&#233;unions nettement moins agit&#233;es qui
finissent avant le d&#233;jeuner. Le groupe d'experts gouvernementaux qui se penche
sur l'ajustement structurel envoie maintenant ses recommandations au Cabinet, de sorte
que les d&#233;cisions importantes mais difficiles peuvent recevoir le soutien collectif du
Cabinet, plut&ocirc;t que d'&ecirc;tre rejet&#233;es par des ministres qui n'ont jamais
&#233;t&#233; consult&#233;s.
<p>
Les minist&#232;res sectoriels tiennent maintenant des consultations quotidiennes
informelles avec le personnel des services du Cabinet pendant toute la pr&#233;paration
des propositions de politiques. Cette concertation augmente l'efficacit&#233; de la prise
de d&#233;cision concernant ces propositions. <p>

<P>
Les quatre sessions telles que pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es dans l'ordre
de jour d&eacute;taill&eacute; ont &eacute;t&eacute; suivies dans
leurs grands traits.
<P>
<H3><B>I. Parcours historique et conceptuel de la notion de Partenariat</B></H3>
<P>
La premi&egrave;re (&eacute;pineuse) question sur laquelle s'est
pench&eacute;e le groupe &eacute;tait celle de la d&eacute;finition
du partenariat  et de l'opportunit&eacute; d'utiliser ce terme
pour qualifier la relation de Lom&eacute;.
<P>
<H4><I><B>1. Diagnostic de l'&eacute;rosion du partenariat</B></I></H4>
<P>
Les participants semblaient d'accord sur le diagnostic de l'&eacute;rosion
du partenariat au cours de 20 ans de Convention. Trois interpr&eacute;tations
<U>politico-historiques</U> en ont &eacute;t&eacute; pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es:

<P>
* la premi&egrave;re con&ccedil;oit un mouvement pendulaire selon
lequel la relation a &eacute;volu&eacute; entre un extr&ecirc;me
de responsabilisation des partenaires ACP et celui du parternalisme.
Le risque identifi&eacute; par cette approche &eacute;tait celui
d'une tendance de l'UE &agrave; se substituer &agrave; ses partenaires
sous couvert de plus d'efficacit&eacute;. 
<P>
* La deuxi&egrave;me s'est centr&eacute;e sur l'&eacute;volution
des articles 4 et 5 de la Convention, qui oblige &agrave; un compromis
entre les priorit&eacute;s des ACP et celles de la politique de
d&eacute;veloppement de l'Union europ&eacute;enne: certes, les
objectifs du Trait&eacute; de Maastricht, de caract&egrave;re
universel, auxquels fait r&eacute;f&eacute;rence l'article 4,
n'entrent pas en conflit avec les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts ACP. Cependant,
pour &eacute;viter des conflits, notamment dans le domaine politique
- droits de l'homme/ d&eacute;mocratisation (cf-Niger) - il faut
trouver des m&eacute;canismes assurant une compatibilit&eacute;
des priorit&eacute;s et pr&eacute;servant les pr&eacute;rogatives
de la partie ACP.
<P>
* La troisi&egrave;me interpr&eacute;tation insistait sur le caract&egrave;re
intrins&egrave;quement politique du partenariat d'origine: pour
sauvegarder le partenariat, il faut trouver une raison d'&ecirc;tre
politique &agrave; cette relation. 
<P>
<H4><I><B>2. Le partenariat et la coh&eacute;sion (d&eacute;ficitaire)
des groupes ACP et UE</B></I></H4>
<P>
Le d&eacute;ficit de coh&eacute;sion au sein des deux partenaires
a &eacute;t&eacute; identifi&eacute; comme une des causes de l'inn&eacute;ficacit&eacute;
de la coop&eacute;ration de Lom&eacute; et une manifestation de
l'&eacute;rosion du partenariat: 
<P>
Du c&ocirc;t&eacute; ACP, le groupe a &eacute;t&eacute; jug&eacute;
trop grand pour certains, m&ecirc;me si des positions tr&egrave;s
cat&eacute;goriques ont &eacute;t&eacute; prises pour d&eacute;fendre
une int&eacute;grit&eacute; sinon du groupe en entier, au moins
de ses 3 composantes, et ce afin de pr&eacute;server un poids
politique face &agrave; l'Europe: la solidarit&eacute; intra-ACP
joue m&ecirc;me en l'absence d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts communs concrets
des 3 composantes. Plusieurs options ont &eacute;t&eacute; consid&eacute;r&eacute;es:
la diff&eacute;renciation au sein du groupe notamment en mati&egrave;re
commerciale, l'&eacute;largissement &agrave; d'autres PMA, la
cr&eacute;ation de zones de libre &eacute;changes avec certains
sous-groupes. L'option de la r&eacute;gionalisation de la Convention
sur base des groupements r&eacute;gionaux existant actuellement
a &eacute;t&eacute; acueillie avec beaucoup de r&eacute;serve:
les regroupements de pays au sein de l'ensemble ACP sont loin
d'&ecirc;tre d&eacute;finitifs ou bien ancr&eacute;s.
<P>
Du c&ocirc;t&eacute; europ&eacute;en, deux lacunes ont &eacute;t&eacute;
soulign&eacute;es au niveau de la coordination entre les bailleurs
de fonds de l'UE et de la coh&eacute;rence entre les engagements
de l'UE au titre de la Convention de Lom&eacute; et les autres
politiques qu'elle m&egrave;ne (y compris l'int&eacute;gration
des exigences de Bretton Woods dans la mise en oeuvre de Lom&eacute;).
En ce qui concerne le premier aspect, une piste a &eacute;t&eacute;
indiqu&eacute;e: celle de l'utilisation des documents de strat&eacute;gie
(documents &eacute;tudiant les le&ccedil;ons du pass&eacute; et
les tendances futures des pays et r&eacute;gions avec lesquelles
l'UE coop&egrave;rent) pour une meilleure coordination des politiques
europ&eacute;ennes en impliquant de fa&ccedil;on substantielle
les pays partenaires dans la discussion. 
<P>
<H4><I><B>3. Partenariat, Solidarit&eacute; ou Inter&ecirc;ts Communs?</B></I></H4>
<P>
L'ad&eacute;quation du terme partenariat pour d&eacute;crire la
coop&eacute;ration de Lom&eacute; a &eacute;t&eacute; vivement
discut&eacute;e. 
<P>
Le point de d&eacute;part &eacute;tait celui de l'&eacute;rosion
de ce partenariat: pour certains, il faut le revitaliser en gardant
le terme, pour d'autres, il faut cesser de coller une &eacute;tiquette
vide de sens et se pencher sur les motivations de la coop&eacute;ration:
solidarit&eacute; et int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts communs. La l&eacute;gitimit&eacute;
des deux termes a &eacute;t&eacute; trait&eacute;e: le premier
exige que l'efficacit&eacute; de l'aide soit perceptible aux contribuables
europ&eacute;ens et comporte un risque de d&eacute;rive vers le
concept peu soutenable de 'charit&eacute;'. Le deuxi&egrave;me
est plus difficile &agrave; d&eacute;terminer, &agrave; l'exception
des fameuses interd&eacute;pendances n&eacute;gatives. On a not&eacute;
que l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t &agrave; coop&eacute;rer &eacute;tait
moins commun que personnel: chacun coop&egrave;re parce qu'il
y trouve un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t (g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement pas
partag&eacute; par l'autre partie): un exemple de cela est l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t
personnel de l'UE dans le retour de l'aide (aide li&eacute;e,
contrats, emplois en Europe) et par les opportunit&eacute;s de
march&eacute;s et d'investissement (l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t des
investisseurs japonais et am&eacute;ricains a &eacute;t&eacute;
ainsi mis en exergue). 
<P>
L'impression qui s'est d&eacute;gag&eacute;e &eacute;tait que
si on limite le partenariat &agrave; la Coop&eacute;ration Financi&egrave;re
et Technique, le terme est inad&eacute;quat, car il s'agit d'une
relation d'assistance et l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t des parties est
mesur&eacute; au solde d'une &eacute;quation co&ucirc;ts-b&eacute;n&eacute;fices.
Il faut r&eacute;introduire une connotation politique plus globale,
un &quot;projet commun&quot;, d'apr&egrave;s l'un des participants.
La dimension r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; dans les droits et obligations
doit &ecirc;tre renforc&eacute;e. 
<P>
<H3><B>II. Nouveaux principes politiques du partenariat</B></H3>
<P>
La discussion de la deuxi&egrave;me s&eacute;ance a port&eacute;
principalement sur le dialogue politique et les fondements politiques
de la relation, ainsi que sur le rapport entre partenariat et
d&eacute;veloppement.
<P>
<H4><I><B>1. Aspects politiques du partenariat</B></I></H4>
<P>
Le groupe s'est pench&eacute; sur un certain nombre de questions,
notamment la raison d'&ecirc;tre de la politisation de la Convention
et les th&egrave;mes &agrave; aborder dans le cadre d'un dialogue
politique entre adultes. La question de la &quot;good governance&quot;
et de la d&eacute;mocratie a &eacute;t&eacute; trait&eacute;e
au niveau de la mise en oeuvre.
<P>
<H4><I> La politisation de la Convention de Lom&eacute;</I></H4>
<P>
Il est int&eacute;ressant de noter une contradiction apparente
dans la discussion: d'une part, dans la premi&egrave;re s&eacute;ance,
l'intervention insistant sur l'&eacute;rosion du caract&egrave;re
politique du partenariat n'a pas &eacute;t&eacute; contredite.
D'autre part, dans la deuxi&egrave;me s&eacute;ance, tout le monde
s'accorde pour reconna&icirc;tre une politisation de la Convention
par le renforcement des clauses droits de l'homme - d&eacute;mocratie
et par l'institution du dialogue politique. Cette contradiction
est d&eacute;pass&eacute;e par le fait que la politisation de
la Convention est ressentie comme un dictat politique d'une partie
sur l'autre plut&ocirc;t que sur un accord politique n&eacute;goci&eacute;
entre partenaires &eacute;gaux. La politisation de la Convention
est un ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne in&eacute;vitable, compte tenu
de la politisation croissante d'un des deux partenaires, l'Union
europ&eacute;enne, ainsi que des changements intervenus sur la
sc&egrave;ne internationale. Le hic est de faire accepter cette
politisation par la partie ACP en y introduisant un changement
de nature de la relation et en y incluant des th&egrave;mes importants
pour les pays ACP. 
<P>
<H4><I> Partenariat et dialogue politique</I></H4>
<P>
Les mots clefs qui transparaissent de cette discussion sont &quot;franchise&quot;
('il faut pouvoir se dire m&ecirc;me les choses d&eacute;sagr&eacute;ables',
a dit D. Frisch) et engagements mutuels. Le partenariat passe
alors d'&ecirc;tre une relation entre donneur et receveur &agrave;
&ecirc;tre une relation adulte fond&eacute;e sur contrat imposant
des obligations aux deux parties. Le dialogue politique doit permettre
d'identifier les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts et objectifs communs ainsi
que les r&ocirc;les des deux parties. Le Partenariat doit en outre
aborder des th&egrave;mes qui vont au-del&agrave; de la coop&eacute;ration
au d&eacute;veloppement, &agrave; savoir des questions telles
que la s&eacute;curit&eacute;, la pr&eacute;vention et r&eacute;solution
des conflits.Le dialogue politique doit, en somme, &ecirc;tre
renforc&eacute; et rendu plus visible aupr&egrave;s de l'opinion
publique. 
<P>
<H4><I><B>2. Partenariat et d&eacute;veloppement</B></I></H4>
<P>
La coop&eacute;ration dans le cadre de Lom&eacute; est tout d'abord
une coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement. La relation entre
partenariat politique et d&eacute;veloppement a &eacute;t&eacute;
longuement trait&eacute;e: question des &quot;b&eacute;n&eacute;fices&quot;
du d&eacute;veloppement, de la planification du d&eacute;veloppement
et de l'interaction avec les bailleurs de fonds, la mise en place
de crit&egrave;res de &quot;good governance&quot; ou comment rompre
avec la culture de l'allocation automatique. 
<P>
<H4><I> Les &quot;b&eacute;n&eacute;fices&quot; du d&eacute;veloppement
sont-ils partag&eacute;s?</I></H4>
<P>
L'aspect b&eacute;n&eacute;fice pour les europ&eacute;ens de la
coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement a &eacute;t&eacute;
trait&eacute; par un certain nombre de participants ACP qui ont
fait appel &agrave; la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; d'avoir des &eacute;tudes
sur ce point. Des r&eacute;serves sont apparues, c&ocirc;t&eacute;
europ&eacute;en, soulignant que des analyses chiffr&eacute;es
comportaient le risque d'un taux de retour sup&eacute;rieur dans
d'autres pays, et surtout celui d'un retour mal r&eacute;parti
entre les diff&eacute;rents Etats membres de l'UE, poussant &agrave;
des attitudes nationalistes vis-&agrave;-vis de l'aide europ&eacute;enne.
<P>
<H4><I> Partenariat et strat&eacute;gies de d&eacute;veloppement</I></H4>
<P>
Un plaidoyer a &eacute;t&eacute; fait &agrave; la fois par une
personne issue du milieu non-gouvernemental et par un repr&eacute;sentant
public ACP en faveur de la mise en oeuvre de strat&eacute;gies
nationales ou r&eacute;gionales de d&eacute;veloppement. En effet,
pour que la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement se fasse
sur base partenariale, il faut que les bailleurs de fonds interviennent
en appui &agrave; des strat&eacute;gies nationales: or depuis
que la planification est tomb&eacute;e en disgr&acirc;ce, les
gouvernements ACP raisonnent en termes d'&eacute;ch&eacute;ances
d'ajustement structurel en n&eacute;gligeant, faute de temps et
de ressources, le d&eacute;veloppement &agrave; long terme. L'appui
de l'UE &agrave; la conception et &agrave; la mise en oeuvre (y
compris politiquement vis-&agrave;-vis d'autres bailleurs de fonds)
de strat&eacute;gies serait n&eacute;cessaire et appr&eacute;ci&eacute;.
Un appel a &eacute;galement &eacute;t&eacute; fait &agrave; la
concentration de la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement.
<P>
<H4><I> Flexibilit&eacute; et partenariat</I></H4>
<P>
La question: comment rompre avec la culture de l'allocation automatique
tout en &eacute;vitant les dictats du bailleur de fonds? a bien
entendu &eacute;t&eacute; controvers&eacute;e. En effet, la programmation
est une garantie d'une part de l'existence d'une strat&eacute;gie
et d'autre part donne la pr&eacute;visibilit&eacute; n&eacute;cessaire
pour les pays. Deux questions ont &eacute;t&eacute; trait&eacute;es:
quels sont les crit&egrave;res d'allocation de l'aide? quels sont
les crit&egrave;res de performance? Sur la premi&egrave;re question,
l'option de &quot;remettre les compteurs &agrave; z&eacute;ro&quot;
et d'allouer l'aide selon des crit&egrave;res objectifs a &eacute;t&eacute;
contest&eacute;e: deux crit&egrave;res devraient &ecirc;tre employ&eacute;s:
tout d'abord les besoins du pays (allocation nationale et crit&egrave;re
de pauvret&eacute;. Les acquis de Maastricht -article 130 U -
ont &eacute;t&eacute; rappel&eacute;s &agrave; cet &eacute;gard),
et ensuite une attribution selon les m&eacute;rites. 
<P>
Le jugement du &quot;m&eacute;rite&quot; ne devrait pas se faire
sur la base d'une capacit&eacute; d'absorption quantitative mais
plut&ocirc;t sur l'engagement du pays dans la voie de la bonne
gestion de ces affaires. La question de la d&eacute;mocratie a
&eacute;t&eacute; abord&eacute;e avec prudence, notamment par
la partie europ&eacute;enne. Du c&ocirc;t&eacute; ACP, l'engagement
en faveur de la d&eacute;mocratie a &eacute;t&eacute; tr&egrave;s
fort et a soulign&eacute; deux exigences: la n&eacute;cessit&eacute;
d'une d&eacute;mocratisation durable, fond&eacute;e sur une 'appropriation'
par les populations de ce principe, et la n&eacute;cessit&eacute;
d'avoir un appui soutenu par les partenaires europ&eacute;ens
&agrave; ce qui a &eacute;t&eacute; appel&eacute; une 'course
de fond'. La &quot;good governance&quot; semblait &ecirc;tre un
concept plus acceptable et plus quantifiable. Cependant, bien
que le groupe ait &eacute;t&eacute; d'accord sur le fait que l'&eacute;valuation
de la performance et de la &quot;governance&quot; doit se faire
de fa&ccedil;on conjointe et selon des crit&egrave;res objectifs,
ces crit&egrave;res n'ont pas &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;termin&eacute;s
et il a &eacute;t&eacute; a recommand&eacute; que des centres
de recherche se penchent sur la question. 
<P>
<H3><B>III. Partenariat et gestion de la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement</B></H3>
<P>
Sur le th&egrave;me de la gestion de la coop&eacute;ration au
d&eacute;veloppement, la discussion est partie du constat que
des lourdeurs existent dans le syst&egrave;me de co-gestion, qu'il
y a un manque de transparence, et qu'un monopole &eacute;tatique
et institutionnel sur la Convention n'est plus souhaitable. N&eacute;anmoins,
il faut faire attention &agrave; ne pas faire primer l'efficacit&eacute;
-vue comme une plus grande rapidit&eacute; de d&eacute;boursement
de l'aide- sur le partenariat et le d&eacute;veloppement &agrave;
long terme. 
<P>
<H4><I> Partenariat et participation d'autres acteurs de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;</I></H4>
<P>
L'acceptation du partenariat comme impliquant seulement l'UE et
des gouvernements tombe en d&eacute;su&eacute;tude: le partenariat
doit &eacute;galement &ecirc;tre con&ccedil;u en rapport avec
les repr&eacute;sentants de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile et
du secteur priv&eacute;. Il faut impliquer, consulter les interlocuteurs
sociaux et &eacute;conomiques: une attitude plus ouverte de la
part des d&eacute;l&eacute;gations sur le terrain a &eacute;t&eacute;
r&eacute;clam&eacute;e ainsi que du renforcement des capacit&eacute;s
au niveau des ONG coupoles. La fa&ccedil;on de mettre en oeuvre
cette participation se heurte toutefois &agrave; plusieurs obstacles:
la souverainet&eacute; des Etats dans leur organisation interne,
bien que l'exemple de la Convention Internationale contre la d&eacute;sertification
(article 21) qui enjoint les signataires &agrave; impliquer les
acteurs &eacute;conomiques et sociaux ait &eacute;t&eacute; pr&eacute;sent&eacute;
comme option pour la r&eacute;vision de Lom&eacute;; la repr&eacute;sentativit&eacute;
et donc la capacit&eacute; de rendre des comptes des interlocuteurs
choisis; le risque d'&eacute;clatement des strat&eacute;gies de
d&eacute;veloppement men&eacute;es par l'Etat, les collectivit&eacute;s,
les organismes de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile, ou les op&eacute;rateurs
&eacute;conomiques.
<P>
<H4><I> Partenariat et programmation</I></H4>
<P>
Deux recommandations ont &eacute;t&eacute; faites &agrave; ce
sujet: Tout d'abord, un plaidoyer tr&egrave;s fort a &eacute;t&eacute;
fait pour sauvegarder la programmation nationale et l'allocation
nationale des fonds (PIN): en effet, l'existence de programmes
nationaux donne un cadre de gestion qui demeure tr&egrave;s utile
et suppose l'&eacute;laboration d'une strat&eacute;gie, m&ecirc;me
si elle ne concerne que les fonds du FED, &agrave; moyen terme.
La pr&eacute;visiblit&eacute; des fonds allou&eacute;s, ou du
moins d'une partie d'entre eux (allocation par tranches) est extr&ecirc;mement
importante. En deuxi&egrave;me lieu, un appel a &eacute;t&eacute;
fait &agrave; la d&eacute;mocratisation de la programmation par
le biais d'une ouverture aux autres acteurs du d&eacute;veloppement.
Un tel exercice permettrait une meilleure allocation des priorit&eacute;s
(&agrave; travers la consultation d'op&eacute;rateurs qui connaissent
les n&eacute;cessit&eacute;s et contraintes du terrain) et plus
de transparence: les op&eacute;rateurs ainsi impliqu&eacute;s
sont mieux plac&eacute;s pour contr&ocirc;ler la mise en oeuvre
des priorit&eacute;s agr&eacute;&eacute;es avec l'administration
nationale. 
<P>
<H4><I> Partenariat et gestion conjointe</I></H4>
<P>
Toujours en relation avec l'ouverture de la convention &agrave;
d'autres acteurs, la gestion conjointe des fonds (dans le cadre
du PIN) par les autorit&eacute;s centrales et d'autres acteurs
(Associations et ONG, Secteur priv&eacute;, Collectivit&eacute;s
d&eacute;centralis&eacute;es) a &eacute;t&eacute; propos&eacute;e.
Une option serait de mettre certains fonds, o&ugrave; la pr&eacute;sence
de l'Etat est indispensable, sous gestion commune et de laisser
d'autres fonds &agrave; disposition du secteur priv&eacute;, des
collectivit&eacute;s, des repr&eacute;sentants sociaux et en y
limitant le r&ocirc;le de l'Etat &agrave; celui, essentiel, du
contr&ocirc;le. 
<P>
<H4><I> Flexibilit&eacute; et performance</I></H4>
<P>
Le syst&egrave;me de co-gestion, entre le pays ACP et l'Union
europ&eacute;enne, est extr&ecirc;mement lourd et bureaucratis&eacute;.
Confier la gestion de l'aide au bailleur de fonds supposerait
un recul majeur dans le partenariat. La co-gestion doit donc &ecirc;tre
pr&eacute;serv&eacute;e &agrave; ce niveau mais &ecirc;tre flexibilis&eacute;e:
on assiste actuellement &agrave; un v&eacute;ritable &quot;dopage
administratif&quot; qui absorbe la plus grande partie du temps
et des ressources des administrations ACP. L'option pr&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute;e
dans le groupe est celle de lier la bonne performance du b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire
de l'aide &agrave; un accroissement de ses responsabilit&eacute;s
par la budg&eacute;tisation graduelle de l'aide. Cela signifie
que si un pays g&egrave;re bien ses affaires, les fonds communautaires
peuvent &ecirc;tre directement vers&eacute;s dans son budget national.
Un tel syst&egrave;me fond&eacute; sur la confiance suppose l'existence
d'un dialogue r&eacute;el sur les politiques men&eacute;es par
le pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire permettant un contr&ocirc;le
de la bonne utilisation de l'aide.
<P>
<H4><I>D&eacute;bureaucratisation et simplification de l'aide</I></H4>
<P>
Celle-ci peut se faire par une plus grande d&eacute;l&eacute;gation
sur le terrain, par l'introduction graduelle de la budg&eacute;tisation
de l'aide (voir ci-dessus), et par une simplification des proc&eacute;dures
existantes. Cette simplification pourrait se faire non seulement
au niveau de l'aide communautaire mais aussi de l'aide bilat&eacute;rale
des Etats-membres de l'Union europ&eacute;enne.
<P>
<H4><I> Suivi et &eacute;valuation</I></H4>
<P>
Un syst&egrave;me bas&eacute; sur une plus grande responsabilit&eacute;
des partenaires doit avoir comme corrolaire indispensable un suivi
plus s&eacute;rieux des actions men&eacute;es et une &eacute;valuation
conjointe de l'impact achev&eacute;: ceci est indispensable pour
que le bailleur de fonds et l'Etat b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire
puissent rendre des comptes aux populations sur l'utilisation
des ressources.
<P>
<H3><B>IV. Responsabilit&eacute;s europ&eacute;ennes dans un nouveau
partenariat</B></H3>
<P>
La n&eacute;cessit&eacute; d'accro&icirc;tre la coh&eacute;rence
entre la politique de d&eacute;veloppement de l'UE et les autres
politiques communes a fait l'objet d'un accord sans discussion.
Le d&eacute;bat s'est concentr&eacute; sur deux &eacute;l&eacute;ments:
le r&ocirc;le du groupe ACP dans la d&eacute;fense des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts
de ses membres dans les instances internationales, et l'appui
attendu de la part de l'Union Europ&eacute;enne. Le cas de la
dette a &eacute;t&eacute; soulign&eacute; de fa&ccedil;on toute
particuli&egrave;re. 
<P>
<H4><I> La d&eacute;fense des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts ACP dans les enceintes
internationales: une responsabilit&eacute; du groupe...</I></H4>
<P>
L'absence de dimension internationale du groupe ACP a &eacute;t&eacute;
fortement regrett&eacute;e: il ne semble exister que vis-&agrave;-vis
des 14.6 Milliards d'ECUs de la Convention. Les politiques et
les contraintes qui p&egrave;sent sur les pays ACP sont d&eacute;cid&eacute;es
&agrave; Washington et &agrave; Gen&egrave;ve. Le groupe devrait
s'organiser et se mobiliser pour y d&eacute;fendre ses int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts.
<P>
<H4><I> ... devant &ecirc;tre soutenue par les partenaires europ&eacute;ens</I></H4>
<P>
Le partenariat ne sera pas une r&eacute;alit&eacute; si la partie
europ&eacute;enne (c'est &agrave; dire la Commission europ&eacute;enne
et les 15 Etats membres) ne se solidarise pas avec ses partenaires
ACP dans la d&eacute;fense de leurs int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts et des
points de vue communs dans les enceintes de Bretton Woods et de
l'OMC, o&ugrave; l'Europe p&egrave;se d'un poids tr&egrave;s lourd:
50% de l'APD, majorit&eacute; de voix dans les organismes financiers,
premier bloc commercial. L'exemple de l'ajustement structurel
a &eacute;t&eacute; pr&eacute;sent&eacute;: les europ&eacute;ens
devraient utiliser leur poids politique pour faire valoir leurs
id&eacute;es concernant l'ajustement structurel au sein des institutions
de Bretton Woods, et mettre en oeuvre ces id&eacute;es dans le
cadre des politiques bilat&eacute;rales des Etats-membres.
<P>
<H4><I> Le probl&egrave;me de la dette</I></H4>
<P>
Le cas de la dette a &eacute;t&eacute; mis en exergue dans la
discussion. En effet, tant qu'il n'est pas r&eacute;solu, le d&eacute;veloppement
des pays ACP est compromis. L'appui de l'Union europ&eacute;enne
a &eacute;t&eacute; sollicit&eacute; dans ce cadre l&agrave;:
certes le FED n'a aucun effet d'accroissement de la dette, mais
les ACP attendent de la Commission qu'elle fasse mettre ce sujet
&agrave; l'ordre du jour, notamment des Etats-membres de l'UE.
Cette probl&eacute;matique pose un d&eacute;fi fondamental &agrave;
la solidit&eacute; de la relation ACP-UE: celui de l'int&eacute;gration
des probl&egrave;mes structurels de d&eacute;veloppement dans
le partenariat.

Le point de vue d'une ONG internationale
</h3>
par<i> Hugh Goyder</i>
<p>
Texte int&#233;gral d'un article paru dans le <i>Bulletin DPMN</i>, 2(3), d&#233;cembre
1994: pages 10 - 11
</center>
<hr>
<p>

<H3>Le partenariat est-il encore valable et faisable?</H3><P>

Les ONG internationales ont une exp&#233;rience mitig&#233;e du partenariat. Le mot
devint &#224; la mode pendant les ann&#233;es 80 lorsque les ONG du Sud
adopt&#232;rent une attitude plus critique vis-&#224;-vis de leurs partenaires du Nord,
et que les liens de d&#233;pendance traditionnels entre les donateurs et les
b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires furent remis en question. Dans les ann&#233;es 90, un
nouveau type de relation vit le jour et la collaboration augmenta entre les ONG du Nord
et les organismes internationaux de d&#233;veloppement; certains financements se firent
directement des bailleurs de fonds officiels aux ONG du Sud.<P>
Tandis que le concept de partenariat reste valable, la plupart des ONG sont
confront&#233;es &#224; de r&#233;elles difficult&#233;s pour rendre ce concept
pleinement op&#233;rationnel. Un partenariat v&#233;ritable implique une
compatibilit&#233; de vision, de buts et d'objectifs entre les deux parties, ce qui est
tr&#232;s rare dans la pratique. Toutefois, la relation reste essentiellement
in&#233;gale, un c&ocirc;t&#233; conservant le droit d'accorder ou de refuser le
financement et, donc, le pouvoir r&#233;el.
<P>
En outre, de nombreuses ONG internationales sont devenues de plus en plus
interventionnis- tes ces dix derni&#232;res ann&#233;es, &#233;laborant tout un
cort&#232;ge de politiques sur des sujets tels que la condition des femmes,
l'environnement et les droits de l'homme. Il semble probable que les donateurs officiels
qui parlent maintenant de la n&#233;cessit&#233; d'une relation de partenariat seront
confront&#233;s &#224; des contradictions similaires.
En d&#233;pit de ces difficult&#233;s, le concept de partenariat a encore une
r&#233;elle valeur en tant que philosophie sous-tendant le d&#233;veloppement
institutionnel. Sa valeur cl&#233; r&#233;side dans l'affirmation d'une relation qui va
au-del&#224; du financement, vers un engagement r&#233;el &#224; long terme
envers le d&#233;veloppement d'organisations nationales.
<P>
Un partenariat r&#233;el demande une planification conjointe strat&#233;gique et un
accord sur les objectifs et les indicateurs par lesquels les progr&#232;s seront
mesur&#233;s. Cette relation &#233;tablie, les probl&#232;mes peuvent &ecirc;tre
ouvertement reconnus et &ecirc;tre trait&#233;s avant de devenir trop importants. 
<P>
<H3>Les ONG ont-elles moins d'obligations que les donateurs?</H3>
<P>
Les ONG telles que Actionaid mettent en oeuvre une grande part de leurs projets elles-
m&ecirc;mes. Toutefois une mise en oeuvre durable demande que nous
&#233;tablissions des relations de partenariat avec une grande vari&#233;t&#233;
d'organisations locales -- les organismes gouvernementaux &#224; tous les niveaux,
d'autres ONG et des organisations au niveau de la collectivit&#233;. 
<P>
Les travaux op&#233;rationnels montrent bien que nous devons faire les m&ecirc;mes
choix au niveau micro-&#233;conomique que les donateurs officiels au niveau national.
Par exemple, nous devons souvent choisir entre fournir notre propre assistance technique
agricole 'alternative' ou nos services de sant&#233;, ou bien persuader le gouvernement,
au terme d'un long processus de lobbying et de conseil, de fournir ces m&ecirc;mes
services. La base de notre financement &#224; long terme provient largement de sources
qui s'engagent pour une p&#233;riode de cinq &#224; dix ans. Cette base s&ucirc;re
nous permet d'&#233;viter les projets de mise en oeuvre rigide et d'adopter des
strat&#233;gies &#224; plus long terme.
<P>
N&#233;anmoins, les ONG ne sont pas &#224; l'abri des probl&#232;mes li&#233;s
&#224; l'obligation de rendre des comptes auxquels sont confront&#233;s les dona-
teurs officiels. Actionaid, en commun avec la plupart des ONG similaires, a
d&#233;velopp&#233; un syst&#232;me de responsabilit&#233; financi&#232;re qui
pr&ocirc;ne des contr&ocirc;les financiers s&#233;v&#232;res. A ceci s'ajoutent une
supervision &#233;troite et une r&#233;vi- sion p&#233;riodique des strat&#233;gies
du programme.
<P>
Toutefois, plus le syst&#232;me de responsabilit&#233; financi&#232;re face &#224;
nos administrateurs et donateurs au Royaume-Uni est strict, plus il est difficile pour nous
d'honorer cette responsabilit&#233; financi&#232;re vis-&#224;-vis des
communaut&#233;s avec lesquelles nous travaillons directement. Tous les organismes
interm&#233;diaires connaissent ce probl&#232;me et essayent de mettre en oeuvre des
projets au niveau de la collectivit&#233; et d'utiliser des fonds qui proviennent de
donateurs de plus en plus pr&#233;occup&#233;s de savoir comment leurs fonds sont
utilis&#233;s.
<P>
<H3>L'exp&#233;rience d'Actionaid</H3>
<P>
Dans tout projet ONG, on doit se sentir responsable envers les besoins des
communaut&#233;s, plut&ocirc;t que de suivre des programmes rigides tout en veillant
simplement &#224; ce que les choses se fassent. D&#232;s la mise en marche du projet,
l'ONG a besoin d'&#233;tablir une philosophie claire afin que la communaut&#233;
puisse d&#233;terminer ses propres priorit&#233;s et imposer son rythme. Cela signifie
souvent que pendant la premi&#232;re ann&#233;e du projet, rien de bien tangible ne
se passera. Cette p&#233;riode est essentielle pour s'assurer que la communaut&#233;
ressente un sentiment d'appropriation du projet &#224; long terme: m&ecirc;me ainsi,
certains donateurs officiels rejettent les propositions des ONG qui mettent l'accent sur
cette sorte d'approche, parce qu'ils ne peuvent pas voir le b&#233;n&#233;fice
pratique (et mesurable) pour les communaut&#233;s &#224; court terme.
<P>
Dans la situation id&#233;ale, le personnel devrait &ecirc;tre recrut&#233; dans les
environs imm&#233;diats du projet et vivre et travailler autant que possible dans les
communaut&#233;s. Dans le pass&#233;, les projets d'Actionaid s'appuyaient sur des
bases sectorielles avec des objectifs largement sectoriels. Plus r&#233;cemment, de
nombreux projets sont pass&#233;s &#224; une approche plus
d&#233;centralis&#233;e et bas&#233;e sur l'entit&#233; locale, ce qui implique
souvent un plus grand d&#233;fi du point de vue de la gestion mais donne plus
l'occasion &#224; la communaut&#233; de reprendre la gestion du projet.
<P>
Les ONG ont pendant trop longtemps ignor&#233; les structures locales; elles ont
m&ecirc;me affaibli ces structures en recrutant leur personnel &#224; des niveaux de
salaires &#233;lev&#233;s. Jusqu'&#224; pr&#233;sent, le plus gros du d&#233;bat
sur le renforcement des capacit&#233;s ne s'est adress&#233; qu'aux institutions au
niveau national, et le gouvernement local a &#233;t&#233; relativement
n&#233;glig&#233;. Les ONG doivent travailler &#224; la fois du c&ocirc;t&#233;
'demande' (en aidant les communaut&#233;s &#224; devenir plus productives et
&#224; exiger des services meilleurs et plus coh&#233;rents de la part du
gouvernement) mais &#233;galement du c&ocirc;t&#233; 'offre' -- en travaillant avec
les minist&#232;res sectoriels et les autres autorit&#233;s; et ce, afin d'assurer que, des
deux c&ocirc;t&#233;s, on dispose de la main-d'oeuvre qualifi&#233;e, des fonds et
du mat&#233;riel n&#233;cessaires pour travailler efficacement. C'est seulement dans
les pay confront&#233;s &#224; une d&#233;b&#226;cle &#233;conomique et
politique compl&#232;te que les ONG devraient essayer de reprendre en mains cette
fonction.
<P>
Une fois que ces structures du niveau communautaire sont en place, il est important de
ne pas surcharger les acteurs sur place d'une r&#233;daction excessive de rapports. Une
'culture bureaucratique' se d&#233;veloppe rapidement dans de nombreuses ONG,
particuli&#232;rement en Afrique, si bien qu'une partie importante du personnel sur
place est bloqu&#233;e derri&#232;re les bureaux. L'obligation de rendre des comptes
doit &ecirc;tre claire pour chaque membre du personnel, de sorte que seuls les
gestionnaires du projet doivent passer leur temps &#224; rendre des comptes au bailleur
de fonds; et le personnel bas&#233; dans les communaut&#233;s devrait alors
&ecirc;tre en mesure de travailler avec les communaut&#233;s et en leur sein.
<P>
A l'int&#233;rieur d'une telle structure, la meilleure r&#233;ponse &#224; donner aux
pr&#233;occupations des agences quant &#224; l'efficacit&#233; d'un projet est
d'impliquer les communaut&#233;s dans la d&#233;termination des objectifs et
l'identification des indicateurs de performance. Une super- vision interne peut &ecirc;tre
contr&ocirc;l&#233;e &#224; l'aide d'&#233;valuations p&#233;riodiques utilisant
les indicateurs identifi&#233;s par la communaut&#233; ainsi que ceux de l'agence.
<P>
Le risque est r&#233;el, compte tenu de l'accroissement en nombre des ONG et de la
difficult&#233; qu'elles rencontrent &#224; avoir acc&#232;s &#224; des fonds, que
la plupart des ONG deviennent des 'fournisseurs,' &#224; l'instar de nombreuses ONG
am&#233;ricaines qui sont devenues des fournisseurs de l'USAID. Le danger principal
que courent les ONG en acceptant de tels liens est qu'elles devront, en fin de compte,
&ecirc;tre plus sensibles aux exigences de responsabilit&#233;s financi&#232;res des
bailleurs de fonds qu'aux exi- gences des personnes qu'elles devraient servir.
<P>
<H3>Les implications pour 
les autres donateurs </H3>
<P>
Ces exp&#233;riences n'ont pas toutes la m&ecirc;me sig- nification pour les donateurs
officiels. On peut toutefois d&#233;gager quelques indications utiles. 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Le besoin de revoir l'aide du point de vue du b&#233;n&#233;ficiaire. Il est crucial aussi
bien au niveau national qu'au niveau de la commu- naut&#233; que l'agence locale
d&#233;veloppe un sentiment d'appropriation envers n'importe quel projet. La
multiplicit&#233; actuelle des donateurs, leurs diverses exigences en mati&#232;re de
rapports et les conditions de plus en plus complexes menacent les capacit&#233;s des
gouvernements nationaux &#224; s'occuper de l'aide m&ecirc;me et ne leur laisse que
peu de place pour leur propre politique de d&#233;veloppement. Il est tout &#224; fait
l&#233;gitime que le bailleur de fonds impose des conditions &#224; l'octroi de l'aide,
mais il doit &ecirc;tre plus transparent quant aux strat&#233;gies qui sous-tendent ces
conditions: l'ODA a annonc&#233; qu'elle d&#233;voilerait ses priorit&#233;s
strat&#233;giques dans diff&#233;rents pays.
</UL><P>

<UL>
<LI>Le besoin d'une d&#233;centralisation plus grande de la part des bailleurs de fonds officiels. La n&#233;cessit&#233; de rendre des comptes 'vers le haut' est une justification
insuffisante pour l'approche centralis&#233;e d&#233;fendue par certains bailleurs de
fonds, y compris l'Union europ&#233;enne. A cet &#233;gard, la
d&#233;l&#233;gation d'autorit&#233; par les bailleurs de fonds, telle celle de l'ODA
britannique vers les Divisions du d&#233;veloppe- ment bas&#233;es
r&#233;gionalement, appara&icirc;t comme une &#233;volution positive. Le
renforcement des capacit&#233;s nationales restera un vain mot si la communaut&#233;
du bailleur de fonds &#224; l'int&#233;rieur de chaque pays ne se voit pas confier un
mandat clair pour travailler avec d'autres bailleurs de fonds en vue d'atteindre cet
objectif.
</UL><P>

<UL>
<LI>Le besoin de proc&#233;dures plus simples et plus transparentes pour transf&#233;rer
l'aide. Il y a un risque r&#233;el que, au moins dans le cas de l'Union
europ&#233;enne, les pays ACP soient rendus responsables des faibles taux de
paiements, alors que la cause principale serait des retards dans le processus
d&#233;cisionnel au sein de l'Union europ&#233;enne elle-m&ecirc;me. En ce qui
concerne le financement des ONG par l'Union europ&#233;enne, la plupart des ONG
font actuellement l'exp&#233;rience de retards de plus en plus longs dans les
d&#233;cisions prises &#224; Bruxelles assurant le financement. Aucune
r&#233;partition nette des t&#226;ches n'appara&icirc;t entre Bruxelles et les
d&#233;l&#233;gations; les proc&#233;dures d'&#233;valuation des propositions
manquent de clart&#233;, et les crit&#232;res d'acceptation ou de rejet des
propositions paraissent souvent arbitraires.
</UL><P>
<UL>
<LI>La prise de conscience par les donateurs officiels, qui allouent les contrats aux ONG pour
des services &#224; un niveau communautaire, que les obligations qu'ils imposent en
mati&#232;re de comptes sont n&#233;cessaires mais qu'elles ne sont jamais suffisantes,
et qu'ils doivent trouver des moyens de v&#233;rifier l'&#233;tendue de l'engagement
des communaut&#233;s dans le travail des ONG.

<hr>
Le "partenariat" est la description "politiquement correcte" de la plupart des formes de
coop&#233;ration. Le partenariat implique, en th&#233;orie, que les partenaires du Sud sont
responsables de leur propre d&#233;veloppement et que les organismes donateurs n'ont qu'un
r&#244;le d'appui. Bailleurs de fonds et b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires en vantent les avantages et
tous pr&#233;tendent le pratiquer.
<p>
Le partenariat s'est r&#233;v&#233;l&#233; bien difficile &#224; mettre en oeuvre. La
r&#233;partition des responsabilit&#233;s reste souvent floue. Il est difficile de combiner
l'appropriation par les b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires et l'exigence de justification de l'utilisation de
l'aide par les donateurs. Les bailleurs de fonds constatent un faible engagement, un d&#233;clin
institutionnel, des syst&#232;mes de reddition de comptes assez m&#233;diocres et une
d&#233;pendance vis-&#224;-vis de l'aide. Ils r&#233;agissent par des approches
interventionnistes en d&#233;pit de l'&#233;vidence de leurs limites. Les pays en
d&#233;veloppement constatent un manque d'int&#233;r&#234;t pour les r&#233;alit&#233;s
politiques, de nombreuses conditionnalit&#233;s, une bureaucratie excessive et une
coh&#233;rence politique insuffisante.
<p>
Dans le climat politique actuel, les agences d'aide sont contraintes de repenser la nature de leur
coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement. Leurs &#233;lectorats attendent une gestion efficace
et des preuves de l'impact de l'aide. Le domaine de l'aide s'est g&#233;n&#233;ralement
montr&#233; peu enclin &#224; tirer les le&#231;ons des &#233;checs pass&#233;s et des
bonnes pratiques. La baisse des budgets d'aide refl&#232;te la crise de cr&#233;dibilit&#233;
que traverse la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement. 
<p>
L'ECDPM a invit&#233; 45 personnes, provenant de pays en voie de d&#233;veloppement,
d'organismes donateurs, de parlements, d'organisations non gouvernementales et de la
communaut&#233; des chercheurs, &#224; assister &#224; une table ronde. Les trois questions
suivantes &#233;taient &#224; l'ordre du jour: le partenariat demeure-t-il une approche utile?
Comment associer l'appropriation et le besoin de justifier l'utilisation de l'aide? Comment
apporter des changements dans la mise en oeuvre de l'aide?
<p>
Ce rapport passe en revue les pressions exerc&#233;es sur le partenariat et les contradictions
pr&#233;sentes dans le syst&#232;me d'aide. Il t&#233;moigne qu'il n'existe pas d'alternative
au partenariat, mais que le concept doit &#234;tre red&#233;fini. Des suggestions sont
&#233;mises quant aux moyens d'y parvenir. Enfin, ce rapport analyse les strat&#233;gies
permettant de h&#226;ter les r&#233;formes souhait&#233;es.

Partenariat dans la recherche agricole
</h3>
par<i> Steven Tabor</i>
<p>
Texte int&#233;gral d'un article paru dans le <i>Bulletin DPMN</i>, 2(3), d&#233;cembre
1994: pages 12 - 13

<hr>
<p>
<H3>Historique</H3>
<P>
Le d&#233;veloppement et la diffusion des nouvelles technologies est peut-&ecirc;tre la
seule source de croissance &#224; long terme des soci&#233;t&#233;s agraires
&#224; faibles revenus. Aider les &#233;conomies en d&#233;veloppement &#224;
atteindre leur plein potentiel technologique est une des raisons pour lesquelles les
donateurs ont toujours fourni une aide &#224; la recherche agricole. Le fait que la
majorit&#233; des pauvres du monde r&#233;sident dans des r&#233;gions rurales et
que l'agriculture soit leur principal moyen de subsistance explique cet engagement.
<P>
Ces quarante derni&#232;res ann&#233;es, les donateurs ont investi
&#233;norm&#233;ment dans le renforcement des capacit&#233;s de recherche
agricole. Pendant les ann&#233;es 50 et 60, l'aide &#233;tait principalement
utilis&#233;e pour former des scientifiques et &#233;quiper des structures nationales
de recherches. Au cours de ces ann&#233;es, les d&#233;penses de la recherche
agricole ont augment&#233; de presque 9% par an et le nombre de scientifiques
form&#233;s s'est accru de presque 12% par an. Dans les ann&#233;es 80,
l'intensit&#233; de l'aide au d&#233;veloppement en mati&#232;re de recherche
agricole a chang&#233; &#224; deux &#233;gards.
<P>
Premi&#232;rement, l'ordre du jour du d&#233;ve- loppement est pass&#233; du
renforcement des capacit&#233;s institutionnelles et de la r&#233;solution des
contraintes structurelles de la croissance, au fait de se doter de politiques
'appropri&#233;es.' Deux r&#233;alit&#233;s ne peuvent pas &ecirc;tre
contest&#233;es: d'une part, la r&#233;forme des politiques s'est fait longtemps
attendre, d'autre part, les gouvernements pris dans le cercle vicieux du
d&#233;s&#233;quilibre de la balance des paiements n'avaient pas d'autre choix que
d'utiliser l'aide pour stabiliser les march&#233;s financiers. Cela a contribu&#233;
&#224; d&#233;tourner les ressources d'aide au d&#233;veloppement agricole en
g&#233;n&#233;ral, et, dans de nombreux pays, de la recherche agricole en particulier.
De nombreuses structures de recherche agricole, caract&#233;ris&#233;es par des
capacit&#233;s physiques et humaines consid&#233;rables, mais des ressources
op&#233;rationnelles inad&#233;quates, ont commenc&#233; &#224; souffrir de
d&#233;s&#233;quilibres financiers s&#233;rieux.
<P>
Deuxi&#232;mement, les termes de l'aide se sont durcis (dans un sens qualificatif)
pendant les ann&#233;es 80. Des projets d'aide &#224; la recherche agricole ont
commenc&#233; &#224; mettre de plus en plus l'accent sur la durabilit&#233; de
l'environnement, sur le r&ocirc;le des femmes dans le d&#233;veloppement et la
participation des ONG. Comme le dialogue politique commen&#231;ait &#224; porter
sur des mati&#232;res de gestion du secteur public, les projets de recherche agricole ont
&#233;t&#233; davantage utilis&#233;s comme un moyen de favoriser le
d&#233;veloppement du secteur priv&#233; et de r&#233;former les politiques
technologiques. Ces projets furent de plus en plus ax&#233;s sur le processus de
changement, qu'il s'agisse de gestion institutionnelle, d'orientation des politiques ou
d'environnement technologique, plut&ocirc;t que sur les investissements dans des biens
tangibles.<P>
Alors que le financement de la recherche agricole commen&#231;ait &#224; stagner,
il devint clair que les investissements du pass&#233; n'&#233;taient plus durables d'un
point de vue financier, ou du moins que des gouvernements ne pouvaient pas les
maintenir &#224; un niveau raisonnable. La sous-utilisation des investissements qui
avaient &#233;t&#233; faits en &#233;quipements de recherche agricole et en
personnel form&#233; fit na&icirc;tre un sentiment de cynisme et d'amertume aussi bien
parmi les donateurs que parmi les b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires. Mais, en m&ecirc;me
temps, le besoin de nouvelles technologies permettant de r&#233;duire la
pauvret&#233; rurale et de r&#233;pondre aux n&#233;cessit&#233;s alimentaires
du pays resta largement inchang&#233;.
<P>
<H3>Quelques le&#231;ons &#224; tirer 
de l'exp&#233;rience</H3>
<P>
D'abord, l'assistance au d&#233;veloppement va se tourner vers le secteur public, vers
la recherche de nouveaux investissements et d'activit&#233;s r&#233;alisables dans un
cadre temporel relativement modeste.
<P>
Ensuite, les priorit&#233;s de d&#233;veloppement vont se modifier, et, ce faisant, les
pays vont &ecirc;tre confront&#233;s aux risques que les investissements tr&#232;s
co&ucirc;teux ne puissent pas &ecirc;tre maintenus.
<P>
Enfin, les priorit&#233;s de d&#233;penses des donateurs sont beaucoup plus sensibles
aux changements que ne le sont les probl&#232;mes et les d&#233;fis sous-jacents du
d&#233;veloppement auxquels sont confront&#233;s les pays
b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires.
<P>
<H3>Les implications pour le partenariat b&#233;n&#233;ficiaire-donateur</H3>
<P>
Comment pourrait-on forger une relation b&#233;n&#233;ficiaire-donateur qui
contribue efficacement et &#224; long terme &#224; la croissance et au
d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique? De nombreuses mesures ont
&#233;t&#233; propos&#233;es, qui devraient changer les r&#232;gles fondamentales
en vertu desquelles l'aide est n&#233;goci&#233;e ou mise en oeuvre. Les organismes
donateurs ont sugg&#233;r&#233;, par exemple, d'arr&ecirc;ter l'assistance technique
&#224; l'Afrique, de cr&#233;er de nouvelles institutions pour g&#233;rer un dialogue
politique et d'accorder une attention plus grande &#224; la conception et &#224; la
supervision des projets. Certaines de ces mesures pourront en effet am&#233;liorer
l'efficacit&#233; de l'aide, mais on peut se demander si, dans la pratique, elles
apporteront un changement significatif &#224; l'environnement de l'aide globale.<P>
 Il se peut tr&#232;s bien que l'environnement de l'aide soit beaucoup plus r&#233;sistant
au changement qu'on ne le souhaiterait. Comme dans tous les syst&#232;mes
bureaucratiques en place depuis longtemps, les forces de l'inertie sont tr&#232;s fortes.
Si l'environnement de l'aide n'est pas susceptible de changer radicalement, ou s'il change
d'une fa&#231;on qui &#233;chappe au contr&ocirc;le du donateur et du
b&#233;n&#233;ficiaire, la strat&#233;gie ad&#233;quate de partenariat consiste
&#224; ce que toutes les parties concern&#233;es tirent les le&#231;ons des
exp&#233;riences pass&#233;es et s'adaptent &#224; un climat de l'aide en pleine
&#233;volution.
<P>
Il serait &#224; conseiller tant aux b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires qu'aux donateurs de l'aide
de mettre sur pied un partenariat strat&#233;gique, soumis &#224; des
consid&#233;rations de temps, pour s'occuper de t&#226;ches particuli&#232;res.
Que cette relation &#224; long terme puisse &#233;voluer serait plus le produit d'un
hasard heureux que d'une politique d&#233;lib&#233;r&#233;e. Dans ce cas, la
meilleure solution de partenariat appara&icirc;trait lorsque les donateurs et les
b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires de l'aide essayeraient de faire co&iuml;ncider leurs exigences
de financements, leurs priorit&#233;s, les capacit&#233;s d'utilisation de l'aide et les
forces de mise en application. Certains de ces &#233;l&#233;ments, qui pourraient
servir de base &#224; un partenariat, figurent dans le tableau ci-dessous.

<HR>
<P>
<B>The development aid budget of the Federal Republic of Germany
was to be frozen at the 1993 level of 8.4 billion DM for 1994
and 1995, and now has been cut even further. Many are protesting
this decision, pointing out that the promise was made, and reconfirmed
by Chancellor Kohl at UNCED in Rio, to reach the 0.7 per cent
goal in the near future. For others, the stagnation of German
development assistance is a reason to reevaluate the quality rather
than the quantity of contributions. As a result, they demand greater
effectiveness and efficiency.</B> 
<P>
It is not my intention to reflect on ways to improve the planning,
management, and monitoring of Technical and Financial Cooperation
projects. l want to address this topic in a much more radical
way
<P>
<B>1. The grant element</B> 
<P>
All current discussions leave one cornerstone of development cooperation
untouched: The &quot;grant element&quot;. This is almost inevitable,
since the grant element is the development aid component which
the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD recognizes
and registers statistically (and not the gross contributions).
All forms of development cooperation that operate successfully
with only small subsidies were in a statistical sense not particularly
attractive, since they did not accelerate the cash outflow, the
&quot;resource transfer&quot;. The Federal Ministry for Economic
Cooperation defines grant element as &quot;. . . the difference
between outright subsidy and transactions at market terms (assuming
a market interest rate of 10%). In the case of a nonrepayable
loan the &quot;grant element&quot; is 100% per cent; a 40year
loan bearing an interest rate of 0.75% per cent and including
a 10year grace period, has a grant element of 80.86% per cent;
a loan at 2% per cent interest and 30 year maturity with a 10year
grace period has a grant element of 66.14% per cent.&quot;
<P>
The average grant element of German development cooperation in
1990 amounted to 85.9% per cent. The DAC average is 86 per cent.
The term &quot;grant element&quot; infers that at the respective
percentage levels, development cooperation funds have the character
of donations. The justification for these donations is their alleged
positive impact on development.
<P>
The obvious questions are:
<UL>
<LI>Would it be possible to achieve a positive impact on development
with a substantially smaller grant element? Or:
<LI>Could a reduction of the grant element possibly have a greater
impact on development at the same development cooperation funding
level?
</UL>

<P>
<B>2. Revolving funds</B> 
<P>
Revolving funds do not provide grants but guarantee that (at the
very least) their capital is preserved. Consequently, they use
their capital only to make loans, or to invest it in shares. Since
the loans are repaid, and the stocks and bonds earn dividends
and interest, and are sold when necessary, the fund principal
is preserved and fund management expenses are covered. The IFC
(International Finance Corporation of the World Bank group) the
DEG (German Investment and Development Corporation), and other
similar institutes are such revolving funds (in the abstract sense).
They provide financing according to market principles. Therefore,
they must consider profitability; their fund capital is preserved,
and it revolves.
<P>
Since they operate according to private industry practices, the
grant element of their contributions is zero, or close to zero.
It is not completely zero because their profit margin does not
come close to capital market interest levels in Germany and the
OECD countries. Insofar, it may be argued that their promotion
includes a 35% per cent grant element. But even that is still
far below the grant element percentage of Financial (FC) and Technical
Cooperation (TC).
<P>
At this point, the argument may be made that TC and FC projects
frequently still have enough problems despite their large grant
element and would not stand a chance without their high donations.
Consequently, these projects could not be successful without a
grant element. However, this is the weakest point of the argument.
<P>
It is undisputed that both IFC and DEG have a positive impact
on development. The DEG came to this conclusion after a comprehensive
evaluation of its portfolio. The results of its evaluation were
made public. In its publication, the DEG demonstrates that its
promotion of private industry helps make private enterprise profitable
and therefore viable in the long term; private enterprise provides
employment and thereby creates income; its foreign exchange balance
is positive; it imports technological and managerial knowhow;
it diversifies the economic structure of the specific country,
and contributes to an improvement of the infrastructure. In addition,
it voluntarily though not necessarily unselfishly provides important
social services for its employees and thus functions as a model
for private industry in the respective countries. All this is
accomplished with an (almost) zero grant element.
<P>
Would this not suggest that German and international development
cooperation should shift much more heavily toward this form of
development assistance ,toward the instrument of &quot;revolving
funds&quot;? Why does the Federal Government continue to implement
TC and FC measures which cannot be &quot;successful&quot; without
a large grant element? Is it a fact that projects with a large
grant element have a greater proven and measurable effect on development
than those which are financed without grants? The author is not
aware of any such evidence.
<P>
Even if this were the case, would it not be wiser for the Federal
Republic and other &quot;donors&quot;, particularly in times of
tight budgets (but also in other times) to concentrate on instruments
that can operate without grant elements on a constantly revolving
basis? After all, &quot;to revolve&quot; means that the same amount
of money can positively affect development not just once, but
many times.
<P>
Another important aspect should not be overlooked: Outright as
well as partial grants have been known to very rapidly lead to
wanton use of scarce resources, to state consumption and unproductive
investments, to corruption and mismanagement and finally to indebtedness.
Market conditions, on the other hand, have a healthy disciplinary
effect.
<P>
<B>3. Guarantee Funds</B> 
<P>
The &quot;revolving&quot; concept can be further enhanced or optimized
if the fund's capital is not revolved, but used exclusively as
collateral to guarantee the loans of commercial banks.
<P>
The private Swiss foundation FUNDES (Foundation for Sustainable
Development in Latin America) is based on this concept. It has
established joint ventures with local FUNDES foundations in nine
Latin American countries. Its target group are small enterprises
with up to 50 employees, which do not have access to commercial
credits because of their lack of collateral. The FUNDES guarantee,
which is issued by the local foundation after it has evaluated
the project, is fully accepted as collateral by the local banks.
FUNDES foundations can issue guarantees up to a quintuple of their
capital. To ensure that these guarantees are not called, the FUNDES
foundations also provide management consulting services for their
clientele.
<P>
In 1992, 1120 small entrepreneurs obtained commercial loans with
the help of FUNDES guarantees. The credit volume was 1.6 million
US $; the average loan amount was US $10,000. FUNDES (Switzerland)
as well as the national foundations are funded with contributions
from private industry in Europe and Latin America. The guarantee
business itself is self sustaining: Actual defaults are very low
0.8% per cent. These defaults as well as current operating expenses
for fund management are offset by income from guarantee fees.
Of course, the guarantee capital also earns investment interest.
<P>
From a development standpoint, the following aspects are important:
<UL>
<LI>The grant element is practically zero; guarantees are &quot;fully
paid for&quot; by the fees charged.
<LI>The guarantee fund instrument has the important advantage
that it strengthens the local financial sector without disturbing
it. There is no intervention in the local process of savings formation
and loan disbursements.
</UL>

<P>
<B>4. Fund capitalization sets limits</B> 
<P>
The development of the FUNDES foundations demonstrates that the
expansion potential of this instrument whose development successes
need not be enumerated is limited by only one factor: The capitalization
of the guarantee funds. The same holds true for the IFC and DEG.
Therefore it is not at all surprising that the IFC, which increased
its loan volume in the last ten years from about 200 million US$
to 2 billion US$ and had great difficulty of late in raising additional
capital, now openly considers increasing it through higher investment
profits.
<P>
<B>Worker in a DEG supported company producing safety valves in
Bombay, India</B> 
<P>
It would also not come as a surprise if the DEG, whose business
plan called for an increase of its guarantee volume from about
300 million DM to approximately 1 billion DM in the 1990s and
which has been stagnating for years at a guarantee level of about
350 million DM due to capital shortages, would follow the IFC
example to replenish its capital. It would not be surprising at
all, but it certainly would be a big mistake for German development
policy, since the quality of development promotion would definitely
suffer at the IFC as well as the DEG.
<P>
Bundestag member Ingrid Walz has proposed that governments of
developing countries be allowed to make debt service payments
in their own currency, rather than have their debts forgiven,
and to use these counterpart funds to establish venture capital
funds denominated in the local currency. These funds could then
sponsor small entrepreneurs who only need local financing anyhow
<P>
This proposal concurs with the concepts of this article. Such
counterpart funds could function either as revolving or as guarantee
funds. All the above mentioned institutions FUNDES, IFC, and DEG
could easily manage such counterpart funds to promote the private
economy
<P>
5. <B>Restructuring of development cooperation </B>
<P>
Why is there no radical restructuring of development cooperation
to make increased use of revolving and guarantee funds? Why is
the totally inadequate 0.7 per cent goal conjured up again and
again? Why is more and more economic cooperation demanded, when
the main problem of present development assistance is after all,
to find worthy objects, promising projects?
<P>
Most likely, opponents will be quick to argue that private promotion
through revolving and guarantee funds will soon reach the limits
of its absorption capacity also, and that DEG, IFC, and FUNDES
will very soon encounter &quot;marketing problems&quot;. The response
is: Let's try it. Contrary to TC projects, which have a grant
element of 100 per cent such an experiment would not cost anything;
the principal, as has been shown, will be preserved. What are
the real reasons for the opposition to a radical restructuring
of development assistance in the direction of capital preservation?
The first reason is the 0.7 per cent goal and the concept of resource
transfer The second reason is the development assistance administration
establishment a system of entrenched turfs. Every budget director
in the government administration jealously guards his &quot;pot&quot;.
Every &quot;implementation organization&quot; fights for its share
of the development budget. The consulting industry has an ever
watchful eye on the vestibules of political decision making, on
party councils, and on parliamentary committees to find out whether
there is even the slightest mention of structural changes and
always demands, through its lobbyists, that the 0.7% per cent
goal be reached sooner, rather than later.

<P>
Worldwide discussion on the ineffectiveness of Technical Cooperation
(TC) has led to the decision to hold a conference, on the initiative
of the OECD, the World Bank and UNDP, on the subject of &quot;Improving
the Effectiveness of Technical Cooperation in the 90's&quot;.
The conference takes place in June 1994 in Paris. Two staff members
of the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) take up the
discussion.
<P>
The three so far most important contributions to the discussion
came from the OECD, UNDP and the World Bank. In response to criticism,
the OECD published its &quot;Principles for effective aid&quot;
in 1992. For UNDP, Elliot Berg took a critical look at TC, particularly
in Africa, in &quot;Rethinking Technical Cooperation&quot;, 1992.
In a wellreceived speech in May 1993 (&quot;Capacity building
the missing link in African development&quot;), Edward Jaycox
of the World Bank urged that, rather than sending out experts,
priority be given to the training of local development planners
and managers.
<P>
<B>An evaluation of TC criticism</B> 
<P>
The criticism of TC is on the whole under | standable in view
of the inadequacy of development aid faced with powerful security,
economic and political interests both in the North and in the
South. The hopes placed in development cooperation, however, were
often unrealistic and exaggerated. The sometimes oversimplified
criticism does not do justice, either to the complexity of problems
facing development support in Africa, or to the diversity of reasons
for failure which would require a more differentiated analysis.
<P>
In Germany, unlike other donor countries, Technical and Financial
Cooperation (FC) not only developed along different lines from
the outset, but also within separate organisations: the German
Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and the Reconstruction
Loan Corporation (KfW). This meant that TC in Germany was never
subordinate to FC, i.e. an accompanying or preparatory factor,
but was always able to concentrate on 'capacity building' in the
wider sense, that is, on increased efficacy through training and
further training programmes and the establishment and capacitation
of organisations, networks and selfhelp structures.
<P>
Following decolonisation, the new states were lacking in vital
historical, ethnic, economic and institutional requirements for
'nation building'. A broad variety of public services was, therefore,
supposed to improve the legitimacy of the new states in the eyes
of the population. Development Cooperation was used for the setting
up of government facilities whose economic and social coherence
or longterm stability was often insufficiently verified. It thus
shares the responsibility for the structural crisis in the partner
countries and within DC itself.
<P>
During the 80s, the severe worsening of the situation in many
partner countries made it clear that the welfare state concept
was unrealistic, particularly for the poorer countries. Structural
adjustment programmes designed to overcome the crises showed and
show insufficient effect. One consequence of the crisis, augmented
by structural adjustment, was a capacity decrease of the governmental
partners, which led to a rethinking of previously stateoriented
bi- and multilateral DC. In many countries, DC is now confronted
by a situation in which
<UL>
<LI>structural adjustment programmes have sometimes intentionally
weakened the state instead of underpinning its more vital functions;
<LI>at present neither sufficient financing nor the political
strength is available for the implementation of an urgently needed
basic redistribution of political capacities between a competent,
administrative state and a pluralistic array of organisations
for social development, and,
<LI>as long as the above remains unattained, DC serves nothing
more than the extension of an unacceptable situation, rather than
employing its potential for the furtherance of social change.
</UL>

<P>
The above problems apply to a greater or lesser degree to all
developing countries and to the transition states of eastern Europe,
particularly with reference to the participation of the population
in decisionmaking processes.
<P>
<B>Modern TC in changed circumstances</B> 
<P>
In future, it can no longer be the task of TC to ensure the prolongation
of unsustainable structures simply because these are needed at
the time for the securing of public services. Rather it is a question
of fulfilling the (historically and culturally determined) essential
tasks of the state. TC should support governmental partners in
the search for their new role. Where the state sets limits, complementary
nongovernmental structures and organisations must be set up, the
establishment and assistance of which should also be a task for
TC.
<P>
A form of TC with a sociopolitical function as described above
does not indiscriminately transfer a certain model, rather it
looks for adequate solutions together with the partner. It advises
its governmental partners in particular to admit and support giving
more participation and decisionmaking power to nongovernmental
structures. Capacity building, apart from being the training of
political management as favoured by the World Bank and UNDP, is
then the enabling of broad sections of the population to take
part in decisionmaking processes relevant to their own lives and
resources. It is in the balance between governmental and nongovernmental
fields that TC faces its main new challenge.
<P>
The greater the opportunities for a majority of people to participate
in the process of their own development, the more evident it becomes
that TC operates in a context of power and related interests.
This is where the political function of modern TC becomes important
and where it can use its potential in favour of participation,
pluralism and the reduction of poverty. TC as the promotion of
social diversification can only be said to have been successful
once the pluralist network can support itself without outside
aid.
<P>
<B>New concepts within the GTZ</B> 
<P>
New concepts and mechanisms have been developed within the GTZ
according to the perception of conditions and the changed role
of the GTZ as described above. They will be introduced in the
following as possible answers to the deficits of TC. The adaptation
of each to the structures of the society in question forms an
important aspect.
<P>
1. <B>Analysis of the interests of various participants:</B> 
<P>
TC projects are embedded in a multifarious system of development
problems, processes and interests, which necessitates a sensitive
analysis of the interests of various participants as well as the
use of relevant instruments (participant analysis, conflict management).
<P>
2. <B>Assignment of participants' roles:</B> 
<P>
Before beginning a project, the GTZ and the partner establish
which tasks for the attainment of project targets can be taken
on by target groups themselves, by NGOs or by private companies
instead of governmental bodies, and how decentralisation and private
enterprise management can relieve public and parastatal institutions.
<P>
3. <B>Promotion of pluralism on an institutional level:</B> 
<P>
Programmatic concepts are ideal here (rather than isolated projects).
The German side no longer aims to serve all regions and sectors,
but prefers to identify focal points in order to achieve synergetic
effects by working on different levels. 4. <B>Inclusion of NGOs:
</B>An increasingly important element of TC is the inclusion of
qualified NGOs with grassroots legitimisation as project partners.
The cooperation with NGOs from the developing countries as mediators
is at the same time a step towards lessening structural poverty.
<P>
5. <B>Transfer of adapted technology and knowhow:</B> 
<P>
The combination of local and external knowhow can often result
in a creative synthesis knowledge adapted to the problem in question.
A major undertaking for TC is to continue the development and
communication of new, adapted forms of technological development.
<P>
6. <B>Realistic planning through counselling of partners: </B>
<P>
One of the main points of criticism in evaluations is the overambitious
planning resulting in an unrealistic assessment of project targets.
The GTZ has therefore developed a mechanism known as the &quot;open
orientation phase&quot;. Should a partner government's project
application fail to clarify project concept and executing agencies
the GTZ offers a period of planning counselling with partner and
target groups.
<P>
7. <B>Project Cycle Management:</B> 
<P>
The GTZ has broadened participatory planing methods to form an
integral concept known as &quot;Project Cycle Management&quot;
(PCM). This includes the usual participatory, target oriented
project planning, a monitoring and evaluation system for every
project and further adjustable management mechanisms. Of increasing
importance for TC measures are participatory assessment and evaluation
methods (e.g. Rapid Rural Appraisal and Participatory Poverty
Assessment).
<P>
<B>a. Use of local knowledge:</B> 
<P>
Many local professionals nowadays have the necessary qualifications
to find the required solutions to problems themselves. In addition,
they have important knowledge of local institutions and their
interests. The GTZ now employs some 5,000 local staff. For some
time now, it has regularly used local experts in survey and evaluation
phases and trains local consultings in various fields.
<P>
9. <B>Support of key political figures:</B> 
<P>
A central problem of TC in Africa remains the departure of qualified
professionals from key public positions. The need to find a solution
to this problem is of utmost urgency wherever duties cannot be
transferred but the remuneration for the duties in question is
inadequate. This is particularly true of highranking civil servants
in decisionmaking positions. Direct, limited support for individuals
in such positions should be taken into consideration as a temporary
solution.
<P>
10. <B>Use of various TC instruments for appropriate problem solutions:
</B>
<P>
The GTZ supports development processes in almost 100 countries
with various development histories and various solutionfinding
capacities. The role of the experts and their professional profile
has been enlarged. In countries where solutionfinding capabilities
are already relatively high, external experts are needed as specialists
in the transfer and development of knowhow. In countries or situations
with relatively low problem solving capacities, the experts can
also act as agents in social change.
<P>
<B>Summary</B> 
<P>
Capacity building, in the broader sense described in the above,
remains the top priority for TC. In the next few years, competent,
politically sensitive, communicative and enthusiastic international
experts as well as the professional capacities and the experience
of development organisations will remain a necessity wherever
relevant solutions cannot be found in the pages of international
sales catalogues.
<P>
Countries in which the conditions for successful FC private enterprise
structures and acceptable public framework conditions are not
(yet) given, should nevertheless be allowed access to TC. Indeed,
herein lies a major challenge for TC in its sociopolitical role
for the development of pluralism and democracy.
<P>
Solution concepts drafted in the above cannot of course be initiated
immediately and in all situations. The notions and ideals, both
of decisionmakers on both sides and of many project workers, are
still characterised by the principles of the TC of the 70s and
80s. Concepts and mechanisms are for the most part in alignment
with the &quot;DAC Principles for Effective Aid&quot;, some go
beyond that.
<P>
The TC Conference planned for June will have to show whether the
international donor community, including such multilateral organisations
as the World Bank, the United Nations and the European Union,
cannot only agree on the guidelines laid down in the DAC Principles,
but can also pledge themselves to their implementation. In view
of the global shortage of resources for TC, their coordinated
and thus economic use has to be given priority over personal or
national interests. This would be the first serious step towards
a new generation of Technical cooperation. <HR>

<hr>
<P>
A wide variety of issues have been addressed by the participants
in the Working Group. We limit ourselves here to a selection of
interesting conclusions.
<P>
<B>1. Simplify management of Lom&eacute; instruments</B>
<P>
Lom&eacute; is endowed with a wide variety of instruments of financial
and technical cooperation. In theory, this diversity should allow
for much flexibility in adapting the support to specific country
needs. In practice however, great difficulties arise in using
this package of instruments in the most effective and coherent
way.
<P>
In the view of the working group there is nothing wrong with the
broad package of Lom&eacute; instruments for financial and technical
cooperation. Rather than abolishing instruments, they should be
simplified to ensure a better management by both the recipient
and the Commission. In recent years, the Post-Fiji study has already
pointed to major weaknesses in the implementation of Lom&eacute;
resources. Particularly in small and with capacity poorly endowed
ACP countries, the system does not work in practice. In many cases
this has led to an increasing weight of individuals (e.g. European
technical advisors) who are exercising a high amount of discretion
in deploying the EDF. Although discretion may favour some, it
was also seen as one of the real weaknesses of the system. 
<P>
<B>2. NIP must remain cornerstone of Lom&eacute; instruments</B>
<P>
In spite of the rapid increase of non-programmable resources in
recent years, a number of participants felt that the NIP should
remain central to all Lom&eacute; instruments. It is the instrument
&quot;par excellence&quot; of policy dialogue.  Programming remains
important since it ensures predictability, flexibility a relatively
low degree of conditionality and a match between demand and supply.
Others, however, criticised the &quot;obsessive attention&quot;
being paid to programming to mainly satisfy requirements of bureaucracy.
The programming process could be improved to ensure more cohesion
between all instruments. The practical value and effectiveness
of the NIP depends to a large extent of the way it has been integrated
in a global development vision of the ACP country. In the future
the basis for programming should be enlarged by sharing the NIP
with private sector and NGO's. The example was given of C&ocirc;te
d'Ivoire were a National Committee for the Management of the NIP
(&quot;Comit&eacute; National de gestion du PIN&quot;), comprising
private sector and civil society actors, has been created. It
was also stressed that coherence between NIP and RIP should be
strengthened and, even more importantly that both should not contradict
each other.
<P>
<B>3. Controversies about phased programming/incentive allocations</B>
<P>
The recent innovations in the use of financial and technical cooperation
(e.g. phased programming, incentive allocations) aroused considerable
controversy. In general it was felt that these innovations will
undermine the positive features of the Lom&eacute; programming
exercise (e.g. previsibility of funds, autonomy of the recipient
government,..). If the system would have worked adequately, these
innovations would not have been necessary. Participants mentioned
a number of risks involved with these new approaches:
<P>
* increase of leverage of the Commission on the policy dialogue;
<P>
* lack of transparancy on how the second tranche will be decided.
Adequate criteria have not yet been established;
<P>
* risk that ACP partners would be inclined to submit 'easy' short-term
projects (quick spending approach) instead of qualitative long-term
sustainable projects in order to ensure eligibility for the second
tranche; 
<P>
* increase of management problems at both sides. 
<P>
Standardised appraoches should be avoided to explain the underutilisation
of EDF funds by ACP countries. For each country one should try
to identify the main reasons for this (political problems? capacity
problems? at the ACP side, or at the level of DG VIII or at the
level of the delegation?, etc...). The working group also felt
that more work should be invested in measuring 'performance' of
ACP countries. In any case this should not be done by defining
purely quantitative targets (e.g. disbursement levels) but  qualitative
ones (e.g.economic reform, good governance, etc..).
<P>
<B>4. Differentiated approaches in the management of Lom&eacute;
instruments</B>
<P>
While co-decision (i.e joint programming of Lom&eacute; resources)
was seen as a prerequisite for effective cooperation, co-management
of aid programmes at the level of implementation was not considered
desirable. Experiences with the actual system of co-management
have been rather dissapointing with considerable delays caused
to a large extent by a lack of clear division of roles and responsibilities.
 To overcome these bottlenecks the group has proposed a differentiated
approach. In ACP states that are unable (because of political
or capacity problems) to manage Lom&eacute; resources well, a
larger degree of interventionism from the EC in various stages
of the project cycle could be justified. If the problem is purely
one of absorptive capacity (e.g. small Pacific islands), the provision
of institutional support that may help to create the necessary
conditions for effective implementation of the development programmes
by the ACP country, is considered necessary. In any case this
should be done in the framework of local administrative structures
and not through the creation of special management units or excessive
use of TC. In countries where the relations between the EU and
central government are flawed because of political reasons, decentralised
cooperation may be indicated. 
<P>
In another (and growing) group of ACP countries where the dialogue
is good and where trust exists, the working group strongly advocated
the principle that ACP countries should be responsible for managing
EDF funds on their own (&quot;full management&quot;). This could
also imply that instruments can be adapted to the provision of
direct budgetary support, with limited programming. It has been
strongly emphasised that, in a similar vein as the World Bank,
criteria should be developed for distinguishing different categories
of ACP countries for which different types of instruments can
be deployed (e.g. well governed countries, reforming countries,
countries in crisis,..)
<P>
<B>5. Coherent and integrated use of instruments</B>
<P>
Both programmable and non-programmable intruments retain their
validity. However, some concern was expressed over the increasing
weight of non-programmable instruments over the programmable instruments.
The integrated use of both types of instruments will depend to
a very large extent from a variety of country specific factors.
<P>
Some examples were given of well integrated use of both programmable
and non-programmable Lom&eacute; instruments (e.g. Ethiopia, Guyana,
C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire etc..).  Key ingredients for a well integrated
approach to Lom&eacute; resources included:
<P>
* ownership based on large inputs in fashioning the package by
the ACP country. In this respect it was clearly said that &quot;pushes
from the donor cannot make a difference. Only the ACP country
can make the difference&quot;;
<P>
* the institutional environment in the ACP country. The example
was given of C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire where coherence between various
instruments has significantly improved since the Prime Minister
coordinates EDF instruments as well as World Bank resources;
<P>
* absorption capacity. The example was given of some Pacific countries
were this was totally lacking;
<P>
* the quality of dialogue between the ACP government and the EU.
If there is a good &quot;entente between the trio&quot; (desk
officer, delegate, NAO) everything is possible.
<P>
<B>6. Direct support to non-state actors?</B>
<P>
The Working group fully recognised the validity of non-state actors
in Lom&eacute;. New requirements will need new instruments but
the working group strongly warned not to do this in an improvised
manner. A number of warnings were issued:
<P>
* do not go by doctrines. During thirty five years of development
cooperation we have been confronted with too many of these (e.g.
in the past central government planning doctrine, now decentralised
cooperation);
<P>
* look at multi-faceted aspects: With whom do you work : How do
you measure the representativity and legitimacy of non elected,
self appointed entities? How should these be made accountable?
<P>
To overcome the potential risks of working directly with these
new actors in development, the group proposed a three step approach:
<P>
* the EU must first have a strategy towards these non-state actors
that has been discussed with the ACP governments.
<P>
* second, a 'constituency analysis' with disaggregation of non-state
actors should be made (&quot;a who is who in civil society&quot;,
business and non-profit organisations with risk and opportunity
analysis). It is therefore important to check accountability and
to guarantee transparancy of non-state actors. ( e.g. care should
be taken that Northern NGO's do not 'hijack' EU funds that should
be provided to local NGO's.).
<P>
* third, mechanisms should be established for accessing and managing
Lom&eacute; funds by non-state actors. In this context a proposal
was formulated to create a special fund for the management of
decentralised cooperation through which all EU aid for non- state
actors would be tranferred 
<P>
<B>7. New instruments for conflict prevention and ensuring coherence</B>
<P>
The Group did not see any fundamental reason to equip future Lom&eacute;
Conventions with new conflict prevention instruments. Prior to
conflict outbreaks, existing institutions (Joint Assembly) could
play a useful role. Delegations could also be more pro-active.
But it was felt that other fora (such as OUA, UN) were more indicated
to deal with these issues. It was also strongly advocated to have
a stronger role of the EU in multilateral debt relief facility
which is hindring to a large extent the room of manoeuvre of ACP
governments.

<TR><TD>Abstract <TD>Technical co-operation (TC) as an instrument of development co-operation is in need for an overhaul. Despite enormous financial and personal resources which have been invested into TC for many years, the main target of TC, namely the building and strengthening of local capacities, was achieved to an insufficient extent. Compared to the expenses and measured by the policy aims formulated by those involved success remained rather humble. Among the reasons for the failure of essential progress in development to materialize, despite substantial input of TC, shortcomings in dealing as well as problems with efficient and coherent implementation of TC have to be emphasized. Incentives for a substantive redefinition of TC, country-specific and cost--effective applications of that instrument as well as parallel reduction of expatriate personnel combined with improved remuneration and efficiency of public administration in Africa were proposed as first steps in reforming TC. Largely existing reasonable reform proposals and initiatives regarding TC ought to be given speedy chances for systematic utilization. Hardly any alternative is left for the disorientated donor countries as well as for the institutionally feeble African states.

Clarifying Concepts as a Prelude to Action</h3>
by <i>Rogerio Pinto</i>
<p>
Full text of an article from <i>DPMN Bulletin, 2(3) December 1994: pages 6 - 7</i>
</center>
<hr>
<h3>Commitment, Ownership and Participation</h3>

The World Bank, along with most other donor agencies, now stresses the importance of country
commitment and ownership as critical to improving the quality of its project portfolio. But there
is a widespread failure to distinguish clearly between these two terms and thus a danger that the
processes required to achieve greater commitment and ownership will be less effective than
anticipated. The two are, of course, related concepts. But the difference between them needs to
be recognised as a basis for action.
<p>
Commitment to a project is associated with the intent of the leadership while ownership is
associated with the hands-on involvement (participation) of the rank-and-file who will have a
more direct effect on implementation activities.
<p>
<h4>Commitment</h4>

In the context of project preparation and implementation, commitment extracted from the
political leadership in borrowing countries is achieved through high-level consultation and
exchanges. It takes the form of declarations or enunciations of intent by the government. It may
also be reflected in policy acts or governmental statements.
<p>
But while commitment entails willingness to contribute to achieving outcomes by holding others
accountable for its outcome, it does not necessarily ensure ownership, nor respons- ibility for the
project.
<p>
<h4>Ownership</h4>

Where there is ownership of a project the owners will feel responsible and will care about
outcomes. If the outcome of the project is successful, owners will gain; if it is not successful,
owners will lose. Thus ownership goes beyond mere commitment. While commitment is
articulated in a declaratory manner, ownership is achieved through intensive interaction between
owners and the project.
<p>
All too often, donors incorrectly assume that where there is commitment at the highest level,
ownership by the rank-and-file will follow almost automatically. However, if it is accepted that
ownership is a higher order of involvement than commitment and that it needs to be achieved
rather than simply declared, then the need for participation in project preparation becomes more
evident.

<p>
<h4>Participation</h4>

Participation is, therefore, the means to ensure ownership of a project. It brings project
preparation closer to the people, in and outside of government, who determine the outcome of
implementation.
<p>
The importance of commitment is that it allows the project preparation process to get underway
leading to project approval. But it does not ensure project implementation. This requires that
preparation is undertaken in a participatory way, resulting in ownership.
<p>
In other words, you can have commitment without responsible ownership, but you cannot have
responsible ownership without commitment.
<p>
<h3>Institutional Environment Assessment</h3>

The process of Institutional Environment Assessment (IEA) has been developed in the World
Bank as a diagnostic procedure conducted by African governments as preparation for their civil
service reform programmes. However, the process has the potential for wider application to all
project activities.
<p>
IEAs build on commitment at the highest level but are designed to ensure ownership by all
concerned. Accordingly, the IEA provides a participatory process for project preparation
involving both senior and mid-level government officials. It creates opportunities for full
understanding of project objectives as well as for the shaping of these objectives.
<p>
The starting point for a participatory process designed to achieve ownership is to engage mid-level actors in diagnostic activities. This is a central objective of an IEA workshop which allows
these actors and other rank-and-file officials to be mobilised for the collection and analysis of
information on the environment to be targeted by a project. Thus the participants are brought in
at the ground level of project preparation and genuinely contribute to the shaping of the project.
While participation is very beneficial for ownership and improved project implementation, it
bears a cost. Participation increases expectations and projects can become more complex.
Furthermore, there is a need to keep participating players involved in project preparation which
entails a longer and therefore more costly process.
<p>
Participation involves donors working with officials and not merely with the political leadership
which gave its initial commitment to a project. But it is with this leadership that the World Bank
and most other donor officials typically interact. By following the IEA procedure, donors are
required to examine their own internal project cycle procedures so as to ensure that the costs and
benefits of ownership of project preparation are fully internalised by borrowers. 
<p>
The World Bank is currently introducing changes in its review procedures to streamline the
project cycle and make it more consistent with borrower participation, leading to genuine
ownership of projects.
<p>
<h4>An IEA in Practice</h4>

An IEA was conducted in The Gambia in the context of preparation of a Sector Adjustment
Loan. Both commitment and ownership were, to a large extent, achieved. Senior officials have
consistently demonstrated a high level of commitment and mid-level managers have continued
to be involved in project preparation activities to ensure ownership. It can be expected that both
commitment and ownership will be maintained throughout the project's implementation.

<title>Cooperation in Policy Reform</title>
</header>
<hr>
<H3><center><img src="../images/dpmf.jpg"><p></a>
Cooperation in Policy Reform</h3>
by <i>Derrick Brinkerhoff</i>
<p>
Full text of an article from <i>DPMN Bulletin, 2(3) December 1994: pages 8 - 9</i>
</center>
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
Cooperation between donor agencies and the poorer developing countries has become an area
increasingly characterised by dissatisfaction and disillusionment on both sides. Donors look at
cooperation and observe weak commitment to reform, feeble institutions, failed or partial
implementation, and limited results for the funds expended. Countries, from their perspective,
see cumbersome procedures for accountability, lack of flexibility, ambitious timetables and
targets, imposed technical solutions, and little sympathy for political realities. 
<p>
At no time in the past, however, have the needs of the developing world been greater, nor the
resources available from the industrial countries to deal with these needs scarcer. Furthermore
the post-Cold War era has introduced a new set of interests and players into the development
assistance equation, which is having a strong impact on the partnership between donors and
recipients. Adding even further complexity is the increasing recognition that many of the
problems facing our world are global and interconnected. No-one disagrees that development
cooperation needs to become more effective and efficient, the critical question is how to do it.
<p>
Obviously, there is no simple solution and this short essay does not purport to have one. The
problems of cooperation for development are multi-faceted and complex, and we need to
continue to search for the right questions as well as the answers. What is offered here is a process
perspective on policy reform and some suggestions on how that perspective can contribute to
improved donor-country cooperation in policy implementation.
<p>
<h3>Policy Reform as a Process</h3>

Many analysts have pointed out that a key factor in the difficulties with donor-country
cooperation for policy reform is a flawed perception of the policy process itself. Technocrats in
the international financial institutions and in developing country finance and/or planning
ministries have tended to view the policy process as mechanical and linear rather than political
and interactive.
<p>
This linear view places a premium on 'first-best' technical prescriptions, and the preparation of
detailed plans that follow predetermined steps once the decision to move ahead has been
negotiated. These steps then become the basis for releasing funds, judging success, and
determining accountability. When problems arise, remedies are sought by refining the technical
content of the policies and programmes and/or in seeking to build technical and analytic
capacity. The primacy of the technical fix is reinforced by the officially apolitical stance of
multilateral donors, as laid out in their charters, and by recipient governments' concerns for
sovereignty.
<p>
Experience has shown, though, that the policy process is at least as political as technical (if not
more so), and is multi-directional and highly interactive. Besides technical analysis and
prescription, the policy process calls for consensus-building, participation of key stakeholders,
compromise, contingency planning, and flexibility. Instead of identifying ideal solutions a priori,
the process perspective highlights the importance of iteratively developing 'second or third-best'
answers that stakeholders can agree on over the life of the policy. When problems are
encountered, addressing them turns on shared analysis and joint action, both inside and outside
of government, and on building strategic planning and management capacity along with technical
skills. In the liberalising political environment of many developing countries, the ability of
donors and/or governments to impose technical fixes for economic reform is vastly reduced.
<p>
Adopting an interactive process view of policy reform changes the nature of donor-country
partnership, moving it from an emphasis on conditionality to an emphasis on mutuality. This
change implies new opportunities and responsibilities for both partners. On the donor side, it
means assuring that policies and programmes have real constituencies along with the capacity
to begin to implement them. This implies greater selectivity in interventions, wider participation
in discussions of potential programmes intents and actions, more attention to specifying clear and
agreed-upon goals, and a willingness to suspend or withhold assistance if the constraints are too
binding.
<p>
On the country side, it implies governments being more responsible and accountable for
outcomes, not just to donors but to their own citizens, building broad constituencies for change,
and actively managing implementation to achieve results creatively, not just going through the
motions to reach targets. On both sides, a mutual partnership for development cooperation
indicates a more extended time horizon for reaching goals, which puts a premium on monitoring,
feedback, and adaptation.
<p>
<h3>Capacity-building for Policy Reform</h3>

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has supported technical
assistance and applied research over the past four years in the provision and refinement of
approaches and tools to help developing country policy-makers and implementors become more
strategic in designing and carrying out policy reforms.
<p>
The Implementing Policy Change project (IPC) has worked with governments, the private sector,
and NGO's in more than a dozen countries on various aspects of policy management. IPC uses
a process framework for strategic management that includes several steps: 
<ul>
<li>agreeing on a strategic process for developing a policy implementation strategy;
<li>mapping the policy situation, including analysis of political and operating environments,
policy content, and stakeholder expectations and resources;
<li>identifying key strategic issues;
<li>designing an implementation strategy;
<li>designing and applying a process to monitor progress and make ongoing adjustments.
</ul>
<p>
Helping developing country managers to understand and apply this framework and its
accompanying tools has contributed to building stronger local ownership for policy changes.
Furthermore, it has increased the capacity to respond to accountability requirements from donors.
An example illustrates one case of how strategic management capacity-building has taken place. 
<p>
<h3>A Case Study -- Zambia</h3>

In Zambia, IPC was asked to help set up a Policy Analysis and Coordination Division (PAC),
located in the Cabinet Office. PAC's mission is to serve the Cabinet with advice on policy
decisions and help the Cabinet to implement its decisions. PAC and a reformed Cabinet Office
are intended to contribute to the Zambian Government's effort to become more performance-driven and client-responsive.
<p>
Zambia is implementing a World Bank-IMF structural adjustment programme, which imposes
tight budgetary targets. Among the problems in meeting those targets is that sectoral ministries
frequently present proposals to the Cabinet requiring extra-budgetary expenditure. Without a
mechanism to review priorities and communicate them effectively, the Cabinet was poorly
equipped to deal with these requests and its decisions were often ignored, thereby creating
accountability problems with Zambia's donors. The IPC was intended to be this mechanism.
<p>
The IPC team worked with the Cabinet Secretary and the Cabinet Office, talking with them
about their vision of government and what was hampering its realisation. Jointly terms of
reference and an organisation chart for PAC were drafted. These were refined in discussions and
ultimately approved by the Secretary and the President. One month later, the formation of the
division was officially announced. 
<p>
PAC's four principal responsibilities are: to review proposals submitted to the Cabinet; to prepare
the minutes of Cabinet meetings; to monitor the implementation of decisions taken by Cabinet;
and to facilitate implementation of those decisions.
<p>
A workshop for PAC staff and the other senior Cabinet Office staff was held. To detail PAC's
tasks and explore relationships between PAC and the rest of the Cabinet Office. First we helped
participants conduct a stakeholder analysis, asking: Who are PAC's key stakeholders? Who is
interested in what PAC will do? Whom should PAC serve? Who might oppose PAC's activities?
What resources can the stakeholders mobilise for or against PAC? Then we helped the
participants to prepare an action plan to implement PAC's four areas of responsibility. We
conducted two more workshops with the Permanent Secretaries of line ministries. These
workshops presented PAC's mission and action plan, and addressed how PAC and the line
ministries could work together effectively. 
<p>
Once PAC had been operating for a year, gradually introducing new procedures, a workshop for
the Cabinet to review PAC's performance was held. It explored the Cabinet's expectations of
PAC, and discussed innovative ways the Cabinet might conduct its business. IPC continues to
work with PAC staff to set up systems to monitor PAC's performance and the impact of Cabinet
policy decisions.
<p>
While it is too early to assess the institutionali- sation of this strategic management approach,
some progress has been made in increasing the Zambian government's capacity to implement its
structural adjustment programme. The rambling Cabinet meetings of a year ago, which often
lasted till midnight and even then failed to resolve issues, have been replaced by far less
contentious meetings that finish before lunch. The government task force on structural
adjustment now sends its recommendations to the Cabinet so that important but difficult
decisions can receive its collective support, rather than be rejected by ministers who were never
consulted. Line ministries now hold daily informal consultations with Cabinet Office staff during
the preparation of policy proposals, and this has increased efficiency in making decisions on
those proposals.

International development cooperation:<br>
Towards a new world of partnerships

<b>
International development cooperation has come to a crossroads. The steady increase in official development assistance the world has known over the last decades has come under mounting pressure. Indeed, official ODA has declined in real terms in recent years. The next replenishment of IDA is imperilled by the US Congress. Bilateral flows are threatened by budget cuts. The difficulties experienced in negotiating the Lom&#233; IV second financial protocol portend an increasingly complex challenge in the future. Finally the UN system for operational activities is facing serious difficulties in maintaining, let alone increasing, resource levels.</b>
<p>
	The reasons for this retrenchment have been analysed and debated by many commentators. There seems broad agreement about at least some of the factors. The end of the Cold War has deprived development cooperation of support based on realpolitik considerations. Indeed for Keith Griffin, 'without the Cold War, it would have been impossible to generate the domestic political support in the donor countries necessary to sustain foreign assistance for more than four decades.'
<p>
	Linked to the end of the Cold War has been a significant rise in intra-state violence, leading in some cases to the disintegration of states and major ethnic strife. This has led to big increases in resources for peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance. The budget implications for the UN have been dramatic.  Peacekeeping costs have risen in five years from $278 million to about $3.5 billion. Of the ODA channelled through the UN, the percentage spent on emergencies has gone from 25% to over 45%. These realities have clearly had a significant and direct pressure on resources earmarked for development budgets.
<p>
	These budgets have, in any case, been faced with the challenge of the increasing fiscal austerity among donor countries as the latter confront deficits inherited from the free spending 1980s. At a time of cuts, funds earmarked for development are an attractive scapegoat for pressurised politicians. Another element is the increasing questioning of the case for development cooperation. There is disillusionment with the results. Has the money been well spent? The cry is for trade, not aid; democracy and free trade, so the argument goes, are the true harbingers of sustainable development.
<p>
<h3>The 'CNN' factor</h3>

	A final element which compounds the others may be summarised as the 'CNN factor'. Instant images of human tragedies, flashed across the world, have arguably had the beneficial impact of mobilising public opinion in support of humanitarian intervention. In comparison to the immediacy of emergencies, long-term development challenges that take a sustained and patient approach fade from the popular imagination. The immediacy of the one becomes the unpopularity of the other. You cannot measure development - you cannot feel and see it - so why do it?
<p>
	The pressures are being felt by the entire development practitioner community. These represent challenges - but ones that can be met assuming an adequate international response. The end of the Cold War provides far-reaching arguments for boosting development cooperation, not weakening it. In the complex realities of the post-cold war period, investments in human security seem as vital as investments in national security were a decade ago. Squeezing national budgets cannot, in the long run, be translated into abdicating international responsibilities - not in a world where in the last 30 years, the ratio between the richest and poorest 20% of the world's population has increased from 30:1 to 60:1. The cry for trade and not aid is too simple; both are needed; they fulfil different and indeed complementary roles. And we must face the facts. In 1994, 75% of direct foreign investment  went to just 12 countries. Only 6% went to Africa and just 2% to the least developed states. Finally images are just that - they need to be confronted with realities.
<p>
	The issue today is not whether arguments exist to put development cooperation back on the international agenda. The arguments abound. The question is whether the international community will rise to the challenge. And to some extent the answer will lie in the approaches adopted by the various players - the bilateral donors, the Bretton Woods institutions, the EU, the USA and numerous NGOs among them. There has been a remarkable similarity in the responses of the various actors to date. The 1950s and 1960s were the heyday of decolonisation and development cooperation was largely seen then as a transfer of resources to newly independent countries. The colonial past entitled countries to these transfers and Cold War realities dictated the direction and volume of the flows. National development plans established priorities and resource transfers were provided to support these. While interdependence became an increasingly fashionable concept in the 1970s, globalisation had still not made it into the practitioners' daily repertoire.
<p>
	The shift that began in the 1980s, and has since accelerated, can be traced in the evolution of development policy virtually across the board among donors. New keywords in the lexicon include thematic focus, performance criteria and coordination. The UNDP provides an excellent example of this evolution. The Programme was conceived in the 1960s and was very much a product of its time. It financed activities as requested by governments. Amounts called Indicative Planning Figures (IPFs) were preallocated according to objective criteria. There were no global thematic priorities to be applied. Coordination was, to a large extent, a function of government development planning.
<p>
	The UNDP underwent a series of changes during the 1980s culminating today in a significantly different profile. Now, it is mandated with specific thematic objectives such as poverty elimination, women, jobs and the environment. Good governance is acknowledged as indispensable in the development process. Only some 30% of the UNDP's total core resources and under 20% of its overall resources are definitively committed to specific countries. Final allocations are now linked to programme performance on the basis of clearly defined criteria. This is neither 'politicisation' nor the imposition of conditionality on the Programme - but it does provide an incentive for substantive performance and ensures that resources get channelled to those best prepared to make optimal use of them. As a corollary, UNDP has increasingly focused on the need for a programmatic as opposed to a project approach and for increased coordination.  It has become evident that the pursuit of thematic objectives requires such an approach, which involves coordination at a quite different level.
<p>
	The EU's experience appears to have been similar. Here the drive for a more focused and coordinated approach to development was crystallised in the Maastricht Treaty. This firmly placed sustainable development, the integration of developing countries into the world economy, poverty alleviation and the consolidation of democracy at the heart of EU development strategies. It also concentrated the minds of legislators, policy analysts and practitioners alike on how different dimensions of these issues should be addressed. Reflecting a climate in which there is increasing pressure to boost the quality of ODA and render it ever more efficient, it also triggered the current emphasis on what Commissioner Pinheiro has called the 'the 3 C's'; coherence, coordination and complementarity.  In so doing, it signalled the potential for a new era of productive partnerships between development practitioners - at the level of policy coordination, in international fora and most importantly, in the field.
<p>
<h3>Policies converge</h3>

	The UN and EU experiences have found similar expression in most if not all the major bilateral programmes. A quick review of these indicates a strong convergence on the thematic focus. Issues such as democracy, good governance, women, poverty elimination and the environment are found repeatedly. This is hardly surprising.  In the end, it is largely the same governments, using the same taxpayers' money, that fund the various instruments - the EDF, the UNDP, the Bretton Woods bodies, the NGOs and the bilateral programmes.
<p>
	Is this the answer then?  Has the case for development been remade?  Does the projection of global challenges and themes responding to the new realities suffice to ensure the future of development cooperation? It certainly seems reasonable to assume that globalisation holds the key to the future. It is the implications of this trend on the ground that remain to be absorbed by the practitioners.
<p>
	Our concluding proposition follows from the above. The adoption of a thematic focus requires new and strong development partnerships. This is the only way we can meet the challenges now confronting development cooperation. When a large number of agencies commit themselves to fighting HIV-AIDS, more than coordination is required. What is needed is a substantive programme partnership. When numerous donors want to support preventive diplomacy in a crisis area, there must be a concerted programme. And let there be no mistake - sustainability and capacity-building require full national and local participation in each one of these programmes.
<p>
	Globalisation has thrown up global challenges - the response must be to forge global partnerships. If this does not happen, development cooperation will indeed become marginalised. This is the broader significance of the series of World Conferences that have taken place over the last five years - on Human Rights, Environment, Population, Social Development and Women.  Global partnerships must be just that - between programme countries, interested donors and players in civil society, especially the private sector and NGOs. They must take account of actors at the global, regional, country, subregional and local levels. This is the only way that the case for development can be remade and we can realistically strive to achieve structural stability.
<p>
	The experience with the Angola Round Table, held in Brussels in September  provides an excellent example. The successful outcome was due to the collective efforts of the Angolan Government, UNITA, the UN Secretary General's Special Representative, the European Commission, the UNDP, the Belgian Government and others. What happened was that each participating body made its own unique and vital contribution. And the whole turned out to be much greater than the sum of the parts. In short, the UN and EU both have indispensable and complementary roles to play if the emerging challenges to development cooperation are to be successfully turned into new opportunities. Unilateralism, in whatever form, will surely not be the rallying call for the new millenium.

<hr>
<P>
The group worked through the four sessions as they were detailed
in the annotated agenda.
<P>
<B>I The historical and conceptual background to the notion of
Partnership</B>
<P>
The first (thorny) question to be considered by the Group was
the definition of partnership and the appropriateness of using
this term to describe the Lom&eacute; relationship.
<P>
<I><B>1. Diagnosis of the erosion of partnership</B></I>
<P>
The participants appeared to agree on the diagnosis of the erosion
of partnership during the 20 years of the Convention. 3 <U>politicohistorical</U>
interpretations were presented:
<P>
* The first is based on the concept of a pendulum motion, according
to which the relationship has shifted from one extreme  in which
responsibility was vested in ACP partners  to the opposite extreme
of paternalism. The danger highlighted by this approach was a
tendency by the EU to take over from its partners under the guise
of achieving greater efficiency.
<P>
* The second interpretation focused on the evolution of Articles
4 and 5 of the Convention, which requires a compromise between
ACP priorities and those of European Union development policy.
Certainly the objectives of the Maastricht Treaty referred to
in Article 4, which are of a universal nature, are not in conflict
with ACP interests. However, in order to avoid friction, particularly
in the political sphere  human rights/democratisation (c.f. Niger)
 mechanisms need  to be found which will ensure compatibility
of priorities while preserving the prerogatives of the ACP side.

<P>
* The third interpretation stressed the intrinsically political
nature of the original partnership: in order to preserve the partnership,
it is necessary to find a political raison d'&ecirc;tre for the
relationship.
<P>
<I><B>2. Partnership and the lack of cohesion within the ACP and
EU groups</B></I>
<P>
The lack of cohesion within the two sides of the partnership was
identified as one of the causes for the ineffectiveness of Lom&eacute;
co-operation and a manifestation of the erosion of partnership:
<P>
On the ACP side, the group was considered by some to be too large,
even though very categorical positions were taken to defend the
integrity if not of the entire group at least of its three component
parts. The aim of the latter approach is to preserve a political
weight against Europe: there is a certain intraACP solidarity
even in the absence of concrete common interests shared by the
3 component parts. Several options were considered: differentiation
within the group in matters of trade in particular, extension
to include other Least Developed Countries, the creation of free
trade areas with certain subgroups. The option of regionalization
of the Convention on the basis of the present regional groups
was greeted with great reserve: the groupings of countries within
the ACP are far from definite or firmly rooted.
<P>
On the European side, two lacunas were emphasised, relating to
co-ordination between the EU donors and to the coherence between
EU commitments under the Lom&eacute; Convention and the other
policies which it is pursuing (including the integration of the
Bretton Woods requirements in the implementation of Lom&eacute;).
With regard to the first aspect, a path was indicated: using strategy
documents (documents studying the lessons of the past and future
trends in the countries and regions with which the EU is co-operating)
in order to achieve better co-ordination of European policies
and substantially involve the partner countries in the discussion.
<P>
<I><B>3. Partnership, Solidarity or Common Interests?</B></I>
<P>
The adequacy of the term partnership to describe Lom&eacute; co-operation
was the subject of lively discussion.
<P>
The starting point was the erosion of this partnership: some thought
it should be revitalised and that the term should be retained;
others thought it essential to stop sticking on a label devoid
of meaning and to consider the motivation for co-operation: solidarity
and common interests. The legitimacy of these two terms was discussed:
the first requires that the effectiveness of the aid should be
clear to the European contributors and entails the danger of drifting
into the untenable concept of  'charity'. The second is more difficult
to determine, with the exception of the wellknown negative interdependencies.
It was noted that interest in co-operation was a particular rather
than a common interest, each party co-operating because it has
an interest in doing so (generally not shared by the other party):
an example of this is the particular interest of the EU in the
return of aid (tied aid, contracts, employment in Europe) and
in market and investment opportunities (the interests of Japanese
and American investors were underlined).
<P>
The impression which emerged was that if partnership is  limited
to financial and technical co-operation, the term is inadequate,
as the relationship is one of assistance and the interest of the
parties is measured according to the balance of an equation of
costs and benefits. According to one of the participants, it is
necessary to reintroduce a more global political connotation,
a  &quot;joint project&quot;. The dimension of reciprocity of
rights and obligations should be enhanced.
<P>
<B>II New political principles of partnership</B>
<P>
The discussion at the second session was mainly concerned with
the political dialogue, the political foundations of the relationship,
and also with the relationship between partnership and development.
<P>
<I><B>1. Political aspects of partnership</B></I>
<P>
The Group considered a number of questions, in particular the
rationale for the politicisation of the Convention and the themes
to be discussed within the framework of a political dialogue between
adults. The question of good governance and democracy was considered
from the point of view of implementation.
<P>
<I> The politicisation of the Lom&eacute; Convention</I>
<P>
It is interesting to note an apparent contradiction in the discussion.
On the one hand, during the first session, there was an intervention
stressing the erosion of the political nature of partnership;
this was not contradicted. During the second session, on the other
hand, everyone agreed that there was a politicisation of the Convention
due to the strengthening of the human rights and democracy clauses
and the institution of the political dialogue. This contradiction
is outweighed by the fact that the politicisation of the Convention
is felt to have been a political dictate imposed on one party
by the other, rather than a political agreement negotiated between
equal partners. The politicisation of the Convention is an inevitable
phenomenon, bearing in mind the increasing politicisation of one
of the two partners, the European Union, and the changes which
have taken place on the international stage. The problem is to
get the ACP side to accept this politicisation, introducing a
change in the nature of the relationship and including themes
important to the ACP countries. 
<P>
<I> Partnership and political dialogue</I>
<P>
The keywords running through this discussion were  'frankness'
(according to D. Frisch  it should be possible to say things to
one other even if they are 'unpleasant') and mutual commitments.
Partnership is them transformed from a relationship between a
donor and a recipient into an adult relationship based on a contract
imposing obligations on both sides. The political dialogue should
make it possible to identify the common interests and objectives
and also the roles of the two parties. Partnership should also
include themes which go beyond development co-operation i.e. questions
such as security, prevention and resolution of conflicts. Political
dialogue should in fact be reinforced and made more obvious to
public opinion.
<P>
<I><B>2. Partnership and development</B></I>
<P>
Co-operation under Lom&eacute; is primarily about development
co-operation. The relationship between political partnership and
development was discussed at length focusing on: the 'benefits'
of development, planning of development and the interaction with
the donors, the establishment of criteria for good governance,
how to break with the culture of automatic allocation.
<P>
<I> Are the 'benefits' of development shared?</I>
<P>
The aspect of benefit to the Europeans as a result of development
co-operation was discussed by a number of ACP participants, who
called for studies to be carried out on this point. Reserves were
expressed on the European side, stressing that statistical analyses
entail the risk of a higher rate of return being indicated in
certain countries and in particular the risk of a return unequally
distributed between the various member states of the EU, thus
reinforcing nationalist attitudes with regard to European aid.

<P>
 <I>Partnership and development strategies</I>
<P>
A plea was made both by someone from the nongovernmental sphereand
by an ACP public representative in favour of implementing national
or regional development strategies. In order for development co-operation
to take place on a basis of partnership, it is necessary for the
donors to intervene in support of national strategies; however,
planning has acquired, in recent years, a negative connotation,
pushing ACP governments to think in terms of structural adjustment
deadlines and neglect longterm development due to lack of time
and resources. Support from the EU in the conception and implementation
of strategies (including politically in relation to other donors)
would be necessary and appreciated. A call was also made for the
concentration of development co-operation.
<P>
 <I>Flexibility and partnership</I>
<P>
The question of how to break with the 'entitlement culture' while
at the same time avoiding the dictates of the donor was of course
a controversial matter. Programming is in fact a guarantee that
a strategy exists and it also provides the predictability necessary
for the countries. Two questions were considered: What are the
criteria for the allocation of aid? What are the criteria for
performance? On the first question, the option to 'start from
zero' and to allocate aid according to objective criteria was
contested. Two criteria should be used: first the needs of the
country (national allocation and poverty criterion. The 'acquis'
of the Maastricht Treaty  Article 130 U  were quoted in this connection)
and subsequently assignment on merit.
<P>
The judgement of  'merit' should not be based on a quantitative
absorption capacity but rather on the commitment of the country
to pursue a course of good management of its affairs. The question
of democracy was approached with some caution, particularly by
the European side. On the ACP side the commitment in favour of
democracy was very strong and emphasised two requirements: the
necessity for sustainable democratisation, based on the 'ownership'
of this principle by the people, and the necessity of receiving
support from the European partners in what was called a  'longdistance
race'.  Good governance seemed to be a more acceptable and more
quantifiable concept. However, although the Group agreed on the
fact that evaluation of the performance of  'governance' should
be carried out collectively in accordance with objective criteria,
these criteria were not established and it was recommended that
policy research centres should consider the question.
<P>
<B>III Partnership and management of development co-operation</B>
<P>
On the theme of the management of development co-operation, the
starting points for the discussion were the observation that there
is a certain sluggishness in the system of comanagement, that
there is a lack of transparency and that a state and institutional
monopoly of the Convention is no longer desirable. Nonetheless,
it is necessary to ensure that efficiency  seen as a faster flow
of spending on aid  does not take precedence over partnership
and longterm development.
<P>
 <I>Partnership and participation by other actors in society</I>
<P>
It is no longer the generally accepted view that partnership is
something involving only the EU and governments: partnership should
also be seen in relation to representatives of civil society and
the private sector. It is necessary to involve and consult representatives
of the social and economic sphere: pleas were made for a more
open attitude on the part of the delegations in the field and
reinforcement of the capacities of co-ordinating NGOs. However,
implementation of this participation has to contend with various
obstacles: the sovereignty of states in their internal organisation,
although the International Convention against Desertification
(Article 21), which enjoins the signatories to involve economic
and social actors, was presented as an option for the revision
of Lom&eacute;; the representativeness and thus the accountability
of the actors chosen; the danger of the collapse of development
strategies pursued by the state, public bodies, civil society
groupings or economic operators. 
<P>
 <I>Partnership and programming</I>
<P>
Two recommendations were made in this connection: First of all
a very strong plea was made to safeguard national programming
and the national allocation of funds (NIP): indeed the existence
of national programmes provides a management framework which remains
extremely useful and requires a mediumterm strategy to be drawn
up, even if it only concerns EDF funds. The predictability of
the funds allocated, or at least part of them (phased allocation)
is highly important. Secondly, a call was made for the democratisation
of programming by opening it up to other actors in development.
Such an exercise would permit better allocation of priorities
(through consultation with operators who know the requirements
and constraints in the field) and greater transparency: the operators
thus involved are in a better position to check the implementation
of the priorities agreed on with the national government.
<P>
 <I>Partnership and joint management</I>
<P>
Again in relation to opening up the Convention to other actors,
joint management of the funds (within the framework of NIP) by
the central authorities and other actors (associations and NGOs,
private sector, decentralised public bodies) was proposed. One
option would be to place certain funds, where State presence is
essential, under joint management and to leave other funds entirely
to the private sector, public bodies, social representatives,
limiting the role of the State to the essential role of checking
the results. 
<P>
 <I>Flexibility and performance</I>
<P>
The system of comanagement by the ACP countries and the European
Union is extremely sluggish and bureaucratic. Placing management
of aid in the hands of the donor would imply a major step backwards
in the partnership. Co-management should therefore be maintained
as it is but it should be made more flexible: there is at the
present moment a surfeit of administration which is absorbing
most of the time and resources the ACP governments. The option
preferred by the Group was to link good performance on the part
of the beneficiary of the aid to increased responsibility acquired
through progressive budgeting of the aid. This means that if a
country manages its affairs well, the Community funds can be fed
directly into its national budget. A system of this kind, founded
on mutual trust, assumes the existence of a real dialogue on the
policies followed by the country benefiting from the aid, so that
it is possible to check that the aid is being well used. 
<P>
 <I>'De-bureaucratisation' and simplification of aid</I>
<P>
This can be achieved by more delegation in the field, by the progressive
introduction of aid budgeting (see above) and by a simplification
of existing procedures. This simplification could be effected
not only in respect of Community aid but also in the case of bilateral
aid from member states of the European Union.
<P>
 <I>Followup and evaluation</I>
<P>
As an indispensable corollary to a system based on greater responsibility
of the partners, there should be a more careful followup of activities
undertaken and a joint evaluation of the impact achieved: this
is essential in order for both the donor and the receiving state
to be accountable to their people regarding how the resources
have been used.
<P>
<B>IV European responsibilities in a new partnership</B>
<P>
It was agreed without discussion that greater coherence is needed
between the EU development policy and other common policies. The
debate concentrated on two elements: the role of the ACP group
in protecting the interests of its members in international bodies,
and the support expected from the European Union. The Debt issue
was stressed most particularly.
<P>
 <I>The protection of ACP interests on the international stage:
a responsibility of the group...</I>
<P>
The lack of an international dimension within the ACP group was
strongly regretted: the group seems to exist only in relation
to the ECU 14.6 billion from the Convention. The policies and
constraints which weigh on the ACP countries are decided in Washington
and in Geneva. The group should organise and mobilise itself in
order to protect its interests in these places.
<P>
<I> ... that should be supported by its European partners</I>
<P>
Partnership will be an empty concept if the European part of the
equation (i.e. the European Commission and the 15 Member States)
does not demonstrate solidarity with its ACP partners in the defence
of their interests and of common points of view in the Bretton
Woods institutions and the WTO. Indeed the EU is a heavy weight
in these fora: 50% of ODA, greatest chunk of votes in the financial
institutions, first trade block. The case of Structural Adjustment
was put forward: the Europeans should use their leverage to put
forward their views on structural adjustment in the Bretton Woods
institutions and to implement them in the bilateral policies of
the Member States. 
<P>
<I> The debt issue</I>
<P>
The case of debt was singled out in the discussions. As a matter
of fact, as long as this issue is not solved, the development
of ACP countries is compromised. The support of the EU has been
requested in this respect: although EDF does not increase the
debt of the ACP, the latter do expect the European Commission
to put the issue on the agenda of the Member States in particular.
This case exemplifies a major challenge to the solidity of the
ACP-EU relation: that of the integration of structural development
problems in the partnership.

<title>Partnership in Agricultural Research</title>
</header>
<hr>
<H3><center><img src="../images/dpmf.jpg"><p></a>
Partnership in Agricultural Research</h3>
by <i>Steven Tabor</i>
<p>
Full text of an article from <i>DPMN Bulletin, 2(3) December 1994: pages 12 - 13</i>
</center>
<hr>
<h3>The Historical Background</h3>
The development and diffusion of new technologies is perhaps the single most important source
of long-term growth in low-income agrarian societies. Helping developing economies reach their
full technological potential is one of the reasons why donors have historically provided aid to
agricultural research. The fact that the majority of the world's poor reside in rural areas and
depend on agriculture for their main source of livelihood are other factors explaining this
commitment to agricultural research. 
<p>
Over the past four decades, donors have invested heavily in building agricultural research
capacity. During the 1950's and 1960's, aid was mainly used to train scientists and to equip
national research systems. In retrospect, this can be considered the 'bricks-and-mortar' heyday
of international assistance to agricultural research. During these years, spending on agricultural
research increased by close to 9% per year and the numbers of trained scientists rose by almost
12% each year.
<p>
In the 1980's, the emphasis in development assistance to agricultural research shifted in two
important respects.
<p>
First, the development agenda shifted from building institutional capacity and resolving
structural constraints to growth, to 'getting policies right'. That policy reform was long overdue,
and that governments caught in the vice of balance of payments disequilibrium had little choice
but to use aid to stabilise financial markets, cannot be contested. At the same time, however, this
contributed to a diversion of aid resources away from agricultural development in general, and
in many countries, from agricultural research in particular. As a result, growth in research
spending slowed while development of scientific manpower continued at a relatively brisk pace.
Many agricultural research systems began to be plagued by severe financial imbalances,
characterised by considerable physical and human-capital capacity, but with inadequate
operational resources to utilise it.
<p>
Second, aid terms hardened (in a qualitative sense) during the 1980's. Aid projects to agricultural
research began to demand more emphasis on environmental sustainability, women-in-development and participation of non-governmental organisations. As the policy dialogue began
to touch on matters of public sector management, agricultural research projects were used as a
means of fostering private-sector development and reforming technology policies. Increasingly,
research aid projects became centred on changing processes, be it institutional management,
policy direction or the technology environment, rather than investment in tangible assets. 
<p>
As funding for agricultural research began to stagnate, it became clear that past investments were
not financially sustainable, or at least could not be sustained at a reasonable level by
governments mired in fiscal crisis. The degree to which expensive investments in agricultural
research facilities and trained personnel became grossly under-utilised contributed to a sense of
cynicism and resentment on the part of aid donors and recipients alike. But at the same time, the
need for new technologies to address rural poverty and meet developing country food needs
remained largely unchanged.
<p>
<H3>Some Lessons from Experience</h3>

Three lessons stand out from this brief summary of aid experience for agricultural research.
<p>
First, development assistance will be biased towards the public sector, to new investments and
to activities that can be tackled within a relatively modest time-frame.
<p>
Second, development priorities will shift, and as they do, countries face the risk that high-cost
investments cannot be sustained. 
<p>
And third, donor spending priorities are far more subject to change than are the underlying
development problems and challenges faced by recipient countries.
<p>
<h3>Implications for Country-donor Partnership</h3>

How then can country-donor partnerships be forged to make an effective and long-lasting
contribution to economic growth and development? Many measures have been proposed which
would change the ground rules under which aid is negotiated or implemented. Leaders of donor
agencies have suggested, for example, a halt to technical assistance to Africa, creation of new
institutions to manage policy dialogue, and increased attention to project design and supervision.
While some of these measures might improve aid effectiveness, one can question whether they
would in fact result in a meaningful change to the aid environment as a whole.
<p>
It may well be that the aid environment is far more resistant to change than aid insiders would
like. As in all long-standing, bureau- cratic systems, forces in favour of inertia are strong indeed.
If the aid environment is not likely to change very much, or will change in ways beyond the
control and foresight of both donors and recipients, then the appropriate partnership strategy
would be for all parties concerned to learn from past experience and adjust to an evolving aid
climate.
<p>
Aid recipients and donors alike would be best advised to forge strategic, time-bound,
partnerships to tackle particular tasks. That long-term relationships might evolve would be more
a product of serendipity than of deliberate policy. In such cases, the best partnership solution
would arise when aid donors and recipients try to match financing requirements, priorities, aid
utilisation capacity and implementation strengths. Some of these different attributes, upon which
partnerships could be forged, are shown in the table below.
<p>
<center>                         
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=8>

<tr><th></th><th>Criteria on Which Partnership can be Forged</th><th></th></tr>
<tr><th></th><th>Donor Attributes</th><th>Recipient Attributes</th>
<tr><th>Financing supply/demand</th><th>Short-term or long-term<br>

</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
If a good fit can be found between a country's needs and a donor's assistance instruments, then
a partnership should be forged. In many cases the fit between aid-agency and recipient nation
attributes will be far from perfect. In these cases, the objective becomes one of searching for
satisfactory partnerships, directing those partnerships to tackle particular tasks, assessing and
remoulding such partnerships as both donor mandates and country requirements evolve.
Flexibility in forming and redefining partnerships may be the best-fit for countries, and their
donor partners, as the aid climate evolves in the 1990's.

<hr>
"Partnership" is the politically correct description for most forms of development cooperation.
It refers to a shared commitment to tackle development problems on the basis of an agreed
division of tasks and responsibilities. Through partnership, it is claimed that southern partners
are responsible for their own development and that donor agencies have supportive roles only.
Donors and recipients alike preach its benefits, and all claim to practise it. 
<p>
Partnership has turned out to be very difficult to implement. It is often not clear what it really
means and who should be responsible for what. Recipient ownership is hard to combine with
donor accountability. Donors look at their partners and observe weak commitment to
development, institutional decline, poor accountability systems, and aid addiction. They respond
with hands-on approaches, despite evidence of their limitations. Developing countries see little
sympathy for political realities, many conditionalities, too much bureaucracy and too little policy
coherence.
<p>
In the current political climate, aid agencies are under pressure to re-think the nature of their development
cooperation. Their electorates expect value for money, efficient management, and evidence of impact. There are
numerous reports and evaluations on how to improve aid effectiveness, but the aid sector has generally been
reluctant to learn from past failures and best practice. The credibility crisis in development cooperation is reflected
in the decline of aid budgets.
<p>
ECDPM invited 45 participants from developing countries, donor agencies, parliaments, non-
governmental organisations, and the research community to attend a Round Table. Three
questions were on the agenda. Is partnership still a useful approach, how can both recipient
ownership and donor accountability be combined, and how can changes in the aid system be
achieved? 
<p>
This brief summarises the discussions. It reviews the pressures on partnership and contradictions
in the aid system. It argues that there is no alternative to partnership, but that the concept needs
redefining. Suggestions are made on how this can be done in the management of development
programmes. Finally, it analyses strategies to accelerate the desired reforms.

<title>A Perspective from an International NGO</title>
</header>
<hr>
<H3><center><img src="../images/dpmf.jpg"><p></a>
A Perspective from an International NGO</h3>
by <i>Hugh Goyder</i>
<p>
Full text of an article from <i>DPMN Bulletin, 2(3) December 1994: pages 10 - 11</i>
</center>
<hr>
<h3>Is Partnership still Valid and Feasible?</h3>

International NGO's have a mixed experience of partnership. The word became fashionable
during the 1980's as Southern NGO's became more critical of their Northern partners, and
traditional dependency relationships between donors and recipients were questioned. In the
1990's, new relationships are emerging, with increasing collaboration between Northern NGO's
and international development agencies, and some direct funding from official donors to
Southern NGO's. 
<p>
While the concept of partnership remains valid, most NGO's face real difficulties in making the
concept fully operational. True partnership implies a compatibility of vision, aims, and
objectives between the two sides which is all too rare in practice. However, the relationship
remains essentially unequal, with one side retaining the right to disburse or withhold funding,
and thus, the real power. 
<p>
In addition, most international NGO's have become increasingly interventionist over the last ten
years with a wide range of policies on issues like gender, the environment, and human rights. It
seems likely that official donors who now talk about the need for partnership will face similar
contradictions to NGO's. 
<p>
In spite of these difficulties, the concept of partnership still has real value as a philosophy
underlying institutional development. Its key value lies in the assumption of a relationship that
goes beyond funding, to a real long-term commitment to the development of national
organisations.
<p>
Real partnership requires joint strategic planning and agreement on objectives and indicators by
which progress is measured. Once a relationship is established, problems can be openly
acknowledged and addressed before they become overwhelming. There is much scope for
learning by both sides. 
<p>
<h3>Are NGO's less Constrained than Donors?</h3>

NGO's like Actionaid implement a large proportion of their projects themselves. However,
sustained implementation requires that we establish partnerships with a wide variety of local
organisations -- government agencies at all levels, other NGO's, and community level
organisations.
<p>
Operational work of this kind means that we have to make the same choices at the micro-level
as official donors at the national level. For instance we frequently have to choose between, say,
providing our own 'alternative' agricultural extension or health service, or by a longer process
of lobbying and advocacy, to persuade the government to provide the same service. Our long-term funding base is derived largely from individual sponsors who make a commitment of
support for a period of between five and ten years. This secure funding base makes it possible
for us to avoid rigid implementation schedules and to adopt longer-term strategies.
<p>
Nevertheless, NGO's are not immune from the problems of accountability faced by official
donors. Actionaid, in common with most similar NGO's, has developed a system of financial
accountability, with strong internal financial controls, regular internal and external audits, and
strict financial reporting schedules. This is combined with close monitoring and periodic reviews
of programme strategies. 
<p>
However, the stronger the system of accountability to our trustees and donors in the UK, the
more difficult it is to honour our accountability to the communities with whom we work directly
and the wider society of which these communities are a part. This problem is shared by all
intermediary agencies trying to implement projects at community level and using funds from
increasingly inquisitive donors concerned about the use of their funds. While there are no easy
answers, our experience suggests the following:
<p>
<h3>Actionaid's Experience</h3>

In any NGO project, the majority of the staff need to feel accountable to the needs of
communities, rather than following rigid schedules and 'getting things done'. This means that
from the start of the project the NGO needs to establish a clear philosophy to let the community
determine its own priorities and set the pace. This often means that in the first year of a project,
not much tangible happens, apart from training and recruiting staff, and conducting meetings,
surveys, and participatory appraisal exercises. This time is essential in order to ensure that the
community feels a sense of ownership of the project in the long-term: even so, some official
donors reject NGO proposals that emphasise this sort of approach because they cannot see
practical (and measurable) benefits reaching communities fast enough. 
<p>
Staff should ideally be drawn from the immediate project area and they need to live and work
in the communities as much as possible. In the past, Actionaid projects were set up on sectoral
lines with largely sectoral objectives. In recent years many have moved over to a more
decentralised and area-based approach, which often involves a much greater management
challenge, but allows many more opportunities for the community to take over the project's
management.
<p>
Operational NGO's have for too long by-passed local government and other local structures, and
have often weakened these structures further by recruiting their staff at higher salaries. So far,
much of the debate about capacity-building has concerned national-level institutions, and local
government has been relatively neglected. NGO's need to work both on the 'demand' side
(helping communities to be more productive and to demand better and more consistent
government services) but equally on the 'supply' side -- working with line ministries and other
authorities at both the provincial and local level to ensure that they have both the qualified
manpower, funds, and equipment to work effectively. Only in those relatively few countries
facing complete economic and political collapse should NGO's try to take on these functions
themselves. 
<p>
Once these community-level structures are in place, it is important not to over-burden field
workers with excessive reporting requirements. A 'bureaucratic culture' is increasing in many
NGO's, especially in Africa, to the extent that too many field staff are stuck behind desks writing
proposals and reports for donors. The accountability requirements of each staff member need to
be made very clear, so that only the project manager and a few senior staff have to spend time
on 'upward' accountability requirements; and community-based staff should then be free to work
with, and within, their communities. 
<p>
Within such a structure, the concerns of donors and agency staff about whether or not a project
is 'effective' can best be met by involving communities in setting objectives and identifying
performance indicators. Internal monitoring can be verified by periodic evaluations that use the
indicators identified by the community, as well as those of the agency.
<p>
There are real dangers, given the growth in numbers of NGO's and the difficulty they
increasingly face in accessing funds, that more NGO's will become 'contractors' in the way that
many American NGO's have become contractors for USAID. The main danger in NGO's
accepting such contracts is that they will, in the end, be far more sensitive to their donors'
accountability requirements than those of the people they should be serving. 
<p>
<h3>Implications for Other Aid Donors</h3>

Not all of these experiences may be relevant for official donors. There are however some useful
indications:
<p>
The need to review the 'aid business' from a recipients' perspective. A sense of ownership of any
project by the local implementing agency is as crucial at the national, as at the community level.
The present multiplicity of donors, their diverse reporting requirements, and increasingly
complex conditionalities, threatens the capacity of national governments to cope with aid itself,
and leaves them little space for their own development policies. It is entirely legitimate for
donors to impose conditions on aid disbursement, but they need to be more transparent as to what
strategies underlay these conditionalities: the British ODA has recently announced that it will
in future disclose its strategic priorities in different countries. 
<p>
The need for far more decentralisation by official donors. The need for 'upward' accountability
is insufficient justification for the centralised approach of some donors, including the European
Union (EU). In this regard, the delegation of authority by donors like the British ODA to
regionally-based Development Divisions appears a positive development. National capacity-building will remain little more than a slogan unless the donor community within each country
is given a clear mandate to work with other donors to achieve this objective. 
<p>
The need for simpler, and more transparent procedures for disbursing aid. There is a real risk that
at least in the case of the EU, low rates of disbursement will be blamed on the ACP countries,
when a major cause may be delays in decision-making in the EU itself. As regards the EU's
funding of NGO's, most NGO's now experience lengthy and worsening delays in securing
funding decisions from Brussels. There appears to be no clear division of labour between
Brussels and the delegations; the procedures by which proposals are assessed are unclear; and
the criteria by which they are accepted or rejected often appear arbitrary.
<p>
Official donors who award contracts to NGO's for specific services at a community level must
realise that their own particular accountability requirements are necessary but never sufficient,
and they must find ways to verify the extent of community involvement in the NGO's work.

Partnership in Development Cooperation -- Selected Readings</h3>
<p>
From <i>DPMN Bulletin, 2(3) December 1994: page 14</i>
<p></center>
<hr>
Berg, E.J. 1993. Rethinking technical cooperation: Reforms for capacity-building in Africa. New York: United
Nations Development Programme.
<ul>
Reviews technical cooperation effectiveness and criticises its limited impact on local capacity building. Suggests that
donor agencies should find ways to support local capacity and institutions.
</ul>
<p>
Bossuyt, J. et al. 1992. New avenues for technical cooperation in Africa. Maastricht: European Centre for
Development Policy Management.
<ul>
Proposes an agenda to change technical cooperation in Africa. Using case experience from four countries - Burundi,
Cameroon, Malawi and Tanzania - the authors point to a number of promising avenues in the continuing search for
effective modes of aid delivery. Focussed on possible actions by African governments and donors, it assesses how
current reform efforts can be used to build and sustain capacity for aid management in recipient countries.
</ul>
<p>
Development Assistance Committee. 1992. DAC principles for effective aid. Paris: OECD.
<ul>
Compilation of aid 'best practice' for use primarily by donor agencies. Considers project appraisal and the need for partnership,
presents new orientations for technical cooperation, and outlines some principles for evaluating development assistance. Covers
the whole process of aid programming and implementation, from appraisal and policy dialogue with recipient countries through
to procurement and evaluation of results.
</ul>
<p>
Donors to African Education. 1994. Improving the implementation of education projects in Africa through ownership.
Paris: DAE.
<ul>
Reports on discussions between high-level education officials from Africa and education specialists from the donor community.
Particularly interesting for the report of a closed session in which African ministers of education reviewed ownership and
partnership in education projects.
</ul>
<p>
Lele, U. 1991. Aid to African agriculture: Lessons from two decades of donors' experience. Baltimore: Johns
Hopkins University Press. 
<ul>
This study on aid to African agriculture shows that donors are part of the problem. The form in which aid is given, the
large number of donor agencies, the limited human and institutional capacity in Africa, and the lack of institutional
memory and know-how in donor agencies make its absorption more difficult than it should be. 
</ul>
<p>
Price Waterhouse. 1992. Study of the causes of delay in the implementation of financial and technical
cooperation. London: Price Waterhouse.
<ul>
Examines the causes of delay in implementing aid delivered under the Convention of Lom&#233;. Stresses that the
nature of the partnership envisaged under the Convention requires that effective local capacity be developed if the
funds are to be fully utilised.

<title>Weaknesses and Arrogance in Development Cooperation</title>

Weaknesses and Arrogance in Development Cooperation</h3>
by <i>Jos&#233; Filipe Fonseca</i>
<p>
Full text of an article from <i>DPMN Bulletin, 2(3) December 1994: page 4</i>
</center>
<hr>
<h3>Both Partners Need to Reform</h3>

Responsibility for the disappointments of both donors and recipient countries with the
effectiveness of development assistance must be shared between the two partners. Neither should
point fingers of criticism at the other without examining its own processes, institutions and
behaviour. Two problems encountered in implementing a true partnership are of particular
importance. First, are the pervasive weaknesses in recipient countries. Second, is the widespread
arrogance in the behaviour of donors.
<p>
<h4>Recipient Countries</h4>

When I speak of weaknesses, I am not only referring to the obvious economic and technological
weaknesses of African countries. These are, of course, important. But there are others which
have more bearing on the type of relationships which exist between North and South. These are
the institutional weaknesses in our countries, particularly in respect of the rules by which society
functions at all levels.
<p>
These institutional weaknesses are primarily the result of a lack of real willingness to improve
organisations and management in depth. They are found in relationships with other countries,
including donors, but also in respect of internal matters. Without the fundamental willingness
to take appropriate action, all other factors become secondary.
<p>
Perhaps more important still is the fact that these institutional weaknesses necessarily lead to the
moral weakness of those who are in positions of responsibility in society. The very people who
are called by their countries to manage the cooperative development process and to improve this
process, frequently have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.
<p>
These institutional weaknesses are themselves the basic reason why African countries need ever-increasing amounts of donor assistance to achieve their objectives of growth and poverty
alleviation. For they result in wasted resources and a situation in which domestic resources are
never sufficient for almost everything we do.
<p>
<h4>Donor Countries</h4>

The arrogance of financial donors is not a rare phenomenon. All Africans who have had to
negotiate or execute a project know how weighty a factor this is. Of course, not all donors are
arrogant. People behave in many ways and this is true of field representatives and other officials
of donor organisations. Nevertheless the experience in Africa at all levels is too widespread to
be ignored.
<p>
Certainly the partnership relationship and the effectiveness of external assistance at the project
level would have been far better if, right from the start, donors had the modesty to listen to what
others had to say; if they were not so convinced that only they had the right ideas and the right
solutions to all problems.
<p>
What makes this arrogance worse is that donors equally assert that responsibility for the success
or failure of a project resides entirely with the recipient government and agency. Thus, future
financial liabilities stemming from donor assistance are entirely with the borrower. Moreover,
sanctions are imposed by the donor if these liabilities are not met in full.
<p>
There are no corresponding sanctions which can be imposed by the borrower on the lender, even
if the latter is at fault in project design or implementation. I have never heard of a country being
compensated (for example, by exemption from debts incurred in a project) because a donor has
urged a country to make inappropriate choices or has not correctly executed its duties under a
loan agreement.
<p>
<h3>Deciding to Take Action is as Important as What Action to Take</h3>

It is easy to be pessimistic when looking back at the persistent unwillingness or inability of
donors and African governments to address the problems that lie at the heart of their failure to
generate an effective partnership relationship. Certainly to eliminate the arrogance of the former
and the weaknesses of the latter will be a complicated and long term process. But I think we can
succeed if only we can decide to begin.

<B>1 NIGERIA ISOLATED AT ACP/EU JOINT ASSEMBLY </B>
<P>
Members of ACP and European Union parliaments have today adopted
a very strong resolution against Nigeria at this weeks Joint Assembly
meetings which started on Monday in Windhoek, Namibia.  The resolution
was put forward by the EP group earlier in the week.  The wording
is much stronger than a resolution put forward by the ACP group.
 After an acrimonious debate on the issue on Wednesday, Nigeria
had threatened to pull out of the ACP alltogether.  They also
demanded that the vote on the European resolution be conducted
by secret ballot, and that it should also be a split vote.  This
means that the votes cast by the ACP and EU groups are counted
seperately.  Simon Stocker, Director of Eurostep, is at the Windhoek
meetings and has sent us a report on this morning's vote
<P>
&quot;Of the 49 ACP votes counted 30 were in favour, 13 were against.
 There were 5 abstentions and one spoilt paper.  Of the 56 EP
votes, 52 were in favour, 3 were against with one abstention .
. . This is the first time that there has been a secret ballot&quot;
<P>
According to Simon, the vote is important because so often in
the past the ACP representatives have tended to vote as a block
on difficult issues.  Under considerable pressure, Nigeria has
announced that it will allow a United Nations Special Mission,
to visit Nigeria from 27 March.  The Mission had previously been
turned down by the Nigerian authorities.  It has two major objectives
- 
<P>
i) to investigate the trial and execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and
eight other minority rights leaders and consider whether the procedures
which were followed meet minimum standards of justice as laid
down by international legislation on human rights.
<P>
ii) to report on the plans of the military regime for a return
to democratic rule
<P>
The Mission will have three members
<P>
 Atsu Kofi Amega Former Foreign Minister, President of the Supreme
Court of Togo
<P>
 Justin B S Malmath Member of the National Human Rights Commission
of India
<P>
 John Pace  Chief of Legislation and Prevention of Discrimination
Branch at the Centre     for Human Rights.
<P>
<B>2 OTHER NEWS FROM WINDHOEK</B>
<P>
The Windhoek meetings close today.  One of the subjects for discussion
was the future of the Lom&eacute; Convention beyond the year 2000.
 There is a general feeling that the convention needs a fundamental
overhaul.  The President in Office of the ACP Council, Mr. Z&eacute;phirin
Diabre (Burkina Faso's Minister for Economic Affairs) appealed
to the ACP states to give priority to the development of trade,
and also to increase the effectiveness of aid, which could involve
a speeding up of present procedures.  He also called for a new
initiative to be taken with regard to the continuing debt problems
and suggested that this should be a topic for discussion at the
meeting of ACP Finance Ministers in June.  
<P>
Since it is very early in the process of negotiating the successor
to the Lom&eacute; Convention this Joint Assembly will serve as
a forum for initial discussion rather than a concrete statement
of intention.
<P>
<B>3 RWANDA EVALUATION OF THE CRISIS</B>
<P>
Danida has published a 600 page evaluation of the Rwanda crisis.
 The report looks at the crisis as a whole, including issues of
conflict prevention, the humanitarian response, and the political
response.  There is also an in depth look at the performance of
the many NGOs that rushed to the scene after April 1994.  Copies
of the report are available (free of charge) from Beck Distribution,
fax number + 45 4675 3222.
<P>
<B>4 RWANDA GOVERNMENT LOOKS AGAIN AT NGOs</B>
<P>
Following the expulsion of NGOs from Rwanda in December of last
year, the Rwandan Government, with the cooperation of UNDP, started
an evaluation of all NGO activities.  The evaluation is being
carried out by a team which includes a representative from the
steering committee of NGOs in Rwanda.  We do not know when the
report from the evaluation will be published but it is expected
to be soon (APRODEV, Lutheran World Federation).
<P>
The Rwandan Prime Minister will be visiting Brussels next week.
 A meeting has been arranged in the European Parliament at 11.00
am on 27th March.  The meeting is open to the public.
<P>
<B>5 DUTCH VOTE TO BAN LAND MINES</B>
<P>
Yesterday the Dutch Foreign Minister voted to ban the export of
Anti Personnel mines from Holland.  Since the Defense Minister
had already announced on March 11th that the Dutch armed forces
will no longer use APMs and will destroy existing stocks, this
amounts to an effective cessation of land mine production in the
Netherlands because there are no remaining legal outlets.  Therefore
Holland becomes the 23rd country in the world to have legislated
against the production of land mines.  The growing international
move against these weapons on humanitarian grounds has recently
led the United States to announce a fundamental review of the
use and stockpile of mines by american armed forces.
<P>
<B>6 WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT WIDE ANNUAL CONFERENCE</B>
<P>
WIDE has announced that this year's annual conference will take
place between Thursday 30 May and 2 June at the Gustav-Stressman
Institut in Bonn, Germany.   Information from Monika Loffler at
the Gustav-Stressman Institut fax + 49 228 8107198.
<P>
<B>7 ASIA FOLLOW UP TO THE SUMMIT</B>
<P>
There will be a Joint Assembly of Parliamentarians from Asian
countries and the European Parliament in Strasbourg on April 18th.
 This follows the recent summit of Asian and European leaders
in Bangkok.  The conclusions from that meeting have now been published
and are available from the Eurostep secretariat.
<P>
<B>8 RWANDA MEMORIAL DAY</B>
<P>
Preparations are under way in Brussels for the commemoration of
the second anniversary of the plane crash which, on April 7th
1994, killed the Presidents of both Rwanda and Burundi and signalled
the beginning of the genocide in Rwanda.  A group of Rwandan nationals,
with support from Oxfam Belgium and other NGOs, has organised
a series of workshops on March 30th with discussions on rehabilitation,
the role of the churches, the role of the media, justice etc...
 The group will also mount an exhibition with videos for two weeks
from the 30 March.  The highlight of the campaign will be a torchlit
march from the Place Royale to the Palais de Justice at 7.30 pm
on April 7th.
<P>
We reproduce here the Oxfam summary of the Danida report &quot;The
International Response to Genocide: Lessons from, the Rwanda Experience&quot;
<P>
A The international community failed to recognise and address
numerous indications of impending genocide.  By not imposing strict
human rights conditionality on aid and failing to enforce and
arms embargo, the international community reinforced a perception
of disinterest and allowed the militarisation of the conflict.
 The narrow scope, inadequate support and slow deployment of the
UNAMIR mission again reinforced this perception as well as rendered
the mission ineffective.  Regional governments and the OAU were
under utilised, despite the fact that non regional actors had
proves either incapable or disinterested in translating early
warning to action.  The study criticises the absence of unit within
the UN to analyse information and translate it into options for
action.  It also criticises the inability of the UN to respond
effectively to early warning signals when a partisan interest
is not involved.
<P>
B The study concludes that the international community's response
to the refugee crisis before April 1994 was weak but commends
the large scale humanitarian response that ultimately did take
place after April.  Its criticism of the response include uncoordinated
operations, uneven funding, and poor contingency planning and
preparedness.  The study concludes that there is a need for a
greater link between foreign policy and humanitarian assistance;
more formal and effective mechanisms to ensure professional standards
among NGOs and a strong capacity at the centre to provide leadership
and overall coordination
<P>
C An effective shift from humanitarian aid to assistance for the
reconstruction of Rwanda has not taken place.  Donors have been
slow to comply with the assistance for national recovery that
they pledged in January 1995.  In fact, according to UNDP, only
1/3 of the pledged funds had been disbursed by September 1995.
 Weak areas pointed out by the study include insufficient concern
for survivors of the genocide vis a vis the refugee population,
problems with the distribution of seeds, tools, and food aid in
general, and failure to give women special treatment as a vulnerable
group.  Slow disbursement of Round Table funds, refugees fear
of reprisals, and government perceptions of the camps as a threat
have constrained the repatriation of refugees.  The study concludes
that in order to address these problems, an effective judicial
system must be put in place, the physical security of the refugees
and survivors must be ensured, and rapid economic growth in agriculture
and small business sectors must be promoted.  Because of the historical
and cultural context of the situation, a regional solution to
the crisis should be sought.
<P>
Based on the conclusion of these studies the evaluation makes
over 23 recommendations.  Sole overlap with our lobbying objectives
on Rwanda and UN reform.  They include -
<UL>
<LI>The development of a comprehensive unit for analysis of early
warning of conflict under the office of the General Secretary
<LI>Established procedures for the Rapid Deployment of UN peace-keeping
troops and the rapid response capabilities of peace-keepers from
regional organisations
<LI>Enforcement of international arms embargoes
<LI>Regional participation in preventive diplomacy and peace-keeping
<LI>Setting aside of resources for contingency planning in relief
operations
<LI>Consolidation of one mechanism in the emergency response functions
of major UN humanitarian operations
<LI>Compliance with the rule of law and observance of fundamental
human rights principles with close monitoring of government abuses
<LI>Support for government efforts to establish and promulgate
guilt and punishment for the participants in the genocide
<LI>Instituted consultations and procedures to allow for the rapid
availability of flexible resources for assistance
<LI>Expanded support for the justice system and law enforcement
by developing a systematic approach to assisting the reconstruction
of the justice system and by strengthening the International Criminal
Tribunal through an adequate budget and delegated authority.
<LI>Integrated UN leadership and line of command between headquarters
and the field
<LI>A regional framework for a solution to the crisis.

<P>
<B>Budget Discharge</B>
<P>
The Union's financial account for 1994 were formally approved
and cleared in Strasbourg this week, but not before MEPs had voiced
strong worries at loopholes in the system.
<P>
The debate held on Tuesday on the discharge to be given to the
European Commission for management of the Community budget for
1991 and following years demonstrated that Parliament is now taking
much more seriously its role and responsibilities on budgetary
matters.
<P>
During the debate it was pointed out that, in order to clear the
accounts absolutely correctly, a radical reform of the system
is needed. The Commission does not have the necessary resources
remarking that only 7% of the corrections made in cases of irregularities
are the result of precise calculations, the rest being 'guesswork'
or, in the best cases estimated.
<P>
Mr. Wynn (Labour, UK) recommended refusal to grant a discharge
for the European Development Fund for 1994, speaking of an 'incoherent
mess'. The EP has been trying unsuccessfully for years to have
this fund budgetized, but the Court of Justice has decreed that
EDF expenditure is not Community expenditure, but simply member
State expenses managed by the European Commission.  the MEP also
pointed out that the member States have the easy role, since they
'write the rule book', whereas the Commission takes the blame
when things go wrong.
<P>
Mr. Fabre-Aubrespy (Europe of Nations) criticised the rejection
of the discharge for the EDF and asked why this discharge had
been granted during previous budget years. Ms. Ewing (Scottish
MEP, European Radical Alliance) called for assurance that this
rejection will not entail delays or cuts in the allocation of
funds to ACP countries.
<P>
European Commissioner for the Budget Erkii Liikanen noted, in
response to MEPs, the need for better implementation of the innovation
introduced by the Maastricht Treaty (Article 188C), namely the
statement of assurance (SOA) established by the Court of Auditors
on 'reliability of the accounts' of the Commission and the 'legality
and regularity of the underlying transactions'.
<P>
Mr. Liikanen said he regretted the rejection of discharge for
the EDF management in 1994 and felt that this means the EP does
not have anything to say in the use of the European Development
Fund. However, he indicated that the Commission essentially shares
the Parliament's views and will continue to work towards including
the EDF in the budget.
<P>
During the vote on Wednesday, the Parliament endorsed the view
of Rapporteur Wynn, refusing the discharge for the 1994 financial
year of the EDF as it considered illogical to approve execution
of a budget on which it has no possibility of intervening (being
founded on national contributions from member States).
<P>
<B>Chocolate Directive</B>
<P>
On Wednesday, the European Commission adopted its proposal aimed
at modifying the directive relating to cocoa products and chocolate.
All member States will have the choice of authorising their 
<P>
chocolate manufacturers to incorporate vegetable fats other than
cocoa butter in chocolate up to 5% of the total weight of the
finished product on condition that this is clearly mentioned on
the label of the product (a 
<P>
mention in the list of ingredients would not be sufficient). Member
States that wish to maintain the obligation to use only cocoa
butter - and no other vegetable fat - will be free to do so.
<P>
The UK, Denmark, Ireland, Portugal, Austria, Finland and Sweden
already authorise the use of alternative fats.
<P>
According to Martin Bangemann, this proposal plans to reconcile
three major principles: subsidiarity, the free movement of goods
and consumer protection. The Commission nonetheless expects that
its proposal (subject to codecision procedure) will give rise
to difficult debates at the Council and Parliament.
<P>
There are in fact many and divergent interests at stake: those
of member States, chocolate manufacturers, cocoa producer countries
and countries that export vegetable fats other than cocoa butter.
The ACP cocoa producer countries have not failed to voice their
opposition for some while now to extension of the minority rule
of 5% which, they say, would threaten their cocoa bean exports
with collapse (the reduction would be from 80 000 to 200 tonnes
and annual receipts lost are estimated at $290 million). This
would cause cocoa prices to collapse on international markets.
<P>
Given the lobbying by cocoa producer countries, Burkina Faso and
Mali, C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Cameroon, shea butter exporters
to the EU also expressed their strong concern given the risk of
seeing exports receipts, which are essential to their economy,
dry up.
<P>
The Commission envisages partially compensating the loses of the
revenues of those countries through the STABEX. The European citizens
will have then to contribute to cover the interests of the big
industries.
<P>
The decision of the Commission is contrary to its commitments
taken at the International Cocoa Agreement.
<P>
<B>Fisheries Council</B>
<P>
The Fisheries Council will meet on Monday 22 April in Brussels.
The ministers will again debate the problem of driftnets, as well
as research into fishing; they should approve the tariff quotas
for 1996 and the regulation opening the way to greater quota flexibility
for catches. The Commission will set out the recommendations of
scientist on reducing fleet capacities for the period 1997/99.

<font size=4><b>What's going on?</b></font>


<P>
Campaigners from The Land is Ours are occupying the of the old distillery and oil depot, on York Road, SW11.  We're building a <b>sustainable village</b>, with <b>gardens</b> and <b>public amenities</b>.  We're laying on lots of <b>events</b> - music (acoustic only), circus stunts, talks, painting and story telling.  Everyone's  welcome - please come and join us. 
<P>
On May 8th, we'll be celebrating the 50th anniversary of the biggest occupation in British history, when demobbed servicemen took over 1000 derelict sites.  On May the 12th, we'll be handing the land over to people who want to live there or to use it in  the longer term.  This, if you're interested, means <b>you</b>.
<P>
<center><b>Why are we doing it?</b></center>
<P>
We want to highlight the desperate need to make good use of the <b>derelict sites</b> in Britain's cities.  They're the best places for the <b>affordable housing</b>, the <b>community facilities</b> and the <b>green spaces</b> our city needs so badly. At the moment they're either being wasted or used for the sorts of developments which tear up communities - such as giant superstores and extremely expensive housing. 
<P>
We want to show what can be done in places like this - and how much better development can be when ordinary people are involved, rather than big business and bureaucrats.


<P>
<center><b>Why have we chosen this place?</b></center>
<P>

Because, with the right sort of development - making use of the waterfront and the excellent location - it could be wonderful.  Also, since <b>Elm Farm</b> was shut down by Wandsworth Borough Council, Battersea people have been deprived of one of their best amenities. We want to restore some of the things the area has lost.
<P>
<center><b>Will we be a nuisance?</b></center>
<P>
We're acutely aware that we're within earshot of people's homes, so no amplified music or other major noise will be allowed on site.  This is a <b>peaceful, friendly</b> and <b>constructive</b> occupation. If you feel worried by any aspect of what we're doing, please come to the reception tent the main entrance and tell us what you think, and we'll try to sort it out.
<P>
<center><b>What will happen next?</b></center>
<P>
To a large extent this is up to you. We believe that homeless people and the local community should be the driving forces of development.  So please come along and join our meetings. Tell us what you think and what you would like the land to be used for.  Then we can work out together how we can put your ideas to practice.
<P>
<center><b>Who are we?</b></center>
<P>
The Land is Ours is a campaign, not an organisation.  It has no membership and no paid staff.  We're campaigning for <b>sensible land use</b> in Britain, and <b>better access</b> both to the land itself and to the decision-making processes that affect it.

<font size=+1><i><b>Chris Brazier
</b>returns after ten years to the African village which transformed his way of looking at the world.</i></font><p><hr width=80% size=4>What words and ideas do you associate with Africa? War. Famine.Murderous tribalism. Population spiralling. A basket case. Apermanently outstretched hand.<p>        You can probably add your own impression of awfulness to thislist. And after years that have contained Somalia and Rwanda,not to mention the current events in Sierra Leone and Burundi,you can be forgiven for holding such images in your head.Prompted by news media which only dip into the continent whenthey can find events sufficiently terrible to top what we haveseen before, people are quick to give up on Africa. It seems ahopeless, helpless case.<p>        And yet how much of Africa do these images leave out? How manycountries quietly busying themselves with the process ofpeaceful development are betrayed by the media focus on war andfamine? How many millions of people leading their everyday liveswith dignity and endeavour are dismissed and forgotten when  wedraw a red line through the whole continent?    The longer Ilive, the more I learn that what you see depends on yourvantage-point and not on any absolute truth. Look at Africa froma rich country and you are likely to see that kaleidoscope ofsuffering and mayhem. Look at the African countryside from oneof its capital cities and you are likely to see poverty,backwardness and ignorance. Look at rural Burkina Faso from abus during the dry season and you will find nothing visually tocontradict the fact that this is one of the poorest countries inthe world.  The earth is baked hard and looks dusty andlifeless. The villages and trees seem almost like intrusionsinto a landscape which looks like it is already giving up theghost, yielding to the relentless southward march of theonce-distant Sahara.<p>        But spend a few weeks in any one of those villages, as I havejust done, and you soon see the world in a very different way.The red earth looks different when you remember the vibrant, rawlife that screams out of it during the rains. Once you're in thevillage you not only know that life is possible here but alsothat it has its full quota of human drama. People come alive foryou. 'African villagers' stop being statistics in a thesis,cyphers on a printed page. They have real bodies, real feelings-  lives that have a beginning and a middle, not just somehorribly painful end. Their loving and their laughing, theirdancing and their dreaming, their pain and their joy are notthat different from our own.<p><img width=110 height=179 border=1 align=left hspace=10 vspace=10 src="ni_pix/268_p8_memories.gif"><img width=125  height=161 border=1 align=right hspace=10 vspace=10 src="ni_pix/268_p8_memories2.gif"><font size=-1>Memories of 1985: the co-wives featured in our film. Meryam holds her new-born baby Rasmatu (left) and Zenabou her toddler Salamatu (right).  The Salamatu of today appears above and her mother on the <a href="ni_pix/268_cover_fullsize.gif">front cover. (gif = 336k)</a></font><hr width=60%><p>        It was ten years ago, in June 1985, when I learned this lesson.My first-ever journalistic assignment in Africa sent me insearch of a woman farmer whose story we could tell in the NIfilm that was eventually broadcast as Man-Made Famine. I'dchosen Burkina Faso because it was in the middle of a revolution- and for once it was a revolution in more than just rhetoric.Its young President, Thomas Sankara, had a unique honesty andvision which set him apart from almost any other African leaderand which could have served as an alternative blueprint fordevelopment (see Page 26). I have never been in a country whereI have felt such a kinship with what the Government was tryingto do.<p>        Eventually the film crew came out and we settled on a villagecalled Sabtenga, in the south-east of the country, and on awoman called Zenabou Bambara. But I found myself peripheral tothe filming process and instead took to wandering through thevillage in the company of a young woman who volunteered to actas my interpreter, Mariama Gamene. Those days of walking andtalking utterly changed the way I viewed the world.<p>         I was staggered by how much I had in common with the people Imet. Here I was in one of the poorest villages in one of thepoorest countries in the world, a village in which people didnot have animals to help them work the land, forget aboutmachines. They simply had to scrape at the bitter earth withtheir backs bent. Here I was in a place on the far side of acultural as well as economic gulf - a society in which animismwas the dominant religion, in which polygamy was the norm and inwhich girls almost without exception suffered genitalmutilation. And yet across this widest of all gulfs I made aconnection with people, a connection of common humanitytranscending all borders, all difficulties and differences.<p>        That I should have been surprised by such an instinctive andnatural connection says a lot about the package of prejudices wecarry with us. The goal of this issue is to leave you with thesame feeling of connection. Of course there is a world ofdifference between reading about someone and actually sittingdown to chat with them, between being told about your commonkinship and actually sensing it for yourself. But short ofsending you all to Sabtenga for a few weeks that's what we'regoing to have to do.<p>        I could have chosen any village in Africa and found humanstories, vivid personalities and lessons about how developmentworks out on the ground. But I'm not sure I would have had thegall to turn up unannounced in a village I'd never visitedbefore and expect it to reveal its innermost secrets: after all,anthropologists spend years living with people and still manageto get some things wrong.<p>        No, I chose Sabtenga because I had a head start there - I feltI'd got halfway to understanding the way it worked before andwould be able to build on that. But above all I wanted to returnto see what had happened to the community and individual peoplewithin it like Zenabou and Mariama.<p>        It's all too rare that journalists return to the stories theyhave once told or exploited - people are milked for their angleand then dropped back into limbo as if they have only lived forthe moment in which the media blesses them with its magnanimouseye. That's inevitably true even of development journalists whoare looking to tell the human stories behind the big statisticsabout the poor world.<p>        For years I've had the idea of returning to this village thatopened my eyes so dramatically, that had literally changed thewhole way in which I viewed the world. This year the tenthanniversary of my first visit seemed to tip the project over thebrink into plausibility. I sent word to the village that I wascoming, giving at least a bit of warning. But I had no idea whathad happened in the intervening years - my early attempts atcorrespondence had soon petered out.<p>        What would I find? Would the village be utterly unchanged,barely rippled by the raging tides of world events? Or would theRevolution that I witnessed in action there, that inspired meso, have survived the murder of its leader?  Would Mariama havemanaged to maintain her courageous lone stand against genitalmutilation? Would the earth look even more degraded and thetrees have completely disappeared?  Above all, would the peopleI remembered still be alive?<p><p>©Copyright: New Internationalist 1995<hr><a href="index.html"><img width=35 height=30 src="ni_pix/nilogo3.gif"> NI Home Page</a> <a href="contents268.html"><img width=45  height=68 src="ni_pix/268_cover_thumb.gif"> Issue 268</a><hr><p></body></html>

<B>1 GREAT LAKES   LOCAL NGOs IN CONFLICT PREVENTION</B>
<P>
Following on from  the Kigali gathering of international and local
NGOs which took place on February 24th, a meeting was held on
Monday of this week to examine the European end of the programme.
  Monday's meeting was attended by <I>Eurostep</I>, Aprodev, Novib,
NCOS, Miserior, and Hassan Ba from Synergies Africa, who is largely
responsible for the initiative.  The three main themes from the
Kigali meeting were discussed -
<P>
1 The process of consultation now taking place with NGOs in the
Great Lakes on how local NGOs can be effective agents for conflict
prevention in the region.
<P>
2 The research project which was proposed in Kigali. This will
involve one African and one European researcher will investigate
the capacity and potential of local NGOs in the areas of greatest
conflict in the continent.  These were defined as Sierra Leone,
the Horn of Africa, the Great Lakes, and possibly also Southern
Africa.  The Brussels meeting on Monday set up a small working
group to come up with terms of reference, and a budget, for the
research.
<P>
3 The need for European agencies to promote the idea that local
NGOs can be effective in conflict prevention and that they should
be supported in this endeavour.  Networks based in Brussels including
<I>Eurostep</I>, Aprodev, and (it is hoped for the future) EuroCidse,
should lobby the appropriate EU institutions on these ideas.
<P>
<B>2 BURMA COMMISSION INVESTIGATION ON FORCED LABOUR</B>
<P>
The European Commission investigation on forced labour in Burma
has asked organisations and individuals to come forward with any
evidence they have about the issue.  The deadline for initial
submissions is March 20th.  David Arnott, of the Burma Peace Foundation,
has told us that if you would like to testify to the hearing you
should immediately fax the Commission describing your knowledge
of forced labour in Burma, and also outlining any documents which
you have ready to go.  You should mail any documents, videos,
photographic material etc.. which you have available now, (further
documents can be submitted at a later date).  The Commission has
not yet decided what forms the inquiry will take, so people should
indicate any options which they feel would be appropriate, including
fact-finding missions to the area.  Contact the Commission at
-

Rue de la Loi 200, <BR>
B - 1049, Brussels, Belgium    <BR>
fax  + 32 2 299 1047
<P>
David Arnott also requests that anybody applying to the Commission
also informs the Burma Peace Foundation (fax no. + 41 22 738 9419)
and the International Confederation of Trade Unions - Department
of Trade Union Rights (fax no. + 32 2 224 0297).  
<P>
The inquiry is important because the continuation of EU trade
preferences to Burma under the General System of Preferences depends
on the result.  If the Commission finds Burma guilty of practicing
forced labour, this could cost the Burmese government $30 million in
lost tariff reductions.  It would also be a serious embarrassment
to the regime and would contribute greatly to the pressure brought
about by international isolation.  We know that there are plans
to bring victims of forced labour to Brussels to testify, and
we will pass on more information about this issue when we can.
 
<P>
<B>3 SOCIAL WATCH FOLLOW UP TO THE SOCIAL SUMMIT </B>
<P>
How much of the action plans from the Social Summit and the Beijing
Conference on Women has actually been implemented?  The answer
will be contained in a new publication - the Social Watch report
- the first issue of which will be launched in Brussels on 29
March.  It contains information from civil society organisations
about what has happened in their countries since the action plans
were adopted.  In the first issue (known as the baseline edition
zero) <I>Eurostep</I>'s Mirjam Van Reisen has written the chapter
on the external policy of the European Union.  She will also be
addressing the meeting which launches the report.  There is also
a chapter by Greetie Lubbi of Novib on social policies within
the EU.  In future editions there will be opportunities for individual
NGOs worldwide to share their experiences.  Contributions can
be deposited over the Internet, creating an international exchange
of information on the implementation of the action plans.  
<P>
The report is published by Instituto Tercer Mundo in Montevideo,
Uruguay, with facilitation by Novib.  It will be available from
Novib.  Contact Caroline Wildeman at the Secretariat. 
<P>
<B>4 CONFLICT PREVENTION</B>
<P>
We have received a report on the activities of FEPAC - the group
of 120 European Members of Parliament which debates issues surrounding
conflict prevention.  FEPAC sees this as a key issue in the development
of a Common Foreign and Security Policy.  The first report is
more of an initial brochure than a serious examination of the
issues.  However, it promises that future reports will make available
the informed debates of FEPAC.  The first such report will be
published in June 1996.
<P>
<B>5 NGOs HOW EFFECTIVE ARE THEY?</B>
<P>
Earthscan has published a report called &quot;Beyond the Magic
Bullet :  Non-Governmental Organisations - Performance and Accountability&quot;.
 As the title suggests, the book looks at the claim that NGOs
are more effective agents for development than governments and
official aid agencies, and finds that the real impact of the NGO
sector is not well documented.  This is partly because NGO performance
assessment and accountability methods are weak, and partly because
NGOs are caught up in the world of official aid, which pushes
them towards certain forms of evaluation at the expense of others.
 There are also ideas about how NGOs can improve, based on the
need to develop the way they measure and account for their performance.

<B>6 UNITED NATIONS AFRICAN INITIATIVE</B>
<P>
Today is the launch of the United Nations System-wide Special
Initiative on Africa which promises a target and coordinated effort
to improve development results in Africa, and the expenditure
of $25 billion over the next 10 years.  We went to the press conference
this morning in Brussels where it was admitted that most of the
$25 billion will come from existing resources.  However there
will also be new funds.  Both the IMF and World Bank have been
involved in the development of the initiative.  Cooperation between
the different parts of the UN system has been highlighted as a
key objective.<HR>

<B>1 INTERGOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE</B>
<P>
The Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) gets under way in Turin
today.  Whilst the discussions are purely preliminary, and will
probably be dominated by the issue of qualified majority voting,
(with british cows appearing in the background) several organisations
have nevertheless rushed to publish position papers before the
proceedings begin.  Amnesty International has called on the EU
to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights as a legal
entitiy in it's own right.  The Fourth World Committee echoes
this idea and also wants a Charter on Fundamental Social Rights
to be included in any new treaty.  The Fourth World Committee
appeals to the IGC to lay down the legal foundations enabling
the Union to complement measures taken byMember states in the
fight against poverty.  They propose that representatives of the
poor be invited onto the EU Economic and Social Committee.  Finally,
they call for a genuine policy for a global fight against poverty
and exclusion.  They want to see the European Commission committed
to analysing the economic and social impact of its policies on
the poorest.
<P>
After much complaining the European Parliament has been invited
by the Council to send a delegation to the IGC meetings.  In Turin
today the EP is represented by it's President and two MEPs.  At
subsequent meetings there will be a larger delegation of MEPs,
who will be able to meet with the Council of Ministers prior to
IGC meetings to discuss items on the agenda.  Written positions
can also be put forward by the European Parliament.  This therefore
creates a mechanism for NGOs (through contacts with the relevant
MEPs) to impact on the IGC process.  The focus for this in Brussels
will be the Parliament's Committee on Intstitutional Affairs.
 It will also be important for NGOs to lobby at the national level.
<P>
<B>2 FOLLOW UP FROM ACP/EU JOINT ASSEMBLY</B>
<P>
Last weeks PAF did not give full news on the events in Windhoek.
 We should take the opportunity to mention the other discussions
which took place.
<P>
<B>EU action on refugees</B>
<P>
The joint assembly adopted a report by MEP Luciano VECCHI which
invites the ACP/EU Council of Ministers to undertake a general
revision of the policy concerning refugees and displaced persons,
reconstruction and rehabilitation measures.  The Assembly was
concerned by an idea being contemplated in the EU Council to adopt
a restricitive interpretation of the legal concepts of &quot;political
refugee&quot; and &quot;refugee&quot;.  There was support for
the regional approach to the resoultion of refugee crises and
therefore for the idea of a regional conference on peace, security
and development in the Great Lakes region under the aegis of the
UN and the OAU.  More specifially on Rwanda, the Assembly noted
with concern that large scale refugee intimidation was being perpetrated
by ex-government of Rwanda and interahamwe forces responsible
for the genocide in Rwanda.  The assembly guaranteed that it will
give its full support to the new EU special envoy, Mr Aldo Ajello.
<P>
<B>Sugar</B>
<P>
The joint assembly asked for a gurantee from the EU that sugar
would not be targetted by free trade arrangements.  The Union
was asked to take account of socio-economic factors when setting
the price for ACP sugar.
<P>
<B>Cocoa</B>
<P>
There were fears for the future of the cocoa market.  The joint
assembly called on the EU to explicitly ban the use of vegetable
fats rather than cocoa butter in the manufacture of products bearing
the name chocolate.  The European Commission was called on to
find a solution so that the three Member states that benefit from
a derogation from the rule (Denmark, Ireland, United Kingdom)
could gradually adapt to the Community rules.
<P>
<B>Bananas</B>
<P>
The joint assembly appealed to the EU to keep the quota for ACP
bananas at 30% of EU consumption (it was reduced to 26% two weeks
ago).  It also called on the Union to take steps to monitor social
conditions linked to banana production by multi nationals, especially
in South America, and to prevent imports when these conditions
are notoriously inhuman.
<P>
<B>Other trade issues</B>
<P>
The assembly recommended that that ACP governments set up a joint
and permanent pressure group to defeat their interests within
the WTO.  The Council and Commission were urged to improve the
trading position of ACP countries by being more flexible on rules
of origin, widening preferences giving acess to EU agricultural
markets, and allowing easier access for technology, licences and
patents when these correspond to a country's development plans.
 The assembly also called for a special committee to investigate
the extent of dumping of EU agricultural products and a process
to bring about an end to this practice.
<P>
<B>3 FAO REGIONAL CONFERENCE FOR EUROPE</B>
<P>
The FAO is inviting organisations as observers to it's Regional
Conference for Europe which is being held in Tel Aviv, Israel
between 29 April and 3 May.  The conference will mark a step along
the way to the World Food Summit in November this year at FAO
headquaters in Rome.  The regional conference in Tel Aviv will
be given draft versions of the policy document and plan of action
that will be considered at the summit.  For more information contact
The Conference Secretary, FAO Regional Office for Europe, FAO
Headquarters, 00100 Roma.  Fax - + 39 6 5225 5634.
<P>
<B>4 FOLLOW UP TO THE SOCIAL SUMMIT</B>
<P>
&quot;Social Watch&quot; is launched today at a special meeting
in Brussels to follow up on the Social Summit.  A further organ
forum for follow was identified by the UN Economic and Social
Committee at its meeting of June 1995 when ECOSOC designated the
UN Commission for Social Development as the official UN body for
follow up and implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit
for Social Development.  In pursuit of this designation the UN
Commission for Social Development is to convene a special session
to discuss its mandate with other interested parties.  Novib is
preparing a position paper.  They will attend the meeting with
a number of southern partners and in collaboration with Oxfam
International in preparation for this meeting, which will take
place between 21 and 30 May 1996 in New York.   The responsible
person at Novib is Caroline Wildeman.
<P>
<B>5 NIGERIA</B>
<P>
We have been receiving information concerning a campaign being
organised in USA by the Washington Office on Africa (WOA) who
describe themselves as &quot;a not for profit church, trade union
and civil rights group supported organisation that works with
Congress&quot;.  They are calling for a US ban on imports of Nigerian
oil, and are encouraging people to write letters to various influential
figures in the US.  They can be contacted on the internet - woa@igc.apc.org./rg

<font size=+1><i>Have the old women had their way?...<br>The Chief's revelation... <br>National campaigns snowball...<br>The hands that made the cut...</i></font><p><font size=-1>Left: 'For my health I refuse excision.'<br> This product of a strong government campaign<br> is one of many impressive health-education posters<br> to be found on the walls of Sabtenga's clinic.</font></center></ul><hr width=80%><br clear=left><p><font size=+2>O</font>f all the issues that perturbed me as I returned to the village this time, the one that worried me most of all was female genital mutilation - the traditional practice in some African societies of removing a girl's clitoris in preparation for womanhood and marriage. I was also well aware that this is a subject with a rare power to fascinate Western readers by its sheer horror. In a magazine built on the idea of connecting people across the cultural and economic Grand Canyon how was I to handle this most alienating of issues? <p>There is something of a voyeuristic, negative element to this preoccupation of 'enlightened', anti-sexist Westerners with clitoral excision. Somehow, debarred from all the other reactionary notions about African savagery, our morbid fascination and 'politically correct' moral outrage becomes all the more extreme. Some campaigners have reacted to this by launching a defence of the practice as a part of indigenous African tradition over which Westernization is riding roughshod. <p>Let's try to dispense with morbid fascination but also agree that excision itself is indefensible - it not only deprives women of sexual pleasure but causes them all kinds of pain and health complications. Girls regularly end up disabled and even dead as a result of the 'operation' or infections caused by it.<p>But my worries, as I returned to the village, were much more concrete. Mariama was the first woman in the village to stand up against the traditional practice and refused to have her daughters mutilated. Ten years ago her two daughters Memnatu and Aseta were still unharmed but I was by no means confident that they would have remained so. There have been plenty of documented cases where the older women of a village (who are generally responsible for the act) have taken matters into their own hands and used a razor on a girl. In 1993, for example, Ouagadougou teacher Isabelle Ilboudo sent her five-year-old daughter Vanessa on holiday to her family village - only for Vanessa to be sent back to the capital excised by outraged aunts.<p><img width=150 height=134 border=1 align=left hspace=10 vspace=5 src="ni_pix/268_p14_aseta.gif"><p><font size=-1>One of the saved.  Aseta's fourth journey to the pump this afternoon ends in a shimmering curtain of water.  <a href="268_coca.html">The scar by her nose tells a tale...</a></font><p>Even if the old women had not intervened, I wondered if Mariama's eldest daughter Memnatu, who would now be of marriageable age, might have been forced to capitulate to the tradition in order to find a marriage partner. In some parts of Burkina Faso excision actually doesn't happen until the wedding day itself, when the bride is cut in the bush, honoured in a ceremony and then returns to her husband to consummate the marriage.<p>So it is with great relief that I find neither Memnatu nor her sister Aseta have been mutilated. But it isn't until I interview the traditional Chief of the village that I discover what a revolution has occurred here these past ten years. I ask the Chief about his attitude to excision fully expecting him, as official guardian of tradition in the community, to be gung-ho for it, as everyone was in 1985. 	<p>Instead he gives a remarkable answer. Up until seven years ago, he says, he thought this a good thing. But after hearing government campaigns on the radio and listening to the case made by local women like Mariama, he came round to thinking it an unhealthy practice which causes women pain and danger in childbirth. Since then he has not only stopped it happening to his own youngest daughters but has also held two public meetings to campaign against it.<p>I can hardly believe my ears. I naturally came to the village in hope of finding success stories that might lighten people's general gloom at the African condition. But never in my wildest dreams did I expect such a transformation as this. As Mariama and I retreat from the Chief's concession I ask her if this is really true.<p>'Yes, it's true,' she says. 'Excision doesn't happen here any more.'<p>But that's wonderful, I burble, telling her how proud of herself she should be. And so she should - as the first woman to stand against the tide she can take a great deal of credit for the change. <p>Of course the Chief could have been just telling me what I wanted to hear - as he certainly did on another issue (see Page 16). But over my weeks in the village the revolution in attitude is confirmed. There seems to be nothing taboo about the subject: everyone agrees excision no longer happens. When I ask a lively women's meeting about the issue, for example, one woman pipes up 'If I tried to do it to my daughter now she'd have me put in prison!'<p><img width=199 height=195 border=1 align=left hspace=10 src="ni_pix/268_genital_graph.gif"><p>As this indicates the change has not come about entirely through grassroots pressure from below. It is also a response to national education campaigns which have their roots in Sankara's Revolution. Sankara was the first of the country's leaders to take a stand against genital mutilation, calling the campaign 'a just and noble struggle' which aimed to emancipate women. In 1985, just before my first visit to the country, activists called for the abolition of excision during National Women's Week. This led directly to a national seminar in 1988 and ultimately to the production of a TV documentary with the World Health Organization called Ma fille ne sera pas excisee (My daughter will not be excised). The National Anti-Excision Committee was launched formally in 1990 by President Compaore, and this runs regular awareness meetings as well as producing TV and radio broadcasts. <p>The unanimity with which the practice is now condemned in the village is quite staggering - I almost want to find someone who disagrees to prove I am not the victim of some huge whitewash. I find it in the person of the old Imam, Umaru Tanaguda, who doggedly sticks to his position that neither woman nor man can be a Muslim unless they have been circumcised - it is for him a question of purification. But even the most devout members of his community have now moved beyond him and accepted that there is no connection between Islamic faith and female excision - the practice was never advocated in the Qur'an. Adama, for example, the husband in our film ten years ago, is himself a marabou, a kind of lay preacher, who teaches Islamic law in his own home. Yet he too has abandoned the practice so that Rasmatu, who was born while I was here ten years ago, has escaped mutilation.<p>If there are still excisions going on in the village then they happen clandestinely. In the nearby town, Garango, I meet a nurse who says that he does still encounter excision - but in only about ten per cent of girls. This is still too high, of course, but it is a pretty remarkable shift from the near 100 per cent of ten years ago. And perhaps the most telling thing of all is that the excisions are now happening in secret. Ten years ago the shame and stigma was on those who still had what was seen as 'the female penis' and who were thus not real women. The reversal is extraordinary.<p>I am determined to meet one of the old women who used to carry out the operation to see if she has accepted the new orthodoxy. Coca Maloni, who is profiled below, performed excisions up until three years ago - a chilling thought given the state of the enfeebled, shaking hands which held the razor blade so recently. Even more terrifyingly, she says she had always believed that the clitoris was a worm that would burrow back inside the girl and do internal damage if it were not cut out. But three years ago she'd been persuaded that it was a bad and unnecessary practice - she mentions official radio campaigns as a key factor in convincing her and the other old women that they should stop. We can lament the ignorance that governed her practice of excision over all those years - but we should also appreciate the humility with which she has accepted, at the very end of her life, that she has been mistaken.<p>Almost everyone I talk to in the village is against excision on health grounds rather than on those of sexual pleasure - and this is undoubtedly the right tack to have won the support of traditional religious and community leaders. But the sexual benefits for all concerned will also be enormous. Sexual intercourse is often very painful for excised women not just because of scarred tissue but also because the removal of the clitoris (and often the labia minora too) means that the vagina is not lubricated by arousal. Some women do report experiencing pleasure when the scar of their clitoris is touched but in practice the experience of sex is inevitably one of endurance for women. This is by no means an advantage for the man - though excision probably originated out of the need for husbands to be sure of their wives' fidelity. Burkinabe men who experience sex with an unexcised woman soon realize that her pleasure and active participation gives them much more enjoyment as well.<p>The idea that sexual pleasure will now be possible for all these girls and young women who would have been denied it before is fantastic. It shouldn't be underestimated in itself as a force that will propel this generation of women towards greater equality with their menfolk. Nothing changes in Africa? Don't you believe it!	<p>©Copyright: New Internationalist 1995<hr><a href="index.html"><img width=35 height=30 src="ni_pix/nilogo3.gif"> NI Home Page</a> <a href="contents268.html"><img width=45 height=68 src="ni_pix/268_cover_thumb.gif"> Issue 268</a><hr><p></body></html>

<H2>The Global School Project</H2>  

<P>School children around the globe share the same inquisitive desire to find

out more about the world outside their classroom. In the past this curiosity has

had to be satisfied by looking through atlases or encyclopedias. Now, the

Internet provides a new forum whereby children can learn from each other and

exchange ideas with their counterparts anywhere in the world. </P>

<P>The potential of this Global School is enormous; bringing children closer

together and creating a spirit of understanding and cooperation. The Global

School will also enable educational and training materials to be distributed to

any school linked to the Internet at almost no cost. Resources developed for

children in any country can be shared with schools throughout the world.

Interaid is involved in working with educational software developers in order to

build up a library of training materials fo distribution around the world.</P>

<P> To become part of the Global School, all that a school requires is a

computer, modem and suitable telecommunication link. Interaid is working towards

this goal by providing the relevant equipment and training to schools which are

not presently fortunate enough to have these facilities. Initially, this will

involve schools in the UK and South Africa but the long term objective is to

link up other secondary schools all over the world.

<H1>April 1996 Newsletter</H1>

<P>Welcome to the first edition of  'Short Cuts,' a new electronic publication

aimed at keeping you in touch with our efforts to link British schools with

their counterparts in poorer countries. 

</P>

<P>Interaid is the brain-child of Nick Short, a lecturer at Reading University,

whose long-standing interest in computer technology and its social and economic

impact, led him to recognise the potential of using the Internet to link young

people around the world.  After much research, Interaid was launched succesfully

on March 11th, 1996, with the intention of giving children the opportunity to

share information and learn more about different cultures and lifestyles. 

</P>

<P>

As an educational device, Interaid's concept of  the global school is

compelling. In countries where access  to new research, scientific data and

academic expertise is often hampered by financial problems, the global school,

with its walled-garden facility is of great value.   This has been  illustrated

sharply by the speed and enthusiasm with which schools in South Africa, Jamaica

and India have expressed their interest in our plans.  However, the merits of

Interaid's international, electronic network go far beyond than the transfer of

educational material from North to South. 

</P>

<P>For too long, the people of develping nations have been told what is good

for them and had &quot;improvement&quot; schemes imposed upon them, often with

the minimum of consultation.   Their countries are home to legions of &quot;advisers&quot;

and &quot;consultants&quot; who though well-meaning, are sometimes viewed as

prolonging a culture of dependency that has poorer countries looking to the

continents of Europe and North America for support.  We at Interaid do not

intend to follow this well-worn development path. We seek to create a true

relationship between school-children the world over, so that a meaningful

dialogue can take place.  Where once children from Southampton to Soweto, sought

understanding in books, encyclopaedias and atlases, our global school intiative

will enable them to explore cultural diversity, to asks questions about national

lifestyles and receive answers by lively, interactive means.

</P>

<P>

Interaid's global school will develop into a rich, well-spring of academic and

cultural information from which young people around the world will be able to

draw 24 hours a day.  Of course, we recognise the size of this bold undertaking.

</P>

<P>Over the last two decades, the sheer pace and scale of computer development

has added significantly to the South's technology deficit. This alone makes a

nonsense of the argument that certain regions of the world can afford to stand

aside blithely from such advances.  The people of poorer nations certainly give

no indication of wishing so to do. They want the modern technological skills

that can improve their nations, as any visitor to such countries can testify. 

It is our wish to assist this demand in a manner which is both sustainable and

responsible.  

</P>

<P><BR></P>

<H2>WHY INTERAID?  - By Nick Short 

</H2>

<P>In the past 10 years, information technology has had an enormous impact on

society in the developed countries of the world. Today everything from

commercial enterprises to academic institutes have become dependent on the

efficiency of computers.   Whilst there have been some negative repercussions,

there can be little doubt that the &quot;computer revolution&quot; has affected

people's lives to an extent comparable to that of  the 18th century's Industrial

revolution. 

</P>

<P>The developing countries of the world have lagged far behind the wealthy

nations in their adoption of this new technology. This is due to a limited

access to computers, the lack of training in their use and the problems of

adapting Western technology to Third World needs among other factors.   The

consequence has been that many such countries are at risk of being left behind

in this new revolution placing them at an even greater disadvantage in their

struggle to keep pace with Western development and maintain their global

influence. 

</P>

<P>INTERAID intends to address the unbalanced share of information technology

by channeling resources from computer users in the North to assist the people of

the South to develop similar skills.  

</P>

<P>Training software developed at the University of Reading will be sold in

Europe and the United States to fund Interaid projects in developing countries. 

 This &quot;Robin Hood&quot; approach provides the a win-win approach which will

benefit both existing computer users in the North world whilst encouraging new

users in the South. 

</P>

<P>To focus the limited resources of INTERAID we have decided initially to

concentrate on providing secondary schools in British Commonwealth countries

with the latest computer technology. All participating schools will be linked up

via the Internet to a secure walled garden where school children and their

teachers can communicate with each other around the world.   This will provide

the children of today with the technology that they will need for the coming

century. We also hope that by improving communication between countries we will

help to foster a climate of international understanding and cooperation. </P>

<H1>May 1996 Newsletter</H1>

<P>Welcome to Short Cuts, your monthly electronic publication keeping you

informed about Interaid&#146;s  plans to use the Internet to link schools in

Africa, Asia and the Caribbean with their British counterparts.  

</P>

<P>Interaid has been particularly active this month. Our attempt to create a

global school has caught the imagination of the British media and Interaid&#146;s

founder Nick Short, has featured in local and national press and on radio.  

</P>

<P>Our range of  Microsoft training software HOVI Help has increased and we

have been able to take on new workers to speed up our product development.  We

have submitted our software for review by some of Britain&#146;s leading

computer magazines. So far, the response has been generally favourable.  

</P>

<P>The continued success of  Hovi Help will make good our promise to create a

global so we shall not be resting on our laurels. New techniques and features

have been added to HOVI Help to enhance its appeal to first-time and

intermediate computer users. 

</P>

<P>The task of getting schools on line has proved as great as we imagined.

However, contacts have been established and we are particularly pleased with the

response we have received from the Ministry of Education in South Africa. There

is a keen interest in our plans and we can not act soon enough.  Keep your

comments coming in to Short Cuts. We reply to each message. Enjoy  

</P>

<H2>IN THE NEWS    

</H2>

<H3>WORDS, WORDS, WORDS 

</H3>

<P>Oxford University&#146;s 676-year-old Bodleian Library, holds 5.6 million

books with a word count of more than 700 billion. Computer experts have

predicted that they will be able to catalogue the entire collection onto just

six Compact Discs over the next ten years.  

</P>

<H3>ORACLE MARCH ON  

</H3>

<P>Predicting the end of the PC comes Oracle, chief trumpeter of the Net

Computer (NC). Oracle claims the NC will supplant the PC in the home and office

because it offers less expensive access to the Internet and Intranet, a basic

Internet system with enhanced security, which enables the publication of

internal web sites. 

</P>

<P>Microsoft, Compaq, Sun, Philips and Apple are all rumoured to be producing

their own home Internet systems which could be available this summer.  

</P>

<H3>BLAIR&#146;S  INTERNET PLEDGE TO SCHOOLS 

</H3>

<P>British Labour Party leader Tony Blair, reaffirmed in a keynote speech this

month that if elected his government will ensure that &#147;every school and

college will be connected up to the developing information superhighway.&#148; 

</P>

<P>Mr Blair has set up a panel under the chairmanship of Dennis Stevenson which

will investigate the challenges involved in linking educational institutions to

the Internet.  The panel comprises teachers, business people, financiers and

educationalists and has been asked to identify the main technological choices

available, their consequences for the national curriculum and teacher training

and how Labour&#146;s plans can be funded by a private-public partnership.   The

panel is expected to report by summer&#146;s end.    

</P>

<H2>NEWS FEATURE      

</H2>

<H3>THE SUPERHIGHWAY&#146;S GOLDEN GOOSE  

</H3>

<P>Students of the future will learn by computer, will be taught by computer in

virtual universities open 24 hours a day and will take their examinations by

computer.  The crowded, stuffy lecture theatre will be a thing of the past. The

nervous tension of the examination room may well go the same way. Pen, paper and

crib sheets will be the cherished relics of a distant era.   Virtual students

will be able to select their own teaching schedule, work at their own pace and

have access to a tutor, library and a virtual student union association where

surfers can net-graze to their heart&#146;s content. Welcome to the new world

order of the Cybergrad. 

</P>

<P>Within 10 years, the number of Internet-users world-wide will exceed 100

million. This and the sheer capacity of the Internet to transform the provision

of education and the methods by which students learn, are the current obsessions

of university chancellors, now sniffing out every opportunity to bring in more

revenue for their embattled institutions. 

</P>

<P>Distance learning is the new buzz word among academics and the race is now

on to make real the concept of using the Internet to educate students from Accra

to Acapulco in the comfort of their own homes. 

</P>

<P>Professor Diana Laurillard, the pro-Vice Chancellor of Britain&#146;s Open

University claims that her institution has already committed &#163;10 million to

investigating the potential of distance learning and  numbers 15,000 students

with access to its on-line network.   Talks are already underway between the

university&#146;s academics and business leaders with a view to pioneering a new

programme of courses for foreign students.  Professor Laurillard told the

British Daily Express newspaper that the Open University wanted to: &#147;Integrate

the complexity of technology with course structure to expand the options open to

students.   &#147;The technology aspect opens up whole new horizons for research

with access to vast resources of information around the world.&#148;  According

to the university, students of some 59 courses use the Internet, bulletin boards

and electronic discussion groups during their academic work and the university

has allocated &#163;1.25 million towards expanding the new technology used in

the delivery of its curriculum. 

</P>

<P>The Open University has also set up the 30-strong Knowledge Media Institute

(KMI) to investigate how  multi-media can enhance learning.  The attraction of

distance learning by computer is obvious. It may relieve some of the financial

costs, on both sides, of delivering an educational curriculum to foreign

students. Moreover, it may help to stem the brain drain from South to North and

make available research material which will enable academics to keep up to date

where ever they may be located. 

</P>

<P>Yet it is the very flexibility of learning by computer which has encouraged

institutions such as the Open University to look kindly on the system.  The Open

University&#146;s current distance learning techniques require students to watch

or video-record television transmissions which often air late in the evening or

early hours of the morning. Work is prepared by students in isolation and sent

to lecturers for appraisal.   Many Open University students complain of the

isolation they feel which is only punctuated by the occasional study weekends

and retreats. 

</P>

<P>The virtual universities of the future will offer students visual

interaction with lecturers and provide on-line study groups.  Indeed, the

prestigious North American Yale and Harvard universities now offer students the

world over the chance to attend via an international video-conferencing link

beamed by satellite.    

</P>

<H2>COMMENT                     

</H2>

<P>Each month, we invite readers of these pages to give their personal view on

matters affecting development, education or information technology. 

</P>

<P>This month, Malcolm King, a natural resources consultant, gives his personal

account of  development &#145;African style.&#146;   

</P>

<H3>PLAYING THE DEVELOPMENT GAME   

</H3>

<P>For something so apparently simple, development is a maddening term to get

people to agree upon. Everyone thinks they know what it means but then for each

person consulted it has different nuances.  &#147;Oh yes,&#148; said one friend.

&#147;Development is definitely progress towards greater freedom, more skills

and material well-being.&#148;  Comprehensive, I thought, until I asked another

who said that development can also mean the provision of a safe and reliable

water supply, road building and agricultural development. 

</P>

<P>For others, it is equally the availability of teachers, volunteers and

assorted experts to bring their collective expertise to bear on particular

issues which defy local competence.  Then again, there are those who give

development the widest scope possible. For example, one British aid agency in

Kenya negotiated with government authorities to bring to the country a cricket

coach who would improve local standards. Basketball &#145;experts&#146; have

already done tours of duty on behalf of America&#146;s Peace Corps. 

</P>

<P>Of course, all of these definitions are worthy of consideration but perhaps

it is this very flexibility that has given development something of a bad name. 

Drawing together all of the above explanations leads to the general conclusion

that development at its most positive should aim to improve and uplift what

exists currently.   Yet when this maxim is applied in any examination of

development in Africa, the result is sobering. In the 30 years since most

African countries gained their independence, the evidence available to justify

any association with the words development or progress is subject to doubt. </P>

<P>Africa has changed all right but how much of it has been for the better? 

The continent can throw up precious few exemplars to make good all the work done

and the words spoken by the serried ranks of government ministers,

non-governmental organisations and donor financiers.  Africa, the playground of

the rogue and the well-intentioned, can hardly be championed as a shining model

of the successful implementation of development theories proposed by the legions

of consultants who have offered their expensive expert analysis. 

</P>

<P>In all fairness, doubt should not be cast upon the genuine development work

which continues little remarked the length and breadth of Africa and has done so

for the past three decades.   Few can seriously argue that the improvements to

infrastructure and communications have not made a huge difference to communities

hitherto isolated.  Equally, it is unquestionably true that carefully appraised

and applied water projects or immunisation programmes have contributed

enormously to the betterment of people&#146;s lives. 

</P>

<P>Yet the overriding impression left by too many development projects is one

of missed opportunities.  Who is to blame? The usual suspects can be rounded up

and used as defence witnesses in the case  against development. Mischievous

governments, unscrupulous multi-nationals, widespread corruption, climatic

stress, over-reliance on commodities, impossible foreign debt schedules, ethnic

disputes and the ravages of neo-colonialism all take their places rightfully as

contributors to Africa&#146;s malaise.  But should United Nations programmes,

NGOs, donor organisations and aid agencies escape their share of the blame?  

Surely, after more than 30 years it is time to hold such organisations up to the

full glare of public scrutiny and ask of them a few hard questions. 

</P>

<P>Why is it that all the most important economic and social indices governing

individual quality of life and national well-being reflect so unfavourably on

Africa when there is so much development work taking place across the continent?

 In these circumstances, who and what is being developed?  If Africa has first

call on the world&#146;s experts, supplemented by a thriving home-grown

development &#145;industry&#146; which exists presumably to accelerate progress

and wealth generation, what are these development professionals doing as the

continent continues its economic decline? 

</P>

<P>The 1990 United Nations review of Africa&#146;s commodity problems, revealed

that the continent has 28 of the world&#146;s 42 poorest nations.  The same

report highlighted the decline in Africa&#146;s economic fortunes at a time of 

a rapid population explosion, perpetuating environmental deterioration and an

ever increasing dependence on food imports.

</P>

<P>

During the 1980&#146;s, only six of Africa&#146;s 50 states experienced growth

exceeding more than two per cent per annum. Since 1980, income per head in

Africa has declined every year, although some analysts point to recent

improvements in countries such as Uganda and Ghana.  Moreover, in 1988, Africa

earned $18 billion dollars from the sale of its commodities, excluding oil, on

the international markets. In real terms, this was 28 per cent lower than in

1980 and 35 per cent less than the sum received in 1970.  Published data of this

kind does nothing but confirm the perception that Africa has ceased to develop

economically in comparison with other parts of the world and advances the charge

of the pessimists that this situation will only worsen.  Something clearly is

awry. </P>

<P>So much effort, so many projects, so great the number of experts when the

aggregate result is so infuriatingly meagre.  Of course, it is not wise to

censure NGOs, donors and development agencies too severely when the trying

conditions they are often forced to work under are taken into consideration.

</P>

<P>

It is also true to say that the odds against improvement, progress and

development on the African continent do seem daunting especially given the

current international economic position.  But let us not be too charitable.

Development has &#147;failed&#148; because it has become a game, a righteous

indulgence which has become somehow removed from the real lives of the

communities it was intended to serve. 

</P>

<P>The game goes something like this. Development agencies petition foreign

donors with elaborate and well meaning proposals requiring vital funding.  

Money is donated accordingly to the favoured projects which begin amid scenes of

widespread joy and energy. Evaluation is often haphazard. Failure all too

frequently ensues by which time the donor has forgotten about the project and

moved on to other interests, leaving the way clear for the agency to demand more

money for another absolutely vital concern.  Even failure itself does not always

demand a critical review. Generous allowances are made and excuses all too often

receive a fairer hearing than they might deserve.  A grotesque parody, you might

think but I would wager that it remains closer to the truth than some dare

admit. 

</P>

<P>

&#147;Progress&#148; has become something of a merry-go-round, development

agencies and their foreign sponsors twirling arm in arm while Africa awaits the

results.  Donor organisations, NGOs, environment and development agencies have

all too often been at fault in their choice of projects.  Kenya&#146;s

disastrous Turkwell Dam and the &#145;white-elephant&#146; fish processing plant

at Turkhana, are but mere cameos of development fiascos across Africa. 

</P>

<P>As the development sector blossoms, a development culture flourishes and

sloth and waste set in. With the most emotive of working briefs to dispel

criticism, NGOs in cohoots with their foreign donor counterparts, have become

adept at junketing.  The circuit of conferences, workshops and &#145;brainstorming

sessions,&#146; spans the globe. No country is too far flung to host one

activity or another. </P>

<P>Many a senior development worker has toured the world in the name of

progress.  It is not uncommon to find NGO and development agency representatives

staying in expensive hotels and eating nouvelle cuisine while they discuss the

effects of poverty, malnutrition and under-development in their home countries. 

On top of all of this, participants at such conferences can expect to receive

payment for their attendance. Those who were present at a six day &#145;development&#146;

workshop in Nakuru, Kenya in August 1994, pocketed $240 in hard currency &#147;expenses&#148;

just for turning up, even though the costs of their travel, board and lodging

were met by the conference&#146;s sponsor. 

</P>

<P>It is churlish to suggest that little of substance emerges from such

workshops or that more would be achieved if delegates gathered together in grim,

austere surroundings. Conferences are important opportunities to network and

share ideas with like-minded people. In developing countries, they are often

crucial in mobilising a national action plan.  Yet, by establishing the practice

of  paying delegates and installing them in plush hotels, organisers have become

hostage to the curse of the  &#147;going rate.&#148;  Failure to pay an

anticipated sum in hard currency could lead to a conference being abandoned by

the very people it was designed to attract. </P>

<P>A chicken and egg dilemma yes, but surely one the donors and their local

agents might have seen coming.  Foresight however, is all to uncommon given the

size of the bureaucracy spawned in the name of development. This cumbersome,

conservative and self-regarding behemoth devours enormous sums on salaries,

trips, projects, property and additional &#147;expenses.&#148; How much of this

vast fortune can truly be justified?  Moreover, far too much money is spent on

what appears to be passing whims. This years fad - population control. Last year&#146;s

- tree nurseries. And next year? The runners include sustainable energy projects

and women&#146;s groups! All very worthy but real progress requires strategic,

long-term planning and a clear vision rather than the multi-focus approach which

currently prevails.

</P>

<P>

The sheer number of players adds to this confusion. With the myriad NGO

proposals competing alongside government programmes and foreign-aided private

schemes, there is tremendous scope for deliberate misadventure.  In presenting

the case against development as it reveals itself now, it is not my intention to

challenge its legitimacy entirely, only to point out its failings.  Development

agencies can play a responsible role in improving the fortunes of Africa&#146;s

citizens. If they fail to do so, their very credibility may soon be open to

question.     

</P>

<P>So, is Malcolm King right? Is development a game played by the self-seeking

to Africa&#146;s detriment? Tell us what you think.

         commemorates a crucial victory by Protestant colonists over
         Irish Catholics 300 years ago. Catholics have decided to

<H1>Danger for peace looms in Derry</H1>

<P>By JOHN WEST</P>

<P>DERRY/LONDONDERRY, AUGUST 9 - This is a dangerous weekend for the
failing peace process in Northern Ireland. Long negotiations have
failed to defuse a crisis over Saturday's planned march by the
Apprentice Boys Association, which commemorates a crucial victory by
Protestant colonists over Irish Catholics 300 years ago. Catholics
have decided to hold their own march on Friday night.</P>

<P>Leaders and politicians from both sides of Northern Ireland's
religious divide are warning that in the present tense atmophere, a
confrontation in <A HREF="ot_town.html">Londonderry - or Derry</A> as
its majority Catholic population knows it - could reignite full-scale
sectarian fighting.</P>

<P>The British government has banned all public processions on a
section of Londonderry's 17th-century town walls overlooking the
Catholic Bogside area where the Apprentice Boys had been demanding to
march. Security forces have put up razor wire and metal sheeting to
close the stretch of walls.</P>

<P>"We're in the majority here in Derry and we have to stand up for
the Nationalist community in the whole of Northern Ireland,"
<A HREF="ot_views.html">Margaret Gallagher</A>, a teacher who was
elected to the Bogside Residents' Association when it was formed last
year, told OutThere after the <A HREF="ot_watershed.html">decision to
go ahead</A> with the Nationalist march on Friday. "We should show
that we can stand up for what we believe in without being threatened
by anyone and without threatening anyone."</P>

<P>The mood in the loyalist Protestant camp is grimmer. "The people
here are down, it's bad for our side, you know?"
<A HREF="ot_views.html">Alexander Trotter</A>, a middle-aged welder,
commented bitterly. "The English don't want us, they think we're a
headache. The Free State (the Republic of Ireland) doesn't want us,
we're too much trouble."</P>

<P><A HREF="ot_sinnfein.html">Martin McGuiness</A>, deputy head of
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA),
urged Nationalists in Derry to remain "calm, peaceful, dignified and
disciplined".</P>

<P>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew,
issued the ban on Wednesday night after days of talks failed to
produce a "local agreement" between the Apprentice Boys and the
Bogside Residents Association. It prohibits all processions and open
air meetings on the section of Londonderry's walls overlooking the
Bogside from now until the end of August.</P>

<P>Mayhew angered and dismayed nationalists last month when he
refused to intervene in a crisis over a loyalist march in Portadown.
The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) first banned the march and
blocked the road, but then gave way after some of the worst street
violence since Northern Irelands "Troubles" erupted in 1969. The
<A HREF="ot_troubles.html">long years of political violence</A> began
after a similar dispute over an Apprentice Boys parade in
Londonderry.</P>

<P>Mayhew said: "My purpose in making this order is to assist the RUC
in its task of preserving public order and protecting the community
over the coming days, and is not intended to favour any side in the
current dispute ." He added: "In the event of local agreement being
reached before 10 August, the order will be rescinded."</P>

<P>The Apprentice Boys march is the last major parade of the Orange
marching season, which for Northern Ireland's Unionist majority is
vital reaffirmation that the victories of their ancestors are still
revered and that the province is still part of the United Kingdom.
</P>

<P>But for many Catholics, marches by Orange orders loyal to the
British Queen and the Union Jack affront their sense of Irish
nationalism and increasingly in recent years they have organised to
oppose them.</P>

<P>In Derry, local MP John Hume has chaired at least five extensive
meetings between the Bogside Residents' Association and the
Apprentice Boys in the past week. The latest round of talks collapsed
on Wednesday.</P>

<P>It is not clear whether or when the two groups may meet
face-to-face again. Relations between them have deteriorated, with
Apprentice Boys' Governor Alistair Simpson calling the leader of the
Bogside Residents Association, Donncha MacNiallais, 'dictatorial'.
</P>

<P>To an outsider the actual dispute might now seem insignificant.
</P>

<P>The Apprentice Boys had agreed to allow only 250 of the thousands
of marchers who will be in Londonderry to parade along the 150-metre
section of the city wall that directly overlooks the Bogside. The
Nationalist negotiators were demanding that the number should be cut
to just 13 - one for each of the original Protestant Apprentice Boys
who closed the gates of the city to the army of the deposed Catholic
King James II in 1689, an action which began the bloody three-month
siege of Derry and gave birth to what is still the rallying cry of
Unionism, "No surrender".</P>

<P>The two sides were also arguing about whether marchers could carry
banners and play piped music on the disputed section of the walls.
</P>

<P>In the politically charged atmosphere of Northern Ireland, even
the words used to describe the negotiating process have become an
issue. The Bogside Residents Association have been arguing that the
Apprentice Boys should agree to the general principle of seeking
consent from residents of areas they plan to march through. But the
Apprentice Boys are objecting to the use of terms like 'consent',
which they feel implies they do not have a right to march peacefully
in their own city. Instead, they say they could agree to the idea of
reaching 'consensus' over the march.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="ot_ceasefire.html">breakdown of a ceasefire</A> by
paramilitary groups and the week-long stand-off over last month's
march in Portadown have made many people here worried that conflict
in Londonderry could escalate into a full-scale return of political
violence.</P>

<P>The parade in Portadown turned into a major confrontation when
police originally blocked the Orangemen's march through a Catholic
area.</P>

<P>Thousands of Unionists gathered at the small town, and Protestant
areas of Belfast rioted for five nights running. Dozens of Catholics
living in majority Protestant areas were terrorised out of their
homes.</P>

<P>Eventually, police chief Sir Hugh Annesley changed his mind and
allowed the march to go ahead, which created enormous anger in the
nationalist community and damaged carefully nurtured relations
between Britain and the Irish government in Dublin.</P>

<P>Both the Apprentice Boys and the Bogside Residents have made
well-publicised appeals in the past few days to supporters from
outside Londonderry to come and show their support.</P>

<P>Irish-Americans, too, have become involved. Bill Quinn, a leading
member of the Noraid nationalist fund-raising group, addressed a
public gathering in Enniskillen on Monday, saying he and 40 other
members of the organisation fully backed opposition to the Orange
marches. Quinn, from Kansas City, is leading a fact-finding mission
by the group to Northern Ireland.</P>

<P>The prospect of a rogue loyalist paramiliary unit with no
commitment to the ceasefire declared in 1994 has also loomed in the
last week. The Ulster Volunteer Force, the most formidable of the
Loyalist paramilitary groups, expelled seven men from its mid-Ulster
brigade after they publicly insulted leaders of the Progressive
Unionist Party, the group's political wing.</P>

<P>The Portadown unit - led by a notorious figure known as 'King Rat'
- has been questioned by police over last month's killing of a
Catholic taxi driver.</P>

<P>Now that they are officially at large, the question is whether
they will feel free to strike Catholic targets, or even if the UVF
leadership will try to preempt them to stop them seizing the
initiative within the loyalist community.</P>

<P>The IRA announced in February after a huge bomb in London that it
was ending the ceasefire it began in August 1994. But it has been
careful so far not to launch any attacks in Northern Ireland itself.
Ordinary people in the province relished the months of peace, when
military patrols disappeared from the streets, tourism boomed, and
outside investment began to flow into the economy.</P>

<P>In a further ominous move, a lobby group has been petitioning the
RUC not to equip police with plastic bullets this weekend. The
police, who were equipped with them during last month's unrest over
Portadown, have replied that they actually save life by dealing with
'serious public disorder' in a non-lethal way.</P>

<H1>OutThere on the streets of Derry after the Apprentice Boys' march
</H1>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>Here is an edited transcript of OutThere's live chat
session on the Net on the night of Saturday 10 August 1996:</FONT>
</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle, OutThere news service:</B> Welcome to OutThere's
live chat with correspondent John West, on the street in the centre
of Derry at the end of a tense day when thousands of Protestant
Apprentice Boys marched through the largely-Catholic city to
commemorate victory over a Catholic army 300 years ago.</P>

<P>Over to John to set the scene...</P>

<P><B>John West:</B> It's now Saturday night in the city of
Derry/Londonderry in Northern Ireland and, thankfully, no blood has
been spilt over today's march by Protestants in the city. Here in the
Diamond, inside the picturesque 17th century walls of the old town,
the streets throng with Orangemen drinking in pubs and a fresh breeze
blowing up from the River Foyle blows the litter of thousands of
marchers along the road.</P>

<P>Neither side of this divided city could be said to be happy. The
Protestants - in a minority here but a majority in Northern Ireland
as a whole - feel bitterly disappointed that the British government
stopped them marching along the length of Derry's walls, which are
steeped in a history in which they take great pride. For them, it is
one more sign that they are still 'under siege' - from the Catholic
Nationalist community who want to leave Britain.</P>

<P>But down on the Bogside, a few hundred yards from here beneath the
city walls, many Nationalists feel that the issues are still
unresolved. They resent the fact that the town was effectively
blocked off to them throughout the day, although they represent some
75 percent of the town's population. They also resent what they see
as the arrogance of the Apprentice Boys and the Orangemen in refusing
to come to an agreement with them.</P>

<P>There may yet be trouble tonight. At least some gangs of
Protestant youths are almost bound to be on the rampage along these
streets, and among their favourite victims are journalists - so watch
out! Protestant leaders have enigmatically spoken of 'walking the
walls at a time of their own choice'. There's an outside chance that
could mean storming the barricades tonight. But it could have been a
lot worse. Both sides had talked cataclysmically of today as being a
possible flashpoint that could plunge Northern Ireland back into
full-scale blood on the streets.</P>

<P>So far, that hasn't happened and I sit in the Diamond, with a pint
of Guinness for good measure, waiting to hear from you.</P>

<P>...But just hang on a second, there's too much drunk angry
shouting coming this way. I'm moving right now...</P>

<P><B>Saira Shah:</B> Hope he's not getting nutted.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Me too.</P>

<P>(John West logs off the live chat session)</P>

<P><B>Saira Shah: </B>Oops</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> This proves we were definitely live from the
street.</P>

<P>(John West logs back onto the live chat session)</P>

<P><B>John West</B>: waves but discreetly, trying not to attract too
much drunk Orange attention</P>

<P><B>Saira Shah:</B> So what's been going on?</P>

<P><B>John West:</B> I just pegged it from the Diamond down to
Shipquay Street. Someone just came to tell me there are two busloads
of Orangemen shouting and throwing bottles down at 'the Gaelics'...
while about 20 'Gaelics' are shouting back at them.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Do the people in the centre of Derry know that
there have been some clashes elsewhere - I've just heard on the radio
that there's a standoff in the village of Dunloy.</P>

<P><B>John West:</B> Yes, they know... FIVE RUC vans storming up the
street, STORMING. They must be heading towards the drunken Orangemen.
</P>

<P><B>Saira Shah:</B> How far away are the Orangemen?</P>

<P><B>John West:</B> We're talking unruly teenagers, as far as I've
seen. They must be gathering up the HQ of the Apprentice Boys, which
is about 300 yards from here. I still think there's unlikely to be
any large scale trouble here tonight.</P>

<P><B>Saira Shah:</B> So - do you think this proves that stamping
down hard on the marchers is the way to stop the kind of aggro we saw
after Drumcree?</P>

<P><B>John West:</B> I'm not sure about that. Drumcree was Drumcree
and Derry is Derry. One thing I've realised since getting here two
days ago is that the whacking Catholic majority here really makes all
the difference to the dynamics of the situation. The Orangemen
weren't going to stand off here in Derry because they simply
couldn't, whereas Portadown is smack in the middle of the Protestant
heartland. To answer your question, Saira, I'd say the government
could certainly try cracking down on them more than they have done in
the past but they really have to assess each situation on its own
merits...</P>

<P><B>John West:</B> There's now a little conversational knot around
this laptop - two Catholics and an English photographer. The
Catholics want to know who we think is in the right and who's in the
wrong.</P>

<P><B>Saira Shah:</B> Let's hear one of them talk to us.</P>

<P><B>Paddy:</B> My name is Paddy, I'm 33 years of age. I've two
babies, a boy and a girl. One's 14 and one's 11.</P>

<P>John West asks what Paddy thinks about today.</P>

<P><B>Paddy:</B> It's up to the government. I believe that the
Orangemen should be able to walk on the walls. They defended the
place in 1689.</P>

<P><B>Saira Shah: </B>What numbers are reasonable?</P>

<P><B>Paddy:</B> 13 (the number of the original Apprentice Boys who
shut the city's gates against the advancing Catholic army in 1689).
</P>

<P><B>Saira Shah:</B> And when does a march become a provocation?
</P>

<P><B>Paddy:</B> When it's marching through an area where the
marchers are not welcome. They DID march, just not along the walls
over the Bogside... but the centre of town has seen 10,000 Orangemen
today.</P>

<P><B>Saira Shah:</B> Do you think there is trouble to come?</P>

<P><B>Paddy:</B> No, not between the two communities here in Derry
because Sinn Fein don't want trouble.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Do you think peace is possible? Do the two
sides really want it?</P>

<P><B>Paddy:</B> No, most definitely not. They've ruled us for too
long, the Unionists.</P>

<P><B>Saira Shah: </B>Do you think there is any LONG-TERM solution to
the marching season? Or will it always have to be thrashed out on an
individual basis?</P>

<P><B>Paddy:</B> I don't know, but there has to be parity of esteem.
</P>

<P><B>John West:</B> Paddy was arrested and tortured as a teenager.
Paddy wants to know what you all think and he's just off home so make
it fast.</P>

<P><B>Saira Shah:</B> I'm trying to understand it all, specifically
the marches. Intellectually, I understand the reasons and rationale
of why it's considered important. But I still can't really grasp it
emotionally.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> I think it's hard for British people who aren't
from Ireland to understand the depth of passion.</P>

<P><B>Paddy:</B> It's hundreds of years of history.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> I mean my ancestors were Welshmen who were
occupied by Edward the First but I don't feel that means much to me
now. In Ireland, it's different.</P>

<P><B>Paddy:</B> When you have to go through three generations like
in my family, and none of us had a job and we all lived in the same
house, and them Protestants wouldn't give us the vote. And my Dad was
in the British army, too, in the Enniskillen Fusiliers, he was in
Palestine.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> I take your point - history means so much when
there is present-day discrimination.</P>

<P><B>Paddy:</B> I'm 33 and I've never had a job. I left school in
1979 and have NEVER had a job. I had no education. You see, when I
started secondary school it was 1973 and it was hard core then from
'73 to '75. You weren't really educated, you were trying to move guns
around and bombs around rather than going to school. That was
expected of you. I regret that now for my children but not for
myself.</P>

<P>(Paddy and his wife leave. A young man has come up.)</P>

<P><B>George:</B> I want to be known as George. I'm 17. That's not my
real name.</P>

<P><B>John West:</B> Ask George a question, he's unemployed, lives in
the Bogside, spent tonight walking about and in and out of bars...
George doesn't want to be known as George any more, wants to be known
as Toss, which is his real nickname. So, questions for Toss?</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Do you think there'll be a settlement in your
lifetime?</P>

<P><B>Toss: </B>(Thinks about it for a second) Aye, because if Sinn
Fein get to sit down with that John Major there'll be peace.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Do you think the IRA should agree to a
ceasefire to make it possible for Sinn Fein to talk to Major?</P>

<P><B>Toss: </B>Those two men from the UVF (Protestant paramilitary
group) went to talk with your man Major. So why not Sinn Fein?</P>

<H1>Nationalist councillor: Unionist values must be accommodated
</H1>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>Here is an edited transcript of OutThere's interview
with Belfast City councillor Alex Attwood on Sunday 10 August
1996.</FONT></P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle, OutThere news service:</B> Welcome to the first of
two live OutThere interviews this evening on prospects for peace in
Northern Ireland. With OutThere correspondent John West in
Revelations cyber cafe in the centre of Belfast is Alex Attwood,
member of Belfast City Council for the Social Democratic and Labour
Party, the mainstream Nationalist party in Northern Ireland.</P>

<P>Mr Attwood has represented the Upper Falls area on Belfast City
Council since 1985 and ran the 1987 general election campaign of the
SDLP's Member of Parliament for West Belfast, Joe Hendron. He works
as a lawyer, and his legal skills have helped to steer the SDLP
through the complex procedural wrangles that dominated the first
sessions of all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland.</P>

<P>First question - A month ago, Northern Ireland erupted in violence
when police rerouted a Protestant parade in Portadown. Yesterday, the
Apprentice Boys' parade passed off peacefully in Londonderry, even
though police closed off part of its route. Why such a different
outcome?</P>

<P><B>Alex Attwood:</B> First, because there was a process of
dialogue in Derry which created a better atmosphere than in
Portadown. Second, the British Government adopted a different
approach in banning marches from part of the parade route, which
defused some problems though encouraged others. Third, the hype and
attention on Derry and the very serious threat that the situation
presented in Derry made virtually everybody attempt to pull back from
an even more serious situation than on 12th July.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Is there any way to build on this improvement
in the atmosphere?</P>

<P><B>Alex Attwood:</B> Yes. The process of dialogue between marching
orders and protest groups needs to be expanded and developed. The
British government need to take serious control of the issue by
reviewing the law on marching, encouraging principles that would
govern march routes. There should be a commission on cultural
celebration of all the traditions and a better method of resolution
of disputed marches. In addition, there is an endless range of
political initiatives that must be taken immediately to defuse the
very deep-seated community tensions.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> The problem seemed to be in Derry that the
government had to take control because the marching order and the
local groups couldn't reach agreement. Is it practical to think that
'local agreements' can be reached in future?</P>

<P><B>Alex Attwood:</B> There is no alternative unless there is an
annual rerun of conflicts over routes, increasing the number of areas
and the potential for catastrophe... There has to be an improvement
in the overall atmosphere otherwise if it's not marching, it will be
another issue - policing, human rights, or something else.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> A question from someone nicknamed Dual in the
Revelations cafe - What are the SDLP going to do to avoid
confrontation on a similar or worse scale than that which we have
witnessed? Will the next 10 months be used fruitfully; will attempts
be made to enable discussion without so much argument about
rudimentary issues such as George Mitchell (US Senator appointed to
chair all-party peace talks)?</P>

<P><B>Alex Attwood:</B> First, we will continue to maximise the
opportunities of the current talks process, moving beyond procedural
issues, getting into negotiations on a comprehensive agenda, which is
negotiations on all the relationships in this island and between
these islands which are at the heart of the conflict. We will
encourage local initiatives as (SDLP leader) John Hume valiantly
demonstrated in Derry to resolve marching and other justice issues.
Most critically, we will hold the line as always against extremism,
both political and paramilitary.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> But there has been a blockage in the peace
process in the last few weeks - what has caused the problem, in your
view, and how can it be unblocked?</P>

<P><B>Alex Attwood:</B> The primary reason for the blockage is that
people and parties will not engage in dialogue on local issues and
broader issues, and when they do engage, they are not serious or
genuine. In the absence of proper structured creative dialogue, you
end up with a stand-off on a disputed march route or at the talks
table. However, the blockages reflect people's and parties' concerns
about their community and their future, and also reflect the refusal
of too many to accept change, to encourage equality, and to take
risks for peace.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> It looks as if there is a need for confidence
building measures. Do you have any suggestions of what could be done
to build confidence in practical ways immediately?</P>

<P><B>Alex Attwood:</B> Yes. The British government, who surrendered
to threat and terror in July, have a primary responsibility to accept
publicly the crisis that the Nationalist community is now
experiencing. Secondly, rather than slavishly defending the RUC
(Royal Ulster Constabulary), they should acknowledge that the RUC's
contribution to this crisis is profound. Thirdly, they should move
the talks process forward urgently from the 9th September by showing
leadership on the issue of decommissioning, by accepting that
decommissioning can only be dealt with in parallel to the
negotiations NOT in advance, and should fully adopt the Mitchell
proposals. The British government with the Irish government must
prevail on all the parties to accept the comprehensive agenda of the
talks, that everything is on the table and must be addressed to
secure agreement, including constitutional issues such as the future
constitutional position of the north of Ireland.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> This connects to a question that Dual would
like to ask - Does Mr Attwood agree that the Dublin Government has a
place in securing a lasting agreement between both sides?</P>

<P><B>Alex Attwood:</B> Yes, the Dublin government is essential. As a
Nationalist, I identify with the rest of the island, I wish to share
in the life of the rest of the island. That requires political,
institutional and symbolic links between the north and the south of
the island.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Question from Saira Shah - you've laid out what
the British government can do, what should the nationalist community
do as well?</P>

<P><B>Alex Attwood:</B> First, we must repeat that the Unionist
community has an equal and full place on this island, that what they
value - the British way of life, the loyalty to the crown, the
commitment to the British union - must be accommodated in any future
agreement. Second, while we state that the Irish people have the
right to self-determination exercised by referendum on the island,
north and south, we also accept the principle of consent, which is
that any future constitutional change must be with the consent of the
people of Northern Ireland.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Someone nicknamed TineBeag from Dublin asks -
Do you think that a solution satisfactory to nationalists could
involve Northern Ireland staying within the UK but with greater links
to the Republic of Ireland?</P>

<P><B>Alex Attwood:</B> What we wish to see is an agreed Ireland with
institutions of government which have the allegiance of all the
people. Now, what an agreed Ireland would look like is what is agreed
between the governments and the parties and endorsed by the people.
My strong preference is that the most durable basis for peace and
prosperity is the reunification of our country but realistically what
the Unionist parties will agree to may fall somewhat short of our
preference.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Dual asks - Does Mr Attwood know that those in
the South want a United Ireland? What do they think about sharing
their growing prosperity?</P>

<P><B>Alex Attwood:</B> My sense from being in Dublin regularly and
from my parental ties to Cork City, where they were born and bred, is
that the people in the south want peace, that they know that peace
will need political and institutional changes, that in that context,
the opportunities for economic growth throughout the island are
immense and that peace and political agreement can bring economic
advantage to all and not loss to the south.</P>

<P>I want to say another thing. A united Ireland is one political
model which MIGHT secure agreement and the one I am personally
committed to but an AGREED Ireland may have many political forms best
suited for our political conditions.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> What would you say has been the significance of
this past weekend's events for the Nationalist community in Northern
Ireland?</P>

<P><B>Alex Attwood:</B> First, the Nationalist community
instinctively knew that we all had to step back from the brink, that
a rerun of the stand-off, the terror and the threat before and after
Drumcree would be too much for peace and the political process.
Second, the Nationalist community committed itself to the principle
of dialogue over marching, and over everything else, and this is a
very important anchor in the political process. Third, the crisis and
lack of confidence in the state has NOT declined but there is a
stability, generally, that didn't exist even a week ago.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle: </B>TineBeag asks - Economically, do you think that
given the large (3 billion pound odd) subsidy Great Britain pumps
into Northern Ireland that nationalists might be inclined to vote for
a continuation of the UK for economic reasons, e.g. the much lower
tax rates?</P>

<P><B>Alex Attwood:</B> Well, we would prefer that whatever political
agreement emerges, it is underpinned by financial and social
guarantees from the British and Irish governments, from Europe, from
private monies invested, particularly from America, and critically,
there is a sustained attack on social need and the historic
inequality in jobs and justice, because after 25 years a male
Catholic adult is 2.2 times more likely to be unemployed than a
Protestant male adult and that equally the economic disadvantage of
many Protestants is equal to that of their Catholic neighbours .
Ultimately, as the ceasefire period proved, the opportunities of
tourist jobs, U.S. investment, special European packages, and
increased cross-border trade suggest political agreement can bring
economic advantage on a broad scale to those in greatest need.</P>

<P>Your readers might like to know that within the last four weeks
the foundations were laid for Belfast's Hilton hotel, symbolically
putting our city on the map.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Final question from Saira Shah - Do you think
the new stability you mentioned will last for any length of time?
</P>

<P><B>Alex Attwood:</B> Northern Ireland people have immense
resilience and defiance. That's why Belfast did not become a Bosnia.
Something in the make-up of its people pulled them back from the
excesses of open civil conflict. With that human resource comes
stability in the face of all threat and terror and that will endure
now also. Change and agreement may come very slowly but a return to
25 years of violence and disorder seems not likely because the
community does not believe there is any advantage to war and refuses
to live with the consequences of war.</P>

<H1>Ulster Unionist MP: Nationalists talk at us and about us but not
to us</H1>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>Here is an edited transcript of OutThere's interview
with Ulster Unionist MP Ken Maginnis on Sunday 10 August 1996.</FONT>
</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle, OutThere news service:</B> Welcome to OutThere's
second live interview this evening on prospects for peace in Northern
Ireland. In the hot seat in Revelations cyber cafe in the centre of
Belfast with OutThere correspondent John West is Ken Maginnis, MP for
Fermanagh and South Tyrone and spokesman on security matters for the
Ulster Unionist Party.</P>

<P>Mr Maginnis has been MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone since 1983.
Once a teacher, he also served for several years as a volunteer
policeman and a part-time officer in the Ulster Defence Regiment of
the British Army. He's been described as the "liberal voice of
Unionism" but also as a "Prophet of Doom" who never believed that the
ceasefire announced by the IRA in 1994 would last.</P>

<P>First question - A month ago, Northern Ireland erupted in violence
when police rerouted a Protestant parade in Portadown. Yesterday, the
Apprentice Boys' parade passed off peacefully in Londonderry, even
though police closed off part of its route. Why such a different
outcome?</P>

<P><B>Ken Maginnis:</B> The community has gained some experience from
the Drumcree, that is the Portadown, events. In Portadown, the parade
that was taking place substituted for seven parades that used to take
place there and the Garvaghy Road route was previously agreed as a
compromise. For the Orangemen to be told that they could ONLY parade
in what amounted to their own ghetto areas was a contradiction of the
very thing that Nationalists had demonstrated for 27 years before, in
1969. In Londonderry, however, because of IRA activity for 25 years,
the parade route along the wall had been closed. It was only opened
again last year and so it became a reasonable compromise, if somewhat
unwelcome, that part of the route should be abandoned until the whole
question of parade rights was sorted out</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Is there some way to build on this outcome to
reinvigorate the wider peace process in Northern Ireland?</P>

<P><B>Ken Maginnis:</B> The important thing that society as a whole
has got to realise is that driving each tradition strictly into its
own ghetto area is going to create fear and distrust, the very diet
on which terrorism feeds. Therefore, the resolution to the parades
issue must be one where both traditions can have free access to
traditional and main arterial routes rather than what is happening at
present. A difference can be made and indeed should be made between
traditional parades which have a degree of pageantry attached and
political parades. The political parades should be confined to areas
where there is significant political support but those which have
traditional aspects should be able to continue unimpeded along
traditional routes and particularly arterial highways.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Do you think it was right that the government
took responsibility for the route of the parades in Londonderry,
rather than leaving it to the police as at Drumcree?</P>

<P><B>Ken Maginnis:</B> I believe the ideal solution would be a
predetermination as to what is generally acceptable, that parades
should be registered and that the size and nature be carefully
defined. Then the police will only have the task of applying the law
in terms of behaviour and general decorum. They should certainly not
be required to make operational decisions which have significant
political undertones. The government's forthcoming enquiry into this
matter will decide how contentious issues are to be resolved.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> A question from someone nicknamed Dual in the
Revelations cafe - Does Mr Maginnis agree that the only way to secure
a real lasting peace is for all the Unionist representatives at all
levels to be in immediate and direct dialogue with Gerry Adams and
Sinn Fein regardless of their obvious association (with the IRA)? If
not, who will the Unionists talk to?</P>

<P><B>Ken Maginnis:</B> The Ulster Unionist party has been in talks
with every constitutional, political party in Northern Ireland, with
the Irish government and obviously with our own government. We have
talked in London, in Belfast and in Dublin. We have been members of
every elected body over the past 75 years and have played a
significant part in trying to reach a compromise and agreement.</P>

<P>It has been Nationalist parties which have traditionally boycotted
the democratic process and we see an example of this in the
reluctance of the SDLP to play a full part in the current political
talks process. They have been selective in participating in the
actual negotiations without giving whole-hearted support to the
debating chamber. In fact they have now withdrawn from that chamber.
To ask Unionists under these circumstances to consider entering into
dialogue with IRA/Sinn Fein is to ask too much. These are the people
who promised a ceasefire but who without any forewarning exploded a
bomb at Canary Wharf on 9 February last... That despite the fact that
our government had talked to them at official level, at junior
minister level and at cabinet level; despite the fact that the Irish
government had released terrorist prisoners; despite the fact that
President Clinton had facilitated Gerry Adams in the United States.
What is the point in Unionists compromising on democracy by entering
into talks with those who cannot be depended upon to honour a promise
made even to the President of the United States?</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Question now from someone nicknamed TineBeag in
Dublin - Do you think different rules should apply to parades which
campaign against the other's community's beliefs, e.g. an Orange
Order march and those that merely celebrate their own, e.g. a Church
of Ireland march?</P>

<P><B>Ken Maginnis:</B> I consider the Orange order, the Royal Black
Preceptory, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Irish National
Forresters, and the Apprentice Boys as religious/cultural
organisations. These should be treated as 'traditional'. I was
suggesting that purely political parades should be judged on the
nature of the issue about which they are organised. For example a
political parade which demonstrates against the closure of a hospital
would normally be cross-community and would present no difficulty,
whereas one which demonstrated against the rights of a Gaelic club to
fly the Irish tricolour or one which demonstrated against the RUC
would be controversial, and would need to be carefully considered in
terms of how where and when it would take place.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Looking more widely, what do you think is
needed to unblock the peace process now?</P>

<P><B>Ken Maginnis:</B> It is often overlooked that more than 80
percent of society in Northern Ireland functions normally. It is
among this greater number of people that there needs to be more
positive activity to support constitutional political initiatives. It
is particularly disappointing that so many decent people who would
never approve of guns and bombs have been attracted by the blatantly
sectarian activities of Sinn Fein/IRA. In the Ormeau Road, Portadown,
and other areas of Northern Ireland, the terrorist who knows he
cannot win a military campaign is capitalising on the baser sectarian
instincts of some people. It is imperative that these folk recognise
the danger and draw back from such confrontation before it is too
late.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> What measures can you as the Ulster Unionist
Party take to encourage "positive activity" across the sectarian
divide?</P>

<P><B>Ken Maginnis:</B> You can only break down barriers when those
on the other side are content that that should happen. For my entire
political life, I have been travelling throughout the WHOLE of
Ireland to universities, rotary clubs, chambers of commerce,
basically wherever I'm asked to speak to people from the other
tradition. Often I've wondered whether I am merely entertainment or
being tolerated as a token Unionist or if there is a genuine desire
to try to understand the Unionist point of view. The last few weeks
have left me with grave doubts. I'm quite disheartened but like my
colleagues, I will continue to communicate with those from the
nationalist tradition in the hope that this will ultimately bear
fruit. Already, in the 1992 talks process, Ulster Unionists put
proposals on the table which would involve Nationalists
(constitutional) at every level within a Northern Ireland
administration. We went to Dublin to negotiate with the Irish
government, we proposed a Bill of Rights, but each of these efforts
was ignored by John Hume's SDLP and the Irish government, which
responded by seeking to do a deal with our own government behind the
backs of Unionists.</P>

<P>To summarise, these people have shown that they will talk AT us
and ABOUT us but are unwilling to talk MEANINGFULLY TO us.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Dual asks - Does Mr Maginnis agree that the
more recent extreme activity has been caused by the exclusion of Sinn
Fein? Have these people lost their constitutional right by voting for
Sinn Fein?</P>

<P><B>Ken Maginnis:</B> That question is the same as suggesting that
the victim of a serious crime is more responsible than the person who
actually committed the offence. Sinn Fein have been told that they
can enter the democratic process, when they are prepared to accept
the responsibilities that go with this. It's not a question of anyone
excluding Sinn Fein but one where they against the wishes of both
governments and all constitutional political parties insist on
excluding themselves. They have only to indicate their willingness to
abide by the same peaceful means as other political parties within
the process, and they can be admitted but obviously, one of the first
things that will then be required is a practical demonstration of
their long-term sincerity. They need to disarm. What would any
constitutional party want with over 100 tonnes of modern
sophisticated weapons and bombs?</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> Our last question. TineBeag in Dublin asks - Do
you think that a solution satisfactory to all could involve Northern
Ireland staying within the UK but with greater links (including
executive and not just advisory powers) to the Republic of Ireland,
one step short of power-sharing but a constitutional arrangement that
perhaps hasn't been tried anywhere else in the world yet?</P>

<P><B>Ken Maginnis:</B> I think that this is almost what Ulster
Unionists want and have been suggesting with the exception of
executive powers for the Republic. It would simply not be practical
to have another government which has no electoral mandate in Northern
Ireland and no accountability involved in the day-to-day affairs of
this part of the United Kingdom. However there could be something
which was more than advisory which would involve meaningful, ongoing
dialogue on a whole range of issues. All this has been proposed as
far back as 1992 by the Ulster Unionist Party but rejected as
inadequate by Nationalists. There is no practical evidence that the
Nationalists are willing to try to create a series of Confidence
Building Measures which Ulster Unionists have ALWAYS believed are
necessary. After centuries of distrust, the cycle of fear and
suspicion can only be broken in this way.</P>

<P>
<B>1. REDEPLOYMENT OF  COMMISSION'S OVERSEAS STAFF</B>
<P>
 In accordance with the shift of interest in the European Union's
external relations the European  Commission is to complete its
redeployment exercise of delegation staff from various African
Caribbean Pacific (ACP)  countries to Asia, the Mediterranean
and Eastern Europe by the end of the year. This is intended to
reinforce offices in areas it now considers to be of increasing
importance to the Union. 
<P>
 Despite the efforts of Development Commissioner Joao de Deus
Pinhero to resist the downsizing of ACP delegations, 23 'A'Grade
posts in the ACP countries the are being redeployed to countries
such as New Independent states in Eastern Europe, Algeria and
Jordan from the Mediterranean and Bangladesh, India and Thailand.
Five of these posts however will  be used to strengthen the Commission's
activities in Southern Africa. 
<P>
 This exercise is a reflection of  the Union's current review
of its traditional ties with ACP countries and it's increasing
focus on Eastern Europe Asia and the Mediterranean. According
to senior Commission officials the redeployment is also a part
of a fundamental review of the breakdown between its permanent
and local staff in its 126 offices around the world. The Commission
is facing growing pressure from the European Parliament to reduce
its running costs and it believes that increasing the number of
local staff it hires would not only reduce its external relations
budget but also free full-time EU staff from more mundane tasks.
The Commission will however have to take account of the negotiations
taking place at the Intergovernmental Conference.  
<P>
<B>2. MEPS CRITICISE COUNCIL AND COMMISSION'S DECISIONS ON DEVELOPMENT
BUDGET</B>
<P>
 Members of the European Parliament Committee on Development and
Cooperation have criticised the European Council and European
Commission's decision to cut the co-operation budget for the Third
World by 10% in Strasbourg.  According to the members of the Committee
cuts will reduce humanitarian aid by 2.49% and other cooperation
measures by 13.35%. 
<P>
 Furthermore the Development Committee stated that the least developed
countries were being unduly penalised at the expense of other
more developed countries. The European Union is set to increase
its spending on the MEDA programme (Euro Mediterranean partnership)
from 400 to 800 million ECUs in its 1997 budget. The Development
Committee called for this money to be reallocated to the poorer
areas of the world in Africa and for MEPS to oppose heavy cuts
in the co-operation budget.
<P>
 The Development and Cooperation Committee's demand come as EU
governments aim to cut the Union's external budget by 15%.
<P>
<B>3. EUROPEAN UNION WELCOMES OUTCOME OF CONGRESS AGAINST SEXUAL
EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN</B>
<P>
 The European Union stated its approval of the Declaration agreed
to at the World Congress of Against the Commercial Exploitation
of Children held in Stockholm from 27 to 31 August. The Declaration
emphasised the need  for partnerships between governments and
international organisations to be forged in order to prevent the
sexual exploitation of children. 
<P>
 The Union, on its part, stated its intentions to press ahead
with its efforts to put an end to what it called 'modern day slavery'
and have the traffic of human beings be declared a criminal offence
internationally.
<P>
<B>4. EU OFFICIALS REMAIN CAUTIOUS ON SITUATION IN THE GREAT LAKES
REGION</B>
<P>
 Mr.Ajello, the European Union's special envoy to Great Lakes
region in Africa expressed  his continuing anxiety over the political
situation in Bujumbura in talks with Mr Joao Pinhero on for development
on Monday, 16 September. Mr Ajello made his conclusions after
talks with political leaders and international observers including
the President of the Hutu guerrilla movement, CNCD, and the US
state department.  He stated that in spite of the changes by the
Buyoya regime towards democratic normalization the political situation
in Burundi is still a cause for concern.
<P>
 This comes after the Commission delegation was called from Bujumbura
for consultation and Mr.Pinhero's call for the suspension of aid
to Bujumbura following the 25 July coup d'etat. Although the EU
has not at yet forrmally suspended aid to Bujumbura, with the
exception of humanitarian assistance, EU aid is not reaching Burundi
because of the embargo by countries in the region. The situation
in the region will be reviewed at the forthcoming General Affairs
Council on 1 and 2 October.
<P>
<B>5. EU TO CLARIFY POSITION FOR FIRST WTO MEETINGS AT INFORMAL
SESSION IN DUBLIN</B>
<P>
 EU Trade Ministers are meeting with Irish minister Enda Kennedy
in preparation for the forthcoming  World Trade Organisation (WTO)
scheduled on the 9 and 13 December in Singapore. The ministers
aim to come up with common positions and guidelines on the following
issues to be on the Singapore agenda. 
<P>
<ul>
<li>the problem of ensuring third countries respect of Uruguay Round
Undertakings for opening markets to Community exports.
<P>
<li>the problem of the maintenance of the momentum of the liberalisation
of world trade in sectors excluded from the Uruguay round.
<P>
<li>whether EU wants new multilateral negotiations on the liberalisation
of  World trade
<P>
<li>if new international rules are needed in the area of competition
and investment
<P>
<li>whether greater importance should be attached to the environmental
and social aspects of international trade.</ul>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. EU HUMANITARIAN AID FOR REFUGEES IN FORMER
YUGOSLAVIA<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The European Commission's Humanitarian Office, ECHO,
has approved a humanitarian aid package worth 85 million ECU for
refugees, displaced persons and vulnerable groups in the former
Yugoslavia (Bosnia, Croatia, Federal Yuigoslav Republic). The
programme which is primarily made up of food, hygiene supplies,
shelter and psycho-social assistance for the most vulnerable people
is to be implemented by NGOs, UN specialised agencies as well
as the Commission. The Commission will also assist in the reconstruction
of housing and basic social infrastructures in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
This is in order to encourage refugees and displaced persons to
return to original homes.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>According to the Commission almost one million people
are still displaced within Bosnia-Herzegovina while a million
others are refugees outside the country. The figure in Croatia
is 350 000. The ECHO programme in collaboration with the United
Nations Transitional Authority for Eastern Slovenia will focus
on the needs of the peoples of Eastern Slovenia. Within the Federal
Yugoslavia aid will go to the estimated 500 000 Croatian and Bosnian
refugees. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. COMMISSION ADOPTS GREEN PAPER ON FUTURE OF
ACP/EU RELATIONS<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The European Commission last week adopted its &quot;Green
Paper&quot; on the reassessment of EC/ACP relations. The Commission
deems it necessary to encourage wide debate on the relationship,
as the Lom&eacute; 1V Convention - the main framework of co-operation
between the two groups, nears its end in the year 2000.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Paper raises the following pertinent issues -
a) whether the present vast diverse ACP grouping of states should
be maintained, giving that the grouping is neither an economic,
political or geographical entity; b) improving competitiveness
and reinforcement of the private sector; c) the role and workings
of the State; d) how the current system of trade preferences to
improve the ACP States ability to profit from the system. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The underlying points running throughout the Paper
are i. the need for greater efficacy or in other words a results
based approach to co-operation; ii. a greater role for the civil
society and the creation of 'investment friendly' environment;
iii. the differentiation of response to the different needs of
the ACP States receiving aid. This implies more flexible aid instruments
and 'positive discrimination' for the least developed countries.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Debate on the Green Paper will go on for a year and
a half resulting in a Commission negotiation brief for the talks
with the ACP States which begin in 1998. EC Commissioner for Development,
Joao de Deus Pinheiro, said, &quot;We must have the courage to
examine everything, except our political commitment and our solidarity
towards the ACP countries&quot;. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>3. MOVEMENTS IN COMMISSION DEPARTMENTS<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In line with its reorganisation and rationalisation
of management, the European Commission has reshuffled a number
of its senior officials and made a few new appointments in top
positions. Steffen Smidt the former Director General of Development
becomes Director General of Personnel replacing the retiring Frans
de Koster and Director General for Information and Culture, Collette
Flesh, becomes Director General of the Translation Service. Michel
vanden Abeele the former head of Commissioner Karel van Miert's
cabinet replaces Heinrich von Moltke as Director General for Business
and Tourism Policy who resigned after a series of fraud allegations
in his department.<B> </B>The former Spanish representation to
the EU, Luis Romero Requena and Anthony Wright, formerly responsible
for financial issues in the Agricultural Directorate General are
new appointees to the Directorate General for Budgets.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>4. SWISS PARLIAMENTARIANS APPEAL TO WTO OVER MARGINALISED
COUNTRIES <BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A delegation of Swiss Members of Parliament met with
Renato Ruggiero, Director General of the World Trade Organisation,
WTO, on Monday 2 December, to present an open letter expressing
their wish that the WTO makes the marginalisation of poor countries
the top priority at the forthcoming WTO Ministerial Conference
from 9-13 December. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The letter calls for the halving of all trade barriers
facing the least developed countries by the year 2000. The MPs
also say that the participation of NGOs is important in providing
broad support for the WTO and call for further steps to be taken
to allow NGOs to participate more fully in the WTO's work. The
Parliamentarians' letter, in addition, calls for the creation
of a WTO parliament composed of individual members from the parliaments
of WTO member countries.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Finally the MP's emphasise the need for evidence
that WTO trade regulations are of benefit to all and have no adverse
effects on poorer countries and the environment. They argue that
if the rich countries are the prime beneficiaries of WTO trade
regulations resulting in an increase in global disparities in
wealth, the legitimacy of the work of the WTO will be undermined.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>5. SUPPLIERS OF BANANAS TO EU SET OUT A COMMON
POSITION BUT GUATEMALA DISAGREES<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A meeting of traditional suppliers of banana to the
EU held in the Canary Islands from the 18-22 November focused
on the Community system governing the import of bananas. Following
the explanation of their positions in the WTO, producers from
Europe, the ACP and Latin America adopted a joint declaration
stressing that &quot;an orderly and regulated market such as the
one in the EU, ensures higher prices&quot;. Guatemalan producers
however disagreed with the statement. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Another declaration was also signed by Latin American
producers' associations from Costa Rica, Columbia, Nicaragua,
Venezuela and Ecuador concerning the Latin American Banana Producers'
Association.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>5. THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT TO ADOPT 1997 EU BUDGET
AND DEBATE COMMISSION'S WORK PLAN<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>At its second reading the European Parliament is
to adopt the EU budget for 1997. It will, in addition, continue
the debate on the Commission's work programme. The Parliament
will also present is Sakharov Award for freedom of thinking to

Its aim was, and still is, to protect the basic human right to free expression. Over the past years <i>Index </i>has reported on censorship issues from all around the world and has added to the essential debates on those issues. Each issue of <i>Index </i>contains a list of attacks on free expression Ñ compiled country by country. These lists remain as extensive today as they were in the early days of <i>Index. </i>They are a trenchant and harrowing reminder that continued vigilance is essential.<p>The list of writers who have contributed to <i>Index </i>is an impressive testimony to its continued importance. They include Vaclav Havel, Nadine Gordimer, Salman Rushdie, Doris Lessing, Arthur Miller, A S Byatt, Aung San Suu Kyi, Noam Chomsky, Julian Barnes, Dubravka Ugresic, Ronald Dworkin, Umberto Eco, Jack Mapanje and Naguib Mahfouz. <i>Index</i> is also a forum for new writers of whom the world will hear more.<p>But perhaps the most telling testimony is that which we receive from readers in those countries where censorship is a life and death issue. <i>Index </i>operates an assisted subscriptions programme which allows readers in South America, Africa, Asia, and the former Communist countries to receive the magazine free of charge. The letters which we receive from readers in these countries are a telling demonstration of the magazine's importance.<p><img border=1 align=left hspace=20  vspace=5 src="index_pix/infopic.jpg"><font size=2>Picture: &copy; Panos Pictures</font><p>&quot;[<i>Index]</i> is greatly respected in our country.<br>&quot;<i>Human Rights Organisation, Colombia</i><p>&quot;I would like to thank you for this great offer which I'm unable to keep to myself but keep on offering to others who don't receive to also enjoy and see what goes on in other parts of the world. This has created more effort in self-expression.&quot;<br><i>Teacher/sculptor, Kenya</i><p>&quot;<i>Index</i> has taught me a lot of things. 1. Respect peace. 2. Not to forget history. 3. Respect human rights. 4. To learn for future development.&quot;<br><i>Civil servant, Uganda</i><p><i>Index </i>is supported by its associated charity Writers and Scholars Educational Trust. It is funded by subscriptions and donations from individuals and foundations. A year's subscription to <i>Index </i>costs just £36 (£42 overseas, $50 USA).

<p align=justify><b>1.	MASSIVE CUTS TO THE EU DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION BUDGET</b></p>
<p align=justify>The European Union is in the middle of the 1997 EU Budget procedure. The Council has proposed massive cuts of 289 MECU to development cooperation expenditure (53% of the overall cut in external relations and a 13% decrease compared to the 1996 Budget). The cuts are particularly evident when one looks at individual development cooperation budget lines - budget lines focused on cooperation measures decrease by 27%; the NGO co-financing line decreases 13.8%; rehabilitation in development countries decreases 23.4%; and other lines such as women and development and landmines are deleted. The amounts cut from these budget lines have been transferred to the EU's MEDA programme (Measures to accompany the reforms to the economic and social structures in the Mediterranean non-member countries) - the Council proposes 842 MECU (a 109% increase) to be allocated to this line.</p>
<p align=justify>The draft budget cuts a total of 546.8 MECU from various existing external relations' budget lines. The agreed ceiling on external expenditure allows at most 312.3 MECU of this reduction to be re-instated. In addition to the re-instating of nearly 300 MECU that amendments tabled at the EP Development Committee will propose, it is expected that amendments by the EP's other two external committees will seek the re-instatement of other budget lines.</p>
<p align=justify>The Development Committee will table amendments to reinstate 1996 budget amounts for development cooperation. To do this they will most likely propose 234.5 MECU be taken from the proposed MEDA line increase and redistributed to developing countries. The MEDA line would then still be increased to 607.5 MECU (51% increase over 1996).</p>
<p align=justify><b>2.	THE GREEN PAPER AND THE LOME CONVENTION</b></p>
<p align=justify>The battle to revamp the lom&eacute; Convention, the trade and aid agreement linking the European Union to 70 ACP states, starts in autumn. European Commissioner Jo&atilde;o de Deus Pinheiro will trigger the long-awaited public debate on the future of the Convention by publishing a Green Paper in October. Comments will then be sought from EU and ACP governments, the European Parliament, NGOs, academics and business leaders.</p>
<p align=justify>Under the convention's rules, negotiations on its future must open at least 18 months before the pacts runs out. To keep this calendar, the Commission will ask ACP and EU representatives to give their views on the future of the convention in the first half of 1997. Pinheiro will then drawn up a formal negotiating mandate for ministerial approval at the end of 1997. Negotiations will open officially with the ACP group in September 1998.</p>
<p align=justify>The Commission says it is going into the difficult debate with a completely open mind. But it will not be easy.</p>
<p align=justify>"Poor nations are loosing their economic significance to us", says Dieter Frisch, a former Commissioner director-general for development. "There is a growing feeling that development policy has not achieved a great deal, especially in the very area where most aid has been directed: Africa. This provides enough pretext to cut development aid at a time of budgetary constraints". Frisch argues that the spirit of North-South partnership and dialogue engendered by the Lom&eacute; Convention are worth preserving.</p>
<p align=justify>The ACP states have not worked out a joint position on the future of Lom&eacute;. But while critical of some aspects of the convention, most ACP representatives insist that the pact should be preserved.</p>
<p align=justify>"The Lom&eacute; Convention has made a significant contribution to alleviating poverty and providing jobs", says Lingston Cumberbatch, current 'president' of the ACP group of ambassadors in Brussels. "What we want to see is a good and effective convention which encourages investments in the ACP states and supports the private sector".</p>
<p align=justify>ACP representatives also say they want a new Lom&eacute; Convention which is "user-friendly and non-bureaucratic". The ACP business leaders argue that the convention is much too complex and technically complicated".</p>
<p align=justify>The Commission's Green paper will look closely at the issue of "differentiation": i.e. suggestions that instead of working with an unwieldy group of  70 ACP nations, the EU should hammer out separate agreements with ACP regions or even sub-regions.</p>
<p align=justify><b>3.	EU-ASEAN RELATIONSHIP</b></p>
<p align=justify>When ten Asian presidents and prime ministers met 15 EU leaders for a summit in Bangkok six months ago, a lot of promises were made by the Europeans while Asian talked about finally finding a seat on the international scene.</p>
<p align=justify>Now they are getting down to business and discovering that things are not that easy. The two sides disagree on many principles and most details. Quarrels over human rights are straining political closeness and spats over labour standards are hindering trade talks. Disappointment with each other and broken ranks on either side are now becoming increasingly evident.</p>
<p align=justify>But trade is, and will continue to be, the crux of the relationship which is bringing Europe closer to China, Japan, South Korea and the nations of Southeast Asia. The two sides also have a political forum in which to discuss security matters -the Asian Regional Forum (ARF)- which is growing in importance almost daily.</p>
<p align=justify>With some 425 million people and high economic growth (its members' combined average annual growth rate is 7.25% - three times that of the Union), the ASEAN bloc also controls some of the world's most crucial shipping routes.</p>
<p align=justify>"Effective recognition of ASEAN's leading role should push the European Union to make it a focal point of its political presence in Asia", said External Relations Commissioner Manuel Marin. Calling for yearly meetings of political experts in fields such as maritime safety, nuclear capacity, drug trafficking and peacekeeping, the Commissioner continues: "Despite many contacts and important programmes, we are witnessing a regrettably static application of our agreement".</p>
<p align=justify>The ARF already provides a forum for discussion on subjects such as nuclear weapons and landmines with all the major players on the Asian continent. It groups foreign ministers of the EU, China, Japan, Russia, the US, India and ASEAN, and Pakistan has applied to join.</p>
<p align=justify>Two events rattled participants at the ARF's July ministerial meeting in Jakarta. But they also demonstrated how important its members perceive the forum to be.</p>
<p align=justify>Arguing that their status as nuclear powers gave them reason to be there in a capacity distinct from that of the EU, the UK and France applied to join, angering their Union partners.</p>
<p align=justify>Subsequently, when Myanmar (Burma) was admitted to the forum, EU governments protested over Rangoon's political and human rights record. Having returned home from the Bangkok summit with the understanding that Europeans would not preach to Asians, the latter were upset by what they saw as Union backtracking.</p>
<p align=justify>Burma is just as divisive an issue within the EU itself. As both France and the UK have economic interests in Burma, they would probably reject the sanctions that other EU partners have already hinted at, and the Union looks set to continue wrestling with Burmese rights problems as it has for years with Indonesia over East Timor.</font></p>

A bit ahead of myself. Time to kill. Check the door. No 70. Look out for tell-tale signs. A small totemic figure hanging from the doorbell. Seems promising. Feeling nervous. <br>She leads me into her consulting room, apologizing for the smell.'My last client was a chain-smoker.' I'm overwhelmed not by the smell of smoke but of incense. 'I don't go up as far as 2025,' she had told me on the phone. Never mind. It's the process of looking into the future - or futurism - that I'm interested in. My motives are initially journalistic. <p><font size=-1>Picture: Today's actions, tomorrows world.  Looking ahead helps to see the damage we are doing now.</font><p>Anna Sandham, Tarot reader and astrologer, lays out four cards, each dealing with a general area: Spirit, Law, Earthly Matters, Romance. I choose the card relating to the area I wish to explore. I surprise myself by choosing'Spirit'. She lays the rest of the cards face-down in an arc before me and tells me to pick 13.When I have picked them andhanded them to her she takes the first card, lays it down and interprets it.<p>I know it is easy to find connections if you are looking for them  - but one after another the interpretations are uncannily resonant for me. After a while I realize that although I've come to have my future told only some of the cards actually relate to the future. Some relate to the past but most relate to very personal things that are submerged in the present. This, she explains, is because we are working largely in the realm of the unconscious. It is this that will affect the future. Afterwards I realize that a simple future projection would have been quite meaningless; that the'future' cards make sense only in the context of the'past' and the'present' cards. To separate past, present and future doesn't feel relevant or meaningful. <p>Later I read something by W Warren Wagar, the New York State University historian and futurist. He puts it in a different way:'Standing in the middle of a river looking upstream one sees the past. Standing in the middle of the river gazing downstream one sees the future. But it is always the same river.'<font size=-1><b>1</b></font><p><h3>Crossing boundaries </h3>Twentieth-century physics is also telling us that rigid past, present and future divisions are not as real or useful as our timepieces suggest.  Before Albert Einstein developed the theory of relativity in 1915 space and time were thought to be fixed. Einstein's theory got rid of this idea and showed that space and time were dynamic.<font size=-1><b>2</b></font><p>Although this radical insight shook up the Western scientific world, it would not have been so strange to many people less thoroughly conditioned by modern scientific rationalism. Within traditional cultures there is a regular crossing of time boundaries. A peasant woman in the Peruvian Andes will talk freely and easily about hearing <i>los ancianos </i>- the spirits of the past who inhabit the mountains - advising her on what to do in the future. Spirits are notoriously disrespectful of time-boundaries - and if spirits are part of your daily conceptual framework you probably have less regard for those boundaries too.Within these traditions there is nothing weird or wacky about trying to see into the future: it is simply another way of reaching the gods. Whether reading the entrails of a sacrificial animals in Ethiopia or visiting a voodoo priest in Haiti, the attempt to divine the future is usually for moral and spiritual guidance. <p>In more secular societies ruminating on the future has usually been driven by intellectual curiosity and playfulness. It has been especially fertile ground for writers, whose works have ranged from fictional ideal worlds - or utopias - to popular Sci-Fi. The former enabled thinkers like Thomas More or William Morris to criticize obliquely their own societies while suggesting alternatives. Such imaginative, fictional approaches to the future have proved to be about as reliable - or unreliable - as more plodding 'probable' scenarios. In fact, that's one reason we chose to ask eight fiction writers to help us look at the world in the year 2025 in this issue of the NI.<p>But in recent years looking into the future has become more serious - 'factual', philosophical and commercial. Eager to gain academic recognition, those who study the future now argue that their subject has its place alongside others like history or geology. In their own defence futurists claim to study alternative futures just as historians study alternative pasts.<p><img width=300 height=268 src="ni_pix/269_tarot.gif"><h3>Beware, beware </h3> It sounds fair enough, but prophecy - like history - is powerful stuff. Facts can be manipulated easily enough in the present to constitute lies. With the future the prophet has an even freer hand. <p>Even George Orwell, creator of that most famous futuristic dystopia or 'reverse utopia' 1984, came to the conclusion that futurism pandered to fear and cravings for power.<font size=-1><b>3</b></font> <p>This rings particularly true in a century that has seen charismatic leaders such as Hitler, Mussolini and Haiti's Papa Doc Duvalier propagating their version of the future. The fascist leader needs to create a convincing vision to mobilize people to do things they might otherwise find morally repugnant. The end has to be convincingly conjured to justify the means - even if it involves genocide. If a particular group of people are the problem, the source of fear and insecurity, they must be removed. Once people have escaped into the easy solution they can be easily dominated by it - as in Rwanda and the former Yugoslav republics today.<p>Historian and futurist, Warren Wagar concedes: 'Virtually all totalitarian regimes of our century have been informed by a past-centred or future-centred ideology that tells their hapless subjects precisely what the past ordains or what the future demands.' <p>This happens, he says, when people take a'too rigid view of time, imagining they know more than they do'. They end up'devaluing present life and happiness in the name of some imagined past or future felicity'.<font size=-1><b>1</b></font>   It is a bit reminiscent of the Queen of Hearts' comment in <i>Through the Looking Glass</i> :'The rule is jam tomorrow, jam yesterday - but never jam today.'<p>Fascism is not the only political force to conjure future visions in a manipulative way. Max Dublin, who has become one of the fiercest critics of futurism since working as a strategic planning consultant to the Canadian Government, states:'Prophecy is a basic tool of ideology, Left or Right, East or West.'<font size=-1><b>4</b></font><p>The USSR preached that communism would lead to a glorious future of a classless, egalitarian society - with plenty of promised jam. The US pointed to a different future of repeated conflict with the'evil empire' in order to stoke up Cold War fever and justify feeding its rapaciousmilitary-industrial complex. A favoured activity of Cold War planners was to work on imagined'wargames' which explored options for'contained' nuclear war.<p><h3>Whose business? </h3>Today the Future is a booming business, especially in North America and Japan. With the millennium around the corner think-tanks, research groups and consultants are peddling their prophecies hard and fast to planners and policy-makers. Many claim their methods are'scientific' and they rely heavily on computer projections. And more and more policy-makers are using their work. <p>Dutch futurists Henk Becker and Joseph van Doorn observe that today:'A policy-maker either uses the results of a futures research project to beat his [sic] opponents or his opponents attack him by using futures research and he needs to have this kind of research available to hit back.'<p>The title of a recent futurist conference in Toronto says it all: <i>Getting to the future first!</i> Newt Gingrich, right-wing Republican Speaker of the US House of Representatives takes such things to heart. He has hand-picked the US's most famous pop-futurist Alvin Toffler as a close adviser. Toffler's ideas are useful to Gingrich - especially the idea that there is going to be a great radical leap into a'Third Wave' and this will involve dismantling a great part of government. Gingrich interprets this to justify his own hostility to state intervention in the economy and to welfare safety nets for the poor.<p>This alliance of politics and prophecy is nothing new. In the first century BC the Roman Senate would not make a move without consulting the book of the Sibyl, a famous collection of prophecies made by an inspired woman. Today, reports churned out by futurists serve the same function. Unfortunately, they are not churned out by inspired women - or inspired men for that matter. Instead they are produced by Western technocrats (mostly white and male) using state-of-the-art computer technology. Despite these sophisticated machines, Michael Marien, US editor of <i>Futures Survey</i>, thinks the quality of futures study has actually declined in the past 20 years. And computer projections, he says, have not helped.'You have to start off with an assumption and if that is wrong then the whole thing will be wrong.'<p>Most commercial futures research assumes that competition and domination will go on being the way the world is ordered. Tacit assumptions are made based on things remaining as they are - only'more so' in whatever direction the trend is stretched. The effect is not to broaden horizons but actually to narrow down options.<p>The fact is that these prophecies say a lot more about who has produced them than about any likely future. You can see how this works by looking at future projections from the last century when there was a firm belief that hot-air balloons were to be the transport technology of the twentieth century. Many of our current obsessions with'virtual reality' may prove to be as inappropriate and risible to future generations.<p><h3>Reclaiming the future </h3>So does that mean that trying to glimpse the future is a waste of time - and a dangerous one at that? <p>If it means passively following the technology fads and self-interested forecasts of big business and its political allies, then yes. But it need not be that. Looking ahead can sometimes help us to think more clearly and imaginatively. It can shed light on the present and help us make the changes now that will affect the future. <p>Teacher Noel Wilson works with teenagers in Australia and the UK and gets them to depict what they think the world will be like in 30 years. After collecting examples from 600 students he was able to see a clear pattern emerging. Over half of the drawings showed computers and robots in block houses, skyscrapers and domes. Most revealed landscapes of bleak devast-ation. Nearly all were negative and dehumanised. Most had no human presence at all.<font size=-1><b>5</b></font><p>What's so worrying about this sense of hopelessness - which other teachers and researchers confirm is the norm - is that it produces passivity and a sense of fatality. The despair itself becomes a self-fulfilling prophecyJoanna Macy addresses this in workshops and in her book <i>Despair and Personal Power in the Nuclear Age. </i>For a start, she teaches that feelings of pain for our world are natural and healthy and only morbid if denied. Information alone, she says, is not enough and unlocking repressed feelings can release energy and clear the mind. Unblocking pain for the world, she concludes, reconnects us with a larger web of life.This is all good therapeutic stuff. In imagining the future we can get in touch with our deepest fears and desires. Then the positive work of imagining alternative scenarios and thinking about how they might be achieved can begin.<p>In another project, when 400 young people from different backgrounds and from different continents focused on how they would like the world to be, two images kept recurring in their utopias. One was'boundarylessness' - a free flow of people, thought and activities unimpeded by occupational or political or national barriers. The other was of a'bright, clean green world with clear blue oceans'.<b>5 </b>If there is one area where changes we make now <i>will</i> affect the future it is in our relationship to the environment. Because environmental damage is happening gradually it's possible to ignore it. But if we ask ourselves what will happen if current trends are not reversed - holes in the ozone layer, global warming, water pollution and the accumulation of toxic and nuclear waste - then things look grim indeed. Unless you believe that technology or'market forces' will get us out of this mess (not a wise bet), then there is no choice but to start taking the environment seriously. Unlike most catastrophes in the making, the eventual collapse of the environment is one we can safely predict - before the suffering actually hits. But can we learn to act now for the future?  <p>David Hicks, Director of the Global Futures Project at Bath College of Higher Education in England, is making a start. He gets his students to imagine what'sustainability' would look like in the North, in the South and globally. And then he challenges them to think about what needs to be done to achieve it.<p>And there are lots of possibilities. We can start the move from fossil fuels and nuclear power to safe renewable sources of energy like solar or wind power. We can introduce an environmental cost in our economic calculations. We can start moving to a philosophy of sustainability as opposed to lemming-like economic growth at whatever cost to the environment. We can adopt an approach of responsibility and stewardship towards our planet rather than exploitation. <p>This may seem like pie-in-the-sky. After all, since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 most governments have shown that their actual - though unprofessed - commitment is to keeping things as they are.<br>And the futures research that politicians and corporations choose to use is unlikely to tell them to stop what they are doing and think about the earth. A report called <i>The Highly Probable Future: 83 assumptions about the year 2025</i>, sponsored by 18 American and European multinationals, is typically woolly on the subject of the environment. The report concludes:'Global environmental management issues will be institutionalized in multinational corpor-ations as well as through the United Nations and other supranational entities.' It goes on to assert:'The multinational corporation will be the world's dominant business form.'<font size=-1><b>6</b></font><p>This is not the future that many of the world's peoples want or are prepared to have decided for them. Resistance is growing everywhere. Environmental activists from Bangladesh to Brazil, from Kenya to Canada are challenging governments and corporations and gaining increasing popular support. When the Nigerian Government recently turned its guns against its own Ogoni people to make way for petroleum drilling by the Anglo-Dutch multinational Shell Oil, international protest was quickly mobilized by activists using global e-mail and other networks. And the scale of recent anti-road-building protests in Britain has taken everyone by surprise. More and more people around the globe are recognizing that we cannot 'tinker' - or build - our way out of the problems we have created for ourselves and future generations  Our relationship with the planet will need to change radically. <p>It's now just five years to the turn of the century and a new millennium, traditionally a time of great upheaval. Astrologers are gearing up for it. The planets will be lined up in Taurus (a powerful Earth sign) in the year 2000. According to Anna, my Tarot-reader, it could mean two things: either we will embark on a new way of relating to the earth; or we will obstinately cling to our old ways. Which is it to be? <p>The kind of world we will have in a few decades depends on our capacity to start making big changes now. In this sense, the future is present.<p><hr width=80%><p>	<font size=-1><b>1 </b>W Warren Wagar'The Future Without End' in Visions for the 21st Century, ed.

<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. HUMANITARIAN ACTION IN GREAT LAKES REGION IS
NOT ENOUGH SAY PARTICIPANTS OF EU MINISTERS OF DEVELOPMENT CO-OPERATION
MEETING <BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A special meeting of the European Union's Ministers
for Development Co-operation was held on Thursday 7 October to
discuss the ongoing crisis in the Great Lakes region. Irish Minister
Joan Burton who opened the session asked the participants to consider
the following key issues - access to the vulnerable populations
following an agreement between the Rwandan, Zairian and rebel
forces; effective delivery of humanitarian assistance to the refugees,
promotion of a safe and dignified return of the Rwandan refugees
in Zaire; ensuring the short-term aid does not create an unsustainable
camp situation and not contradict the political goals of attaining
greater regional stability.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>At a press conference later in the day Mrs Burton
stated that the Meeting had confirmed the absolute urgency of
the setting up of corridors to allow the safe return of Rwandan
refugees in Zaire as all participants were concerned about the
serious risk of an epidemic that the refugees currently faced.
EC Commissioner for Development, Joao de Deus Pinheiro stated
that the means and resources were available but the major problem
remaining was how to get the means and resources through to the
victims. Mr. Akashi, Deputy Secretary General for the UN's Humanitarian
Aid Department described the situation in the region as &quot;a
humanitarian calamity without comparison&quot;. He added that
the political questions such as who would get the aid through,
who would protect the corridors and where the corridors would
be situated will have to be addressed as pledge of humanitarian
assistance was just not enough. Mr Akashi hinted that a neutral
multinational force could contribute towards a more comprehensive
approach.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The participants provided further details answering
questions on the state of affairs in the region. On sending a
neutral force Mrs Bonino, EC Commissioner for Humanitarian assistance
said that clear conclusions had been reached at the Regional summit
in Nairobi and the case had now been referred to the UN Security
Council. She said that it was now up to the Security Council to
set up the mechanisms defined in Nairobi. Mrs Ogata, the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees, confirmed that the Rwandan authorities
had agreed to open up safe corridors through Rwanda and the remaining
concern was for the Zairian section.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The EU Ministers later adopted a resolution calling
for the UN Security Council to react immediately to the Nairobi
proposal in setting up safe corridors and a neutral international
force. According  to Mrs Burton the question of the composition
of the neutral force was not discussed at great length at the
Meeting as this was an issue for the Security Council to discuss.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The European Commission earlier on Wednesday said
it will release a further 25 million ECU for humanitarian aid
in the region. The Commission, which has been following events
in the region through the &quot;Crisis Cell&quot; set up by the
European Commission Humanitarian Office, ECHO, has already released
540 million ECU for humanitarian aid in the region since November
1993.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The EC also stated that it will insist on the setting
up of &quot;humanitarian points of reference&quot; such as the
known position of refugees; the precise identification of available
stocks; the transport routes for distribution of stocks and rapid
contacts with Member States which are willing to provide material
and transport for humanitarian action. <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT PRESIDENT CALLS FOR REFORMS
OF EU'S CFSP AND EXTERNAL RELATIONS<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>After the seventh meeting of the Intergovernmental
conference totally dedicated to issues surrounding the Common
Foreign and Security Policy last week, Klaus Haensch the European
Parliament, EP, president, said at a press conference, that the
CFSP has to be &quot;identified by a person who has a sufficiently
long mandate. .. someone within the Commission.&quot; According
to Mr Haensch this idea had little support and another alternative
was for an eminent politician to front CFSP but this idea had
also been received coolly. Mr Haensch also stated that if the
EU does not have military instruments it would not be able to
have a long term credible CFSP. On the EU'S external economic
relations, Mr Haensch said that the Parliament would like to put
an end to disjointed EU foreign policy and that article 113 had
to be widened to include services direct investment and intellectual
property. Mr Haensch however, conceded that realisation of these
proposals will be a long term process requiring a step by step
approach.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>3. EU SENDS INQUIRY MISSION TO BURMA AS IT TIGHTENS
SCREWS SLORC REGIME<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Manuel Marin, Vice President of the European Commission
announced on Wednesday 6 November that the Commission will be
sending an inquiry mission to Burma in the near future to check
up on the Burmese regime (SLORC)'s action on the practices on
forced labour in the country. This inquiry could lead to the suspension
the benefits of the generalised system of preferences for Burma.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Last week the EU Council decided to impose new sanctions
on Burma, namely the ban on entry visas to the EU for senior SLORC
and military officials and their families and suspension of high
level bilateral government visits. These measures were taken because
of the Burmese government's refusal to respond to EU and UN concerns
over human rights violations in the country. Earlier this week
the Burmese foreign minister announced that Burma is planning
retaliatory sanctions against the EU. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>4. EUROPEAN VESSELS ACCESS TO FISH IN SENEGALESE
WATERS SUSPENDED AS EU/ SENEGAL NEGOTIATIONS OVER A NEW AGREEMENT
THE BREAKDOWN<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The fishing activities of European vessels in Senegalese
water have been suspended following the breakdown in negotiations
between the EU and Senegal on a new fisheries protocol in Dakar
last week. This fallout especially concerns financial compensation
paid by the EU as a counterpart for fishing rights in Senegalese
waters. Senegal is demanding 18 million ECU a year as a financial
counterpart while the EU has proposed only 10 or 12 million ECU.
Senegal has also asked for the EU fishing quota to be reduced
to 10 000 gross barrels from 13 500 in a previous fisheries protocol
signed in 1994.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>No date has been set for the resumption of negotiations
and most European vessels will now seek to redeploy in waters
of neighbouring countries with whom the EU has signed agreements.

THE COMMISSION TO PARTICIPATE IN MINISTERIAL CONFERENCE IN SINGAPORE
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The European Commission will make funds available
to the least developed countries in order to enable them to participate
in the first Ministerial Conference in Singapore. The Commission
will provide 50 000 ECU which will cover at least 20 % of total
costs necessary for the participation of the Ministers and a second
officer from the least developed countries. The Commission hopes
that this financial support will help the least developed countries
to take an active role in the Singapore Ministerial Conference.
The Conference will be held from 9 to 13 December. <BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT CALLS FOR MULTINATIONAL
FORCE</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Members of the European Parliament on Wednesday 13
November approved of a resolution calling for the creation of
humanitarian corridors and the immediate set up of a multinational
force to ensure the safe passage of aid. The MEPS want an embargo
of arms exports to the region and a general disarmament of the
civilian population in the region.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Mr. Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Hory of the Radical party
stated that the mandate of the multinational force should not
allow it to strengthen the Zairian regime and protect its corrupt
army who are prone to pillaging and looting. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>EC Commissioner for Humanitarian Relief Emma Bonino
commended Europe on speaking with a single voice on the issue
stating, &quot;those preventing the sending of a force are on
the other side of the Atlantic.&quot; But she noted that without
a military force ,total unanimity could not save lives. According
to Mrs Bonino the multinational force should be given the mandate
to deliver basic goods protect the refugees and humanitarian material
and personnel, and facilitate the voluntary return of refugees.
On the urgency of the situation Mrs Bonino stated that &quot;If
a decision is not taken immediately, the force that will end up
on location will have nothing else to do bury the dead. .... And
what anger, frustration and shame we shall have to bear.&quot;
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The European Parliamentarians paid tribute to Mrs
Bonino's efforts to resolve the crisis while acknowledging that
the international community would have to bear some responsibility
for the crisis. Mrs Francisca Sauquilo a Spanish socialist wondered
why the EU was not using its capacity to act but rather trailing
the United States and Canada.<BR>

20th annual meeting organised by the Economic and Social Committee.
The representatives recognised the need to adapt cooperation to
globalisation of the economy and to foster conditions for a new
sustainable convention that will ensure economic growth, prevent
crisis and upgrade the wellbeing of the populations. </FONT>

of equality and the partnership of the lom&eacute; Convention;
b) promote good administration , human rights democracy and the
state of law; c) take in account the Maastricht Treaty on European
development policies, as well as the Uruguay round d) adopt a
more flexible approach to development cooperation reflecting the
different social and economic development of the ACP states.

the anti-discrimination clause. The Starting Line representatives
recalled their own proposal backed by almost 300 Union organizations
as well as the Consultative Commission on Racism and Xenophobia,
Kahn Commission. The proposals will allow the EU to adopt legal

<center><font size=7>the case for AID</font></center>
<h4 align=center>A MANIFESTO</h4>


Against a background of unprecedented decline in aid budgets around the world, this manifesto renews the vision of overseas aid in the 1990s.<p>

At a time of growing inequality both within and between countries, it argues that the moral case for aid is stronger than ever before. But it also illustrates why the provision of aid to the poorest is ultimately in all our interests.<p>


<br>

The message of this manifesto is that:<ul>
<li><b><a href="works.html">Aid works</a></b> - At the right levels, and properly targeted, aid can work. It can help people who are not reached by other capital flows.<p>

<li><b><a href="spend.html">Spend now, save later</a></b> - Aid can promote long-term development and growth: by spending now, we can save lives and resources, and protect the environment.<p>

<li><b><a href="handup.html">Aid is a hand-up, not a hand-out</a></b> - It is a sound investment which helps people to help themselves.<p>

<li><b><a href="interests.html">Aid is in all our interests</a></b> - It can help to prevent conflict and tackle the problems of drug trafficking, environmental degradation, migration and epidemics that are linked to poverty.<p>

<center><h3><a href="../../vso/aidcounts.html">VSO launches Aid Counts campaign</a></h3></center>

<h2 align=center>AID WORKS</h2>

<blockquote><i>"Properly applied in propitious environments, aid works." </i></blockquote>
<ul>
Development Assistance Committee of the OECD: <br>Shaping the 21st Century: the Contribution of Development Co-operation.</ul><p>


As we approach the next century, we should remember that the campaign to end world poverty was one of this century's greatest initiatives. <p>

<li>   Mortality rates of young children living in the Third World are almost half what they were
50 years ago. <font size=2>16</font><p>

<li>   The number of people with direct access to safe water has doubled in 50 years (from 35 to 70 per cent). <font size=2>17</font><p>

SPEND NOW, SAVE LATER</h2>

Aid takes a long-term view of development and growth, based on the belief that by spending now, we save later. <p>

Aid saves lives by providing vaccines for immunisation, or investing in sustainable social-service provision such as health and sanitation systems. It can also reduce expenditure in the future. Failures to invest in development can contribute to social and environmental crises, conflict, and breakdown in state and community structures, which all carry high costs for rich and poor countries. 
<p>

<h4>Spend now, save lives</h4>

Aid has contributed to the fall in child mortality across developing countries. Even so, almost 20 per cent of children living in sub-Saharan Africa die before they are five. Most die from preventable diseases. At a cost to each British tax-payer of no more than a few pence, those children could be saved. <p>


<h4>Spend now, save money</h4>

Complex humanitarian emergencies have broken out in dramatic form in the last decade. Managing them has been highly expensive for Western governments and their taxpayers.<p>


<h4>The cost of conflict</h4>

<blockquote><i>"The message from the conflict born of this poverty is that international security is best built on International Solidarity, in which the wealthiest nations help the poorest out of the poverty that breeds conflict. It is in our own interests to do so, because our troops will be called upon to serve to prevent the conflicts."</i></blockquote> <p>

<ul>Speech by the Shadow Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook MP, Hansard 17 November 1994.</ul><p>


Since the end of the Cold War there have been more regional conflicts and civil wars than at any time this century. Of the 82 major armed conflicts that occurred between 1989 and 1992, all but three were within rather than between states.25<p>

The cost of fire-fighting such social disasters is high. More money must be spent, sometimes for generations, as communities rebuild themselves. 
Emergency aid has risen dramatically to respond to these crises. But because overall aid levels are not rising, it is at the expense of long-term development budgets.<p>

<li>   ODA's expenditure on emergencies rose from £129 million in 1990/1 to £334 million in 1994/5.26<p>

<li>   The British government's contribution to peacekeeping operations soared from £32 million in 1990/1 to an estimated £275 million in 1995/6.27 <p>


<h4>Bedfellows: poverty and war</h4>

The majority of the internal or domestic wars in the world today are occurring in the least- developed countries. Though many factors contribute to the outbreak of conflict, poverty is a root cause. <p>

States and societies that are poor are prone to conflict. It is very difficult for governments to govern adequately when their people cannot afford to pay taxes, and industry and trade are virtually non-existent. When resources are scarce, they are likely to be monopolised by political lites. Aid can itself then become a source of conflict. <p>

This was true in Somalia, where factions and clans fought over access to food, water points, and goods looted in the capital, Mogadishu. This conflict in turn caused a famine which took the lives of an estimated 250,000 children. The West's ineffective response was to send aid and troops costing billions of pounds. <p>

Long-term development programmes to reduce poverty can help to stabilise societies which are extremely poor.<p>


<h4>Lack of political will</h4>

Nevertheless, aid cannot substitute for political action.<p>


<h4>Disaster preparedness</h4>

Fewer and fewer of the disasters in the world today can be described as natural. They are increasingly complex and man-made, linked to conflict and scarcity of resources, and to international economic policies. Aid can help to avert or mitigate their effect. <p>


<h4>Spend now, save the environment</h4>

Poverty is a major cause of environmental degradation. In countries heavily dependent on natural resources, environmental pressures are increasingly contributing to large-scale food shortages, migration, and conflicts. Regional conflicts in western Sudan and Ethiopia are closely linked to displacement of people caused by soil degradation and desertification. When people are deprived of economic choices by their poverty, they exhaust their natural resources in order to survive Ð for example by cutting trees for firewood or hunting animals to the point of eradication. <p>

In such cases, sensitive aid is a valuable tool which can prevent the destruction of irreplaceable eco-systems and protect resources essential for the future.<p>


<h4>Environmental refugees</h4>

Aid can also reduce the number of environmental refugees. Where poor people lack the knowledge or the resources to adapt to environmental changes, they have no option but to migrate. Well-designed aid can make it possible for communities to manage in new conditions. <p>

<title>CASE FOR AID</title>

<h2 align=center>AID IS A HAND-UP NOT A HAND-OUT</h2>

Aid helps people to help themselves. It gives a hand-up to individuals, communities, and nations. It is not the subsidy or hand-out that some perceive aid to be. <p>

It helps people to escape from poverty. It can be a catalyst for long-term change. And by providing resources over a period of time which do not create debt, it gives people the chance to take control of their own development. <p>

As such it is an investment in the future. <p>


<h4>A hand-up for people</h4>

<blockquote><i>"Aid is not just a financial flow and should not be thought of as substituting for private investment...aid is a partnership with the recipient..."</i></blockquote>
<ul>ODA: Fundamental Expenditure Review. </ul><p>

NGOs and official donors have been helping people to help themselves for several decades. They have learned to employ a range of techniques that enable people to improve the quality of their lives. <p>

Improving the sanitation systems in city slums means that children can wash without fear of disease and death. Investing in education means that girls can learn to read Ð and thereby broaden the future for their children. Helping to increase household incomes means that families can save for the future and become economically more independent.<p>


<h4>A hand-up for communities</h4>

Aid can help entire communities and social groups. Good aid invests in services that directly help the poor and meet long-term needs of their communities.<p>

Private markets generally do not invest in basic services that target the poor, such as primary health care or girls' and women's education. In its 1993 World Development Report on health, the World Bank acknowledged that 'private markets will not give the poor adequate access to essential clinical services or the insurance often needed to pay for such services'. <p>

Education is one of the most effective ways of giving women independence and power, and it brings financial benefits to an entire community. The World Bank has shown that health and education programmes bring high economic returns at relatively low cost. It reported that wages increase by more than 10Ð20 per cent for each additional year of schooling.29 The return is often higher among women than men.<p>


<h4>A hand-up for countries</h4>

Aid can be a hand-up not only for individuals and communities, but for whole countries. It can build infrastructure, give support to balance of payments, help to feed the population, transfer skills, and support participation in civil society.<p>


<blockquote><i>"Overseas aid...is a means of bridging the gap between the resources (domestic and foreign) which a poor country has access to, and the resources which it needs before it can achieve growth at a level which will reduce poverty." </i></blockquote>
<ul>ODA, Fundamental Expenditure Review, 1995.</ul><p>


<h4>Aid and private investment</h4>

Aid is one source of capital for the developing world; another is private investment. <p>

Some argue that private investment can do the job that aid does Ð and better. But private investment is not attracted to low-income countries that cannot offer relevant human skills, a productive infrastructure, good economic management or essential public services. Poorer countries need large-scale transfers of financial aid and know-how before these things can be achieved. <p>

In consequence, while private investors are responsible for 60 per cent of capital flows to the developing world, their investment is uneven. Sub-Saharan Africa attracts almost no private capital and therefore depends heavily on aid for 70 per cent of its external capital.32<p>

Of course, foreign aid can pave the way for future private investment. It can strengthen transport and communications systems and energy provision and so directly influence the attitudes of private investors.33 Without progress in these areas, and in education and health, poorer countries are unlikely to attract private capital. <p>


<h4>Emerging democracies</h4>

Aid can help countries along the road to a fairer, more responsible system of government. It can be used to promote participation in the political process.<p>

From providing ballot boxes and monitoring elections to supporting unions and women's organisations and community groups, aid can be an effective tool in helping people establish their democratic rights. It can help to develop a fairer, more accountable system of government, both in developing countries and in the transitional societies of eastern Europe. 
Government to government aid should be conditional on the recipient government's respect for human and basic rights, to ensure that aid is not used for repression or personal gain. Aid can provide a powerful lever to encourage compliance with internationally agreed standards.<p>

<h2 align=center>IN ALL OUR INTERESTS</h2>


<h4>National self-interest</h4>

Aid helps the British economy and also promotes Britain's interests in a rapidly changing world. It is a vital instrument for tackling the transnational problems which affect everyone, regardless of geography. It can create a sense of shared responsibility and citizenship in a world where nations are increasingly interdependent. <p>


<blockquote><i>"There is a strong humanitarian impulse to do what we can to alleviate that poverty. There is an equally strong argument of enlightened self-interest." </i></blockquote>
<ul>Speech by the Rt Hon Malcolm Rifkind QC MP,<br> 
Secretary for State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Diplomatic Banquet, 11 June 1996</ul><p>


<h4>Aid and the economy</h4>

NGOs believe that aid should reduce poverty and promote sustainable development. We remain critical of any forms of aid that do not primarily seek to achieve these objectives. But we accept that good aid can also benefit Britain's economy.<p>

Britain is in a strong position to supply skills and products for international development, and British firms are competitive in many areas. Economic benefits from aid should support the competitive sectors of British industry, while meeting the development needs of the poor; they should not be a temporary or wasteful subsidy. <p>

On balance the evidence is that those who receive aid are best served by untying aid, preferably by international agreement. Our own national interests also benefit. The OECD has demonstrated that tied aid reduces the value of aid by at least 15 per cent. Government figures (which are not entirely precise) suggest that the British economy earns about £1.40 for every £1.00 that Britain contributes towards multilateral aid programmes.34<p>


<blockquote><i>"We want to see the decline in British Aid reversed and rapid progress made to achieve the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP. Cutting the appalling toll of suffering and death from poverty is a moral challenge to all people of good will: meeting it would be good for all, in terms of jobs and economic growth globally. Aid isn't just about giving: British jobs depend on it."</i></blockquote> <p>

<ul>John Monks, General Secretary of The Trades Union Congress.</ul><p>


<blockquote><i>"A small part of the bilateral aid programme specifically supports projects that are developmentally sound and of industrial and commercial significance to the UK. This has enabled Britain to promote hundreds of sound projects in over fifty countries, and has paid for itself many times over in terms of additional UK jobs and exports. As with the rest of the bilateral budget, it has been cut back in recent years. An increase, as part of a larger total budget, would help developing countries and boost British jobs." </i></blockquote><p>

<ul>Alick Goldsmith, Director General, Export Group for the Constructional Industries.</ul><p>

In the long term the economic returns will be even more important. By the end of this century 80 per cent of the world's population will be in developing countries, which will generate 50 per cent of global economic output. Impoverished, war-torn, debt-ridden countries do not provide markets for British goods and services. Investing in their development today can enable poorer countries to become Britain's future trading partners.<p>

Twenty years ago the Asian tigers were heavily dependent on international aid. Now South-East Asia buys some £5 billion of British exports each year, and contains some of our fastest-growing trading partners.<p>


<h4>International influence</h4>

<blockquote><i>"In recent years Britain has punched above her weight in the world. 
We intend to keep it that way." </i></blockquote><ul>

Mr Hurd, then Foreign Secretary, reported in The Daily Telegraph, 1 January 1992.</ul><p>

As a member of some of the world's most influential decision-making bodies, Britain has political and economic influence on the international stage. A substantial aid programme is required if Britain is to fulfil its responsibilities in these bodies. <p>


British diplomatic initiatives are likely to be more effective where they are supported by aid for reconstruction and development.<p>


<hr><p>


<h3>WIDER INTERESTS</h3>

Poverty exacerbates, where it does not create, general international problems. Crime, drugs, migration, the spread of epidemics and preventable diseases, environmental degradation and global warming Ð these are global problems requiring urgent global solutions. It is in the future economic, political, and security interests of richer and poorer countries to invest in aid programmes that can go some way towards meeting these challenges. <p>


<h4>Drug trafficking </h4>

International drugs policies are failing because they place too much emphasis on control and not enough on tackling the root causes, such as rural poverty in the South and social alienation in the North, according to research by the Catholic Institute for International Relations. <p>

Forced eradication of drug crops like coca and poppies can lead to social unrest, instability, and human-rights abuses. Without a reduction in demand for drugs, forced eradication also increases environmental damage by displacing drug cultivation to new areas. <p>

Poor farmers grow coca because their options for earning a legitimate income are so limited. Aid can help farmers to gain better access to domestic and international markets for alternative crops.<p>


<h4>The environment </h4>

Without extensive technology transfer and aid, it is likely that industrialisation in developing countries will generate similar (or worse) destructive side-effects to the ones that are familiar in Northern countries. Goods produced by the most polluting and destructive processes are mostly consumed in industrialised countries, which should share the responsibility for their local and global impact. The principle that environmental protection is in the interests of both the industrialised and developing world is enshrined in international treaties to control climate change and prevent destruction of the ozone layer and biodiversity loss. These treaties were signed at the 1992 Rio Conference on the Environment and Development.<p>

Well-targeted aid can promote cleaner production and help to maintain the productivity of renewable resources, such as fisheries, plantations, and forests. Aid can enable producer countries to earn more by processing and refining their products locally.<p>


<blockquote><i>"The pressures of poverty are eroding the environment of the Third World. Because we share a single globe, that damage threatens the climate on which we depend for our standard of living."</i><ul>
Robin Cook, Shadow Foreign Secretary, Hansard, 17 November 1994.</blockquote></ul><p>


<h4>Global awareness</h4>
If Britain is to play its part in meeting the challenges of the twenty-first century, today's citizens and their children will need to understand the relationships that bind the world's peoples ever closer together. Never before has it been so important to encourage respect for the diversity of cultures that share stewardship of our earth and the complex international relationships that affect us all Ð as consumers and producers, as debtors and creditors, as donors and recipients.<p>

Given resources and commitment, the aid programme could make a significant contribution to this important area of work.35<p>

<blockquote><i>"It is essential if environmental policies are to achieve their objective, that there is wide public awareness of the issues at stake and their importance to the future of the planet and future generations. Education has an essential part to play."</i></blockquote><ul>
HM Government, This Common Inheritance: Britain's Environmental Strategy.</ul><p>


In conclusion, Britain's political leaders must realise that overseas development is no longer a problem for poorer people in poorer countries. Providing more and better-targeted aid within a consistent international policy framework is in the long-term interests of people everywhere. <p>


<blockquote><i>"Over the last thirty years, I have been privileged to witness at first hand the enormous benefits which British aid has brought to many countries, especially in Africa. From the provision of basic services to the promotion of democracy and respect for human rights, I believe that aid has played a vital role in improving people's lives. But the challenges ahead are formidable and the message to donors is clear: now is not the time to cut aid."</i></blockquote><ul>
Rt Hon Sir David Steel MP</ul><p>

<h2 align=center>SUMMARY</h2>


<h3 align=center>WHY THIS MANIFESTO?</h3>

Against a backdrop of unprecedented decline in aid budgets in many countries, including our own, this manifesto renews the case for overseas development aid. <p>

We are at a critical point. Non-government organisations (NGOs) that specialise in Third World development believe that the gradual erosion of the aid budget year by year now poses a direct threat to aid effectiveness. The remarkable progress made since 1950 in combating world poverty will not continue into the next century, and may even be reversed. 
Such a retreat might have disastrous consequences for rich countries as well as for poor ones.<p>

Despite this danger, the political will to build on past successes and take a long-term view of aid is collapsing. The aid budget is always an easy target. During a pre-election period, however, when government departments are required to cut costs in a bid to reduce taxes, and domestic issues take precedence, overseas aid is particularly vulnerable. <p>

Yet the moral imperative for aid is stronger than ever. Advances in telecommunications, computers, and transport mean that it is no longer credible to adopt an insular world view. And in a world in which poor countries are forced to compete 'equally' in the global economy, we have more not less responsibility to take care of one another.<p>

In fact, the gap between the richest and poorest countries is wider than it has ever been. A growing number of people in the world are being excluded from global advances, while new challenges are emerging that require instant and international attention. The number of civil wars is increasing, more people are being displaced by environmental degradation, unplanned urbanisation is reaching crisis point in many countries, and old as well as new diseases are posing fresh threats to public health. <p>

This manifesto therefore urges the British government to develop a long-term vision in support of development aid. <p>


<h3>A new vision for aid in the 1990s</h3>

Decisions about the future of development assistance are increasingly guided by immediate political interests. Greater commitment and bolder policies are required if Britain is to address the human and environmental needs of the next century. <p>

For aid is not only justified on moral grounds. It makes economic and political sense. The eradication of poverty is in the economic and security interests of people in both poor and rich nations.

<p>For example, complex humanitarian emergencies like those in Rwanda or Former Yugoslavia cost the British taxpayer huge sums. Many of these conflicts are rooted in poverty. By developing preventive strategies, and investing appropriately in people, aid can help to avert these human tragedies and avoid huge public expenditure. 

<p>NGOs believe that the primary purpose of aid is to reduce poverty in developing countries, but aid also has direct benefits for Britain. It is good for the economy and for Britain's international interests. A portion of the aid budget flows back to Britain in the shape of receipts for goods and services, jobs, and research. In the longer term, it is also an investment. Impoverished, war-torn, and debt-ridden countries will not make good trading partners now or in the future. Today's recipients of British aid are tomorrow's emerging markets. 

<p>Of course aid can only be one element in a strategy to tackle world poverty. Poverty is caused or entrenched by debt, unfair trade, the arms trade and war, low investment in health and education, bad government, and many other factors. NGOs have run high-profile campaigns on these issues and their views are well documented. 

<p>But aid remains important, and this manifesto concentrates on what it can achieve. 

<h3>Our message</h3>

<li><h4>Aid works</h4>

At the right levels, and properly targeted, aid can work. It can help people who are not reached by other capital flows. The international campaign to reduce poverty Ð  in which aid has played a key role Ð remains one of the greatest achievements of this century: this effort must be renewed for the twenty-first century.<p>


<li><h4> Spend now, save later</h4>

Aid can promote long-term development and growth: by spending now, we can save lives and resources, and protect the environment.
<p>

<li><h4>Aid is a hand-up, not a hand-out</h4>

Aid can be a sound investment. It can help people to help themselves Ð and need not be the subsidy or hand-out that some perceive it to be. <p>

<p>

<li><h4> Aid is in everyone's interest </h4>
Poverty and inequality fuel transnational problems like crime, environmental degradation, mass migration, and epidemics. Aid can help to reduce or manage these threats and can therefore benefit both poorer and richer nations. 

<a name="recommendations"></a>
<p>

<h3>RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>

For aid to help in meeting the challenges of the next century, we urge the British government to support the following recommendations: <p>

<h4>Increase aid</h4>

<li>  Official aid should be sustained and increased to meet the challenges of the next century. We recommend a ten-year timetable which sets out year-on-year increases towards the universally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of GNP. (Britain's aid currently stands at 0.31 per cent.) In the first year, the extra cost would be in the region of £200 million.<p>


<h4>Reduce poverty</h4>

<li>  Aid must first and foremost be directed at reducing poverty. We recommend that the <a href="../../oda/index.html">Overseas Development Administration</a> (ODA) increase the poverty focus of its programmes and improve the access of poor people to basic social services such as primary education and health care. We recommend that the ODA should invest further in developing the skills and capacity which people need to participate in their own development and escape from the cycle of poverty. This approach is consistent with the ODA's current policies, which should be promoted in the various international organisations of which Britain is a member.<p>


<h4>Harmonise policies</h4>

<li> All policies that have an impact on developing countries should complement one another and promote development. In particular, the Treasury's management of debt, the ODA's support for structural adjustment, the Department of Trade and Industry's policies on trade and arms sales, and the activities of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office should support rather than undermine the ODA's development objectives.<p>

<h2 align=center>THE NEW MORAL IMPERATIVE</h2>

<blockquote><i>"I have seen repeatedly on my travels throughout the Anglican Communion what a vital contribution the British aid programme makes in developing countries. In countries like Sudan it can mean the difference between life and death for thousands."</i></blockquote>
<ul>
	George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury, June 1996</ul><p>


For so long as poverty and exclusion prevent people from achieving their basic needs, and as long as richer countries can help to meet those needs, the moral case for aid remains. It is this moral imperative that drives the activities of development NGOs, which exist to eradicate poverty and ensure that basic needs are met.<p>

The moral imperative for aid is stronger than ever as we near the end of the twentieth century. Advances in telecommunications, transport, and information technologies have brought us closer together. We can no longer distance ourselves from the suffering of others. <p>

Developed countries contribute in many ways to the growing inequality between nations. They have helped to cause the indebtedness of Third World states, and set trade rules that disadvantage poorer countries. Above all, perhaps, they consume a disproportionate share of the world's resources. Richer countries should therefore accept that they have a duty to reduce world poverty, and share the tasks of managing the world's resources and resolving the world's problems equitably. <p>

In the longer term, it is in the interests not just of ourselves but also our children to create a fairer and more orderly world.<p>



<h4>Future challenges</h4>

Today, one in every five of the world's people is excluded from recent global advances, even in countries that have experienced growth. And the absolute number of poor people is increasing. <p>

In addition, new challenges are emerging. We must deal with complex emergencies that combine war with natural disasters, with rapid unplanned urbanisation, and with the spread of new and old diseases.<p>

<li>   One-fifth of the world's population still live in absolute poverty.7<p>

<li>   35,000 children die every day from preventable diseases.8<p>

<li>   In the developing world, 1.3 billion people lack clean drinking water and 2.9 billion do not have safe sanitation.9<p>

<li>	An estimated 40 million people will be infected with HIV by the year 2000, most of them in the developing world.10<p>

<li>	The poorest 50 countries, mostly in Africa, are home to one-fifth of the world's population but account for less than two per cent of global income.11 <p>

<li>	Nearly 800 million people do not get enough food, and 500 million people are chronically malnourished.12<p>

<li>	About 600,000 women die in childbirth each year.13<p>

<li>	The number of refugees increased nine-fold in 20 years (between 1974 and 1994) to 27 million. Another 15 million are displaced (as refugees in their own country).14 <p>

<li>	As many as 700,000 square kilometres of farmland are abandoned every year because of land degradation and about four million hectares of unirrigated cropland are lost annually as a result of soil erosion.15

<B>1 <I>EUROSTEP</I> FISHERIES CAMPAIGN GOES PUBLIC</B> 
<P>
<I>Eurostep</I> will stage a public event in front of the European
Council offices in Brussels on Tuesday 28 May the day of the meeting
of the Development Council. The purpose is to raise awareness
of the fisheries issue and of the <I>Eurostep</I> campaign. The
delegation, which includes three representatives of the fishing
community in Senegal, will present a report to the Chairman of
the Development Council. The report &quot;The Fight for Fish:
Towards Fair Fisheries Agreements&quot; has been produced by NOVIB
and is now available in both English and French. After a one hour
demonstration on the street the party will move off to the <I>Eurostep</I>
office for a press conference.
<P>
Over the following two days the delegation will have a packed
schedule of engagements which includes an address to the Development
Committee of the European Parliament, and high level meetings
at both DG VIII and DG XIV.
<P>
<B>2 THE FUTURE OF THE LOME CONVENTION</B> 
<P>
The working group on the negotiations for the future of Lom&eacute;
beyond the year 2000 is meeting in the <I>Eurostep</I> office
today. Meanwhile, the Commissioner for relations with ACP countries
and South Africa Mr. Joao de Deus Pinheiro has been dropping hints
about the current thought processes within the Commission. At
a press conference on 21 May Mr. Pinheiro gave the results of
a public opinion survey on how Europeans perceive developing countries.
The survey - called the Eurobarometer - shows that the place of
development cooperation in the list of priorities of European
people has fallen since the last survey in 1991 (it is now in
tenth place). However, the good news for Mr. Pinheiro is that
the public do seem to believe that the EU is a particularly appropriate
institution to work in this domain. The public ranked development
cooperation fourth in their list of privileged fields of action
for the EU. The three areas felt even more appropriate for a European
level response were relations with the countries of Central and
Eastern Europe, the fight against unemployment, and defense policy.
<P>
As for the thought processes leading up to the end of Lom&eacute;
IV, Mr. Pinheiro confirmed that the reflection group which has
been established in the Commission will be producing a green paper
by the end of October. However &quot;the green paper will not
be a book of answers but a book of questions&quot; he said and
he gave examples of the question which were being asked -
<UL>
<LI>What will be the impact of the private sector in development?
<LI>Will the same cooperation instruments be applied to all countries
and to all geographical areas?
<LI>Should one separate the Caribbean and the Pacific from Sub-Saharan
Africa?
</UL>

<P>
Following presentation of the green paper the Commission will
work towards adopting a formal communication in 1997. The actual
negotiations for the new convention will begin in 1998.
<P>
<B>3 GREAT LAKES DEVELOPMENT MEETING</B> 
<P>
The United Nations Non-Governmental liaison service in Geneva
reports in its magazine <I>GO Between</I> that there will be a
governmental level conference in Kinshasa on June 10 to 14 to
discuss development projects for the Great Lakes region. NGOs
are welcome to attend the proceedings, as are regional
<P>
cooperation institutions, the private sector, and investors. The
conference will bring together the governments of Burundi, Rwanda,
Tanzania, Uganda, and Zaire.
<P>
We do not have any further information to give you except that
the official UN contact for the conference is the Multinational
Programming and Operational Centre of the United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa in Addis Ababa, telephone + 251 1 515 827,
fax + 251 1 515 907.
<P>
<B>4 HABITAT II</B> 
<P>
The United Nations Conference on Human Settlements - otherwise
known as Habitat II - will be taking place in the first two weeks
of June in Istanbul. The Women's Environment and Development Organisation
(WEDO) based in New York has formed a women's caucus to focus
efforts to influence the discussions at the conference. The caucus
has been lobbying the conference preparatory process in order
to influence the agenda and is offering facilities at Habitat
II itself including daily de-briefings and a special &quot;super-coalition
tent&quot; for 500 people to be a home from home for the conference's
women. They will give an orientation to the women's caucasus process
at the outset of the conference on Sunday 2 June at the NGO forum
in Istanbul. You can contact them in New York - telephone + 1
212 759 7982 or fax + 1 212 759 8647
<P>
<B>5 Health</B> 
<P>
Following on from last week's alternative PAF, we are glad to
say that the health of Peter Bastogi continues to improve. He
is now able to breathe without the help of a respirator and is
left with a much reduced infection. This is good news. <HR>

<html><head><title>Storm brewing over live AIDS vaccine tests</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><img src="panos_pix/panos_logo.gif"><br><i>The material that follows has been provided by <a href="panos_info.html"> Panos </i> </a><hr><h2>Storm brewing over live AIDS vaccine tests</h2><h3>By Rupa Chinai, a journalist with The Times of India</h3><p>Bombay: Details of secret trials of a live AIDS vaccine in India and the United States are now emerging. <p>The experiments have been condemned as "unscientific and unethical" by the World Health Organization's chief of vaccine development, Jose Esparza. <p>The 10 HIV-positive Indian volunteers were injected with a strain of the Bovine Immunodeficiency Virus (BIV), a close relative of HIV that is known to cause an AIDS-like illness in cattle. Experts at WHO and the US National Institutes of Health say such an experiment may involve great risks to humans. <p>Dr Baihrab Bhattacharya, the US-based veterinary doctor who produced the vaccine in the basement of his house in New Jersey and conducted the Indian trial in 1994, says that he has also begun testing the vaccine in the US . He claims to have given it to 16 New Jersey residents last January.<p>The safety and effectiveness of the vaccine has not been scientifically established. <p>Only inert fragments of the virus or killed virus preparations are thought to be safe - and volunteers who have received even these vaccines are monitored very closely. <p>Dangers associated with the live BIV vaccine include the possibility that the living virus could mutate within the body and evolve into a new, deadlier form of HIV.<p>Impurities in the vaccine also may pose risks. Bhattacharya prepared the vaccine in laboratory cultures of dog cells, and the finished product might contain dog viruses or other contaminants. Some viruses,  including HIV, are known to cross from one species to another, and though they may not cause disease in the species in which they originate, they may be deadly in the new host. If a person contracted an unknown dog virus from Bhattacharya's preparation, a new human disease might be created.<p>All the Bombay residents who received the vaccine - nine men and one woman - are young, educated, middle-class, conscious of their rights and desperate for a cure. They were infected with HIV through sexual contact. Their names are being withheld at their request. <p>Four commercial sex workers in Calcutta also received the vaccine, but there is no information about them.<p>Bhattacharya's experiment was financed by Pierre-Emanuel de Gaspe, a  US  citizen. They both say - as do several of the recipients - that the trial was coordinated by Dr I. S. Gilada of the non-government Indian Health Organisation. Gilada denies any role in the experiment.<p>The incident first came to light in August, after one of the 10 died and the rest became concerned about their health. The condition of two others was deteriorating and they were desperate for a booster shot of the BIV vaccine. <p>At that time, patients said they received the first vaccine dose on March 9 1994, followed on April 12 by a booster dose. But soon after, those involved in conducting the trial are reported to have fallen out over money and the experiment was abandoned.more ... <p>Vaccine trials are usually subject to rigorous controls and regulations established by health authorities in both the country where the vaccine is to be tested and the country where the vaccine is manufactured.<p>The Indian government says it was not informed that its citizens were receiving the live BIV vaccine. No official approval for the trial was given by any ethical committee within India or the US. The US Food and Drug Administration and the US National Institutes of Health claim no knowledge of Bhattacharya and his vaccine. <p>Bhattacharya maintains that he was following the Helsinki Declaration which permits use of experimental substances in terminally ill patients if there is a strong scientific basis for believing the treatment will help,  if the patients are receiving the best possible care available and if the patients have given their informed consent.<p>But in this case most of the patients, though infected with HIV, were not ill. Apart from a physical examination, no baseline medical tests were conducted before the vaccine was administered. One of the patients discovered he had leukemia only after receiving the vaccine.<p>The vaccine has never been tested in animals, nor is there published scientific data suggesting that the vaccine is safe or that it might be effective. <p>Patients signed a consent form stating that their participation was voluntary. They stress, however, that they were not informed of any particular risks associated with live vaccines. <p>"We were told that the BIV vaccine would cure us of HIV/AIDS", said one of the trial subjects, adding that one patient reported that Gilada told him that he could get married after receiving the vaccine. <p>"We were the patients of Dr. Gilada, and we took part in this trial with full sincerity and trust in him. We knew that such a vaccine had not been tried on any other human being. We were told that the trial had the permission of the authorities. We did not know about the absence of clinical studies associated with live vaccines."<p>When the trial was abandoned, eight of the patients decided to stick together and monitor their results. They kept in touch with de Gaspe, who paid for them to have regular blood tests. <p>Over the past year,  four such tests, known as CD4 cell counts, have been conducted at the Hinduja Hospital in Bombay. The CD4 cells, a sub-set of white blood cells (which boost the immune response against infections), decline in HIV-infected persons. <p>Experts say that in patients receiving products that are effective against HIV, the number of these cells in the blood ceases to decline or may increase.<p>The results of the tests, which were sent to de Gaspe in the US, showed that in all eight patients CD4 cell counts did not decline during the first eight months after the vaccine was administered. Thereafter, while the condition of five of the patients remained steady, the other three worsened.<p>One of the three died in August 1995 with full-blown AIDS. (When he received the vaccine he was the only member of the group in a late stage of HIV infection.) The second patient is terminally ill with leukemia but otherwise displays no symptoms of AIDS. The third has registered a decline in CD4 count,  but otherwise remains well.<p>Experts who have studied the patient records express surprise at the general good health of the other five, whose CD4 counts have remained constant. They all have recorded CD4 levels averaging between 700 and 1700. A normally healthy person in Bombay records CD4 levels of 800-1200, they said.<p>But the patients feel they have been treated "worse than guinea pigs".<p>"We have been badly let down by all those who were associated with the vaccine trial," said one. "All that we now ask for is that the vaccine be scientifically tested."<p>Bhattacharya says two of the 16 volunteers in the US have died, one contracted lockjaw and another committed suicide. <p>Bhattacharya has never submitted an application to the Food and Drug Administration for permission to administer the vaccine in human subjects; he claims to have received permission to test the vaccine from the New Jersey Attorney General's Office. Contacted by Panos, a spokesman from the AIDS division of the New Jersey Department of Health denied all knowledge of the trials.<p>©Copyright: Panos 22 November 1995                                                      <hr><a href="index.html"><img src="panos_pix/panos_logo2.gif"> PANOS Home Page</a><hr></body></html>

<font size=+1><i>An emotional arrival...<br>Three children too many... <br>One of two wives in a second-best marriage...<br> Houses changing shape<br> - is that progress or a problem?</i></font><p></center></ul><font size=-1>Mariama with her seventh child, two-year-old Rasinatu,<br> something of an indulged favourite with both mother and father</font><hr width=70%><p><br clear=left><font size=+2>A</font> teenager is leading me through the two kilometres of open country that separate the outlying district of Bidiga, where I am to live, from the centre of Sabtenga. I need his guidance. I thought I would remember my way but I haven't a clue which path to take. To Westerners the word 'village' conveys a clump of houses clustered around a road or central square. That doesn't begin to conjure up Sabtenga, whose 5,000 inhabitants sprawl over a vast area, each living in complex warrens of huts, yards and passageways called concessions. These concessions can house anything between 10 and 100 people - they can be a bit like a village in themselves and are separated from the neighbouring concession by anything from twenty to hundreds of metres of rough, baked earth.<p>Identifying Mariama's concession would have been just as impossible, though I recognize the huge tree at its entrance as I pass. This is dressed not only in leaves but in wrinkled skin - hundreds of bats hang from its upper branches and burst into alarming life every evening the moment the sun takes its leave of the horizon.<p>To tell the truth I am a bit nervous - I am approaching the key moment in this whole adventure, since it was Mariama's insights that opened the door for me on the life of the village ten years ago. She is pleased to see me and gives me an enthusiastic kiss but after that I think neither of us knows quite what to do. She looks a touch more careworn - but nowhere near as much as I do (a soldier at the airport looked at the fresh-faced photo in my passport and then back at me about five times in half-feigned incredulity). <p>We sit down in her courtyard and exchange the most basic news while she pummels at some millet for the evening meal - the everyday staple in the village is a thick, sticky millet porridge or t, chunks of which you dip into a thin vegetable sauce. Her younger children pull at and clamour round her as she works.<p>Ah yes, those younger children. When I was here ten years ago Mariama told me clearly that she didn't want any more than the four children she then had. It was a matter of some urgency for her since the traditional period of grace for a mother after the birth of a child was coming to an end - she knew that Issa, her husband, would soon be resuming his visits to her hut. The familiar sickness and swelling would follow as inevitably as night follows day. She knew they had pills to stop pregnancy in the capital but what use was that here? I remember feeling desperate to think of some way out for her but without contraception her only hope was to persuade Issa that another child would not be a good idea.<p>The inevitable happened and she now has seven children. She is unusually lucky that all her babies have survived - her co-wife Alia, for <p>example, lost four of her seven children. But there is a flipside to this luck: Mariama is an active, intelligent woman who feels besieged by her smaller children and who is desperately conscious of the burden of feeding so many. <p>'I wanted to stop at four,' she tells me the next day when we are a bit more used to each other again. 'But it wasn't possible. First Issa didn't want to stop. And second there were no pills in the village.' It seems contraceptives only became available a year ago - and even now they are used by only 12 women.<p>Mariama's story seems to scotch one myth about population: the one which says that people without contraceptive technology will find some natural method of their own. True, the Bissa had evolved a method of birth spacing through the husband's sexual abstinence for two years after the birth. But in this case a woman who was absolutely convinced that she didn't want more children was unable to prevent their coming. 'It's children that drain a woman and exhaust her,' she says. <p><img width=100 height=131 border=1 align=right hspace=10 src="ni_pix/268_p11_issa.gif"><ul><font size=-1>Issa takes a break from building work on another new house in the concession.</font></ul><hr width=60%><p>But for Issa the drain on his wife counted less than the potential help in the fields later on - the traditional peasant argument in favour of more children. Now, ten years and three children later, he is finally convinced that another mouth to feed would be bad news. So perhaps Mariama's tired body will get some rest. But it's a sad, sad thought that she's been subjected to so much.<p>I think Issa always knew he was getting an unusual package when he took Mariama as his second wife. She says he understood from the start, even as a man who had to live and die by farming his own land, that Mariama would not work in the fields - that she never had and never would. What he was getting instead was a woman of ability and outspokenness - qualities other men would not necessarily have valued in a wife and which won her election to the village's Committee for the Defence of the Revolution, established by Sankara to challenge the conservative power of rural chiefs.<p>When I first met her she was 28: tall and slim, still young despite her four children and with a face so infused with life that it looked all the time as though she were poised on the brink of laughter. All the same, she made no bones about telling me how hard she found life in the village, which she contrasted with her childhood memories of rain and plenty in the nearby town of Garango.<p>Her father had served as a soldier with the French in Vietnam and gained financial security as a result. And he had marked that in the traditional fashion by taking four wives, so there had always been plenty of brothers and sisters around to play with. He was also a devout Muslim - and this turned out to have a profound impact on the course of his daughter's life.<p>By the time Mariama was 17, the traditional age for a Bissa woman to marry, she had fallen in love with a young gendarme in the town. But it was a doomed affair. The fact that he was from a Catholic family might not have presented an insuperable obstacle - Catholics and Muslims live happily cheek by jowl in the village and, provided the woman (never the man) is prepared to adapt, marriages between the communities are not uncommon. But the gendarme was an atheist and Mariama's father absolutely ruled out the idea of a son-in-law who did not pray. She did not even think of standing out against her father's judgement: the marriage she preferred was simply not to be.<p>Instead she had no alternative but to marry another, older suitor who already had one wife. It could have been much worse. Issa was a quiet man of 30 whom she knew would be steady and never beat her. Besides, there was at first the excitement of cosmopolitan Abidjan, capital of Cote d'Ivoire. But after two years Issa's father died and they had to return to Sabtenga so he could become head of the family. It is still a source of regret that they did not have time to build up more savings to underpin their lives as subsistence farmers.<p>This notion of material comfort as something that comes from Cote d'Ivoire or Ghana is ubiquitous in the village. The community lives by subsistence agriculture - people grow enough millet to see them through the year during the rainy season that stretches from May until the harvest in September. Surpluses can be sold to raise cash but surpluses are rare. Instead young men still follow the model set when the French used what is now Burkina Faso as a pool of forced labour for the resource-rich coastal areas. They set out in search of work on the plantations or in the cities. Some never come back. Some go just during the dry season when no useful work can be done in the fields. Some build up a nest-egg to the point where they can return and set themselves up with a wife (or three).<p>It's odd witnessing the effect of such cash infusions over a long period. If I were visiting Sabtenga for the first time now I would probably just be struck by the hardship of subsistence life. Yet having known the village ten years ago I can't help but be struck by signs of material progress that I hadn't really expected to find. <p>Ten years ago, for example, I was desperately aware of people's backbreaking labour in the fields. They walked kilometres to reach their fields then bent double to hack at the bitter earth with their dabas (small hoes). 'Can't they get any help at all with this work?' I remember thinking, being more used to Asia, where oxen pulling ploughs are the norm. <p>To my surprise, the ox and plough have now arrived in Sabtenga. By no means all households have them - and Issa and Mariama are among those who cannot yet afford them. But many households do have oxen, as well as donkey carts in which to bring the harvest back from the fields - a significant advance for women, who used to carry it in vast bundles on their heads. Those who have managed to buy an ox can also cultivate a much larger area, which is especially important when the fertility of the soil is declining. The other family I knew best ten years ago was that of Zenabou and Adama, about whom we made our film. They now have no less than 12 oxen and in material terms are pulling away from their neighbours.<p>As this suggests, a gap between 'rich' and 'poor' is beginning to open up within the village - and as in all societies, the awareness of your own poverty becomes more painful when someone else's relative prosperity is staring you in the face. <p>Even the houses now testify to this. Ten years ago people lived as their foreparents had since time immemorial - in concessions composed of small round huts with conical thatched roofs. I certainly had no thought that this traditional housing was likely to change. Yet it has. <p>They are still building with mud, which is softened with well-water then poured into a mould to form a brick that hardens in the sun for a day. When they have enough bricks they use mud as mortar and build up a rectangular house which is roofed with sheets of corrugated iron. <p>I am used to decrying corrugated iron as a terrible sign of Westernization in a tropical clime - it is an expensive, industrially produced item which invites rather than repels the heat. But you have to listen to what the villagers say. They know full well that corrugated iron makes their houses hotter. But it will not leak during the rains as even the best thatch is liable to - and it will last for fifteen years instead of just two. Even more to the point, the high-quality straw traditionally used for roofing is becoming impossible to find in the bush.<p>If I come back in another ten years I may well find only donkeys in thatched huts. That will certainly be so if the villagers have any choice in the matter, since only the lack of money to pay for corrugated iron stands in their way. As a result the village will look altogether less picturesque to Western eyes. But people will probably be happier in homes which are more spacious, more durable and, sad to say, more free from the connotation of poverty now attached to the traditional houses.<p>Mariama is certainly in no doubt. A box topped with corrugated iron might seem to us a questionable improvement. But to her it would be a palace. She has vivid, longing dreams about living in it - literally her dream home.<p>©Copyright: New Internationalist 1995<hr><a href="index.html"><img width=35 height=30 src="ni_pix/nilogo3.gif"> NI Home Page</a> <a href="contents268.html"><img width=45 height=68 src="ni_pix/268_cover_thumb.gif"> Issue 268</a><hr></body></html>

<P>
<B>La coop&eacute;ration entre les Samoa occidentales et la Communaut&eacute;
europ&eacute;enne remonte &agrave; 1975, date d'adh&eacute;sion
de ce pays &agrave; la Convention de Lom&eacute;. Le secteur de
l'&eacute;nergie a &eacute;t&eacute;, d&egrave;s le d&eacute;part,
le principal b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire des fonds programmables
(4,6 millions d'ECU au titre de Lom&eacute; I et 6 millions d'ECU
au titre de Lom&eacute; II) avec le financement du Projet hydro&eacute;lectrique
de Samasoni &agrave; la fin des ann&eacute;es 1970 et du projet
hydro&eacute;lectrique de Sauniatu au d&eacute;but des ann&eacute;es
1980</B>.
<P>
 Un programme regroupant 260 micror&eacute;alisations a &eacute;t&eacute;
parall&egrave;lement financ&eacute; en vue du d&eacute;veloppement
de l'&eacute;levage de volailles et de porcs, ainsi que de la
p&ecirc;che ; il englobe 96 villages sur les &icirc;les principales
d'Upolu et Savai'i. Un montant suppl&eacute;mentaire de 890.000
ECU a &eacute;t&eacute; attribu&eacute; &agrave; la Western Samoa
Development Bank sous la forme d'une ligne de cr&eacute;dit destin&eacute;e
&agrave; accro&icirc;tre sa capacit&eacute; de pr&ecirc;t. Par
ailleurs, &agrave; l'&eacute;poque o&ugrave; les exportations
de coprah &eacute;taient encore importantes, la Communaut&eacute;
a financ&eacute; des installations de stockage et de manutention
de l'huile et des tourteaux de coprah (900.000 ECU).
<P>
 Outre l'aide programmable, les Samoa occidentales ont re&ccedil;u
12 transferts du Stabex d'un montant total de 9,3 millions d'ECU
en compensation de la chute des exportations de coprah, de bois,
de bananes et de cacao entre 1975 et 1984.
<P>
 La valorisation du potentiel hydro&eacute;lectrique consid&eacute;rable
de ce pays s'est poursuivie au cours de Lom&eacute; III, et les
Samoa occidentales ont effectu&eacute; des progr&egrave;s majeurs
vers l'autonomie &eacute;nerg&eacute;tique. Alors qu'en 1980,
pr&egrave;s de 78 % de l'&eacute;lectricit&eacute; &eacute;taient
produits par des installations au diesel, cette proportion atteignait
26 % &agrave; peine en 1986. Le volume des importations p&eacute;troli&egrave;res
destin&eacute;es &agrave; la production d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute;
a diminu&eacute; &agrave; 36 % au cours de la p&eacute;riode 1982-86.
Ce volume a encore &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;duit suite &agrave;
la construction de la centrale hydro&eacute;lectrique d'Afulio
(Lom&eacute; III et IV), ce qui permet d'importantes &eacute;conomies
en termes de devises. Ce projet - cofinanc&eacute; par la Banque
asiatique de d&eacute;veloppement, la BEI, la Banque mondiale
et la Western Samoa Electric Power Corporation - couvre la construction
d'un r&eacute;servoir de 10 millions de m&egrave;tres cube, d'un
canal d'amen&eacute;e et d'une centrale &eacute;lectrique, ainsi
que l'installation de l'&eacute;quipement m&eacute;canique et
des lignes de transmission. Il a sensiblement am&eacute;lior&eacute;
la qualit&eacute; de l'approvisionnement &eacute;lectrique sur
l'&icirc;le d'Upolu.
<P>
 D'autres travaux ont &eacute;t&eacute; men&eacute;s gr&acirc;ce
aux fonds de Lom&eacute; IV en vue de la distribution d'eau en
r&eacute;gions rurales : un plan directeur et une &eacute;tude
d'am&eacute;nagement ont &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;alis&eacute;s
pour plusieurs zones rurales, et une campagne de sensibilisation
de l'opinion publique &agrave; l'&eacute;gard de l'utilisation
rationnelle des ressources hydriques est pr&eacute;vue parall&egrave;lement
&agrave; l'avancement des travaux d'infrastructure.
<P>
 Enfin, un programme d'un million d'ECU a &eacute;t&eacute; affect&eacute;
au financement de micror&eacute;alisations visant &agrave; r&eacute;nover
l'infrastructure des communaut&eacute;s rurales en mati&egrave;re
de distribution d'eau, de sant&eacute;, d'&eacute;ducation, de
tourisme, d'agriculture et de p&ecirc;che.
<P>
 Les versements du Stabex au titre de Lom&eacute; III (1985-1989)
et de Lom&eacute; IV (1990-1994) se sont respectivement &eacute;lev&eacute;s
&agrave; 11,1 et 5,7 millions d'ECU. Ces paiements ont &eacute;t&eacute;
effectu&eacute;s au titre d'une indemnisation des pertes subies
par l'huile et autres produits &agrave; base de coprah, ainsi
que des pertes encourues par les exportations de f&egrave;ves
de cacao et de bois brut.
<P>
 Outre cette aide non remboursable, la BEI a octroy&eacute; depuis
1981 un total de 9 millions d'ECU environ sous la forme de capitaux
&agrave; risque, principalement utilis&eacute;s dans le cadre
des projets hydro&eacute;lectriques de Sauniatu et d'Afulio.
<P>
 Une somme suppl&eacute;mentaire de 660.896 d'ECU a &eacute;t&eacute;
allou&eacute;e au titre d'une aide d'urgence aux Samoa occidentales
suite &agrave; un incendie de grande envergure sur l'&icirc;le
de Savai'i en 1983, et suite aux cyclones d&eacute;vastateurs
Ofa et Val en 1990 et 1991.
<P>
 La programmation de la tranche suivante du financement communautaire
dans le cadre du 8&egrave;me FED n'est pas encore termin&eacute;e
mais tout porte &agrave; croire qu'elle donnera la priorit&eacute;
&agrave; l'extension et &agrave; la modernisation du r&eacute;seau
de distribution de l'eau.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. MILITARY ACTION STILL REQUIRED IN ZAIRE - EMMA
BONINO</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>European Humanitarian Affairs Commissioner Emma Bonino
reiterated her appeal for military action in Zaire on Tuesday
25 November. She expressed her exasperation over the situation
describing the inability of military chiefs and political leaders
to appraise the conditions, location and the number of people
in distress as &quot;amazing&quot;. Mrs. Bonino said that the
&quot;only straightforward answer to the problem is to organise
a military intervention for assessment in the area.&quot; She
stressed that the international community could no longer tolerate
that the destiny of hundreds of thousands of innocent people be
determined in the absence of international action or relief. Mrs
Bonino had earlier on in the week raised the poignant question
of how many refugees lives should be endangered to merit military
action asking whether the figure 700 000 refugees or a million
was enough to justify action.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Also earlier on Monday the EU Council of Foreign
Ministers meeting on Monday 25 November said that they still felt
an international force was needed to assist the refugees in East
Zaire. France and Spain recalled their willingness to contribute
men to the force, however, British Foreign Minister cautioned
that it was difficult to take any action without an overall view
of the situation. The Council also welcomed the European Commission's
decision to provide a Community contribution from ECHO for the
UN Trust Fund and stressed on the need for the early convening
of an international conference on peace and stability in the region
under the auspices of the Organisation for African Unity and the
UN.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>On the same day the Rwandan government announced
that it will not permit the use of its territory by a multinational
force and added that it viewed military intervention as unnecessary
in contradiction to the advice of the head of the Medecins Sans
Frontieres mission in Kigali.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. EU DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL APPROVES OF WIDE RANGE
OF DEVELOPMENT RESOLUTIONS INCLUDING MEASURES CONCERNING CRISIS
IN ZAIRE</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The EU Development Council approved a wide range
of items on Friday 22 November with the main focus centring on
the persistent crisis in the Great Lakes Region. On this issue
the Council backed the urgent implementation of the UN Security
Council resolution to convey aid to East Zaire and facilitate
free return of refugees to their countries of origin. The Council
also adopted a joint action which calls for voluntary contributions
supporting African participation in a multinational force. A budget
of 15 million ECU is envisaged for this action. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Other items adopted were a) a Human and Social Development
Co-operation policy geared towards the development of man with
particular emphasis on poverty alleviation and sustainable development;
b) a conclusion on anti-personnel mines calling for the implementation
of mine clearance operations, the immediate cessation of the use
and marketing of anti-personnel mines and the creation of an international
planning strategy; c) conclusions on recommending the idea of
equality between men and women in crisis prevention, emergency
aid and rehabilitation; d) conclusions calling for the assessment
of humanitarian aid granted since 1991 in the light of the Court
of Auditors report to be presented before the end of the year.

the Council Meeting can contact the nearest Council office or

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>3. MANUEL OREJA REPORTS ON THE IGC </FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In his latest report of the proceedings of the InterGovernmental
Conference, EC Audio-visual Commissioner, Marcelino Oreja said
that the recent Heads of State and Governments reaffirmed the
determination to conclude the Conference by the end of June 1997.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>On the Common Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP,
little progress has been made, the recent Foreign Ministers Meeting
on 28 November failed to resolve a single one of the issues considered
to be stalling progress, i.e. the definition of the objectives
and the structures needed to conduct those policies and the voting
procedures in the Council of Ministers. According to Mr. Oreja
the lack of progress is due to insufficient trust between the
Member States and between them and the Commission. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>On the issue of defence, the Union envisages bearing
a share of peacekeeping and humanitarian operation responsibilities
in other parts of the world. Co-operation with NATO will also
continue. Mr Oreja, however said that a more effective solution
for the foreign policy problem, which is a vital aspect of the
conference, will have to be sought. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Finally a schedule for forthcoming IGC events is
included in Mr. Oreja's report. Readers interested in copies of
the report and schedule for the next two months can contact Marcelino
Oreja at the European Commission, Rue de la Loi 200, 1040 Brussels.

<B><FONT SIZE=2>4. UNHCR FOLLOW UP TO CONFERENCE ON REFUGEES</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the follow-up to the <I>Regional Conference to
Address the Problems of Refugees, Displaced Persons, Other Forms
of Involuntary Displacement and Returnees in the Commonwealth
of Independent</I> <I>States and Relevant Neighbouring States,
</I>the UNHCR, has initiated a number of activities to involve
national and international NGOs in monitoring the progress made
after the Conference. The principal area of focus will be the
sharing of information among governments, NGOs, the media and
the general public and the enhancement of NGO participation in
the follow-up to the Conference. A directory and database of NGOs
concerned with the refugee problem in the former Soviet Union
is being set up to provide information, including the UNHCR/IOM
bulletin <I>CISCOF NEWS,</I> to the relevant NGOs. All interested
institutions should contact Kirsti Floor, UNHCR Policy Officer
(NGOs) CIS Conference Regional Bureau for Europe to ask for a
questionnaire for the database and further information. <BR>

<p><b>1.	EU/ACP: JOINT ASSEMBLY,  PLENARY IN LUXEMBOURG FROM 23 TO 27 	SEPTEMBER</b></p>
<p>The ACP/EU Joint Assembly, co-chaired by the UK Conservative Lord Plumb and Sir John Kaputin (Papua New Guinea), will open its autumn session in Luxembourg 23 September.</p>
<p>Between 23 and 27 September, MEPs and their colleagues of ACP States will discuss the reports by Jean-Louis Firmin (Haiti) on the future relations between EU and ACP countries, the situation in specific countries (Burundi, Rwanda, Liberia, Nigeria, Angola, Mozambique, Sudan, Somalia and Western Sahara), the development of relations between the EU and South Africa, the results of the Conference on the information society, the very controversial EU draft directive on cocoa and its consequences for producer countries among ACPs and the EU regulation on bananas.</p>
<p>A hearing will take place on Wednesday 25 September on Climate Change and Small Island Countries. </p>
<p><b>2.	IGC/AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL</b></p>
<p>According to Amnesty International, the IGC should provide the opportunity to place the respect for and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the heart of legal basis of the Union. Rather than making new declarations, it should ensure that the existing ones are put into practice through providing new instruments with the European Union framework. AI makes four concrete recommendations:</p>
<OL>
<LI>The IGC should introduce a human rights impact assessment for all important decisions under Common Foreign and Security Policy.<P>
<LI>The Member States should undertake to fully respect international instruments such as the Conclusions of the UNHCR Executive Committee and the Handbook of the UNHCR on Procedures and Criteria for determining Refugee Status.<p>
<LI>The Treaty of Rome should be amended to allow accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.<p>
<LI>The IGC should also provide the opportunity to establish a framework of transparency and accountability at EU level in the field of military, security and police transfers. An EU Code of Conduct on Arms Trade would be a good first step in that direction.<p>
</OL>
<p>At a more general level, Amnesty calls for the principles of transparency and accountability to be incorporated in the EU treaties as a fundamental basis for all activity and recommends that a right of information for the public matters concerning EU human rights issues be provided in the Treaty itself.</p>
<p><b>3.	EU/WTO/BANANAS</b></p>
<p>A World Trade Organisation arbitrarian panel has begun examining the complaint lodged by the United States and four Latin American producer countries against the Union banana import system. According to the legal advisers for the Caribbean exporter countries, notably the  European representative of the Caribbean Banana Exporters Association (CBEA), the US argued that only government representatives should be admitted to the hearing, thus excluding the legal advisers from the session, and "further infringing upon the right of Caribbean producers to defend themselves, when 60% of their export earnings are in danger". The CBEA also warned of the "economic disaster" facing its producers should the European scheme be judged illegal.</p>
<p><b>4.	GENERAL AFFAIRS INFORMAL</b></p>
<UL>
<LI>EU governments expressed their "absolute opposition" to US Helms-Burton legislation punishing European for profiting from Cuba. No nation, they said, should unilaterally impose its laws to others. But rather than carry out their threat to ask for a WTO arbitrarian panel on the dispute, ministers appeared to agree to postpone such action until after the US election.<p>
<LI>The Irish presidency reiterated its pledge to have a draft text of the revised Maastricht Treaty ready to give to Dutch officials when they take over the EU presidency. Foreign ministers set 5 October as the date for a mini-summit in Dublin, which Spring said would be an occasion for top-level reflection on IGC matters.<p>
<LI>Led by Belgium, ministers agreed to promote an EU-wide initiative to combat sexual abuse and the exploitation of children. They agreed that their governments would begin work immediately on proposals to be discussed by the EU justice and interior ministers at their informal meeting in Dublin on 27 September. The Commission also said it would present a proposal at that meeting.<p>
</UL>
<p><b>5.	EU/CITIZENS</b></p>
<p>"Grande Place Europe" (http://www.eurplace.org) is a new debate forum on the reform of the European Union now open on Internet. Initiated by seven European organisations with the support of the Commission, the net forum proposes subjects of discussion such as: citizen's rights, the aims of the EU defence policies, the relevance of social politics, the environment, the EU's role on the international scene etc. Contributions to the debate should be sent to: eurit@eurit/it. A special section is reserved for research centres, European associations and schools, which will be given a free WEB page for explaining who they are. Application forms are available from the project coordinator: Centro "Italia Europea", EURIT # Tel: +39 6 397 46 91 # Fax: +39 6 397 46 94.</p>

The Land Is Ours campaign were acting as a canopy for the occupation. Regular open meetings were being held for active people to get involved. A rough agenda was set and a short list of possible sites was narrowed down to one with two more sites situated nearby if that failed.  <P>May 5, was the beginning of the week long planned occupation where a sustainable eco-village with, gardens for growing food, yurts for kitchen and living spaces, compost toilets and roundhouse as a communal space were to be built. All of this following Agenda 21 that was set at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. All of this was to attract the media who would spread the land issues that we were raising to a wider audience.  <P>Being early May there were plenty of activists floating about, with all of the on route evictions completed on the Newbury by-pass, and the Rainbow Centre cleaned out a few months before. In a convoy of coaches, tat lorries, living vehicles, cars and bikes we all set off from Hammersmith into the unknown. One coach was virtually full of eager media peoples all thinking they've got the prime scoop. Upon arrival, a  few of them slipped into the director's chair and tried unsuccessfully to give orders as if it was a soap opera. <IMG SRC="brendan.gif" ALT="Brendans house" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=182 BORDER=0 ALIGN="RIGHT">They had to be reminded that it was really happening! Within the first week a lot had been achieved, more than expected. The media loved it, the locals loved it, everybody loved it. Except of course the land owners Guinness and the Wandsworth Council. Situated in the heart of Tory territory, the eco-village was used as a slander match between the Tories and Labour councillors. Using it as a prop for their wider issues in their little games of power. The local community were generally supportive, and glad to see the land being used productively. Their support and involvement probably enabled us to stay the time we did. Guinness and the Wandsworth Council wanted us off from day 1. They didn't really need this sort of publicity on their doorstep. A much needed green space was provided for the locals to get actively involved. Kids being kids, couldn't keep away. The inquisitiveness drew them like a magnet. gradually their parents would dawdle over to investigate where their kids are spending so much time. And to satisfy their own curiosity, I'm sure. <P>Summer holidays fast approached and the thought of the local kids from the battle-zones of the estates, terrorising the village became a reality. It was easy pickings for the thieves that swarmed us all summer. After a lot of compromising , people being banned, and finally violent clashes, the thieving became minor.<P>The makings of a mish mash community was in motion. Gardens lush with fresh vegetables appeared randomly across the site. The roundhouse stood grand with the kitchen always nearby, as a focal point of the site. Weekly meetings were held here to try and sort out, mainly domestic, issues arising on site. A lot of positive resolutions came of these as did insults, threats of violence until total disruption beyond any chance of continuing.<P>The kitchen was forever buzzing with vegetables being chopped , boxes of organic produce being dropped off from the local wholesalers. The fire was constantly dancing with the regular kettlewatchers sorting out the world's problem on their arses. For odd reasons the kitchen was constantly being altered, relocated until finally being  dismantled and a more permanent wooden structure was built over a weekend.<P>Dwellings constructed of all materials imaginable had sprung up out of nowhere. Some possibly even landing from above. Physically there was a village community catering for the basic needs of the people within. Obviously the heart of the community being the people which consisted of all walks of life.<P>The village could have been a condensed reflection of this consumerism society that we live. There were a lot of problems which were compassionately taken on board. There were times when the atmosphere was really calm and chilled out. Like a small festival in motion. Other times it was total mayhem with violence and drug abuse thriving. The space was there, as a gift from the gods in this urban jungle. People will perceive it how they want to, as we all live in our own reality. and Living vehicles pulled on and off constantly until a limit was set. I don't think there was ever a figure put on the limit. It was a case of pulling on and if a vehicle had recently pulled off then there must have been space. No-one was turned away and everybody was given the opportunity to involve themselves and be a part of the community. At one stage in the height of summer it was like a camping ground. People opting for a bit of fun, adventure or lazy days to escape from the tedious domestic life.<P>Every month or so there was an eviction scare, a tip-off from a source. Usually unknown. On one occasion it was the practical joke of a local kid ringing up saying that the troops were on their way to evict. People swallowed it and went into full panic stations. No questions were asked, not even as to who the caller was. It was all very entertaining to witness. Shortly afterwards all would be forgotten and people got on with what whatever they were doing. The threat of eviction loomed over our heads for nearly 3 months. The owners finally getting their full possession order from the High Court in early August. This didn't seem to deter people from getting on with their living, contributing here and there to the community. The security of our existence there was created by those who wanted to believe it to be. There was always from day 1, the one who would say ,'But you're going to be evicted anyway'. Attached to this was an attitude that would hinder people from trying to make things happen. This is true to an extent, an eviction is imminent. Time is always there and its precious. The more we could establish ourselves and gain positive recognition and support from the local community the greater our chances of staying longer. This was a viewpoint adopted by many.<P>For whatever reasons the sheriff decided to evict, I`II probably never know. The signs were telling and in your face to see. For whatever we were trying to achieve on site it probably never looked that way towards the end of summer. Our local Support was dwindling and complaints arising. The local kids became extinct on site, parents worried about their safety among the violence and drug abuse.<P>Concrete tip-offs were flustering in from all sources. Instinctively I knew that this was the one. It all seemed plausible at that moment. It was a short lived dream that was swamped with the problems that society won't deal with or fail to recognise. This burden became too great and the final straw was placed to break the camel's back.<P>Guinness with all their cronies had planned a finely executed invasion from all directions. Evicting everyone in a few hours and by the end of the day they had transformed a thriving community , surrounded by lush wildlife, into churned up soil and mounds of debris where the houses and other structures once stood. Later this was turned into sawdust until not even a blade of grass existed. An alarmed fence was erected complete with razor wire to simulate a prison camp.<P>Living there, I don't really know what kind of an impact it had on people, our initial aim was to highlight the failure of the current planning system has on peoples access to common land and their exclusion from the decision making  in the planning process. For all it's madness, the village infested itself into people's own dreams. People were healed and healing others. It was like a huge adventure playground for little and big kids, with no rules. A place where people could be and allowed to have fun.                                                                                                         </B></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="#contents"><IMG SRC="tliosep.gif" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=25 BORDER=0 ALT="seperator"></A></P><A HREF="whaapp.html"><H3><IMG SRC="sun.gif" ALT="Wha' 'appen??"

<html><head><title>Transcript of 'Credit Where It's Due'</title></head><body><img  width=156  height=84 alt="[  ONEWORLD ONLINE ]" src="../owo_logos/online_logo.gif"><p><hr><br><font size=+1>The following is the transcript of <b>'Credit Where It's Due'</b>, a television programme made by Word-Pictures in conjunction with Worldview International Foundation.  <br><b>OneWorld Online</b> thanks Arne Fjortoft for his kind permission to broadcast this WIF/Word-Pictures report.</font><hr><p><center><h1>Micro-loans</h1></center>Micro-loans - very small amounts of money, sometimes no more than a few rupees or taka, loaned to people who cannot afford to offer banks property as collateral -  are of key importance in alleviating poverty. <p>The Grameen Banking system was founded by Dr Mohammed Yunus in 1976 to provide micro-loans to poor people excluded by the conventional banking system - which believes, mistakenly, that poor people are bad credit risks. <p>Women, in particular, have been rejected as customers, by bankers who still see women as 'only housewives' - ignoring the enormous value of women's work, not only in the home but also outside it as agricultural and industrial workers.<p>Two decades later, at the <a href="beijing_intro.html#banking">Fourth World Conference for Women</a> in Beijing, there are suggestions that the World Bank is thinking of following in Dr Yunus' footsteps. The Bank is, at last, considering lending amounts of $100 and up, rather than $10,000 and up - and lending to women.<p>It should not be forgotten, however, that - for many people using the Grameen Banking system - $100 is a small fortune rather than a small loan. <p><hr><p><font size=+1><b><i>TITLE SEQUENCE</i></b></font><p><img width=157 height=117 align=right 1vspace 1hspace src="beijing_pix/yunus_face2.gif"><b>Dr Yunus:<ul>What we are trying to do is to demonstrate that <i>the bankers are wrong!</i> All banks should give loans to poor people.  If banks are not doing [that], then new banks should be created so that everybody can take loans. <p>We are demonstrating that poor people can take money, take credit, pay back [at a] 98%-plus repayment rate - which can change their own life. They don't have to depend on anybody. They're not asking for any mercy from anybody. <i>They simply need a fair chance, and fair deal, and justice. </i></b></ul><hr width=50%><p><center><img width=154 height=117 align=left 7vspace 3hspace src="beijing_pix/yunus_credit.gif"><p><font size=+2><b>CREDIT WHERE IT'S DUE </b></font><br><font size=+1>Dr Yunus and the Grameen Bank</font></center><p><br><br><br><br><br><br>Woman's voice:<ul>Bangladesh has some of the richest soils in the world - but most of us can't benefit from that fact. Out of the 100 million people in our country, 60 million of us own no land at all. Just 8% of the families own nearly half the crop-land - and they keep all the profits. <img width=152 height=117 align=right 20vspace 15hspace src="beijing_pix/yunus_landlord.gif">Our families just work the land for them, and they pay us next to nothing. <p>We would prefer to buy land and become independent farmers - but where could we get the credit? If we borrow money from the rich, they force us to repay our debt at impossible times; they're blackmailing us into selling them at a loss everything we own. <p><i>So they end up with everything - and our families with nothing. And the more inequality there is, the more our fate will slide into their hands. </i><p>As for banks! The only time we ever got credit out of a rich man's bank was when Mohammed Yunus came to visit our village, many years ago.</ul><b>Dr Yunus: </b><ul><b>In the beginning I didn't think about [creating a] bank: all I was trying to do was to take a loan from the bank for poor people in the village that I met. <img width=154 height=117 align=left 15vspace 15hspace src="beijing_pix/yunus_young.gif">But the bank was very reluctant.  They thought it was impossible to lend money to poor people. <p>Ultimately, the only way I could find to get this loan was to offer myself as a guarantor.  <p>So I became a guarantor, and took the money from the bank, and gave the money to poor people.  And I took the responsibility of collecting it back, and paying it back to the bank.  And it worked beautifully! <p>That was in 1976. It was working well, so I got very excited and wanted to expand it to give more people similar loans - to show that poor people can take money and pay it back. And they did.</b> <p></ul></ul><img width=152 height=117 align=right 15vspace 15hspace src="beijing_pix/yunus_banking.gif">Woman's voice: <ul>So Dr Yunus began Grameen Banking, which means "village" banking. We're neighbours - we know and trust each other - so we take turns being guarantors for one other, just like Dr Yunus used to. <p>We meet in the village in groups - and now there are Grameen Banks in over 30,000 villages. We, the people of Bangladesh, are solving our credit crisis ourselves.<p></ul><b>Dr Yunus: <ul>The present banking system is not just, because it only lends money to a very privileged group of people, not the people at the bottom.  So this is what we are dramatising, what we are demonstrating - and we are proving that what we are saying is right. <p>It is happening in Bangladesh, it is being done in many other countries with similar results.  So now it will be very difficult for the banking system, the traditional banking system, to ignore what we have been saying.<p></ul></b>Woman's voice: <ul><img width=154 height=117 align=left 15vspace 15hspace src="beijing_pix/yunus_lurking.gif">Women like us are traditionally supposed to live a very secluded life, always inside the house. <br>In some villages, prayers being offered in a mosque would stop  if a woman passed by. And people said that insects would damage the crops in a field that a woman had walked through.<p> So can you imagine women being allowed to go inside a conventional bank? Much less <i>run </i>the bank, like in Grameen!<p></ul><b>Dr Yunus: <ul>My allegation against the existing banking system is that it is basically an anti-women institution: it doesn't lend money to women. <img width=156 height=117 align=right 15vspace 15hspace src="beijing_pix/yunus_woman.gif"> If you take all the borrowers of a bank together, you only find 1% of [those borrowers are] women.<p>So when I began I wanted to make sure that I don't make the same mistake.  So we are trying to achieve an equal number of both men and women. <p>We noticed very remarkable things happening in the families where we lend money to the women.

But given that 97% of the UN's permanent representatives are still male, one should probably not expect too many direct gains for women from this most disunited and chauvinistic of institutions. <p><b>The real value of such UN conferences </b>may lie not in creating, or even initiating, substantial improvements - but as a way of giving recognition to the subtler changes that have been taking place in any case, over many years, in other quarters and largely through non-bureaucratic means. And that global recognition can be valuable. The 1992 Rio Conference, for example, attracted enormous attention worldwide and gave value to the work of environmentalists. <p><b>Recognition gives confidence, just as invisibility undermines it:</b> any person who has been oppressed or disempowered can vouch for that.  Women have more than enough competence; confidence is what they  need - both at an individual and at a cultural level. That is to say, confidence not only to believe in themselves but to be believed in by others.</b><p><b>The Fourth UN Conference on Women is a mirror</b> in which we, the one world community, can see how far women have become visible already - and how far they (we!) still need to go to be seen and heard as clearly as men are. The call for equal rights before the law is therefore, unsurprisingly, a key conference theme. <p><b>Another theme is reproductive rights for women</b> - without which women can never be equal with men. The Conference could do well to re-iterate the gains of the 1994 Cairo Population and Development Conference, where the population hot potato was finally acknowledged to be a matter of human rights and not merely national demographics.<p><b>Economic rights are a third essential theme.</b>Women have for generations been fooled into thinking that owning or earning property - whether land or money - is somehow, mysteriously, 'unfeminine'. By this ruse men have kept the purse-strings in their own hands, bamboozling women into dependence on their goodwill. Even now, conventional banks will often not lend money to women without their husbands' signature - on the assumption that only men, of course, would have access to collateral. <p><p><b>But all this is set to change...  </b> <p><b>Keep checking into OneWorld</b>'s Special Report on Women, where we will be bringing you - over the next few days and weeks - our NGO partners' reports of the conference, as well as video-stills and transcripts showing how things can change, and are changing, for the better.<p><br><center><img width=475 src="../owo_logos/online_logoconferences_line.gif"></center><p></body></html>

<center><h3>IGC: Development NGOs call for a New Agenda for the European Union's
external relations</h3>Press Release of  the Liaison Commitee of Development NGOs to the EU (7 October 1996) </center>
<p>
<hr>
<center><H3>* * Europe is turning its back on the poor of the World * *<P>


* * Launch of An Action Plan for European Leaders * *</H3>
</center><p>

An extraordinary European Summit on the IGC has taken place in Dublin in
order to quicker the pace of the IGC process. The European NGDOs,
represented by James Mackie (Executive Secretary of the Liaison Committee)
and Robin Hanan (President of the Liaison Committee Working Group on the IGC
), were also present in Dublin to launch their Action Plan for European
Leaders. They wanted to insist on the fact that the IGC is providing an
important opportunity to give a new vision and direction to the European
Union's external relations as a whole.
<p>
The Action Plan for European Leaders calls on European leaders to:<p>

SEIZE THIS HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THAT EUROPE TAKES A PROGRESSIVE LEAD IN WORLD AFFAIRS, by working to:
<ul>
<li>develop a global foreign policy which can play a key role in building a
world with greater peace and stability;
<li>take a leading role in changing unjust and undemocratic international
economic and social systems which are a major cause of instability and
conflict;
<li>move away from a view of security that is based on a military and defence-
centred definition;
<li>develop policies and mechanisms which can facilitate the prevention of
conflicts.
</ul><p>
The statement makes proposals to the IGC to include in the Common Provisions
of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the objectives of the Common
Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) the following fundamental objectives for
ALL the external relations of the Union:
<ul>
i) 	the promotion of economically, socially and environmentally sustainable
patterns of development;<br>
ii)	the promotion of economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights
as agreed in international human rights and humanitarian law;<br>
iii)	greater economic and social equity and justice and equality between men
and women.
</ul><p>
In addition, the Action Plan calls for:<ul>
<li>a renewed emphasis on conflict prevention in the CFSP, taking into account
the contribution of women;
<li>respect for human rights as a basic principle of the CFSP;
<li>legally binding mechanisms to control the arms trade;
<li>greater transparency, openness and accountability with respect to civil
society in Europe and in Africa, Asia and Latin America.</ul>
<p>
The Action Plan was initiated by the Liaison Committee of Development NGOs
to the EU, a network representing over 800 NGDOs grouped in National
Platforms in all 15 EU Member States.

<hr>
<B>Introduction</B>
<P>
In the light of the profound changes which have taken
place since 1989 in the developing countries, Europe and Denmark,
the Government decided in 1993 to prepare a new strategy for the
Danish development policy towards the year 2000. 'Me result of
this work is an extensive strategy paper which was presented to
the Folketing (The Danish Parliament) on March 22, 1994. A translation
of the executive <U>summary</U> of this paper is presented below.
<P>
The problems facing the developing countries and
the instability of international relations increased throughout
the 1980s and the early 1990s. At present, the poorest developing
countries have not overcome the econon3ic crisis of the early
1980s, which requires reform and structural change of state controlled
economies and autocratic political systems. For Sub-Saharan Africa
the 1980s were, in most aspects, a lost decade.
<P>
At the same time, the end of the Cold War fundamentally
changed the rules of the game for international co-operation.
The emergence of economically, ethnically and politically unstable
new states has given rise to increased local and regional tensions
- in several cases with far reaching international consequences.
<P>
In addition, considerable economic growth in a number
of developing countries in East Asia along with improved prospects
for countries in South Asia and Latin America have shown that
the course of development can be changed and that it is possible
to break the vicious circle of poverty.
<P>
For the industralized countries these developments
erect new demands for engagement, cooperation and development
assistance. As a growing number of local problems become regional
and global in character, there is an increasing need to face the
challenges - and to face them in partnership with developing countries
and the newly emerged states. Poverty, the environment, population
pressures, migration and local conflicts all stress the importance
of international solidarity and closer international co-operation.
We do have a responsibility to engage in changing the course of
development, not least in Africa, with the aim of turning the
1990s into the decade where the foundation for economic growth
and social equality was established.
<P>
Denmark has, as a small country, a vital interest
in sustaining international co-operation. A social and humanitarian
tradition has given us the experience that enable us to face these
international challenges. Through our membership of the UN, the
European Union and as a Nordic country, we have a strong basis
for a constructive and effective effort.
<P>
Denmark has a long tradition with international development
co-operation. Our experience has shown how difficult it is to
find sustainable solutions to complicated and often deeply rooted
problems of development. In certain instances, development efforts
have let to tangible results. Other efforts, however, never worked
as expected. The quality requirements to our development assistance
are ever growing, and greater efforts are being made to ensure
that the funds of the Danish development assistance are not misused
or diluted into large bureaucracies. We have a commitment to help
the poorest, and we must, for this reason, be certain that the
assistance we give, actually reaches the most vulnerable groups
of the population.
<P>
One precondition for the ability of Danish development
assistance to comply with these high standards is the continuous
adjustment of our policies in accordance with ongoing changes,
both in the countries we are co-operating with, and inside Denmark
herself. Development co-operation can not be static, but must
adapt to the ever changing environment.
<P>
In recent years, we have learned, for one thing,
the lesson that development co-operation must be looked upon in
a broader, foreign policy perspective involving our overall relations
with developing countries. This applies particulary to the questions
of human rights and democracy, women in development, the environment,
trade policies, debt etc.
<P>
During the 1986-88 period, the first strategic planning
process for Danish development assistance was undertaken. The
result of this process was an Action Programme which in 1989 served
as input to a debate in the Folketing from which decisions regarding
future directions of the development assistance were established.
These recommendations have since then, supplemented with subsequent
parliamentary decisions, guided Denmark's development policy.
<P>
The present strategy is written in line with the
main recommendations of 1989 Plan of Action. 'This means, that
the overall objectives of the Danish development assistance will
be maintained in the future. Especially, the principle of an overall
volume of Official Development Assistance (ODA) at one percent
of the Gross National Product persists including an approximately
even distribution between bilateral and multilateral assistance.
<P>
Within this framework the strategy provides a new
orientation and a revised set of guidelines for a dynamic Danish
development policy towards the year 2000.
<P>
The intention of the strategy is not to give an overall
exposition of every aspect of Danish development co-operation.
Instead, the strategy highlights the relevant aspects of the developments
from recent years, which are also expected to be central for our
development policy in the years to come.
<P>
During 1993, two special working groups dealt with
the Danida co-operation with Danish non-government organizations
and with Danish enterprises. The results of this work have been
incorporated into the present strategy.
<P>
Interest in, knowledge of, and collaboration with
developing countries are deeply rooted in the Danish society.
There is, therefore, a strong commitment in the society to development
co-operation. This, in itself, is an important prerequisite for
a Danish development assistance of the highest quality. During
the working process of this strategy, we have drawn on this engagement
and incorporated the knowledge and experience of various interest
groups. Having this in mind, I would like to take this opportunity
to thank the long list of people who contributed - in an essential
and most valuable manner - to the process that has culminated
with this strategy.

<P>
<hr><p><B>1. Background</B>
<P>
Very much has changed in the world over the last
five to six years. Major political balances have shifted, power
blocks have been dissolved and new states have emerged. New growth
centers have developed, trading agreements have been reached and
regional integration processes are increasingly gaining momentum.
<P>
A lot, however, remains the same. Poverty and underdevelopment
still affects large parts of the world and every fifth person
on earth live in absolute poverty. Despite this, there are positive
tendencies in most developing countries. But unless concerted
efforts are made to initiate comprehensive reforms and maintain
a significant level of development assistance, the development
towards the year 2000 indicates a worsening of the situation in
Sub-Saharan Africa.
<P>
Poverty is behind some of the most fundamental problems
of all developing countries in the years ahead. This applies to
well-known problems such as widespread social deprivation, persisting
population growth, environmental degradation at the local, regional
and global level as well as wars and conflicts. It also applies
to more recent problems such as the growth in migration both locally
and globally, increasing ethnic intolerance and fundamentalism,
and the spread of AIDS to large parts of the population in some
of the poorest countries.
<P>
As a small country, Denmark has a vital interest
in expanding international co-operation. A social and humanitarian
tradition has learned us the experience necessary to face these
international challenges. Through our membership of the UN, the
European Union and as a Nordic country, we have a strong basis
for a constructive and effective effort.
<P>
It is against this background that the &quot;Strategy
for Danish Development Policy Towards the Year 2000&quot; has
been drawn up.
<P>
<B>2.</B> <B>The Strategy's Main
Points</B>
<P>
<B>2.1</B> <B>Development Assistance
Policy towards the year 2000</B>
<P>
In recent years a growing recognition of the inverse
relations between some of the problems involved in international
development co-operation has emerged.
<P>
In many developing countries poverty problems, environmental
degradation, over-utihzation of natural resources, poor health
conditions and high population growth rates in combination produce
a negative dynamic. Lack of economic growth in the poorest, mostly
African, countries has weakened the opportunities for sustainable
improvements in the living conditions among the poorest. At the
same time, failure to integrate these groups into the development
process has, in itself, curbed development and economic growth.
A weak administrative capacity, characterized by inadequate and
incompetent leadership, corruption, ethnic conflicts and religious
intolerance, contibute to accentuating the problems.
<P>
In this situation the overall development policy
has to include a variety of instruments. These will range from
political dialogue on democratization and human rights, over well-targeted
assistance progranmes in key sectors, to special programmes aimed
at strengthening the collaboration between organizations and companies
in Denmark and in the developing countries.
<P>
The primary scope of this strategy is to translate
the overall objectives of Denmark's foreign policy and development
co-operation programme into a progressive and cohesive Danish
development policy based on mutually reinforcing components.
<P>
The strategy is conceived with due attention to the
problems of the developing countries and it attempts to identify
areas which are matching, in which Denmark possesses the preconditions
for, and interest in, a qualified effort.
<P>
The strategy is based on five basic principles:
<ol>
<li>Danish development policy encompasses all our
relations with developing countries, economic and political as
well as multilateral and bilateral. The official development assistance
is a central instrument in the development policy.
<P>
<li>The development policy is flexible and must continuously
be adjusted <B>to </B>new international challenges. The ability
to react quickly and coherently to new situations and react effectively
with emergency relief and other efforts is an integral element
of the development policy.
<P>
<li>Danish development co-operation is rooted in the
commitment to combat the poverty affecting large groups of the
population in many developing countries. 'This is done by providing
official development assistance aimed at developing socially balanced
and ecologically sustainable economic growth.
<P>
<li>Danish development assistance is directed towards
the needs of the developing countries. The priorities and conditions
for Denmark's development policy are reflected in the choice of
co-operation countries, organizations and sectors. Furthermore,
they are reflected in the dialogue with the recipient countries
holding responsibility for specific development activities.
<P>
<li>Development co-operation affects large parts of
the society - both in Denmark and in the recipient countries.
Voluntary and professional organizations, business and industry,
research institutions and public sector institutions comprise
a resource base, that makes qualified diversified Danish assistance
efforts possible. Non-governental actors therefore, must be actively
involved in the formulation, organization and implementation of
Danish assistance efforts.
</ol><P>
<B>2.2</B> <B>The General Perspective
of the Strategy</B>
<P>
Danish development policy is an integral part of
Danish foreign policy, in which the main objectives are: promotion
of common security, the promotion of democratic government and
human rights, the creation of economic and social development
and ensuring ecologically sustainable development The following
objectives have been laid down for Denmark's official development
assistance:
<P>
&quot;The objective of Denmark's official development
assistance to developing countries is through co-operation with
governments and public authorities in these countries to assist
endeavours aimed at achieving economic growth, thereby contributing
to ensuring social progress and political independence, in accordance
with the aims and principles of the United
<P>
Nations Charter and, in addition, through cultural
co-operation to promote "mutual understanding and solidarity."
<P>
Against this background, the overall perspective
of the Strategy for Danish Development Policy Towards the Year
2000 will be to assist developing countries in their efforts to
achieve sustainable development based on the improvement in living
conditions through socially balanced economic growth and with
respect for political independence. Equal and free opportunities
for the individual, in accordance with the aims and principles
of the United Nations Charter, and, in addition, to promote mutual
understanding and solidarity through cultural co-operation.
<P>
The efforts of Danish development assistance will
be organized to promote:
<ul>
<li>production, a socially balanced economic growth
and social justice;
<li>the development of human resources;
<li>pluralistic civil societies and respect for the
individual;
<li>the protection of the global environment and sustainable
exploitation of natural resources;
<li>global and regional co-operation, as well as
<li>cultural co-operation and understanding between
peoples.</ul>
<P>
Fulfillment of these goals will be conditional on
development activities showing due consideration to the respective
contributions of both women and men, together with the utilization
of development assistance in a mutual relationship between bilateral
and multilateral efforts.
<P>
<B>2.3.</B> <B>Poverty Orientation</B>
<P>
Poverty orientation constitutes a fundamental principle
for Danish development assistance.
<P>
The poverty alleviation strategy for Danish official
development assistance may be condensed into three main points:
<ul>
<li>the promotion of sustainable and socially balanced
economic growth;
<li>the development of the social sector, including
the promotion of education and health services as prerequisites
to the development of human resources;
<li>promoting Popular Participation in the development
process, the development of a society based on the rule of law
and good governance as prerequisites to stability and economic,
social and political progress.
</ul><P>
In the weakest countries, the problem of poverty
can only be resolved if the efforts of individual countries are
supported by official development assistance from a range of donor
countries. Denmark will Participate in and contribute to this
co-operation, and will, at the same time, continue its efforts
aimed at increasing the overall volume of official development
assistance of other industrialized countries in accordance with
the established UN targets.
<P>
The implementation of the general poverty alleviation
strategy in the Programme countries will be an integral component
of the formulation of country strategies and will appear explicitly
in these.
<P>
The formulation of specific poverty strategies will
be based on the preconditions prevailing in the individual recipient
country, thus varying from country to country.
<P>
<B>2.4. Cross-cutting themes</B>
<P>
A number of cross-cutting themes will be pursued at all levels within the assistance programme. In addition to
poverty alleviation three such themes have been identified: The
role Of women in development, environment and Promotion Of good
governance and human rights. is that they constitute aspects of
assistance common to all these areas while at the same time act as independent development
assistance areas.
<P>
In most developing countries, women play a critical
role in development. Not only as producers but also as bearers
Of social responsibility and bringing up the next generation.
Danish development assistance emphasizes <B>strengthening of the
role of </B>women in <B>the development process </B>In spite of
concerted efforts over many years, aimed at improving the situation
of women in developing countries, the results are few and scattered.
The global picture continues to show major differences in men's
and women's opportunities and living conditions within almost
all sectors.
<P>
In connection with specific development assistance
efforts, gender aspects will be analyzed. At the same time plans
and goals will be formulated with a view to improving the situation
of women in developing countries and promoting their involvement
in the development process.
<P>
At the operational level emphasis will be placed
on identifying specific goals for women's involvement in the development
process. In the preparation of policy papers, check lists and
other simple aids, steps will be taken to assure full integration
of women's interests throughout the project-cycle.
<P>
In relation to the environment, work will be carried
out at local, national, regional and global levels. To promote
sustainable development in the Danish programme countries, Denmark
will intensify efforts to incorporate the recommendations of the
Rio-conference (UNCED) into Danish development policy. In addition,
Denmark will ensure that environmental aspects are fully incorporated
into Denmark's poverty oriented development assistance.
<P>
Environment Impact Assessments will be undertaken
in all relevant development activities and institutions promoting
sustainable use of natural resources.
<p>
At the same time, Denmark will contribute to strengthening environmental protection and collaboration at regional
and global levels, i.e. by
<UL>
<li>creating incentives for individual developing countries
to engage in the formulation and implementation of regional and
global environmental agreements and programmes;
<li>committing financial and professional assistance
to regional environmental institutions, and
<li>implementing technical environmental studies and
pilot projects in programme countries.</ul>
<P>
The promotion of <B>democratization and human rights
</B>constitutes the last cross-cutting theme. The improvement
of human rights based on respect for <B>the </B>individual is
a goal in itself. It contributes - together with popular participation
in the decision-making processes - to the development of a stable
society.
<P>
Practical assistance to specific human rights and
good governance activities in developing countries will be supported
at all levels. Particular emphasis will be placed on creating
positive incentives for development <B>towards </B>democratic
government and respect for human rights.
<P>
A close and open dialogue with recipient countries
on economic, social, professional and political questions is an
integral part of Danish development co-operation.
<P>
This dialogue will also include questions on the
advancement of human rights and popular participation in the development
process. Continued violation of human rights and lack of interest
within the programme countries to enter into a dialogue on these
issues will be reflected in the extent and character of Danish
development assistance.
<P>
<B>2.5</B> <B>Bilateral Assistance</B>
<P>
The strategy provides for a further concentration
of Danish bilateral assistance efforts.
<P>
Danish development assistance will be concentrating
on fewer countries, and at the country level, on fewer sectors.
<P>
Bilateral development co-operation will concentrate
on activities in 20 programme countries. In connection with the
phasing in and out of programme countries, however, bilateral
co-operation may be extended to a total of 25 countries.
<p>
Due to Denmark's limited human and financial
resources, both bilateral and multilateral assistance will be
utilized selectively and in areas where Denmark has good prerequisites
to contribute.
<p>
Assistance to programme countries can, based
on the individual country's particular circumstances, embrace
all sectors and types of assistance.
<P>
A country strategy will be drawn up for each programme
country. This strategy will be updated on a regular basis.
<P>
Traditional project assistance will, to the widest
possible extent, be <B>concentrated </B>within selected sectors
or sub-sectors. The financial and human resource investments required
to conduct a qualified dialogue with recipient countries make
it essential that our efforts in individual programme countries
are concentrated in a <B>limited number of sectors.</B>
<P>
<B>Collaboration sectors </B>will in individual
countries be selected in accordance with the needs of the recipient
country. Within <B>this </B>framework emphasis will be placed
on areas where the Danish resource base has a strong basis for
supporting and implementing <B>the </B>assistance efforts.
<P>
Assistance within a sector will, to the extent
possible, take the form of <B>sector programme assistance, </B>which
will include broadly based assistance to activities within a given
sector or sub-sector. For example, education and training, running
costs, maintenance and new investment, as well as in the form
of budget assistance.
<P>
At the same time, a portion of Danish governmental
development assistance will continue to be contributed as <B>programme
assistance </B>in the future. This is done to support the implementation
of balanced structural adjustment programmes and to promote economic
growth in countries committed to the implementation of necessary
adjustments. A comparatively large portion of programme assistance
will, within a few years, be contributed in the form of <B>debt
relief.</B>
<P>
Besides activities to promote democratization and
human rights, it will be possible, to a limited extent, to continue
the implementation of innovative <B>projects, </B>outside predetermined
sectors. These projects must be of limited duration and be capable
of establishing a model for similar bilateral activities.
<P>
To ensure sustainability of individual development
activities, assistance will be arranged taking account of <B>the
</B>broad sectoral perspective and in <B>committed co-operation
</B>with the recipient country, which will take overall responsibility
for the <B>activities implemented.</B>
<P>
The changed emphasis of Danish development assistance
efforts implies increased assistance to <B>capacity building </B>in
institutions in recipient countries responsible for sectoral planning,
administration, budget and auditing.
<P>
Increased emphasis on capacity building and increased
local responsibility will be followed up by the gradual reorientation
of <B>personnel assistance. </B>To improve sustainability increased
emphasis will be placed on local advisers supported by short-term
consultants.
<P>
As part of <B>the </B>country strategy process
special efforts will be made to expose areas, where <B>Danish
advisers </B>can participate to promote improved utilization of
local resources in the planning and implementation stages of development
assistance projects.
<P>
Overall, efforts will be made to concentrate bilateral
assistance in the following assistance forms:
<ul>
<li><B>General Programme Assistance, </B>in
the form of balance of payments assistance, in kind assistance,
debt relief, and the like, to support broader socioeconomic reforms.
<li><B>Sector Programme Assistance, to </B>support
developments and reforms within a limited number of sectors or
sub-sectors, for example, within the health service.
<li><B>Project Assistance, </B>which
in the case of pro e co-operation countries will be limited to
minor projects, that are obviously newly created and can act as a model for
similar activities. In addition, projects which, in all developing
countries, can render assistance to the promotion of the democratization
process and human rights. Added to this is the Danish Associated
Financing scheme.
<li><B>Personnel Assistance, </B>is to be reorganized with greater utilization of local advisers and
the short-term deployment of Danish consultants.
<li>Sector programme assistance, assistance towards running
costs, more local responsibility and increased utilization of
local advisers will imply changed conditions for the achievement
of <B>immediate and visible results </B>of assistance, and for
the direct control with local use of Danish funds. A possible
short-term decline in effectiveness and visible results must be
expected to be counterbalanced by development activities becoming
more sustainable with the improved local anchoring. Therefore
they will become more effective, in the final analysis, compared
to projects implemented by posted experts who cannot achieve the
same level of local anchorage.</ul>
<P>
Recipient countries' increased responsibility and
involvement in the preparation and implementation of development
assistance will be followed up by reinforced efforts to <B>strengthen
institutions </B>in recipient countries, responsible for budgeting,
accounts and expenditure control. This strengthening of local control and auditing will be balanced by a reduction
in the direct control of Danish officials on Danish financed activities.
<P>
To strengthen the <B>administration and control
</B>of development assistance, top Priority will be given to assisting
central administrations and local authorities in recipient countries.
For example in the form of institution building, support to increasing
administrative and organisational efficiency as well as strengthening
<B>of </B>auditing and control organs.
<P>
At the same time access to <B>inspection and auditing
</B>of Danish supported programmes will be maintained. This will
also signify to authorities in recipient countries that abuse
of Danish development assistance resources will result in consequences
for the future of development assistance co-operation.
<P>
Besides Programme co-operation countries, bilateral
assistance will be confined to special areas: assistance <B>to
</B>Promote democratization and human rights, associated financing
and transitional assistance. Bilateral assistance will also be
awarded under the terms of the new Special International Environmental
and Catastrophe Facility.
<P>
Assistance to Promote <B>democratization and human
rights </B>will be awarded to a broader selection of developing
countries in accordance with prevailing income limits.
<P>
<B>Associated Financing </B>will only be awarded
to countries with a GNP of less than 2,160 US$ per capita.
<P>
Provisional <B>transitional assistance </B>will be
awarded to create or recreate preconditions for economic and social
development in countries which are undergoing basic social restructuring,
usually in connection with the termination of armed conflict or
transition from a centrally controlled economy to a market based
economic system. Transitional assistance will be awarded for a
limited period and will be used selectively. Assistance will predominantly
comprise product supply, assistance to multilateral programmes
or programmes implemented by non-governmental development organizations,
supplemented by bilateral democratic efforts. cf section 3.2.2.
<P>
In addition, <B>Danish non-governmental development
organizations </B>can engage in assistance in a wide range of
countries and sectors according to their own specific priorities.
<P>
<B>Regional assistance </B>will only include bilateral
and multilateral assistance to interstate or non-governmental
regional institutions and organizations, as well as assistance
to regionally oriented activities in Programme countries. This
implies that bilateral governmental assistance activities outside
programme countries, which formerly comprised Part of the bilateral
regional programme, will be phased out. Bilateral co-operation
outside programme countries will only occur to the extent it is
estimated as reasonable in relation to the administrative costs
associated therewith.
<P>
<B>2.6 Multilateral Assistance</B>
<P>
The <B>fairly equal division </B>of Danish development assistance between Multilateral and bilateral assistance is maintained.
<P>
The Danish contribution to multilateral assistance
will concentrate, to a greater extent, on activity areas highly
Prioritised by Denmark. It will to a lesser degree be based on
the contribution levels within the individual organizations.
<P>
During the preparation of multilateral assistance
emphasis will be placed on <B>prioritizing and concentrating </B>policy
and Professional efforts, both between organizations and within
individual Organizations. At the same time, attempts will be made
to Promote co-operation and clear division of work between the
multilateral organizations involved,
<P>
TOP Priority areas will be assisted through intergovernmental
or nongovernmental Organizations, which - on a case-by-case basis
- are estimated to be in the best Position to administer development
assistance to the areas concerned. Consideration of Denmark's
<B>relative </B>size compared to other donors and <B>the load
division principle </B>will not be decisive in the allocation
of multilateral assistance.
<P>
Efforts to secure <B>Danish appointments </B>to
international organizations will be reinforced.
<P>
In the UN, Denmark will actively contribute to
the development of new <B>operational assistance </B>types, that
can form part of the civil component of UN peace keeping and conflict
preventive efforts.
<P>
In relation to development policy, Denmark will
co-operate within the framework of <B>the European </B>Union.
This will include a contribution to drawing up common development
policies and assistance through the development of a more cohesive
EU policy towards the developing countries, encompassing development
assistance and foreign policy, as well as trade, environment and
agriculture policy areas.
<P>
Denmark will work to maintain <B>Africa in focus
</B>also in terms of European development assistance efforts.
<P>
In relation to dialogue with the World Bank and
other international financial institutions on the formulation
of <B>structural adjustment programmes, </B>Denmark will attempt
to ensure that combating <B>poverty </B>and protecting especially
vulnerable groups, comprise an integral element of the banks'
activities, and that they are broadly anchored in recipient countries.
<P>
As a follow-up to the World Bank's and other multilateral
donors' work in Danish programme countries, and to contribute
to a <B>strengthened dialogue </B>between recipient countries
and multilateral donors, especially in relation to structural
adjustment programmes, initiatives will be taken in 1994 to hold
a number of regional symposiums. The participants will be experts
and decision makers from both Danish programme countries and multilateral
organizations.
<P>
One or more <B>trust funds </B>will be established
with The Global Environmental Facility and/or the World Bank with
a view to <B>co-financing </B>activities within high priority
assistance areas, that are comprised in the organizations' ordinary
project portfolios.
<P>
In addition, a number of <B>strategic funds and
contributions </B>will be established <B>to </B>assist the development
<B>of </B>multilateral organizations' work within high priority
areas. Earmarking Danish contributions will also be employed in
relation <B>to </B>assistance to increase the effectiveness and
reform endeavours of individual organizations.
<P>
Compared to present levels, the extent of <B>multi-
bilateral co-operation </B>with multilateral agencies will be
reduced. In the future multi- bilateral arrangements will be concentrated,
to a greater degree, on those organizations and sectors where
experience has proved positive.
<P>
The new <B>Special International Environment and
Catastrophe Facility </B>means that, in the long-term, a proportional
increase in catastrophe relief, financed under development assistance
arrangements, is not expected. In the coming years however, a
certain increase is expected as part of the more development oriented
and broad-spectrum emergency relief efforts.
<P>
<B>2.7 Crisis Efforts</B>
<P>
Efforts will be stepped up to safeguard the essential
relationship between short-term emergency relief efforts and long-term
development assistance, by, among other methods, the utilization of various
forms of <B>restructuring assistance.</B>
<P>
In relation to crisis situations of a more permanent
character there will, to the greatest possible extent, be a conversion
of efforts from traditional short-term emergency relief comprising
supplies from outside, to a more <B>broad-spectrum </B>assistance,
which as far as possible is based on social structures in the
recipient country.
<P>
Options available to relief organizations to develop
emergency relief Programmes in the <B>grey areas, </B>between
emergency relief and more long-term assistance will be expanded.
<P>
In close co-operation with authorities involved
and private emergency relief organizations, a new initiative will
be taken to establish an &quot;international <B>humanitarian capacity&quot;,
</B>comprised of volunteers from various professional groups,
who, on a short notice, can be deployed in support of Danish or
international relief efforts.
<P>
To avoid that longer term crisis efforts in non-programme
countries developing into small, semi permanent assistance programmes,
individual efforts will be organized in such a way that they do
not require a permanent Danish presence over and above emergency
relief and restructuring assistance for a <B>limited period.</B>
<P>
A survey will be initiated, in co-operation with
Private emergency relief organizations and Danish industry, to
determine the steps that can be taken to engage Danish business
and industry and increase the volume of <B>Danish supplies </B>in
connection with international relief efforts.
<P>
<B>2.8 Thematic Priority Areas</B>
<P>
The strategy aims at strengthening Danish efforts
on three thematic priority areas: population, trade and debt relief
<P>
 As part of upgrading Danish efforts in the <B>population
area </B>a sector strategy will be formulated on this topic in
1994.
<P>
The strategy will focus on activities of assistance
which aim at strengthening the women's and the families' possibilities
of <B>choosing </B>the number of children they want as well as
their spacing.
<P>
In the area of <B>trade policy </B>Danish efforts
will include: the promotion of greater cohesion in EU's development
policy and EU's trade and agricultural policies. In relevant trade
policy fora, Denmark will contribute to breaking down barriers
that hamper developing countries' exports of manufactured products
and thereby counteract diversification of their production systems.
In addition, efforts will be made to increase the integration
of developing countries in the international trading system.
<P>
Through development assistance Programmes Denmark
will support the <B>internationalization </B>Of developing countries'
enterprises. In addition, training programmes and education in
business and commerce, which contribute to the promotion of internationalization
of business and industry, will be granted.
<P>
In the area of <B>debt relief </B>Danish efforts
will include:
<ul>
<li>when the need arises, supplementary contributions
to <B>multilateral arrangements, </B>which aim at helping Denmark's
programme countries repay and service debt to multilateral financing
institutions, of which Denmark is a member, and
<li>in instances where a Programme country is heavily
burdened with debt to multilateral institutions, of which Denmark
is a member, to award <B>bilateral contributions </B>towards interest
payments and reimbursements, possibly including total repayment.</ul>
<P>
<B>2.9 Co-operation with the Resource Base</B>
<P>
The strategy recommends a closer co-operation between
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the many elements of Danish
society, that in various ways co-operate with developing countries.
Provision is also made for strengthening the co-operation between
various non-state actors.
<P>
Intensified co-operation with the <B>resource base
</B>implies that interested parties from business and industry
and development organizations, as well as other parts of the Danish
resource base, will be involved in the formulation of new <B>country
strategies.</B>
<P>
In relation to the formulation of strategy agreements
with Denmark's programme countries, provisions have been made
for additional efforts to develop and strengthen partnership initiatives
or <B>&quot;twinning arrangements&quot;. </B>Where such partnership
arrangements open a perspective for broader participation and
establishment of co-operation relations between the professional
environment and institutions in programme countries and Denmark,
the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively encourage
the involvement of those institutions and professional groups,
with particular prerequisites for such involvement.
<P>
<B>3. The strategy's Implementation and Follow-up</B>
<P>
Denmark has formulated an ambitious goal for its
development policy. Relative to the needs of developing countries
and the overall economic relations between industrial and developing
countries, Danish development assistance is - still - very limited
in quantitative terms. This makes it difficult to establish a
direct causal linkage between development policy goals and the
effects of Danish development efforts.
<P>
<B>Evaluating </B>the direct
and indirect effects of individual activities and programmes,
fully or partly financed by Denmark, will therefore be the most
important instrument in evaluating the annual fulfilment of development
policy objectives.
<P>
Implementation of the strategy's main elements
will be the subject of <B>overall assessment in 1997.</B>
<P>
Global distribution <B>and utilization of Denmark's
bilateral assistance must </B>comply with a number <B>of broad
spectrum objectives. </B>These goals will apply globally over
a number <B>of years, but not necessarily for </B>individual programme
co-operation countries, <B>or in specific years.</B>
<P>
The strategy is reflected in the rolling-five-year-plans
which will include comprehensive analysis of the strategy's implementation
status, beginning in 1996.
<P>
Within the framework of the overall development policy
a number of priority areas will be selected in relation to <B>multilateral
co-operation. </B>At the mid-term review of the strategy implementation
in 1997, it will be established to which extent these priority
areas, in practice, have been managed, taking into account:
<ul>
<li>the distribution of multilateral assistance between
organizations, utilization of the administrative resources of
the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs in <B>the </B>process of
continuous follow-up of co-operation with multilateral organizations,
and
<li>the establishment of and resource injection to
strategic, goal-directed funds in individual multilateral organizations.
<li>the evaluation of the increased involvement of
the Danish Resource Base in assistance co-operation must begin
by determining whether or not the quality of Danish assistance
efforts has been strengthened. Moreover, the effect will depend
on the quality of country strategies and sector assistance programmes,
that will bear bilateral assistance, and which will be formulated
in dialogue with the Danish resource base.</ul>

<P>
<B>1. BURMA</B>
<P>
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on Thursday afternoon
which calls for economic sanctions against Burma. The motion on
the political situation and human rights abuses in Burma welcomes
recent decisions of Carlsberg and Heineken to withdraw all investments
from Burma.
<P>
The motion also calls on the European Council to respond in full
to Aung San Suu Kyi's request that the EU implements economic
sanctions against the SLORC with the establishment of a trade
boycott, the cessation of tourism and the withdrawal of investment
in Burma by European Companies. Aung San Suu Kyi specifically
addressed the EP through a video, taped in Rangoon last week,
and smuggled out of the country by the Burma Center of the Netherlands.
The Burmese people will not suffer from economic sanctions, she
said.
<P>
At the General Affairs Council  of the 15 July, the Ministers
criticised Burma's government for suppressing democracy movements
there, but did not agree to Danish demands for sanctions against
Rangoon. EU governments said they did not want to impose sanctions
on Burma without UN backing.
<P>
Forty-six organisations based in thirteen European countries and
in the United States of America call today for economic sanctions
against Burma. The organisations endorse a petition in support
of the motion for a resolution by the European Parliament. A number
of member organisations from Eurostep, Aprodev and Euro-Cidse
have signed this petition.
<P>
On 24 July, a small demonstration will be held in front of the
Parliament Building at 8h30. Afterwards, the Burma group will
present the case at the Development Committee of the European
Parliament. The purpose of this meeting is to provide the Committee
with information and analysis of current political and economic
developments. After the meeting a press conference has been organised.
A follow-up meeting will be held at Eurostep from 14h00 to 18h00
on the European strategy with all NGOs who will be there.
<P>
<B>2. RULES OF PROCEDURES </B>
<P>
The European Parliament finally adopted this week the new rules
concerning the MEP's financial interests and the conduct for lobbyist.
<P>
The new rules aim to close the loopholes in the present arrangements
for the Parliament's 626 MEPs.
<P>
In future they will have to make a personal, detailed declaration
of their professional activities, any other paid functions or
activities and financial or staff support they receive from anywhere
except the Parliament. Nonetheless, they do not have to say how
much they earn. These details will be kept in a register, which
will be updated annually and open to the public.
<P>
In future, lobbyist will have to sign a register and comply with
a code of conduct in exchange for a pass granting them regular
access to MEPs and assistants. The code will be drawn up by the
Parliament's rules committee after the summer holidays.
<P>
The code is expected to take as its starting point the guidelines
which the institution's quaestors already require regular visitors
to respect. That 13-point set of instructions is directed at embassies,
consulates, representations of states and regions, commercial
organisations and public affairs practitioners dealing with EU
institutions.
<P>
As MEPs continue to bring more transparency into their own dealings,
they are also facing demands to clarify the status of their assistants,
many of whom live in Belgium in a legal twilight.
<P>
<B>3. CFSP</B>
<P>
The European Parliament, for which the external perception of
CFSP could be improved by giving a single Commissioner all competencies
in matters of external action, deplores the fact that the Commission
had presented no proposal for joint action to the Council, and
stresses the importance that the Commission should exercise its
right of initiative in the field. As for the Council, the EP regrets
that it had had insufficient recourse to the instruments provided
for by the Treaty as regards the role of Parliament in CFSP as
well as criticising the &quot;apparent confusion&quot; in the
use of common positions and joint actions. The EP therefore calls
on the Council to inform it regularly on developments in CFSP
and to consult it as a preventative measure on common positions
and joint actions that it intends adopting.
<P>
The Union is growing in size and in its institutions, Gay Mitchel,
Minister of State, observed on behalf of the Irish Presidency.
Its role as regards external relations is much greater that was
the case for the other presidencies, he observed. CFSP has to
evolve too and <I>Member States have vote to design CFSP institutions
to suit any foreign viewpoint, but to suit the evolution of the
Union</I>. In this context, the Union has to consider security
in its wider sense, including for example the fight against drugs.
Neutral countries would have a role to play in this context. The
WEU Treaty expires in 1998, but there needs to be exploration
of the role neutral countries could have within its framework:
the institutions have to show imagination.
<P>
Next Monday, 22 July, the negotiators of the CFSP will meet in
Brussels, and the Irish Presidency will bring new proposals on
the table.
<P>
Speaking for the Commission, Hans van den Broek, noted a &quot;dire
need&quot; for action, for instruments and political will.
<P>
<B>3. EU/ASEAN</B>
<P>
The European Commission is hoping to widen the Union's links with
Asia by moving quickly to reinforce ties with India and Pakistan.
<P>
External Relations Commissioner, Manuel Marin, will visit Pakistan
on 20 July before heading for Indonesia to hold talks with foreign
ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
Brief visits to Malaysia and Thailand will follow.
<P>
Before leaving for Pakistan, Marin said he wanted to expand the
Euro-Asia dialogue by either inviting India and Pakistan to the
London summit or by creating a separate &quot;political platform&quot;
for relations between Europe and South Asia.
<P>
Seeking to smooth ruffled feathers in Pakistan for example, Marin
says that instead of looking at negative measures such as sanctions,
he hopes to cooperate with Islamabad on eliminating child labour.
<P>
Unless South Asian countries made faster progress in developing
closer regional ties, said Marin, they could not secure a region-to-region
dialogue with Europe. But he promised that bilateral ties with
individual countries would be strengthened.

<B>4. PETER BASTOGI</B>
<P>
Despite that Peter is still in hospital, he is recovering slowly
but surely from his meningitis. He will probably come out next
week.

<B>5. PAF HOLIDAYS</B>
<P>
The PAF will have some rest and reappear again at the beginning
of September. We wish you all a  wonderful holiday.<HR>

<P>
<B>1. <I>EUROSTEP </I>FISHERIES CAMPAIGN</B> 
<P>
The Eurostep fisheries campaign was officially launched on 28
May with a very successful demonstration in front of the Council.
The Senegalese delegation, with representatives from Novib and
the Eurostep Secretariat, met the Italian Chairman of the Development
Council, spoke in front of the Development Committee at the European
Parliament, and met MEPs and officials from the DGXIV and DGVIII.
They presented their case as well as the report of a study on
the EU Fisheries policy with the West African countries, particularly
Senegal.
<P>
<B>2. FISHERIES</B> 
<P>
The European Commission is calling for a 40% reduction in fishing
activity in the Northwest Atlantic where certain fish stocks risk
being completely exhausted. The Commission has identified five
categories of fishing, one of which contain the concluded agreements
on stocks. These involve resources in third country and international
waters (beyond 200-mile limit).
<P>
<B>3. DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL - 28 MAY</B> 
<P>
The Development Council under the Presidency of Mr. Rino Serri,
Italian Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, adopted a settlement
and three common positions, UK blocking of conclusions or political
resolutions.
<UL>
<LI>The Council formally adopted the regulation on humanitarian
aid. This will provide a legal base for the activities of ECHO
which have developed to a very large extent (about MECU 750 in
1995). It also assigns clear objectives and general criteria for
humanitarian aid. It sets the procedures for implementation of
humanitarian actions conducted in co-operation with NGOs and aid
programmes financed by the Community.
<LI>The Council approved its &quot;common positions&quot; on the
3 regulations from &quot;Latin American and Asian LDCs&quot;,
&quot;fight against AIDS&quot; and &quot;environment and sustainable
development&quot;. For these three items, the UK delegation did
not bring into play its reserve in principle, arguing that the
qualified majority applied (in reality unanimity was required,
the Council having amended the Commission proposal on the controversial
item of comitology, without its agreement).
<LI>Links between emergency aid, aid to rehabilitation and long-term
development. A broad consensus was reached on the need for a link
between these three aspects of development aid which presupposes
that NGOs be involved in development action, even beyond emergency
situations.
<LI>Environmental impact assessment of development projects and
programmes. The Council held a political discussion on this subject
but did not adopt a resolution
<LI>Follow-up to Horizon 2000 resolution. The Council discussed:
a) operation coordination in the light of experience gained on
the ground, without adopting conclusions, still because of British
reservations. b) coherence between development policy and the
other Community policies at the request of the Danish delegation.
<LI>Decentralised cooperation. The Council held a discussion and
will approve conclusions as soon as possible.
<LI>Migration and development. The Council discussed the links
between certain forms of assistance to poor countries and the
increase in migratory flows.
<LI>Conflict prevention in Africa. The Council showed itself to
be largely in favour of the Commission's approach that recommends
an overall and voluntarist approach that integrates early prevention
of violent conflicts in the EU's policy for development cooperation.
</UL>

<P>
<B>The Great Lakes Region; the chocolate directive</B> 
<P>
During lunch, the ministers discussed the situation in the African
Great Lakes Region in order to draw up a first report. They expressed
their concern - notably about the situation in Burundi - and welcomed
the work accomplished by EU envoy, Mr. Ajello, whose mandate will
certainly be extended. They also expressed their support for UN
and OAU initiatives in favour of peace, and stressed that the
Union is willing to give maximum aid (whether emergency aid or
participation in reconstruction effort after peace is restored).
The cease-fire in Burundi and the creation of a control mechanism
for the movement of weapons remain, however, in the minister's
opinion, essential conditions for national reconciliation, the
establishment of lasting peace and the deployment of effective
humanitarian aid.
<P>
At the request of different delegations, the Council also tackled
the question of modifying the chocolate directive. Belgium, supported
by France, Spain and the Netherlands, stressed the need to take
into account the interests of LDC cocoa producers.
<P>
<B>4. GREAT LAKES REGION</B> 
<P>
European Commission President, Jacques Santer, and Development
Commissioner, Joao de Deus Pinheiro met former United States President
Jimmy Carter in Brussels for an exchange of views on the situation
in the Great Lakes region of Africa. Mr. Carter explained his
initiative aiming to bring about a negotiated settlement of the
conflicts in the region and said he would continue to work to
make the EU more directly involved in the peace process. The goal
is to organise a summit of the Heads of State of Rwanda, Burundi,
Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire with the participation of the EU, the
UN and the OAU. He also launched the idea of establishing a demilitarised
zone in Zaire along the border with Burundi and Rwanda to help
combat arms trafficking and to accelerate the return of refugees.
President Mobutu recently showed a positive interest in the idea.
<P>
<B>5. BURMA</B> 
<P>
The question of Burma was raised at the Development Committee
of the EP by Mrs Kinnock, PES,UK on 28 May. A representative for
the Commission said that despite the problematic incidents that
have occurred in Burma, the European Union would not break its
dialogue with the country. On the contrary, his feeling was that
the European Union would increase the dialogue with Burma as it
did after Tiananmen with China. Mrs Kinnock replied that this
was not necessarily the best example to give.
<P>
As far as economic sanctions were concerned, the representative
of the Commission doubted whether it was a good idea and questioned
whether all 15 countries of the Union would agree on that point.
<P>
On 30 May Mrs Kinnock asked for the situation in Burma to be discussed
at the meeting of the Development Committee in July (22-24 July)
for two or three hours.
<P>
It was agreed it would be one of the items on the agenda.
<P>
The British government has vetoed the EU statement on current
events in Burma. Contrary to statements from Dutch government
officials over last week-end, the blocked statement was not published
last Friday in Rome. The European Union has therefore not commented
on the crisis in Burma. Great Britain has come with its own statement,
followed by Germany and Denmark.

<TR><TD><B>After meeting at the Hammersmith Unemployed Workers' Centre at 10 o'clock on Sunday the 5th of May 1996 the campaigners were given a <a href="happen.html">leaflet</a>.  Then a convoy consisting of two coaches full of campaigners, tat lorries and travellers left for the first planned site.  After successfully claiming the land the coaches returned to collect everyone else and the location of the site was publically released.
<P>
Work started as soon as people arrived at about 10:30 Sunday morning.  Between then and Sunday afternoon the reception, the kitchen, a peat bog toilet, pathways, and more had been constructed by many willing hands.
<P>
A spokesperson for The Land Is Ours (George Monbiot) spoke to the local police immediately after arriving at the site.  The police stated that the occupation was a civil matter and not crimimal and this means that the matter didn't involve the police it was just between the occupiers and the land owners, Guinness.  Guinness portray themselves as being concerned with the environment which we felt would be good news for us.
<P>
<IMG SRC="oct.gif" ALT="Octavia's" WIDTH=282 HEIGHT=162 BORDER=0 ALIGN="RIGHT">The local residents and shop owners were given a <a href="locleaf.html">leaflet</a> about the occupation. They were asked to take part in a survey which asked them what they thought of the occupation and the future use of the land.  Most of the residents are not opposed to the occupation as they do not agree with future plans to build a Safeways superstore on the site which they feel would increase traffic on an already over-busy road.
<P>
<IMG SRC="kitch.gif" ALT="Kitchen" WIDTH=282 HEIGHT=189 BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT">A health and environment inspector from Wandsworth Council found no fault with the site when he visited it on Wednesday the 8th.  Saturday the 11th was an open day at the occupation and hundreds of local people attended our meeting and showed their support.  Lots of activities were put on and a similar day was planned for Sunday the 12th.
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
An "Order by Consent" was asked for, which meant that people would be allowed to stay until Guinness finally decide to use and develop the land which will not be in the near future.  It looked promising that they would agree but unfortunately they refused the order on Monday the 13th.
<P>
George Monbiot was summoned to court on Wednesday the 15th of May.</B>

<html><head><title>ODI - Briefing Paper 4/94</title><!!keys: ODI+apartheid+racism+South Africa></head><body><h3>APARTHEID'S LEGACY OF POVERTY</h3><hr>For generations, institutionalised racism - for the last 50 years through the vicious system of apartheid or separate development - and economic policies favouring the white minority interacted to form an economy characterised by serious structural weaknesses and a deep divide between the affluence of a privileged few alongside the extensive poverty and social deprivation of the majority. <p>The apartheid system also discouraged the systematic collection of key social and economic data, especially those relating to the black majority; thus, the accuracy of key economic statistics remains seriously in doubt. This presents the incoming government with problems in designing social and economic programmes for the new South Africa. It also means that the poverty data available are only approximate.<p>Today, South Africa is inhabited by about 40 million people. According to the racial classification used in the census, some 76% of the population are categorised as black, 13% as white, 8.5% as coloured, and 2.5% as Asian. Around 8% of the population, the vast majority of them white, account for 90% of personally-owned wealth. In contrast, between 30% and 50% of the population, almost all of whom are black, live below the poverty line. <p>A quarter of blacks live in what were termed the 'independent homelands' of Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, Transkei and Venda, another third in the so-called 'non-independent homelands', comprising Gazankulu, KaNgwane, KwaNdebele, Kwazulu, Lebowa and QwaQwa. The remaining 42% live mainly in townships on the outskirts of the major metropolitan areas, their number swelling daily with rural migrants. One third of black urban households have incomes below the minimum income level, but the ratio rises to some 83% of households in the 'homelands'. <p>The apartheid system controlled not only where people lived but their every movement (through the infamous pass laws). Almost 2 million blacks officially designated as 'homeland' residents are migrant workers. An additional three quarters of a million people commute daily to work, often taking many hours to travel. About one third of all formally employed black men live apart from their families. <p>In aggregate, it is estimated that<p><ul><li>one in four blacks in South Africa live in squatter camps or crude temporary housing;<br><li>over 40% of blacks have no access to clean water; - about 50% of blacks are illiterate and one in four children are not in school; and<br><li>only some 10% of rural blacks have access to basic sanitation, and only 5% have access to electricity.<br><li>poverty afflicts proportionately more women and girls than men and boys.</ul><p>In the 15 year period to 1992, state spending on black education has risen by 15% a year, compared with increases of 9% for coloureds and only 3% for whites. Yet, today, the poorest 50% of the population still receive only about one fifth of total state spending on education, health, housing and social welfare. 30% of state spending on secondary schooling, 65% of state spending on university education, and 75% of capital expenditure on tertiary education goes to whites.<hr>Briefing Papers present objective information on important development issues.

Development Co-operation Review of Austria<br>Summary and Conclusions<P>
<i>OECD Development Assistance Committee</i><p></h3>
<h5>March 1996<br>

</center><p>
<hr>
Since the last review of the Austrian aid programme by the Development
Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD in 1993, the Austrian aid
administration has introduced several changes intended to make
the programme more coherent and efficient. These changes included
a reduction in the number of priority countries, the beginning
of sector and country programming, the nomination of local/regional
aid coordinators and new rules for relations with nongovernmental
organisations (NGOs) which implement the bulk of bilateral technical
assistance. Another important change involves Austria's membership
in the European Union (EU). This membership affects the volume,
composition, coordination and other aspects of the overall Austrian
programme.
<P>
The impact of the changes introduced by the Department of Development
Cooperation (DDC) in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is, however,
greatly limited by the small share of official development assistance
(ODA)  less than 15 per cent  for which the DDC is responsible.
Responsibility for Austrian ODA is distributed over a number of
ministries and there is a need for more and improved interministerial
coordination. Austria does not have a clear overall strategy to
guide its development cooperation. The ThreeYear Programme of
Austrian development cooperation (which is updated annually) in
effect binds only the small part of ODA administered by the DDC.
Consequently, any positive initiative taken by the DDC can be
offset by actions in other parts of the aid programme and such
instances have occurred.
<P>
The ThreeYear Programme is not discussed in Parliament and the
report on development cooperation, which has to be submitted to
Parliament every three years, appears to receive little attention.
Development assistance has apparently sunk only limited roots
in Austrian politics and public opinion. Development NGOs, which
try to drum up support, do not have a sufficiently broad base.
By contrast, there appears to be relatively strong support in
public opinion and political circles for humanitarian assistance
and for assisting the transformation of Central and Eastern Europe.
<P>
The aggregate volume and financial terms of Austrian aid have
improved in recent years, but its composition and targeting have
continued to raise serious questions. The increase of Austrian
ODA claims in recent years exceeded by far the DAC average, with
the result that in 1994 Austrian ODA in relation to gross national
product (GNP) (0.33 per cent) exceeded the DAC average  a change
facilitated by a decline of the DAC average to 0.30 per cent.
On the other hand, Austria's ODA/GNP ratio is still well below
the average for EU members.
<P>
In relation to GNP, Austria has been the leading donor to the
Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) and the New Independent
States of the former Soviet Union (NIS). Until 1993 it was also
one of the largest donors in absolute amounts. Austria's total
aid effort for developing and Eastern European countries is far
above the average of OECD/DAC countries.
<P>
Since 1992 Austrian ODA commitments have been in compliance with
the DAC recommendation on terms, but the share of tied aid has
remained high.
<P>
The Austrian programme has continued to be characterised by a
high share of components for which development considerations
are not the prime motivation. These claims are for aid for refugees
in Austria, imputed costs for developing country students in Austria
and official concessional export credits. The combined share of
these components  which had declined in 1992 and 1993  exceeded
half of ODA disbursements in 1994. There is no doubt that Austria
has for many years assumed a heavy burden with regard to refugees
and is one of the most generous OECD countries in this respect.
At the same time the ODA share claimed for refugee costs in Austria
is four times the DAC average, and the reporting of this expenditure
is probably not entirely in conformity with DAC rules. The reporting
of imputed costs for developing countries students in Austria
also requires review. As to concessional export credits, development
considerations are not the main motive for their extension. A
much stronger involvement of the DDC in the selection and screening
of these credits and their integration into sector and country
programming could strengthen the development linkage.
<P>
Austrian payments to the European Community aid programmes resulted
in an increase in the total volume of aid in 1995. However, this
increase in multilateral aid was at the expense of a small reduction
in DDC
<P>
administered assistance. It appears possible that Austria's EU
membership and its related reordering of the country's ODA could
provide a welcome opportunity to review the composition and reporting
of Austrian ODA and to pursue more vigorously improvements in
various areas, including country programming, policy dialogue,
aid coordination and evaluation.
<P>
With a view to increasing effectiveness and coherence, and in
line with recommendations at earlier DAC reviews, the aid administration
has reduced the number of priority countries for Austrian aid
from nineteen to eight. Most of the remaining former priority
countries have been designated &quot;cooperation countries&quot;.
Both groups of recipient countries are now located in five subregions.
However, since DDC administers only a small share of ODA none
of the priority countries are among the major recipients of Austrian
aid. Concessional export credits and refugee support claims have
a far greater impact on the geographic distribution. Former Yugoslavia
(i.e. Bosnia) has, therefore, been the largest recipient, followed
by Algeria, China and Thailand. Poland has been by far the largest
recipient among CEECs due to debt relief.
<P>
Realising that with the limited volume of its aid, Austria can
only be a &quot;niche donor&quot;, DDC now clearly intends to
concentrate its aid not only geographically but also on sectors
where Austria possesses a comparative advantage. Until now the
sectoral distribution has remained widely dispersed. Education,
transport, energy and manufacturing have been the sectors obtaining
the largest commitments. Debt relief made up a large share in
1993/94 and is likely to remain important in the coming years.
<P>
Nongovernmental organisations occupy a special and important position
in the Austrian aid programme since they initiate and implement
a large share of bilateral technical assistance. This situation
is the result of there being no official agency for the implementation
of Austria's bilateral aid. Since many NGOs raise little or no
funds of their own they rely mainly or exclusively on official
funds and in some respects resemble subsidiary organs of the public
administration in spite of their different legal status. While
in the past NGOs could carry out their activities in many countries
and sectors, they are now under increasing pressure from DDC to
orient their activities towards priority countries and sectors.
As implementing agencies for official aid, the DDC wants the NGOs
to be guided by its sector and country programming. The number
of NGOinitiated projects is declining in favour of projects proposed
by the administration. These changes have created tension since
the NGOs want to be treated as equal partners rather than as implementing
agencies. NGOs also complain about stricter control by the DDC
over their activities and late commitment and payment of funds.
Budget reductions, late payments and a strict application of Austrian
budget rules indeed created serious problems for NGOs in 1995,
and this is likely to be repeated in 1996. While certain changes
and reforms are necessary in the relationship between the administration
and NGOs, there is also a need to maintain a fruitful dialogue
and mutual trust.
<P>
Austria attaches great importance to the protection of the environment
and its declared policy is that all its development cooperation
projects should be environmentally sustainable. Thus the administration
has sponsored assessment of the environmental impact of DDC projects.
Austria initiated a threeyear programme (1993/9S) for the protection
and conservation of rain forests, and its agricultural, tourism
and other projects have a strong environmental component. Almost
all agricultural projects are directed to environmentally friendly
bigagriculture.
<P>
Gender issues are officially considered a priority issue, but
practical measures in this area are still limited. Projects are
not systematically assessed from a gender point of view, and there
are few genderspecific projects. Austria supports relatively few
projects in the fields of human rights and democracy  most are
related to electoral assistance, legal training, resettlement
and reintegration of refugees. The Austrian Government has stated
its belief that starvation and extreme poverty are the most serious
violation of human rights.
<P>
Regarding poverty alleviation, no guidelines have been drawn up
to date and no assessment of poverty reduction programmes has
been made. Relevant activities in the programme involve land and
agricultural reforms to promote equitable distribution of resources
and means of production and integrated rural development schemes.
<P>
The effectiveness and efficiency of Austrian aid is impaired by
the lack of a strategy covering the whole aid programme, the distribution
of responsibility over many ministries, the large number of implementing
agencies and the dispersion of aid over many countries and sectors.
The repeated transfer of DDC between the Federal Chancellery (Prime
Minister's Office) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and its
small staff have also been handicaps. Certain measures taken in
recent years  which are mentioned in the first paragraph  should,
however, lead to improvement. The move towards sector and country
programmes instead of the many isolated projects is particularly
welcome. A first country programme was finalised in 1993. These
programmes, discussed and agreed upon with the partner country,
state the objectives and planned cooperation over a threeyear
period. Being aware of its limited resources and its role as a
&quot;niche donor&quot; Austria intends to concentrate its aid
on small and mediumsized recipient countries and on two or three
sectors per country where it possesses a comparative advantage.
The rising number of local aid coordinators should facilitate
and accelerate this process, and permit Austria's participation
in local aid coordination. The DDC has also carried out a certain
number of midterm evaluations  but no <I>ex post</I> evaluations
 and the Division responsible has submitted proposals to improve
the feedback of &quot;lessons learned&quot;.
<P>
This review suggests that further improvements and a more coherent
development cooperation programme for Austria would be facilitated
by the following measures:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The articulation of a basic policy by the Federal Government
which would be binding for all components of the aid programme.</li>
<P>
<li>A concentration of most aid activities under a single administration
and a single minister. In particular, the aid administration should
have the appropriate responsibility for those concessional export
credits which are reported as ODA loans to ensure their conformity
with aid policy orientations as well as their integration with
technical assistance.</li>
<P>
<li>Additional staff for the aid administration.</li>
<P>
<li>Clear rules for the selection of implementing agencies and competition
among them for contracts.</li>
<P>
<li>A reform and activation of the Advisory Board for Development
Cooperation and of interministerial coordination.</li>
<P>
<li>The submission of an annual report on development cooperation
to the Austrian Parliament, followed by an appropriate debate.</li></ul>

<P>
Die weltpolitischen und weltwirtschaftlichen Ver&auml;nderungen,
der Beitritt &Ouml;sterreichs zur Europ&auml;ischen Union, die
technologischen Entwicklungen und das zunehmende Bewu&szlig;tsein
vom globalen Charakter vieler Probleme haben neue Rahmenbedingungen
geschaffen, die ad&auml;quate Konsequenzen in der Forschung ebenso
wie in der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit erfordern.
<P>
Die Arbeitstagung wird sich mit der Analyse der derzeitigen Situation
der &ouml;sterreichischen Forschung mit Partnern in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern
und den gegebenen Defiziten und Barrieren befassen. Davon ausgehend,
sollen konkrete inhaltliche, organisatorische und finanzielle
Voraussetzung sowie Kriterien f&uuml;r die Verbesserung der Zusammenarbeit,
auch im Rahmen von EU-Projekten, definiert werden.
<P>
Ziel dieser Arbeitstagung, die sich vor allem auch als Teil der
inner&ouml;sterreichischen Vorbereitung auf die vom 11. bis 14.
September 1996 in Wien stattfindende VIII. EADI Generalkonferenz
versteht, ist die Ausarbeitung von umsetzbaren Empfehlungen f&uuml;r
ein tragf&auml;higes Fundament eines immer wichtiger werdenden
Bereichs - in der Forschungspolitik ebenso wie in der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit.

<a name=glo></a><h3>Globalisierung, Interdisziplinearit&auml;t, supranationale Zusammenarbeit: Neue Herausforderungen f&uuml;r die Forschungs- und Entwicklungspolitik</h3>
<I>Erfahrungen aus den Niederlanden</I>
<P>
<B>Brigitte M. Holzner</B>
<P>
Die K&uuml;rze der mir vorgegebenen Zeit erm&ouml;glicht es nicht,
auf die umfassenden Themen der Globalisierung, Interdisziplinearit&auml;t
und supranationalen Zusammenarbeit ausf&uuml;hrlich einzugehen.
Hingegen werde ich einige Themen dieser drei Bereiche nennen,
die f&uuml;r den Kontext der Forschungs- und Entwicklungspolitik
relevant sind. Der Schwerpunkt meines Referates liegt auf den
Erfahrungen in den Niederlanden, wobei ich mich auf die Institutionen
konzentrieren werde, die den Ausf&uuml;hrungsrahmen der Forschungs-
und Entwicklungspolitik gestalten. Am Schlu&szlig; werde ich auf
einige Perspektiven f&uuml;r &Ouml;sterreich eingehen, wie sie
mir aufgrund meiner 14-j&auml;hrigen Erfahrung in verschiedenen
T&auml;tigkeiten der Forschungs- und Entwicklungspraxis innerhalb
niederl&auml;ndischer Institutionen (staatliche und nichtstaatliche,
Universit&auml;ten) wichtig erscheinen. 
<P>
<B>Globalisierung, Interdisziplinearit&auml;t, supranationale
Zusammenarbeit</B>
<P>
Das Schlagwort der Globalisierung versucht seit dem Fall des 'Eisernen
Vorhangs' und der rapiden Verbreitung der elektronischen Informationsvermittlung,
die &ouml;konomische und politische Entwicklung der Gegenwart
zu erfassen. Mit einiger Skepsis kann man sich fragen, ob 'Globalisierung'
erst in den neunziger Jahren dieses Jahrhunderts auftritt, oder
nicht schon ein jahrtausendealtes Ph&auml;nomen ist. Aus historischer
Sicht sind die Verbreitung des Bew&auml;sserungsreisbaus vor 2000
Jahren oder die Islamisierung beginnend im 8. Jahrhundert auch
globale Prozesse. 
<P>
Die Entwicklung globaler M&auml;rkte jedoch ist ein unwidersprochenes
Ph&auml;nomen der letzten zehn bis 20 Jahre. Transnationale Betriebe
freuen sich auf die 400 Millionen potentiellen Konsumenten in
der ehemaligen Einflu&szlig;sph&auml;re der Sowjetunion und auf
eine Milliarde Chinesen, die einen h&ouml;heren Lebensstil anstreben.
Parallel dazu ist Armut auch ein globales, wachsendes Problem
geworden. Ebenso ist die Rolle der Vereinten Nationen eine globale
geworden im Hinblick auf die brisanten Themen unserer Zeit, wie
sie auf den Mammutkonferenzen der UNO besprochen wurden (Umweltschutz,
Menschenrechte, Sozialpolitik, Frauenpolitik, Habitat). Jedoch
bestehen neben der Globalisierung von Markt und Politik auch starke
Tendenzen zu einer Regionalisierung, um Einseitigkeiten entgegenwirken
zu k&ouml;nnen und eine regionale Hegemonie in &ouml;konomischer
und politischer Sicht bewahren oder schaffen zu k&ouml;nnen. Die
St&auml;rkung der Europ&auml;ischen Union ist ja auch eine regionale
Antwort auf globalisierende Kr&auml;fte.
<P>
Einige aktuelle globale Themen f&uuml;r Forschung und Entwicklung
liegen in den Bereichen der neuen Arbeitsbeziehungen und Akkumulationsstrategien,
der Konfliktforschung, sozialen Entwicklung und des Umweltschutzes.
Diese Themen k&ouml;nnen nur interdisziplin&auml;r erforscht werden,
wie auch deren Praxis (in der Entwicklungspolitik wie in der nationalen
und regional &uuml;bergreifenden Politik) einen <I>interdisziplin&auml;ren</I><B>
</B>Ansatz verlangt. Am Thema Umweltschutz wird deutlich, da&szlig;
nur das Zusammenspiel von technischen Disziplinen, &Ouml;konomie
und Sozialwissenschaften die Analyse und L&ouml;sung von Problemen
erm&ouml;glicht. 
<P>
Die supranationale Zusammenarbeit der Forschungs- und Entwicklungspolitik
findet gro&szlig;teils auf den Universit&auml;ten und Forschungsinstituten
statt; allerdings spielen auch NGOs und Regierungsorganisationen
eine gro&szlig;e Rolle: die letzteren bei der Wahl der Forschungsthemen,
die ersteren in der Ausf&uuml;hrung. Manche NGOs favorisieren
Handlungsforschung (<I>action-oriented research</I>), teils aus
ideologischen, teils aus praktischen Gr&uuml;nden, und kombinieren
dabei sozialwissenschaftliche und techno-logische Ans&auml;tze.
<P>
Neben den interdisziplin&auml;ren und supranationalen Bedingungen
in der Forschungs- und Entwicklungspolitik sind folgende Ver&auml;nderungen
auf einer internationalen Konferenz signalisiert worden:
<P>
<ul>
<li>von 'reiner' Forschung zum Ausbau von Forschungskapazit&auml;ten
<P>
<li>von kurz- und mittelfristigen zu langfristigen F&ouml;rderungsprogrammen
<P>
<li>von Unterst&uuml;tzung von Projekten zur Unterst&uuml;tzung
von Programmen und Sektoren
<P>
<li>von institutioneller Unterst&uuml;tzung zur Unterst&uuml;tzung
von spezifischen Forschungsgruppen.</ul>
<P>
Diesen Ver&auml;nderungen liegen &Uuml;berlegungen zur Wirtschaftlichkeit
und Nachhaltigkeit zugrunde, die die Finanzierungsprobleme in
den Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern, aber auch die K&uuml;rzungen in
den Entwicklungsbudgets bei den Donoren widerspiegeln.
<P>
<b>Forschungs- und Entwicklungspolitik in den Niederlanden</b>
<P>
Die Forschungs- und Entwicklungspolitik in den Niederlanden basiert
auf drei Pfeilern:
<P>
<ol>
<li>auf der Entwicklung von einigen wissenschaftlichen <I>Disziplinen</I><B>
</B>(zum Beispiel Ethnologie, Nicht-Westliche Soziologie, tropische
Forstwirtschaft), Bibliotheken, Archiven und Museen;
<P>
<li>auf einer starken <I>Dritte-Welt-Bewegung</I><B> </B>mit unz&auml;hligen
Solidarit&auml;tsgruppen, die eine starke Bewu&szlig;tseinsbildung
der Bev&ouml;lkerung reflektieren und weiter ausbauen;
<P>
<li>auf einer weitgehenden <I>Institutionalisierung</I>.</ol>
<P>
Die jahrzehntelange Tradition von einigen wissenschaftlichen Disziplinen
und das 'expansive' Bewu&szlig;tsein weiter Bev&ouml;lkerungskreise
h&auml;ngen - meiner Meinung nach - sehr mit dem holl&auml;ndischen
Kolonialismus zusammen, der auch die Forschungs- und Entwicklungspolitik
gepr&auml;gt hat und noch immer pr&auml;gt und zu einer breiten
Struktur von Institutionen gef&uuml;hrt hat. Diese Tradition kann
zwar die Ursache f&uuml;r diese weitgehende Institutionalisierung
sein, aber die Kolonialerfahrung braucht nicht als Bedingung gesehen
zu werden, um gute Forschungs- und Entwicklungspolitik zu machen.
Die eingangs genannten globalen, interdisziplin&auml;ren Themen
sind auch ohne Imperialismusgeschichte in &Uuml;bersee zu analysieren.
<P>
<b>Institutionalisierung</b>
<P>
Die folgenden Institutionen sind die S&auml;ulen der Forschungs-
und Entwicklungspolitik in den Niederlanden: 
<P>
a) Ministerium f&uuml;r Internationale Zusammenarbeit ( = Direktorat
General im Au&szlig;enministerium; abgek&uuml;rzt DGIS)
<P>
b) Ministerium f&uuml;r Unterricht, Kultur und Wissenschaft
<P>
c) Nicht-Regierungsinstitutionen (NGOs) 
<P>
d) Consultancyb&uuml;ros und -betriebe 
<P>
Das Personal all dieser Institutionen wird an den Universit&auml;ten
ausgebildet und wechselt sp&auml;ter oft von einer dieser Institution
in die andere (zum Beispiel von einer NGO ins Ministerium). Da
die universit&auml;re Ausbildung meistens Praktika in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern
verlangt, werden Studenten schon fr&uuml;h mit der Realit&auml;t
und den Problemen von Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern konfrontiert.
<P>
<I>ad a) Ministerium f&uuml;r Internationale Zusammenarbeit</I>
<P>
Die Regierungspolitik wurde unter dem jetzigen Minister Jan Pronk
in zwei umfassenden Dokumenten (&quot;A World in Difference&quot;
und &quot;A World in Dispute&quot;) dargelegt, an denen mehrere
Wissenschafter mitgearbeitet haben. Thematische Schwerpunkt-programme
sind Armutsbek&auml;mpfung, Frauen und Umwelt. Zu einer Reihe
von Themen, wie Kleinkredite oder Family Planning und reproduktive
Gesundheitsf&uuml;rsorge, wurden <I>policy papers </I>ausgearbeitet,
die dem Parlament vorgestellt wurden und als Richtlinien f&uuml;r
die niederl&auml;ndische Entwicklungspraxis dienen. Au&szlig;erdem
wurden DAC-Kriterien f&uuml;r gef&ouml;rderte L&auml;nder, vor
allem das Armutskriterium, festgelegt. 
<P>
Das Forschungs- und Entwicklungsprogramm von DGIS hat folgende
Schwerpunkte mit mehrj&auml;hrigen, multidisziplin&auml;ren <I>Forschungsprogrammen</I>:
Kleinindustrie, Energie-forschung, internationale &ouml;konomische
und strukturelle Fragen. Das Programm hat eine 'bottom-up', Nachfrage
orientierte Philosophie: Die Entwicklungsl&auml;nder m&uuml;ssen
selbst ihre Forschungsinteressen angeben. Dies hat jedoch zu einiger
Polemik an den holl&auml;ndischen Universit&auml;ten gef&uuml;hrt.
Weiters gibt es ein Programm f&uuml;r Interuniversit&auml;re Zusammenarbeit
(MHO), das von der NUFFIC administriert wird. Themen sind zum
Beispiel Farming Systems Research oder das Southeast Asian Plants
Inventory.
<P>
Folgende Institutionen werden vom Au&szlig;enministerium/DGIS
gef&ouml;rdert:
<P>
<ul>
<li><B>RAWOO </B>(Advisory Council for Scientific Development
Research): ber&auml;t den Minister; Vortragsserien, Publikationen
<P>
<li><B>NCDO </B>(National Commission for Development
Cooperation): Der Staat unterst&uuml;tzt die Zivilgesellschaft
durch Bewu&szlig;twerdungsaktivit&auml;ten (zum Beispiel Jungbauern,
Frauenbewegung, Gewerkschaften, Schulen, TV-Programme; Zeitschriften
'Onze Wereld', 'Internationale Samenwerking')
<P>
<li><B>NUFFIC<I> </I></B>(Netherlands Organisation
for International Cooperation in Higher Education): konzeptualisiert
und begleitet mit 180 Mitarbeitern die Programme zur internationalen
Bildungsf&ouml;rderung (Projekte, Stipendien).
<P>
<li><B>FMO<I> </I></B>(Netherlands Development Finance
Company): vergibt Investitionsgelder f&uuml;r Betriebe in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern,
wird teilweise vom Staat finanziert.</ul>
<P>
<I>ad b) Ministerium f&uuml;r Unterricht, Kultur und Wissenschaft</I>
<P>
An den 13 Universit&auml;ten<B> </B>werden Diplomstudien und zunehmend
internationale Programme (M.Sc., MBA, M.A. etc.) f&uuml;r inl&auml;ndische
und ausl&auml;ndische Studenten angeboten. Auch die Fachhochschulen
'internationalisieren' ihre Ausbildungsprogramme durch <I>Professional
Master</I> Kurse. In vielen Programmen sind Praktika in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern
in der Ausbildung eingebaut, oft als Pflichtf&auml;cher. So wird
vom Fachbereich Methoden &amp; Techniken der Ethnologie/Nicht-Westlichen
Soziologie in Leiden erst ein Praktikum im Inland (mehrw&ouml;chige
Studien in einem Dorf), dann ein halbes Jahr im Ausland (Kreta,
Senegal oder Indonesien) vorgeschrieben.
<P>
Auf den <I>internationalen<B> </B>Markt</I> sind f&uuml;nf <I>Ausbildungsinstitutionen</I>
ausgerichtet:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Institute of Social Studies (ISS) in Den Haag, 
<P>
<li>International Institute for Aerospace Survey &amp; Earth Sciences
(ITC) in Enschede, 
<P>
<li>Institute for Housing and Urban Studies (IHS) in Rotterdam,
<P>
<li>Institute for Hydraulic and Environmental Engineering (IHE)
in Delft und die 
<P>
<li>Maastricht School of Management (MSM).</ul>
<P>
Seit einigen Jahren bestehen sogenannte <I>Forschungsschulen</I>
(Research Schools) f&uuml;r Promotionen , die interuniversit&auml;r
und interdisziplin&auml;r aufgebaut sind. Zwei Beispiele, die
f&uuml;r unser Thema besonders relevant sind, habe ich ausgew&auml;hlt:
<P>
<I>CERES Research School for Resource Studies for Development</I>,
wo interdisziplin&auml;r zwischen Agronomie, Sozial- und Geisteswissenschaften
zusammengearbeitet wird. Interdisziplin&auml;r zusammengesetzte
Forschungsgruppen sind beispielsweise: Natural Resource Management:
Social Insecurity and Cultural Coping; Knowledge, Technology,
Material Artefacts and Agroecological Development, State Formation
and Disintegration; Violence, Informality and Ethnicity; Culture,
Religion and Identity Formation.
<P>
<I>CNWS Research School for Asian, African and Amerindian Studies</I>,
die mit Literatur, Sozial- und Geisteswissenschaften zusammenarbeitet.
Beispiele f&uuml;r Forschungs-gruppen sind 'Recht und Gesellschaft';
'Geschichte der europ&auml;ischen Expansion und ihre Folgen';
'Kunst und materielle Kultur in der nicht-westlichen Welt'; 'Interkulturelle
Genderstudien'; 'Kultur und Entwicklung in Afrika'; 'Politische
und &ouml;konomische Ver&auml;nderungen und die Dynamik afrikanischer
Kulturen'.
<P>
Au&szlig;erhalb der Research Schools finanziert die Stiftung f&uuml;r
Niederl&auml;ndische Wissen-schaftliche Forschung (NWO) Promotionen
und Forschungsprojekte, zum Beispiel &uuml;ber Islamische Heilkunst
in Holland oder &uuml;ber Transformationsprozesse in Osteuropa.
Zuletzt erm&ouml;glicht die Stiftung Tropenforschung (WOTRO) Stipendien
f&uuml;r Themen, wie beispielsweise 'Arbeiterinnen in der Zigarettenindustrie
in Java'. Weiters finanziert die K&ouml;nigliche Akademie der
Wissenschaften (KNAW) interuniversit&auml;re, internationale Forschungszusammenarbeit.
<P>
<I>ad c) NGOs </I>
<P>
In den Niederlanden gibt es eine Reihe von NGOs, die angewandte
Forschung im Rahmen ihrer Entwicklungsprojekte betreiben, wobei
sie f&uuml;r spezialisierte Aufgaben kurzfristige Auftr&auml;ge
an Universit&auml;ten vergeben. Diese NGOs sind teilweise ideologisch
ausgerichtet und werden von DGIS und durch Spenden finanziert.
Die vier gro&szlig;en NGOs, sogenannte Kofinanzierungsinstitutionen,
sind NOVIB (sozialdemokratisch), HIVOS (humanistisch), ICCO (protestantisch)
und CEBEMO-BILANCE (katholisch). Weiters gibt es die &auml;u&szlig;erst
einflu&szlig;reiche SNV (Stichting Nederlandse Vrijwilligers),
eine Volont&auml;rorganisation, die mittlerweile sehr professionell
arbeitet. Schlie&szlig;lich ist noch das traditionsreiche KIT
(K&ouml;nigliches Tropeninstitut) zu nennen, das in Amsterdam
eine Reihe von Trainingsprogrammen anbietet und zudem Projekte
in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern unterh&auml;lt.
<P>
<I>ad d) Consultancyb&uuml;ros und -betriebe</I>
<P>
Schlie&szlig;lich geh&ouml;ren zu den Akteuren der internationalen
Zusammenarbeit noch die profit-orientierten Consultancyb&uuml;ros,
die von DGIS, der Europ&auml;ischen Union, UN-Organisationen,
World Bank, Development Banks usw. Auftr&auml;ge bekommen. Die
dort ausgef&uuml;hrte Forschung ist policy-orientiert; die Publikationen
bleiben meistens im 'grauen Sektor' h&auml;ngen und finden selten
den Weg in wissenschaftliche Zeitschriften.
<P>
<b>Basis der interuniversit&auml;ren, internationalen Zusammenarbeit
</b>
<P>
Die interuniversit&auml;re, internationale Forschungszusammenarbeit
basiert auf den
<P>
<ul>
<li>Netzwerken der Wissenschafter,
<P>
<li>Beziehungen aus der kolonialen und post-kolonialen Geschichte
(Studienkollegen, Bekanntschaften, Familien und Personen mit aus
ihrer Biographie erkl&auml;rbaren Motivationen),
<P>
<li>Alumni-Netzwerken (gef&ouml;rdert durch Auffrischungskurse,
Alumni-Zeitschriften: Praktikapl&auml;tze werden vergeben, lokale
Counterparts f&uuml;r Forschung, Lehre und Consultancy, Hilfe
bei der Suche nach Stipendien und Posten)
<P>
<li>regional spezialisierte Studienzentren (zum Beispiel Lateinamerika-,
Afrikastudienzentrum, Internationales Institut f&uuml;r Asienstudien).
<P>
<li>Forschungsschulen,
<P>
<li>Stipendienprogrammen.</ul>
<P>
Der Dreiheit Lehre, Forschung und gesellschaftliche Dienstleistung
wird auf diese Weise Kontinuit&auml;t garantiert.
<P>
<b>Perspektiven f&uuml;r &Ouml;sterreich</b>
<P>
Was w&auml;re der &quot;&Ouml;tzi&quot;, der ein Paradebeispiel
der supranationalen, interdisziplin&auml;ren Forschung ist, der
Entwicklungspolitik? Die &ouml;sterreichischen Perspektiven der
Forschungs- und Entwicklungspolitik k&ouml;nnten sich - nach meiner
Einsch&auml;tzung - auf folgende M&ouml;glichkeiten ausrichten:
<P>
Mit einer internationalen/globalen Perspektive werden <I>existierende
Strukturen</I> der 'regionalen' Zusammenarbeit, wie sie zum Beispiel
durch das Erasmus-Programm vorgegeben werden, relevant. Ebenso
wichtig ist der Anschlu&szlig; und Ausbau der EU- und UN-Verbindungen,
der akademischen Netzwerke wie auch der historisch begr&uuml;ndbaren
Verbindungen in Mittel- und Osteuropa (CEEC). Jedoch kann meiner
Ansicht nach eine regionale Begrenzung auf CEEC auch zu einem
intellektuellen Provinzialismus f&uuml;hren. Die Impulse aus den
Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern, wo gro&szlig;e Kreativit&auml;t und
Dynamik besteht, werfen immer wieder neue Fragen auf, mit denen
Studenten und Dozenten konfrontiert werden sollen.
<P>
Interdisziplinearit&auml;t ist wichtig, um international <I>aktuelle
Themen</I> mit einer globalen oder regionalen eventuell vergleichbaren
Problematik zu erforschen. Zus&auml;tzlich erscheint es angebracht,
da&szlig; sich &Ouml;sterreich auf einige<I> Nischenthemen</I>
spezialisiert, in denen bereits auf viel analytische Kapazit&auml;t
und eine gute Reputation verwiesen werden kann (zum Beispiel Umwelttechnik,
Tourismus, Metallurgie, Geologie, Bergbauernforschung).
<P>
Die <I>Integration von Lehre und Forschung</I>, d.h. ein auch
international ausgerichtetes Lehrprogramm auf Hochschul- und Fachhochschulniveau,
kombiniert mit einer Reihe von Fragestellungen, die auch durch
die Studenten untersucht werden, bietet gegenseitige Impulse zur
Weiterentwicklung. Au&szlig;erdem kann durch ein Kursprogramm,
das sich auf den 'Entwicklungsmarkt' ausrichtet, ein Teil der
Kosten wieder zur&uuml;ckflie&szlig;en. In den letzten Jahren
zeigte sich die Tendenz, da&szlig; kurze Kurse bevorzugt werden,
da weniger Geld f&uuml;r M.A./Ph.D. Programme zur Verf&uuml;gung
stehen und Angestellte von Firmen oder staatlichen Organisationen
nicht zu lange ihre Posten verlassen k&ouml;nnen. Das impliziert,
da&szlig; f&uuml;r einen 'Senior-Staff' Weiterbildungs-m&ouml;glichkeiten
kreiert werden m&uuml;ssen. Solche Kurse haben einen starken Praxisbezug
und bieten Chancen zur angewandten Forschung.
<H2><U>Voraussetzungen</U></H2>
<P>
F&uuml;r eine breitere, global orientierte und interdisziplin&auml;r
ausgef&uuml;hrte Forschungs- und Entwicklungspolitik sehe ich
- in bezug auf die Erfahrungen aus den Niederlanden - folgende
Voraussetzungen als wichtig an.
<P>
<ul>
<li><I>Gesellschaftliche Verankerung:</I> Engagement und Interesse
(Rolle von einer 'NCDO' wie in Holland; Kirche, Museen, Festivals,
Publikationen);
<P>
<li><I>Institutionalisierung</I> (Ministerien, Botschaften,
Universit&auml;ten, NGOs, Betriebe)
<P>
<li><I>Finanzierung:</I> durch den Staat, die Wirtschaft, Bev&ouml;lkerung,
internationale Institutionen (EU, Weltbank etc.);
<P>
<li><I>Profilierung:</I> Spezialisierung auf bestimmte Inhalte
und Methoden;
<P>
<li><I>Rolle der Universit&auml;ten</I> in Lehre und Forschung
ist ausschlaggebend f&uuml;r die Bildung von Kapazit&auml;ten,
f&uuml;r Reflexion und Kritik &uuml;ber Entwicklungspolitik.</ul>
<P>
Auch kleine L&auml;nder k&ouml;nnen ambitioniert sein gem&auml;&szlig;
der durch die NUFFIC gebrauchten Devise: <B>&quot;Small countries
have to be smarter!&quot;</B>

<a name=for></a><h3>Forschungskooperation mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern: Die &ouml;sterreichische Situation</h3>
<P>
<I>Rahmenbedingungen - F&ouml;rderung - Leistungen - Defizite</I>
<P>
<B>Reinhard Schurawitzki</B>
<P>
<b>Einleitung</b>
<P>
Nach den Ausf&uuml;hrungen meiner Vorrednerin m&ouml;chte ich
jetzt sozusagen als Kontrastprogramm etwas zur &ouml;sterreichischen
Situation sagen. Die Darstellung kann sich auf l&auml;ngere Erfahrung
sowohl im Bereich der Forschungsverwaltung als auch als Sekret&auml;r
der Kommission st&uuml;tzen.
<P>
Ich werde also kurz auf die Vorgeschichte des Themenbereichs &quot;<I>Forschung
mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern</I>&quot; in &Ouml;sterreich und
dessen Rahmenbedingungen eingehen. Daran wird sich ein kurzer
&Uuml;berblick &uuml;ber F&ouml;rderungsm&ouml;glichkeiten und
bisherige Aktivit&auml;ten anschlie&szlig;en.  Die im Programm
angek&uuml;ndigte Darstellung der Defizite ist meine subjektive
Interpretation von Fakten. Abschlie&szlig;end m&ouml;chte ich
bei aller gebotenen Skepsis eine Perspektive vorstellen, die -
so hoffe ich - in den anschlie&szlig;enden Diskussionen einem
kritischen Testverfahren unterzogen wird.
<P>
Die Geschichte des Themenbereichs &quot;Forschung mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern&quot;
beginnt in &Ouml;sterreich mit der Konferenz der Vereinten Nationen
&uuml;ber &quot;<I>Wissenschaft und Technologie im Dienste der
Entwicklung</I>&quot; im Jahre 1979 in Wien. Obwohl die Konferenz
insgesamt nicht sehr erfolgreich war, wurde immerhin die Bedeutung
von Wissenschaft, Forschung und Technologie f&uuml;r den Entwicklungsproze&szlig;
erstmals auf internationaler Ebene in vollem Umfang anerkannt.
Das beschlossene &quot;<I>Vienna  Programme of Action</I>&quot;
ist bis heute das Referenzdokument der Vereinten Nationen.
<P>
&Ouml;sterreich pr&auml;sentierte ein ambiti&ouml;ses 6-Punkte-Ma&szlig;nahmen-Paket.
Es verschwand jedoch bald nach Konferenzende in den Registraturen
der zust&auml;ndigen Amtsstuben. Weder wurde die versprochene
Bindung von Forschungsmitteln f&uuml;r diesen Zweck realisiert,
noch gedieh die Errichtung eines nationalen Forschungszentrums
f&uuml;r Wissenschaftskooperation mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern
&uuml;ber eine Studie hinaus. Als einzige &ouml;sterreichische
Folgema&szlig;nahme der Konferenz wurde zwei Jahre sp&auml;ter
bei der Akademie der Wissenschaften die <I>Kommission f&uuml;r
Entwicklungsfragen</I> eingerichtet.
<P>
<p>Rahmenbedingungen in &Ouml;sterreich</p>
<P>
Wie auch in den meisten L&auml;ndern, auf supranationaler Ebene
die EU - Kommission eingeschlossen, geh&ouml;ren die Bereiche
&quot;Forschung&quot; und &quot;Entwicklungs-zusammenarbeit&quot;
unterschiedlichen gesellschaftlichen Subsystemen an. Daher sind
sie auch kompetenzrechtlich getrennt, obwohl sie in einem weiteren
Sinne in einem Kontext stehen. Die Entwicklung der Industriel&auml;nder
w&auml;re ohne Forschung wohl anders verlaufen.
<P>
Es haben sich also unterschiedliche Kulturen entwickelt, die einander
lange Zeit mit erheblichem Mi&szlig;trauen beobachtet  haben.
Auf der einen Seite befanden sich die Tiers-mondisten, die Entwicklungshelfer,
deren konkrete Erfahrungen mit Hunger, Armut, Krankheit und Gewalt
eine kritische Sicht auf &Ouml;konomie und Politik der Industriel&auml;nder
geradezu provozierten. Auf der anderen Seite die Wissenschaft,
welche in Traditionen eines eurozentristischen Systems mit dessen
Wertma&szlig;st&auml;ben und spezifischen Karriereverl&auml;ufen
ausgebildet worden waren und dort - von Ausnahmen abgesehen -
verharrten: In der Verwaltung als den ihre Bereiche kontrollierenden
Institutionen war das wechselseitige Mi&szlig;trauen besonders
ausgepr&auml;gt.
<P>
Die daraus folgenden Denk- und Handlungsblockaden verhinderten
ein kooperatives Agieren dort, wo sich beide Kompetenzbereiche
bis zu einem gewissen Ma&szlig; &uuml;berdecken: in Wissenschaft
und Forschung. Vorrangiges Ziel war nicht die Entdeckung gemeinsamer
Interessen, sondern eher das Herausarbeiten von Trennendem. Es
war nur folgerichtig, da&szlig; kooperative Forschung in der Programmatik
der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit  keine Rolle spielte, w&auml;hrend
sie im Wissenschaftsbereich vielfach als blo&szlig;e  Entwicklungshilfe
interpretiert wurde. Diese Abgrenzung diente vor allem der Schonung
der jeweiligen Budgets, wirkte jedoch insgesamt  prohibitiv auf
die konzeptuelle Entwicklung und verhinderte den systematischen
Aufbau &ouml;sterreichischer Expertise. Umso mehr Anerkennung
verdienen jene Wissenschafterinnen und Wissenschafter, die sich
von den ung&uuml;nstigen Rahmenbedingungen nicht haben entmutigen
lassen.
<P>
<b>F&ouml;rderung</b>
<P>
Der bei weitem gr&ouml;&szlig;ere Teil der f&uuml;r Zusammenarbeit
mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern relevanten Wissenschaftsf&ouml;rderung
entf&auml;llt auf den Bereich &quot;Studium und Ausbildung&quot;.
<P>
Aus Mitteln des Wissenschaftsministeriums werden Auslandsbeziehungen
der Universit&auml;ten und sonstiger wissenschaftlicher Einrichtungen,
beispielsweise Partnerschaften, kurzfristige Auslandsaufenthalte
und &auml;hnliche Aktivit&auml;ten, finanziert. Der bei weitem
gr&ouml;&szlig;te Teil davon entf&auml;llt auf Kontakte mit Industriel&auml;ndern.
<P>
Das Bundesministerium f&uuml;r ausw&auml;rtige Angelegenheiten
finanziert mit dem bew&auml;hrten Instrument der &quot;Nord-S&uuml;d-Stipendien
f&uuml;r Angeh&ouml;rige von Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern&quot; vor
allem postgraduale Studien und die Durchf&uuml;hrung von Spezialkursen.
Diese sind f&uuml;r die Anbahnung  von Forschungskooperationen
eine hervorragende Grundlage. Sie machen einerseits die Stipendiaten
mit den Verh&auml;ltnissen in &Ouml;sterreich vertraut, andererseits
werden Anliegen der Entwicklungsl&auml;nder den jeweiligen Betreuungspersonen
an den Universit&auml;ten oder au&szlig;eruniversit&auml;ren Einrichtungen
n&auml;hergebracht. 
<P>
Ich mu&szlig; mich hier - dem Thema  der Arbeitstagung entsprechend
- auf die F&ouml;rderung der Forschung beschr&auml;nken. Interessenten
an einem umfassenden &Uuml;berblick &uuml;ber das Gesamtspektrum
der F&ouml;rderungsm&ouml;glichkeiten seien auf das von der Kommission
mit herausgegebene Handbuch &quot;Studieren. Lehren. Forschen.
&Ouml;sterreich und die Dritte Welt&quot; hingewiesen.
<P>
<b>Forschung mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern</b>
<P>
Die F&ouml;rderungsm&ouml;glichkeiten im Forschungsbereich beschr&auml;nken
sich auf wenige Institutionen. Der <I>Fonds zur F&ouml;rderung
der wissenschaftlichen Forschung</I> (FWF) ist derzeit mit rund
760 Mio &ouml;S dotiert. Er f&ouml;rdert jedoch nur Projekte der
sogenannten Grundlagenforschung. Von den im vergangenen Jahr neu
bewilligten 460 Projekten entfielen nur rund 15 auf solche in
bzw. mit Bezug auf Entwicklungsl&auml;nder. Mit China, Taiwan,
Thailand, Indonesien und Argentinien ist jeweils ein sogenanntes
<I>&quot;Memorandum of Understanding&quot;</I> abgeschlossen worden,
welches institutionelle wissenschaftliche Zusammenarbeit erm&ouml;glicht;
1995 sind insgesamt acht entsprechende Vorhaben bewilligt worden,
davon f&uuml;nf mit Argentinien. Individuelle internationale Kooperationsprojekte
wurden 1995 mit &Auml;gypten (1), Belize (1) China (1), El Salvador
(2) und Jamaika (1) genehmigt.
<P>
Bescheidene Ans&auml;tze bieten bilaterale staatliche Abkommen,
wie insbesondere Kulturabkommen oder wissenschaftlich-technische
Abkommen. Solche Abkommen bestehen aber derzeit nur mit einer
Handvoll Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern und in engem personellen Rahmen.
<P>
Mittel der Auftragsforschung des <I>Wissenschaftsministeriums
</I>wurden - obwohl bis zum Sparpaket reichlich vorhanden - nur
in seltenen Ausnahmef&auml;llen f&uuml;r Themen mit Entwicklungsl&auml;nderbezug
vergeben.
<P>
Das <I>Bundesministerium f&uuml;r ausw&auml;rtige Angelegenheiten</I>
finanziert wissenschaftliche Forschung und Studien als Begleitma&szlig;nahme,
wenn dies zur Durchf&uuml;hrung von einzelnen Projekten der bilateralen
technischen Hilfe erforderlich ist. Das Interesse wird in diesen
F&auml;llen vom EZA-Projekt her definiert.
<P>
Der <I>Jubil&auml;umsfonds der &Ouml;sterreichischen Nationalbank</I>
f&ouml;rdert zwar grunds&auml;tzlich auch Forschungsprojekte 
&ouml;sterreichischer Wissenschafter in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern,
es entf&auml;llt jedoch nur ein kleiner Prozentsatz von j&auml;hrlich
etwa 320 Projekten darauf. Au&szlig;erdem werden keine Reise-
und Aufenthaltskosten ins und im Ausland &uuml;bernommen.
<P>
Die einzige Stelle in &Ouml;sterreich, welche Forschungsf&ouml;rderungen
ausschlie&szlig;lich f&uuml;r kooperative Projekte mit einem angemessenen
erwartbaren Nutzen f&uuml;r das Entwicklungsland vergibt, ist
somit die <I>Kommission f&uuml;r Entwicklungsfragen bei der &Ouml;sterreichischen
Akademie der Wissenschaften</I>. 
<P>
Die wichtigste Leistung besteht zweifellos in der finanziellen
F&ouml;rderung von einschl&auml;gigen Forschungsprojekten: Bis
heute sind knapp hundert Antr&auml;ge von der Kommission behandelt
und etwa zwei F&uuml;nftel davon - &uuml;berwiegend f&uuml;r junge
Wissenschafter und Wissenschafterinnen - auch finanziert worden.
Zus&auml;tzlich nenne ich noch Postgraduate-Kurse, die Ausarbeitung
eines Forschungskonzeptes, Durchf&uuml;hrung von Symposien, Informationsveranstaltungen
und zwei Erhebungen &uuml;ber das wissenschaftliche Kooperationspotential.
(&Uuml;bersicht &uuml;ber Projekte und sonstige Aktivit&auml;ten
siehe Anhang 1)
<P>
Alles bestens in &Ouml;sterreich, k&ouml;nnte man meinen. Da&szlig;
dem nicht so ist, zeigt einerseits eine Reihe von Projektantr&auml;gen
an die Kommission, die trotz hoher wissenschaftlicher Qualit&auml;t
abgelehnt werden mu&szlig;te. Ein weiterer Indikator f&uuml;r
eine skeptischere Beurteilung der Gesamtsituation ist die schwache
&ouml;sterreichische Beteiligung an der ersten Ausschreibungsrunde
des Kooperationsprogramms mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern des 4.
Rahmenprogramms der EU. Der Erfolg war mit drei bewilligten Projekten
nicht gerade &uuml;berzeugend. Aber auch die F&ouml;rderungst&auml;tigkeit
der Kommission selbst und ihre sonstigen Aktivit&auml;ten sind
insgesamt verbesserungsf&auml;hig. Es ist an der Zeit, sich &uuml;ber
offensichtliche Defizite klarzuwerden. 
<P>
<b>Defizite</b>
<P>
Woran fehlt es also? Auf politischer Ebene ist ein gewisses Desinteresse
f&uuml;r Anliegen der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit ebenso wie im
Bereich der Forschungskooperation mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern
zu konstatieren. Das hat sich auch in der sehr bescheidenen Finanzierung
der Kommission und in den bereits vor dem eigentlichen Sparpaket
vorgenommenen Subventionsk&uuml;rzungen gezeigt. 
<P>
Im Themenbereich der Forschungskooperation selbst sind Defizite
gegeben. Meiner Ansicht nach ist die Ausarbeitung einer soliden
Programmatik mit klaren Kriterien vordringlich. Die immer noch
bestehenden Divergenzen zwischen Entwicklungszusammenarbeit und
Wissenschaft sind zu korrigieren und zusammenzuf&uuml;hren.
<P>
Denn bisher erfolgte die Antragstellung aus unterschiedlichsten
Interessenslagen individueller &ouml;sterreichischer Wissenschafter
und Wissenschafterinnen. Die Projekte sind daher auch kaum inter-
oder multidisziplin&auml;r angelegt. Eine Netzwerkbildung kann
mit unterkritischer Masse nicht erreicht werden. Die Projektpartner
im Entwicklungsland sind am Entwurf des Projekts nur in wenigen
F&auml;llen beteiligt. Die Herstellung dauerhafter Kontakte nach
Abschlu&szlig; des Projekts ist selten. Eine Abstimmung von Kommissionsprojekten
mit Vorhaben der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit, welche gr&ouml;&szlig;ere
Kontinuit&auml;t und m&ouml;glicherweise auch Wirksamkeit herstellen
k&ouml;nnte, erfolgt nur in Ausnahmef&auml;llen. Das eingangs
angesprochene Zwei-Kulturen-Syndrom hat sich bisher kaum &uuml;berwinden
lassen. Dies hat, nicht zuletzt, auch Konsequenzen f&uuml;r die
Finanzierung.
<P>
<b>Vorschl&auml;ge f&uuml;r die weitere Diskussion</b>
<P>
Ich meine, da&szlig; &Ouml;sterreich sich nicht auf Dauer dem
Anliegen der Erweiterung gemeinsamer Forschungsm&ouml;glichkeiten
mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern entziehen soll und kann. Auch die
Wirtschaft sollte angesichts der globalen Entwicklung daran Interesse
haben. 
<P>
Ein &ouml;sterreichisches mittelfristiges Forschungsprogramm soll
daher eingerichtet werden. Es soll gemeinsam vom Bundesministerium
f&uuml;r ausw&auml;rtige Angelegenheiten und dem Bundesministerium
f&uuml;r Wissenschaft, Verkehr und Kunst in Auftrag gegeben und
getragen werden. Damit sollen klare Zielsetzungen und Kriterien
ausgearbeitet werden. Aufbauend darauf sind eine breit angelegte
Informationsarbeit sowie die Vermittlung von Interessen zwischen
Institutionen und Sektoren erforderlich. Sind diese Voraussetzungen
und entsprechende Rahmenbedingungen f&uuml;r gleichberechtigte
Kooperationen gegeben, kann die konkrete kooperative Projektarbeit
in Angriff genommen werden. Dabei wird im jeweiligen Einzelfall
auch die Finanzierung zu kl&auml;ren sein, wobei alle vorhandenen
M&ouml;glichkeiten zu nutzen sind. 
<P>
Oberstes Ziel mu&szlig; die Vorbereitung und Durchf&uuml;hrung
von im eigentlichen Sinn kooperativen Forschungsvorhaben mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern
sein.
<P>
<b>Begr&uuml;ndung</b>
<P>
Trotz langer Vernachl&auml;ssigung und minimaler F&ouml;rderung
ist unter &ouml;sterreichischen Wissenschaftern und Wissenschafterinnen
betr&auml;chtliches Interesse und die Bereitschaft zu Kooperation
mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern gegeben. Dies ist durch mehrere Erhebungen
wie auch durch die F&ouml;rderungserfahrung der Kommission belegt.

<P>
Engere konzeptive wie operative Zusammenarbeit bzw. inhaltliche
Abstimmung im Einzelfall zwischen den Bereichen Wissenschaft und
Forschung einerseits und der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit andererseits
ist f&uuml;r beide Seiten von Vorteil, ja langfristig unabdingbar.
Ohne effektive Kooperation mit dem universit&auml;ren und au&szlig;eruniversit&auml;ren
Wissenschaftssystem &Ouml;sterreichs wird die EZA eine wichtige
Komponente vernachl&auml;ssigen. 
<P>
F&uuml;r Wissenschaft und Forschung wiederum gilt nach eigenem
Anspruch das Prinzip der Internationalit&auml;t, auch sind wesentliche
Probleme heute globaler Natur. Die Wissenschaft kann und mu&szlig;
mit ihrer langfristig angelegten Probleml&ouml;sungskapazit&auml;t
Beitr&auml;ge dazu leisten. Sie kann dies allerdings nicht ohne
Ber&uuml;cksichtigung der konkreten Situation tun. In der notwendigen
und gew&uuml;nschten Zusammenarbeit bedarf es auch der Beratung
durch und der Kooperation mit Einrichtungen der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit.
Das Ziel eines <I>Institution-Buildung</I> und einer St&auml;rkung
endogener Kapazit&auml;ten liegt somit in beiderseitigem Interesse.
<P>
Das Ziel wird nur erreicht werden k&ouml;nnen, wenn die jeweiligen
politisch-administrativen Ebenen im Verbund mit den wissenschaftlichen
und entwicklungsorientierten Institutionen mit der Einrichtung
eines gemeinsamen Programms eine geeignete Struktur f&uuml;r Beratung,
Koordination und ein intelligentes System der Kofinanzierung schaffen.
Daf&uuml;r gibt es schon jetzt erfolgversprechende Ans&auml;tze,
vor allem seitens der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit.
<P>
Einen m&ouml;glichen personellen Ansatzpunkt f&uuml;r kooperative
Forschung k&ouml;nnten die im Rahmen des Nord-S&uuml;d-Stipendienprogramms
ausgebildeten Wissenschafter aus Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern und
deren Betreuer in &Ouml;sterreich darstellen. 
<P>
Als Tr&auml;ger eines solchen Programms bietet sich die Kommission
f&uuml;r Entwicklungsfragen an. Sie hat langj&auml;hrige entsprechende
Erfahrungen. Sie untersteht einer Institution von hohem wissenschaftlichen
Ruf und internationaler Anerkennung. Sie ist fachlich interdisziplin&auml;r
zusammengesetzt. Sie kann universit&auml;re und au&szlig;eruniversit&auml;re
Forschung zusammenf&uuml;hren, ist vertragsf&auml;hig und autonom
in der Gestion der Mittel und verf&uuml;gt &uuml;ber eine - wenn
auch bescheidene - materielle Infrastruktur. &Ouml;sterreich sollte
sich auf Dauer den Anforderungen nicht entziehen. Es kann auch
nicht ausschlie&szlig;lich auf Aktivit&auml;ten und F&ouml;rderungen
supranationaler Einrichtungen, wie der Europ&auml;ischen Union,
verweisen: Das sinnvolle Prinzip der Subsidiarit&auml;t fordert
vom einzelnen Staat a priori gewisse Eigenleistungen beim Aufbau
der ben&ouml;tigten Expertise. Diese Voraussetzungen auf nationaler
Ebene sind jedoch erst wirklich zu schaffen. Erst dann wird die
Beteiligung an internationaler Zusammenarbeit mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern
auch im Rahmen der EU (&uuml;ber die bisherigen Einzelinitiativen
hinaus) erfolgreich sein, erst dann wird &Ouml;sterreich auch
selbst neue Gesichtspunkte in die Diskussion auf europ&auml;ischer
Ebene einbringen k&ouml;nnen.

am Beispiel der Schweiz</h3>
<P>
<I>Vorstellung der Schweizerischen Kommission f&uuml;r Forschungspartnerschaft mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern (KFPE)</I>
<P>
<B>Daniel Maselli</B>
<P>
<b>1.  Vorgeschichte der KFPE</b>
<P>
Der Ausgangspunkt f&uuml;r die Initiative zur Gr&uuml;ndung der
heutigen Kommission geht auf die 169. Jahrestagung der <I>Schweizerischen
Akademie der Naturwissenschaften</I> (SANW) vor einigen Jahren
zur&uuml;ck (1989), anl&auml;&szlig;lich welcher ein Handlungsbedarf
in der Neuorientierung der schweizerischen Forschung in und mit
Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern klar festgestellt worden ist. In der
Folge haben die SANW und die Direktion f&uuml;r Entwicklung und
Zusammenarbeit (DEZA, vormals Direktion f&uuml;r Entwicklung und
humanit&auml;re Zusammenarbeit/DEH) die Initiative zur Einsetzung
einer &quot;<I>Kommission f&uuml;r die F&ouml;rderung der Forschung
in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern</I>&quot; (FFEL) ergriffen.  Diese
hat in der Folge die &quot;<I>Schweizerische Strategie zur F&ouml;rderung
der Forschung in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern</I>&quot; (1993) ausgearbeitet,
welche einer breiten Vernehmlassung unterzogen wurde. Darin wurde
unter anderem postuliert, eine spezielle Kommission f&uuml;r die
Umsetzung der Anliegen der Strategie einzusetzen.
<P>
Im Fr&uuml;hjahr 1994 gelang es, die &quot;<I>Konferenz der schweizerischen
wissenschaftlichen Akademien</I>&quot; (CASS), welche die vier
Akademien - SAGW (Geistes- und Sozialwissenschaften), SAMW (medizinische
Wissenschaften), SANW und SATW (technische Wissenschaften) - vertritt,
f&uuml;r die Finanzierung des Sekretariats zu gewinnen. Es wurde
eine 50%-Stelle f&uuml;r eine Dauer von drei Jahren bewilligt
(Pilotphase). Im August 1994 nahm das Sekretariat die Arbeit auf,
und im Herbst des gleichen Jahres fand die eigentliche Gr&uuml;ndungsversammlung
statt. Im Mai dieses Jahres hat die CASS das Mandat bis Mitte
2000 um weitere drei Jahre verl&auml;ngert.
<P>
<b>2.  Zusammensetzung der KFPE</b>
<P>
Die Kommission besteht aus 15 &quot;Ad personam&quot;-Mitgliedern,
wobei neun davon Vertreter der Wissenschaft sind und aus verschiedenen
Disziplinen stammen (vgl. Prospekt, Anhang 2). Im weiteren geh&ouml;ren
dieser Mitgliedergruppe je zwei Vertreter nicht-staatlicher Organisationen,
der schweizerischen Au&szlig;enwirtschaft und des Parlaments an.
Diese stimmberechtigten Mitglieder werden durch assoziierte Mitglieder,
welche diverse staatliche und Nicht-Regierungs-Organisationen
(NRO) vertreten, die von der Forschung in und mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern
betroffen sind, verst&auml;rkt (vgl. Prospekt). Schlie&szlig;lich
haben einige weitere Mitglieder Beobachter- und Beraterstatus
(&quot;Ex officio&quot;-Mitglieder).
<P>
<b>3.  Ziele und T&auml;tigkeiten der KFPE</b>
<P>
Die KFPE verf&uuml;gt nur &uuml;ber geringe finanzielle Mittel,
welche ausschlie&szlig;lich f&uuml;r die Aktivit&auml;ten des
Sekretariats vorgesehen sind. Projekte k&ouml;nnen keine finanziert
werden, hingegen versucht die KFPE als Informationsdrehscheibe
zu fungieren (vgl. unten). Sie besitzt auch keine Entscheidungsmacht,
sondern kann nur auf Ersuchen hin Empfehlungen und Stellungnahmen
abgeben. Die KFPE wirkt deshalb vor allem mittels &Uuml;berzeugungsarbeit
auf allen Ebenen (Wissenschaft, Politik, Administration, &Ouml;ffentlichkeit).
<P>
Das Hauptziel der Kommission ist es, zur St&auml;rkung des wissenschaftlichen
Potentials von Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern beizutragen. Um dieses
Ziel zu erreichen, wurde die 'Strategie' einem ZOPP-Seminar (Ziel-orientierte
Projektplanung) unterzogen und ein Aktionsplan mit neun Hauptaktionslinien
ausgearbeitet. Der aktualisierte Aktionsplan sieht folgende Linien
vor: 
<P>
<ol>
<li>Das Modul 7 &quot;Entwicklung &amp; Umwelt&quot; des Schwerpunktprogramms
&quot;Umwelt-technologie und Umweltforschung&quot; (SPP-Umwelt)
wird als 'Erfahrungspool' f&uuml;r partnerschaftliche Forschung
genutzt.
<P>
<li>Ein Informationsinstrumentarium f&uuml;r Forschungspartnerschaft
liegt vor und wird eingesetzt.
<P>
<li>Es wird &Ouml;ffentlichkeits- und Sensibilisierungsarbeit betrieben.
<P>
<li>Die KFPE verf&uuml;gt &uuml;ber ein Instrumentarium zur Beurteilung
der Forschungspartnerschafts-Komponente bei Projekten.
<P>
<li>Die KFPE fungiert als Vermittlungs- und Anlaufstelle f&uuml;r
Forschungspartnerschafts-Anliegen in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern.
<P>
<li>Die KFPE-T&auml;tigkeit und der Impact ihrer Aktivit&auml;ten
werden laufend verfolgt und evaluiert.
<P>
<li>Es werden Reglemente, Verordnungen, Statuten und dergleichen
von EZA-Institutionen (Kommissionen, Stiftungen etc.) optimiert
und auf die F&ouml;rderung partnerschaftlicher Forschung ausgerichtet.
<P>
<li>Es werden Bem&uuml;hungen um Unterst&uuml;tzung spezieller
Aktivit&auml;ten unternommen (u.a. Fund-Raising/Out-Sourcing).</ol>
<P>
In naher Zukunft sollen insbesondere &quot;<I>Leitlinien f&uuml;r
partnerschaftliche Forschung</I>&quot; und ein &quot;<I>Informationsf&uuml;hrer</I>&quot;
ausgearbeitet werden. Dabei wird auf eine breite Abst&uuml;tzung
auch im Ausland Wert gelegt werden.
<P>
<b>4.  Zur &quot;Strategie&quot;</b>
<P>
<I>4.1 Grundideologie</I>
<P>
Die Strategie gr&uuml;ndet auf der &Uuml;berzeugung, da&szlig;
die globalen Probleme unseres Planeten (zum Beispiel Raubbau an
den nat&uuml;rlichen Ressourcen, Bev&ouml;lkerungswachstum) nur
mit gemeinsamen Anstrengungen von industrialisierten und weniger/nicht
industrialisierten L&auml;ndern gel&ouml;st werden k&ouml;nnen.
Im Klartext hei&szlig;t das, da&szlig; der Norden die Probleme
nicht alleine anpacken und l&ouml;sen kann, er ist auf die Mithilfe
des S&uuml;dens angewiesen. Daraus leitet sich der Grundgedanke
der Forschungspartnerschaft ab, da dadurch einerseits an der L&ouml;sung
gemeinsamer Probleme miteinander geforscht werden und gleichzeitig
die Forschungskapazit&auml;t und die Kompetenz auf beiden Seiten
- insbesondere aber im S&uuml;den - erh&ouml;ht werden kann. 
<P>
Die KFPE versucht, die in der Schweiz t&auml;tigen Forscherinnen
und Forscher sowie die Vertreter der schweizerischen Forschungspolitik
bis hin zu den Vertretern im Parlament von dieser Notwendigkeit
zu &uuml;berzeugen. Sie versucht darzulegen, da&szlig; die Schweiz
ein ureigenes Interesse an partnerschaftlicher Forschung hat und
diese nur auf der Basis von gegenseitigem Vertrauen in langfristiger
Zusammenarbeit erfolgen kann. 
<P>
Es ist klar, da&szlig; diese Sichtweise auch auf Widerst&auml;nde
st&ouml;&szlig;t, namentlich in Kreisen, welche die Forschung
im S&uuml;den als zweit- oder drittklassig abstempeln. Die KFPE
ist &uuml;berzeugt, da&szlig; sie hier einen Beitrag zur verbesserten
Bewu&szlig;tseinsbildung zu leisten hat. Einerseits gibt es im
S&uuml;den Forschungsprojekte, deren Resultate sich international
durchaus mit denjenigen des Nordens sehen lassen k&ouml;nnen,
andererseits mag die Forschung in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern zwar
oft mehr angewandter Natur sein, verlangt daf&uuml;r aber vom
Forschenden eine Kombination von Eigenschaften, die an sich schon
eine Herausforderung darstellen (gesundheitliche Robustheit, diplomatisches
Flair, kulturelles Verst&auml;ndnis, Improvisationsverm&ouml;gen
etc.). Ohne derartige F&auml;higkeiten kann ein noch so guter
Forscher aus dem Norden kaum das Optimum bei einem partnerschaftlichen
Projekt herausholen.
<P>
Hier setzt ein zentrales Anliegen der KFPE ein, welche die verantwortlichen
Institutionen der schweizerischen Forschungst&auml;tigkeit - insbesondere
auch die Geldgeber - vom Wert und von der Notwendigkeit partnerschaftlicher
Forschung in und mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern &uuml;berzeugen
und sie dazu bringen m&ouml;chte, k&uuml;nftig die Partnerschaftskomponente
bei der Projektbeurteilung vermehrt zu ber&uuml;cksichtigen. 
<P>
<I>4.2 Erste Erfahrungen</I>
<P>
Im Rahmen des Modul 7 aus dem SPP-Umwelt konnten erste Erfahrungen
in der partnerschaftlichen Forschung mit S&uuml;dl&auml;ndern
gemacht und ausgewertet werden. 
<P>
Die dem Modul zugrunde liegenden &Uuml;berlegungen sind die folgenden:
<P>
&quot;Weltumspannende Probleme im Umweltbereich sind eng mit der
Disparit&auml;t Nord/S&uuml;d verkn&uuml;pft. Die Beziehungen
zwischen Industrie- und Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern erweisen sich
regelrecht als Kardinalfrage f&uuml;r das &Uuml;berleben auf unserem
Planeten. Die derzeitigen weltwirtschaftlichen Spielregeln sowie
die Verhaltens- und Konsummuster der Industriel&auml;nder belasten
die Umwelt erheblich. Weitgehend durchgesetzt hat sich deshalb
die Einsicht, da&szlig; eine nachhaltige Entwicklung sowohl f&uuml;r
den Norden als auch f&uuml;r den S&uuml;den zwingend wird. Nachhaltige
Entwicklung bedeutet eine ausgewogene Integration der &ouml;kologischen,
sozialen und &ouml;konomischen Systeme, die deren Potentialen
und Grenzen Rechnung tr&auml;gt.&quot; 
<P>
Die Schweizer Regierung, verschiedene Umwelt- und Entwicklungsorganisationen
wie auch Privatunternehmen bem&uuml;hen sich, das Ziel der nachhaltigen
Entwicklung und die &ouml;kologische Dimension vermehrt in ihre
Enwicklungspolitik einzubeziehen. Wissenschaftliche Grundlagen
dazu fehlen jedoch in vielen Bereichen weitgehend. Das Modul 7
hat deshalb zum Ziel, bestehende Wissensl&uuml;cken zu schlie&szlig;en
und entwicklungspolitische Leitgedanken zu entwickeln. An den
Forschungsarbeiten beteiligt sind - nach der Leitidee einer Forschungspartnerschaft
- Schweizer und Drittwelt-Forschungsinstitutionen: Probleme beidseitiger
Bedeutung sollen gemeinsam angegangen werden. Dadurch werden Umwelt-
und Entwicklungsaspekte (F&ouml;rderung des einheimischen Forschungspotentials,
&quot;capacity- and institution-building&quot;) miteinander verkn&uuml;pft.

<b>5.  Was hat die KFPE bislang geleistet und erreicht?</b>
<P>
<I>5.1 Kurzbericht der internationalen Konferenz in Bern</I>
<P>
Aufgrund einer Initiative des IUED (Institut Universitaire d'Etudes
du D&eacute;veloppement) in Genf wurde die KFPE angefragt, eine
internationale Konferenz zum Thema Forschungspartnerschaft mit
Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern durchzuf&uuml;hren. Sie wurde dabei unterst&uuml;tzt
von der DEZA, dem SPP-Umwelt, der SANW und dem IUED, welche auch
im OK vertreten waren. 
<P>
Die Konferenz wurde von etwa 380 Forscherinnen und Forscher sowie
Verantwortlichen der Forschungspolitik aus 67 L&auml;ndern besucht,
wobei 50 davon aus Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern stammten, was f&uuml;r
einen derartigen Anla&szlig; wohl als au&szlig;erordentlich bezeichnet
werden kann. Die KFPE konnte so wertvolle Kontakte kn&uuml;pfen
und Erfahrungen auf internationaler Ebene austauschen sowie eine
recht beachtliche Medienpr&auml;senz verzeichnen. Am ersten Tag
wurden verschiedene Strategien und Vorgehensweisen der bislang
am meisten engagierten Industriel&auml;nder - namentlich Kanada,
Schweden und Holland - sowie die Erfahrungen weiterer bedeutender
Akteure, wie etwa Deutschland, Frankreich und England, miteinander
verglichen. Die erw&auml;hnte starke Pr&auml;senz des S&uuml;dens
hat es dabei deren Vertretern erm&ouml;glicht, ihre positiven
wie auch negativen Erfahrungen mitzuteilen und Verbesserungsvorschl&auml;ge
bei k&uuml;nftigen gemeinsamen Forschungsvorhaben vorzutragen.
<P>
Zwei Hauptreferate, beide gehalten durch S&uuml;dvertreter, welche
mit dem Norden in enger Verbindung stehen (SPAAR/WB und TWAS),
haben u.a. die Diskussion um Hindernisse und Stolpersteine der
partnerschaftlichen Forschung sowohl im Norden wie auch im S&uuml;den
in Gang gesetzt. Interessant war dabei festzustellen, da&szlig;
die S&uuml;dvertreter selber finanziell und materiell mehr beitragen
m&uuml;ssen und teilweise auch wollen, um die eigene Forschungskapazit&auml;t
zu erh&ouml;hen und um als gleichwertige Partner betrachtet werden
zu k&ouml;nnen. Dabei mu&szlig; den Disparit&auml;ten unter den
Entwicklungs- und Schwellenl&auml;ndern Rechnung getragen und
die gegenseitige Hilfe untereinander verst&auml;rkt werden (S&uuml;d-S&uuml;d-Netz).
Ein wesentliches Ziel sollte dabei die St&auml;rkung der Forschungskapazit&auml;t
und gleichzeitig die Verminderung des diesbez&uuml;glich starken
Ungleichgewichts von rund 30 Forschern im Norden auf einen Forscher
im S&uuml;den sein, das schon in Rio klar bem&auml;ngelt worden
war. 
<P>
Am zweiten Tag wurden zuerst im Rahmen eines Rundgespr&auml;chs
Probleme rund um die verschiedenen Formen des Wettbewerbs bei
Forschungsvorhaben im S&uuml;den diskutiert. Besonders anregend
war das anschlie&szlig;ende &quot;Swiss Policy Forum&quot;, wo
sich vier Vertreter der schweizerischen Forschergemeinschaft mit
vier Vertretern des Parlaments ein Streitgespr&auml;ch &uuml;ber
die bisherige und k&uuml;nftige schweizerische Forschungst&auml;tigkeit
und -politik in und mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern geliefert haben.
<P>
Nach einem Postermarkt w&auml;hrend des Lunches folgten am Nachmittag
Gruppendiskussionen zu neun verschiedenen Themata, deren Resultate
am Vormittag des dritten und letzten Konferenztages vorgetragen
wurden. Der ganze Anla&szlig; wurde durch einen Vortrag eines
Vertreters der schweizerischen Wirtschaft und durch das &quot;Executive
Summary&quot; abgerundet.
<P>
<I>5.2 Proceedings, Infof&uuml;hrer und der Leitfaden f&uuml;r
die Partnerschaft</I>
<P>
Im Anschlu&szlig; an die Konferenz wurde eine Redaktionsgruppe
f&uuml;r die Herstellung der Proceedings bestellt. Diese sollten
bereits bis Mitte September 1996 - gerade rechtzeitig zur EADI-Konferenz
in Wien - zur Verf&uuml;gung stehen. Sie sind als praktische Arbeitsunterlagen
f&uuml;r die Ausarbeitung von neuen Strategien und f&uuml;r die
Verbesserung der partnerschaftlichen Forschungszusammenarbeit
konzipiert. Sie werden sowohl im Buchhandel wie auch bei der KFPE
erh&auml;ltlich sein. 
<P>
Die KFPE hat k&uuml;rzlich ebenfalls beschlossen, die Herstellung
des Leitfadens f&uuml;r partnerschaftliche Forschung m&ouml;glichst
rasch voranzutreiben und auch den Informationsf&uuml;hrer rund
um Forschungsaktivit&auml;ten in und mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern
so bald wie m&ouml;glich herauszugeben. Im &uuml;brigen kl&auml;rt
die KFPE ab, ob in rund zwei Jahren eine Konferenz &auml;hnlicher
Art mit Hauptansprechpartnern aus der Wirtschaft durchgef&uuml;hrt
werden k&ouml;nnte. Die Mittel f&uuml;r eine derartige Folgekonferenz
w&auml;ren durch Outsourcing bei Wirtschaft, Industrie, Handel
etc. zu beschaffen.
<P>
<b>6.  Datenbank &quot;Swiss Research and Developing Countries&quot;
</b>
<P>
Nachdem die erste Ausgabe der Datenbank 'Schweizer Forschung und
Entwicklungsl&auml;nder 1993/94' mit Daten aus 1992 klar veraltet
war, hat das IUED in Genf im Hinblick auf die obige Konferenz
die Datenbank v&ouml;llig neu &uuml;berarbeitet und gestaltet.
Die Informationen sind nunmehr als relationale Datenbank auf CD-ROM
und Disketten f&uuml;r Macintosh und PC erh&auml;ltlich und erlauben
kombinierte Suchfolgen nach Disziplinen, geographischen und inhaltlichen
Stichworten. Die Datenbank enth&auml;lt zurzeit detaillierte Informationen
zu 319 schweizerischen Institutionen, welche mit der wisschenschaftlichen
Forschung in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern zu tun haben, sowie zu 743
sogenannten &quot;resource persons&quot; und zu 549 Forschungsprojekten.
Die Angaben werden fortan periodisch und in relativ kurzen Abst&auml;nden
aufgearbeitet und interessierten Personen und Institutionen zug&auml;nglich
gemacht.

<p>
<a name=zus></a><H3>Zusammenfassung der Diskussion im Plenum</H3>
<P>
<B>Bericht des Rapporteurs Herwig Palme</B>
<P>
<ol>
<li>Es wurde mehrfach festgestellt, da&szlig; die auf der Arbeitstagung
diskutierten Probleme im wesentlichen ihre Wurzeln im ausgepr&auml;gten
Mangel an politischem Willen zur Unterst&uuml;tzung und F&ouml;rderung
der &Ouml;sterreichischen Entwicklungszusammenarbeit (&Ouml;EZA)
haben. In enger Verbindung damit ergibt sich das allgemein geringe
forschungspolitische Interesse an Entwicklungsfragen. 
<P>
<li>Es wurde die Forderung gestellt, die explizite Rolle von Wissenschaft
und Forschung im neuen Dreijahresprogramm der &Ouml;EZA zu kl&auml;ren.
<P>
<li>Die wesentliche Rolle der Forschungspartnerschaften zwischen
&Ouml;sterreich und Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern wurde betont. Dabei
spielt die Forschungskooperation nicht nur eine Rolle in der Erzielung
besserer Ergebnisse der EZA, sondern auch als Beitrag zur heute
als wesentlich angesehenen Aufgabe des <I>Capacity Building</I>
der EZA in den Empf&auml;ngerl&auml;ndern.
<P>
<li>Einzelne Wortmeldungen und Teile der Diskussion brachten die
Problematik der Kompetenzverteilung zwischen dem Bundesministerium
f&uuml;r Wissenschaft, Verkehr und Kunst (BMWVK) und der &Ouml;sterreichischen
Entwicklungszusammenarbeit im Bundesministerium f&uuml;r ausw&auml;rtige
Angelegenheiten (BMaA) in Fragen der Entwicklungsforschung zum
Vorschein. Die gegenw&auml;rtige Situation der Zuweisung der Zust&auml;ndigkeit
f&uuml;r Entwicklungsforschung an das BMaA, jene der Forschungskoordination
jedoch an das BMWVK bleibt f&uuml;r die meisten Au&szlig;enstehenden
undurchsichtig und scheint vor allem dazu beizutragen, da&szlig;
es zu wechselseitigen Schuldzuweisungen f&uuml;r Inaktivit&auml;t
in Forschungsfragen kommt. Es wurde der Eindruck vermittelt, da&szlig;
angesichts der gro&szlig;en Bedeutung der beiden Ministerien f&uuml;r
die F&ouml;rderung der Entwicklungsforschung die Herstellung eines
Einvernehmens zwischen den beiden Ministerien eine Grundvoraussetzung
f&uuml;r eine Verbesserung der Forschungssituation darstellt.
<P>
Die Tatsache, da&szlig; auf dem Gebiet der Entwicklungsforschung
als wesentliche Akteure neben den beiden Ministerien die Kommission
f&uuml;r Entwicklungsfragen bei der &Ouml;sterreichischen Akademie
der Wissenschaften und die Rektorenkonferenz t&auml;tig sind,
f&uuml;hrt ein charakteristisches Merkmal der Situation besonders
drastisch vor Augen, n&auml;mlich die Abwesenheit von Universit&auml;tsinstituten
und au&szlig;eruniversit&auml;ren Forschungsinstituten. Dadurch
ergibt sich einerseits eine starke Abkoppelung der Forscherinnen
und Forscher von den wichtigsten Institutionen bzw. Organisationen
und andererseits die Einbeziehung der Forschungskompetenz auf
der Grundlage von personalisierten Beziehungen zwischen Forscherinnen
und Forschern und den Hauptakeuren. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist
die mehrfach gestellte Forderung nach der - seit langem diskutierten
- Errichtung eines Senatsinstituts f&uuml;r Entwicklungspolitik/forschung
zu verstehen.
<P>
<li>Angesichts der bisher von pers&ouml;nlichem Forschungsinteresse
und pers&ouml;nlichen Beziehungen zu den Hauptakteuren gepr&auml;gten
Landschaft der Entwicklungsforschung wurde in der Diskussion auch
Kritik an der fehlenden Programmatik mit feststehenden Kriterien
f&uuml;r die Errichtung von Forschungskooperationen zwischen &Ouml;sterreich
und Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern laut. Es wurde die Ausarbeitung von
Leitlinien f&uuml;r Forschungspartnerschaften (zum Beispiel die
besondere Ber&uuml;cksichtigung von Genderfragen) gefordert. Ebenso
wurde die Notwendigkeit der Festlegung von Forschungsschwerpunkten
auf der Basis der bisher gemachten Erfahrungen betont, wobei einerseits
die Anforderungen an die Forschung seitens der &Ouml;EZA und andererseits
die Feststellung der vorhandenen Forschungskapazit&auml;ten und
die komparativen Vorteile derselben zu ber&uuml;cksichtigen sind.
<P>
Von seiten der &Ouml;EZA wurden folgende programmatische Voraussetzungen
f&uuml;r die wissenschaftliche Forschung genannt:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Schwerpunktl&auml;nder (Nicaragua, &Auml;thiopien, Uganda,
Burkina Faso, Kap Verde, Mosambik, Bhutan)
<P>
<li>sektorpolitische Schwerpunkte: l&auml;ndliche Entwicklung,
Kleingewerbe, Bildung, Wasser und Energie, makro&ouml;konomische
Rahmenbedingungen.
<P>
<li>thematische Schwerpunkte: Armutsbek&auml;mpfung, Geschlechterfragen,
Umwelt, Demokratie.</ul>
<P>
<li>Die Forschungszusammenarbeit soll in das Dreijahresprogramm
aufgenommen werden. Dabei sind die wesentlichen Ziele der wissenschaftlichen
Kooperation zu ber&uuml;cksichtigen:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Organisationsentwicklung (<I>capacity building</I> und
<I>institution building</I>)
<P>
<li>F&ouml;rderung der wissenschaftlichen Kapazit&auml;ten,
insbesondere personeller, in Empf&auml;ngerl&auml;ndern
<P>
<li>Sachleistungen an wissenschaftliche Institute in Empf&auml;ngerl&auml;ndern.</ul>
<P>
<li>Folgende Punkte, die in der Diskussion in verschiedener Weise
angesprochen wurden, enthalten Vorschl&auml;ge f&uuml;r die Erstellung
eines &ouml;sterreichischen F&ouml;rderungskonzepts:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Ausarbeitung eines gemeinsamen Forschungsprogramms von
BMaA und BMWVK;
<P>
<li>insgesamt soll mehr Informationsarbeit &uuml;ber bestehenden
Bedarf an Forschungsbeitr&auml;gen geleistet werden, wobei auch
die Frage der Ausschreibung von wissenschaftlichen Beitr&auml;gen
f&uuml;r die &Ouml;EZA aufgeworfen wurde;
<P>
<li>die Koordination der Forschungsaktivit&auml;ten in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern
soll verbessert werden und Kriterien f&uuml;r die Vergabe von
Forschungsprojekten sind zu erstellen. Als best geeignete Organisation
f&uuml;r die &Uuml;bernahme der Koordinationsfunktion wurde die
Kommission f&uuml;r Entwicklungsfragen bei der &Ouml;sterreichischen
Akademie der Wissenschaften genannt.
<P>
<li>Die Vermittlung zwischen den betreffenden Institutionen
und Organisationen soll verst&auml;rkt werden;
<P>
<li>die Gespr&auml;che zwischen den Institutionen und den Wissenschafterinnen
und Wissenschaftern sollen intensiviert werden;
<P>
<li>eine Pr&uuml;fung aller Finanzierungsm&ouml;glichkeiten
soll vorgenommen werden;
<P>
<li>die Bildung von Forschungspartnerschaften zwischen &ouml;sterreichischen
Einrichtungen und solchen in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern soll als
notwendige Voraussetzung f&uuml;r die Vergabe von Forschungsgeldern
gelten; als ein m&ouml;glicher Ansatzpunkt f&uuml;r wissenschaftliche
Kooperationen k&ouml;nnte das Nord-S&uuml;d-Stipendienprogramm
genutzt werden.</ul>
<P>
<li>Als Voraussetzungen f&uuml;r eine Intensivierung der Entwicklungsforschung,
die sich zum Teil aus den niederl&auml;ndischen und schweizerischen
Verh&auml;ltnissen ableiten, wurden genannt:
<P>
<ul>
<li>verst&auml;rkte Legitimit&auml;t,
<P>
<li>Institutionalisierung der Entwicklungsforschung,
<P>
<li>st&auml;rkere Profilierung und Spezialisierung,
<P>
<li>Bedacht auf die kritische Rolle der Universit&auml;ten
und
<P>
<li>die Suche nach Kontakt und Dialog mit der Wirtschaft.</ul></ol>
<P>
<hr> 
<P>
<a name=emp></a><h3>Empfehlungen</h3>
<P>
<ol>
<li>Die Einrichtungen der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit sollen anerkennen,
da&szlig; Wissenschaft und Forschung einen wichtigen Beitrag zu
einer dauerhaften Entwicklung leisten. Die wissenschaftlichen
Institutionen sollen ihre Partner in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern
auch in der Praxis als Teil der internationalen Wissenschaftsgemeinschaft
anerkennen. Unterschiedliche Quantit&auml;t und Qualit&auml;t
des Wissenschaftsbetriebs d&uuml;rfen keinen grunds&auml;tzlichen
Hinderungsgrund f&uuml;r Partnerschaften darstellen. 
<P>
<li>Eine engere Kooperation zwischen den Institutionen der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit
und der Wissenschaft ist daher unter Bedachtnahme auf das jeweils
geltende Drei-Jahresprogramm der &ouml;sterreichischen EZA sowohl
bei der Ausarbeitung von Strategien als auch in der Projektarbeit
und deren Finanzierung anzustreben. Die engere Zusammenarbeit
soll dazu beitragen, den vorhandenen R&uuml;ckstand &Ouml;sterreichs
in der kooperativen, entwicklungsorientierten Forschung aufzuholen.
<P>
<li>Damit dies effektiv und effizient geschieht, soll gemeinsam ein
mittelfristiges Strategieprogramm ausgearbeitet werden. Im Interesse
beider Bereiche sollen bestehende Kooperationsl&uuml;cken zwischen
EZA und Wissenschaft &uuml;berbr&uuml;ckt und somit Synergien
zwischen bisher isolierten Ans&auml;tzen hergestellt werden. &quot;Forschungs-partnerschaft
mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern&quot; soll mit diesem Progamm dauerhaft
in die Forschungs- wie in die Entwicklungspolitik integriert werden.
<P>
<li>Mit der Beratung, Koordinierung und Abwicklung dieses Strategieprogramms
soll von den beiden zust&auml;ndigen Ressorts die Kommission f&uuml;r
Entwicklungsfragen betraut werden. Diese hat die Details des Programms,
wie sie zum gro&szlig;en Teil in der Arbeitstagung vorgeschlagen
wurden, auszuarbeiten, wobei Interdisziplinarit&auml;t, Langfristigkeit
und regionale Breitenwirkung wichtige Kriterien darstellen. Es
ist in entsprechender Weise auf bestehende Forschungskapazit&auml;ten
R&uuml;cksicht zu nehmen; gew&uuml;nschte Anpassungen sind zu
f&ouml;rdern.
<P>
<li>Die Kommission f&uuml;r Entwicklungsfragen soll auch als Programmkomitee
zur Beratung &uuml;ber forschungspolitische Positionen und Strategien
f&uuml;r die &ouml;sterreichische Beteiligung an der Aktionslinie
II (Zusammenarbeit mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern/INCO/DC) des jeweiligen
Rahmenprogramms f&uuml;r Forschung und Technologie der EU fungieren.
<P>
<li>Die Institutionalisierung der Entwicklungsforschung im universit&auml;ren
Bereich ist durch die Errichtung eines Senatsinstituts f&uuml;r
Entwicklungspolitik zu verwirklichen.</ol>

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of Austrian Development Cooperation</h3>

Official Austrian development cooperation started in the mid 1970s, based on charitable church-related and a
voluntary tradition of assistance to post-war European countries and refugees. Attention and assistance
traditionally were more focused on the consequences of East - West conflicts than on North - South
relations. Its neutral position in international politics facilitated Austria's intermediary role in UN affairs.
North - South development cooperation received rather belatedly attention in Austrian politics. Although the
majority of the Austrian public has a positive attitude towards development cooperation, it does not yet
appear to be well informed on this point, and appears to overestimate current Austrian development efforts.
Development education activities are stepped up by the Government. 
<p>
Net official development assistance amounted to US $ 556 million in 1992, which was 0.30 per cent of
GNP. This percentage was 0.25 cent in 1990 and 0.34 in 1991. The Government has stated the intention to
reach the DAC average (1990) for ODA of 0.35 per cent of GNP and, later, the EU average for ODA of
0.51 per cent. In 1992 24 per cent of Austria's ODA was disbursed through multilateral channels.
Multilateral contributions increase faster than the bilateral component, and will continue to do so as a
consequence of Austria's EU membership. 
<p>
<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>
<p>
The legislative basis for Austria's aid programme is the Development Cooperation Act of 1974 and
subsequent Acts in 1977, 1983 and 1989. Development cooperation is not the responsibility of one minister,
but is spread over several ministries. Till 1989 development cooperation was the responsibility of the
Federal Chancellor and thereafter the competence of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Since 1991 a State
Secretary for Integration and Development Cooperation, who heads the Department for Development
Cooperation in the Federal Chancellery (BKA) is responsible. The State Secretary is responsible for:
bilateral technical aid, co-financing programmes, humanitarian and emergency aid and parts of the
multilateral financial assistance. The financial efforts in these areas however, amount to less than 30 per
cent of the bilateral programme in 1992. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is responsible for multilateral aid.
The Ministry of Finance is responsible for financial aid (a.o. debt relief) and concessional official export
credits. The Ministry of the Interior is responsible for aid to refugees (in Austria), the Ministry of
Agriculture for food aid and the Ministry of Science and Research as well as the Ministry of Education are
both partly responsible for the scholarship programme. 
<p>
Since Austrian law does not allow the government to carry out its own programmes (principle of
subsidiarity), there is no governmental aid agency for the implementation of project. Implementation is
contracted out to private firms and NGOs or implemented by the federal Lnder and Municipalities.
<p>
The Secretary at the BKA is responsible for the overall coordination, programming and reporting on aid
policies, with the above mentioned extensive limitations. Policy planning is done by a Planning and
Programming which comes under the competence of the Department for Development Cooperation of the
BKA. During the coming re-organisation the number and expertise of the currently small number of staff in
the department will be enlarged and up-graded. 
<p>
To strengthen the coordination of the aid programme an Interministerial Committee for the Coordination of
Aid was established in 1992, including a dozen senior officials of the various ministries. The Committee is
chaired by the Director-General of the Department for Development Cooperation. The Committee can issue
non-binding recommendations only. 
<p>
<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>
<p>
In 1974 an Advisory Council on Development Cooperation (Beirat) was established in order to guarantee a
coordinated development policy and implementation. The Council could advise the Federal Chancellor on
these matters. The ca. 50 members of the Council are appointed by the Federal Chancellor and represent all
major sections in society, including Members of Parliament of the Standing Committee for Foreign Affairs,
representatives of NGOs, industry, and trade unions. It is chaired by the State Secretary for Integration and
Development Cooperation.
<p>
The Council meets three or four times a year. Meetings are held at the request of the State Secretary. The
Council does not write reports or recommendations. It is a panel for discussion with the State Secretary.
Discussions are considered as an input for policy formulation which is executed by the State Secretary and
the officials involved. The Council's main function is preserving the support for development cooperation in
Austrian society. It discusses amongst others: DAC reports, the negotiations with EU and the government's
Three-Year Programme for Development Cooperation. The operational criteria for Austrian development
cooperation were elaborated in 1979 and 1980 by a working group of the Council, based on the 1974 Law.
The Council appears to play a minor role since. The Council has no Secretariat. Members can be contacted
through the Federal Chancellery. The Council does not publish any documents of its discussions and its
present agenda is not known.
<p>
In order to improve its functioning working groups were established in 1992 on environmental questions and
on human rights. In the DAC Aid Review of 1992/93 the Austrian government is invited to reconsider the
role of the Advisory Council with regard to obtaining the necessary support of the population for an
enlarged and improved aid programme. In view of greater efficiency, a reduction of the number of Council
Members should be considered. 
<p>
Parliament has a Standing Sub-Committee on Development Policy (under the responsibility of the Standing
Committee for Foreign Affairs) which sets its own agenda. Parliament apparently does not show great
interest in questions of aid. Debates on government reports submitted to Parliament have been held
belatedly. In 1988 Parliament conducted an enquiry into the development assistance, but there has been no
active follow up reported.
<p>
<a name="ngo"><HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>
<p>
There are many small, mainly church related NGOs and a number of large ones. In 1991/1992 sixty per
cent of the bilateral aid was channelled through fifty NGOs. Four NGOs accounted for two-thirds of funds
made available. The NGOs continuously urge the government to improve the performance of its aid
programme and to raise the volume of aid. Discussions with the government concentrate on the question
whether 
NGOs can be discussion partners for the government in development cooperation policy matters or whether
they are subcontractors for implementation of projects only. In 1993 the Government and NGOs entered into
serious negotiations in order to establish a long term cooperation programme between government and
NGOs. An umbrella organisation of several development NGOs, the Working Association for Development
Cooperation (AGEZ), is acknowledged by the Government as a discussion partner on issues such as the
quality of Austrian aid and the consequences of Austria's EU membership. 
<p>
The NGOs can be roughly divided into four categories: firstly, organisations for the care of foreign students
in Austria (which originated in the late 1950s at the universities); experts and volunteer sending
organisations, organised in the Institute for International Cooperation and in the Austrian Development
Service; third, NGOs that implement projects in developing countries and fourth, NGOs for information and
development education.
<p>
According to the 1991 OECD/EADI survey 11 institutes qualify as Development Research and Training
Institutes. Several contribute to the debate on development policy and implementation, such as the Vienna
Institute for Development Cooperation, the Austrian Foundation for Development Cooperation and the
Austrian Research Foundation for Development Cooperation. The latter institute publishes an annual survey
and analyses of Austria's development cooperation.

<html><head><title>'People with AIDS the bosses', says new UN agency chief</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><img src="panos_pix/panos_logo.gif"><br><i>The material that follows has been provided by <a href="panos_info.html"> Panos </i> </a><hr><h3>'People with AIDS the bosses', says new UN agency chief</h3>Geneva: People with AIDS will play a key role at a new United Nations organisation set up to combat the AIDS epidemic, says its new director <p>The new organisation - UNAIDS - starts work on January 1, 1996 and is designed to coordinate the AIDS work of six UN organisations - the World Bank, the World Health Organization, the UN Development Programme, the UN Children's Fund, the UN Population Fund and the UN Education Scientific and Cultural Organisation.<p>Its establishment reflects concerns that previous efforts have sometimes duplicated each other and responds to a new urgency to find more effective strategies to combat the epidemic.<p>Dr Peter Piot, the head of UNAIDS, says the organisation's board of directors will be made up of representatives of community groups and non-government organisations, with a special role for people with AIDS.<p>"This is the first time people from the community level have been on the board of a UN agency," Piot said in an interview with Panos.<p>"They bring the epidemic into the boardroom. They are my bosses - they will ensure that we don't divert our attention from the epidemic to all kinds of political and bureaucratic disputes."<p>Piot has been involved in AIDS prevention since the earliest days of the epidemic, when he worked in Zaire in the early 1980s. He acknowledges there is frustration with how little progress there has been in combating the epidemic.<p>"In the beginning people didn't realise how important AIDS was, or anticipate how it would change the future of mankind," he says. <p>"It took several years before we realized how HIV is transmitted. Then we very quickly developed a test to determine whether someone was infected, and then shortly after that we even had the start of a treatment. But since 1985 or 1986, progress has been very slow."<p>Piot argues that the pandemic is too complex and affects too many different sectors of society and government for just one organisation to come up with the best responses to it.<p>"We have learned that AIDS is a very complex issue. There are no simple solutions for people who are infected or for those who are at risk. Several agencies of the UN have become involved, both in prevention and, to a lesser extent, in care and support of those who are infected.<p>"There has not been much coordination of these efforts. There has been duplication of work in the same country and even conflicts between different agencies. We need to use our resources more efficiently. So much has to be done, and not using resources well is unethical. That is why UNAIDS was created - to improve the UN response and the response of various governments to AIDS."<p>Some critics have claimed that the new organisation will be riven by political struggles and arguments between the different agencies. Piot says he is determined that this will not happen. <p>He also stresses that AIDS must stop being pigeon-holed as simply another disease - that it belongs on a wider political agenda.<p>"We will be working with governments and donors to make them realise that if we don't work together to fight AIDS then we can forget about many other things in terms of economic or social development," he says.<p>"It is clear that AIDS will be with us for generations to come. It is not like an outbreak of something like Ebola virus that strikes and goes away. We have to start thinking about long term approaches."<p>Dealing with AIDS means tackling discrimination in society, he says, but he cautions against raising expectations of how much  the UN can do to change attitudes. <p>"We wish to work on the factors in society that make people more vulnerable to infection such as discrimination against sex workers, migrants or ethnic minorities. <p>"But we have to be realistic. Some communities have unrealistic expectations of what a UN agency can do. An independent NGO (non-governmental organisation) can do a much better job of monitoring human rights abuses than we can. We have to work with the governments that might be violating human rights. We can...mobilise them politically, but we can't change them overnight.<p>"We want to stick our necks out, but there are limits."<p>A priority for the new agency will be to expand efforts to help people living with AIDS and those who are ill, Piot says. <p>"In the past, most emphasis has been placed upon preventing new cases of infection. Of course that will continue. We have got to do a better job of prevention and do more, but now with more and more people becoming infected and becoming ill we cannot continue to ignore the need for care and support."<p>Piot also says he believes that more can be done to provide treatment to people with HIV/AIDS in the developing world: "It is not that expensive to prevent and even cure a number of opportunistic infections associated with AIDS (although not AIDS itself). There is a lot that can be done with drugs made locally, but physicians don't even know about them."<p>One of the biggest potential problems facing the new organisation is funding. Piot insists that, despite the pressure on development budgets, Western governments need to understand that AIDS prevention is an investment and not a cost. <p>Nevertheless, he argues, "we should think not only in terms of money set aside specifically for AIDS but we should also ensure that AIDS is on the agenda of other development projects - such as World Bank loans, women and development projects, health and social services projects." <p>Already there have been major financial disappointments - including the recent news that the French Government has cut its funding commitment to the new organisation.<p>More funds need to come from those countries most at risk, Piot says, not just from the industrialised aid donor countries.<p>"In many countries, AIDS is still perceived as something from the outside. Up to now it was almost entirely supported by external money. It is time to change that," Piot asserts.more ... <p>Some countries are beginning to do so, he says, and he cites Thailand as a "shining example": "The government budget for AIDS activities in Thailand for next year is about US$60 million. That is the same amount of money (UNAIDS) will have for the whole world. Thailand does this because it recognises that it is so important for its own development and for the future."<p>While Asian and Latin American countries may be able to afford to follow Thailand's example, much of Africa is struggling with terrible economic problems, and will have to continue to rely on external money to fund its AIDS care and prevention programmes. For this reason sub-Saharan Africa, Piot says, will be UNAIDS' priority. <p>Piot stresses one point above all else - the importance of involving people with HIV and AIDS in every element of the struggle against the epidemic, from the boardroom to the community.<p>The biggest contribution that people with HIV and AIDS can make, he argues, is "to live as fully as possible and spread the message that life is worth living, and that you can do something about the epidemic.<p>"You must also hang together. Solidarity is extremely important. There is very little anyone can do on their own."<p>©Copyright: Panos 22 November 1995                                                      <hr><a href="index.html"><img src="panos_pix/panos_logo2.gif"> PANOS Home Page</a><hr></body></html>

Si la petite taille du Cap-vert, la dispersion de son territoire
sur de nombreux &icirc;les et &icirc;lots, son climat sah&eacute;lien
en butte continuellement &agrave; la s&eacute;cheresse et &agrave;
l'aridit&eacute; du sol, sa faible population - moins d'un demi-million
d'habitants - expliquent sa grande pauvret&eacute; et exigent
pour sa survie et son d&eacute;veloppement une aide importante
de l'ext&eacute;rieur, ce sont les efforts consentis par ce petit
pays pour assainir son &eacute;conomie, et profiter au maximum
de l'aide ext&eacute;rieure qui lui ont valu une attention particuli&egrave;re
des bailleurs de fonds. Ce n'est pas par hasard que la Commission
europ&eacute;enne a d&eacute;cid&eacute; l'ann&eacute;e derni&egrave;re
d'augmenter de 7% - soit un surplus de 1,7 million d'ECU - sa
dotation au Programme indicatif national de ce pays dans le cadre
de la Convention de Lom&eacute; (Lom&eacute; IV, premier protocole
1990-95, 7&egrave;me FED). Le Cap-vert avait d&eacute;j&agrave;
engag&eacute; la quasi-totalit&eacute; des 23 MECU qui lui avaient
&eacute;t&eacute; allou&eacute;s, signe d'une administration soucieuse
d'utiliser pleinement l'aide re&ccedil;ue.
<P>
<H3>Quand le r&eacute;alisme est un luxe</H3>
<P>
 Imaginez qu'une &icirc;le habit&eacute;e par une population de
cent soixante mille habitants, l'&icirc;le de S&atilde;o Vicente,
o&ugrave; est situ&eacute;e Mindelo, la deuxi&egrave;me ville
du pays avec 70.000 habitants, ne poss&egrave;de aucune source
d'eau potable. Avant, l'eau arrivait par bateau de l'&icirc;le
voisine de Santo Ant&atilde;o. Cette ville s'est actuellement
&eacute;quip&eacute;e de plusieurs unit&eacute;s de dessalement
de l'eau de mer, la plupart venant d'Isra&euml;l, qui l'alimentent
&agrave; cent pour cent. La fourniture d'eau comme celle d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute;
est g&eacute;r&eacute;e par la soci&eacute;t&eacute; publique
Electra qui avait b&eacute;n&eacute;fici&eacute; dans le cadre
du FED (Fonds europ&eacute;en de D&eacute;veloppement) d'une aide
de la Commission europ&eacute;enne pour augmenter ses capacit&eacute;s
en &eacute;lectricit&eacute; en se dotant, de trois &eacute;oliennes
de fabrication danoise qui fournissent &agrave; elles seules 13
% de la consommation non industrielle de l'&icirc;le. Le dessalement
de l'eau de mer, les &eacute;oliennes, toutes solutions consid&eacute;r&eacute;es
ailleurs comme irr&eacute;alistes. Pour cent soixante mille personnes
sans une goutte d'eau, le r&eacute;alisme est parfois un luxe.

<P>
Si l'&icirc;le de Santiago qui abrite la capitale Praia n'est
pas aussi d&eacute;pourvue de sources naturelles d'eau, ses ressources
hydriques sont loin d'&ecirc;tre suffisantes pour son approvisionnement.
L'un des projets financ&eacute;s r&eacute;cemment par l'Union
europ&eacute;enne a pris en charge l'am&eacute;lioration des r&eacute;seaux
de distribution d'eau, l'assainissement et le drainage des eaux
pluviales. Ces travaux concernent entre autres le recyclage des
eaux us&eacute;es que l'&icirc;le ne peut se permettre de perdre.
Le point faible du Cap vert est certainement le manque d'eau.
Son point fort, sans conteste, le dynamisme de sa population.

<P>
A la D&eacute;l&eacute;gation de la Commission au Cap-vert, on
consid&egrave;re que les interventions &agrave; Praia, relatives
&agrave; la distribution et &agrave; l'assainissement de l'eau
et ceux de soutien aux quartiers pauvres de la capitale menac&eacute;s
de surpeuplement parall&egrave;lement au d&eacute;peuplement d'autres
r&eacute;gions du pays, sont symboliques de la volont&eacute;
de l'UE de tenir compte simultan&eacute;ment de cette faiblesse
et de cette force, et sont repr&eacute;sentatives de la vocation
de l'aide communautaire dans ce pays. De fa&ccedil;on g&eacute;n&eacute;rale,
cette aide se concentre sur les infrastructures - production et
distribution d'eau et d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute;, am&eacute;nagement
urbain - d'une part et sur la formation et la sant&eacute; d'autre
part.
<P>
Le centre historique de Praia, &quot;le Plateau&quot; riche d'une
belle architecture coloniale et n&eacute;o-classique est en train
de perdre beaucoup de ses constructions abandonn&eacute;es par
des propri&eacute;taires incapables de les entretenir. L'aide
communautaire s'est port&eacute;e sur ce patrimoine en perdition.
Elle serait insuffisante pour financer la r&eacute;novation du
Plateau, mais &agrave; l'instar du gouvernement capverdien qui
a maintenu dans un tr&egrave;s bon &eacute;tat les b&acirc;timents
administratifs ou de l'exemplaire r&eacute;novation du si&egrave;ge
du Centre culturel fran&ccedil;ais, la Commission va probablement
prendre en charge la r&eacute;novation d'une superbe b&acirc;tisse
du si&egrave;cle pass&eacute;e, la &quot;Casa Cor-de-Rosa&quot;
pas seulement pour la restaurer mais pour en faire le coeur d'un
projet plus global de formation de professionnels du b&acirc;timent
&agrave; la restauration, et d'incitation &agrave; la sauvegarde
du centre historique, destin&eacute; &agrave; servir d'exemple
pour les futurs acqu&eacute;reurs, institutions, entreprises et
particuliers, parmi ces derniers, les &eacute;migr&eacute;s qui
alimentent en grande partie l'entreprise du b&acirc;timent.
<P>
La Communaut&eacute; a financ&eacute; une &eacute;tude de sauvegarde
du Centre historique de la capitale qui a servi de guide &agrave;
la Municipalit&eacute; de Praia. Un projet d'un million d'Ecu,
entrant dans le projet global d'am&eacute;nagement de la ville
de Praia, en cours actuellement, aide celle-ci &agrave; r&eacute;aliser
une op&eacute;ration pilote, la restauration d'un &icirc;lot,
dont le but premier est la formation de techniciens capverdiens.
Encore dans le domaine de la formation, ont &eacute;t&eacute;
r&eacute;alis&eacute;s les travaux de construction de l'Ecole
technique de Praia. La phase suivante, d'un montant de pr&egrave;s
d'un million d'ECU doit financer la fourniture d'&eacute;quipements
et la formation d'enseignants. 
<P>
Toujours dans le cadre du projet global d'am&eacute;nagement de
la ville de Praia, un projet du FED d'un montant d'1,3 million
d'ECU est consacr&eacute; &agrave; l'am&eacute;nagement d'une
zone destin&eacute;e &agrave; accueillir un site industriel. Un
projet d'&eacute;lectrification rurale dans les environs de Praia
s'est vu allou&eacute; &agrave; la fin de l'ann&eacute;e derni&egrave;re
un budget d'un million et demi d'ECU. Il b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiera
&agrave; une population de sept mille cinq cents personnes vivant
dans les trois centres ruraux les plus peupl&eacute;s de l'&icirc;le
de Santiago. La r&eacute;alisation technique des travaux sera
confi&eacute;e &agrave; l'entreprise publique Electra, le priv&eacute;
se chargeant de la fourniture d'&eacute;quipements et de la surveillance
des travaux.
<P>
<H3>La &quot;capverdianit&eacute;&quot; comme ressource</H3>
<P>
Les dirigeants du Cap vert insistent r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement
sur la richesse que constitue ce qu'ils appellent la capverdianit&eacute;
pour un pays aussi pauvre que le leur. De fait, ce pays, malgr&eacute;
des moyens limit&eacute;s d&eacute;ploient beaucoup d'&eacute;nergie
et d'ing&eacute;niosit&eacute; &agrave; &quot;cultiver&quot; sa
culture. Deux projets financ&eacute;s dans le cadre du Programme
indicatif national de ce pays et totalisant un demi-million d'ECU
concernent deux longs m&eacute;trages cin&eacute;matographiques,
ils devront contribuer &agrave; rompre l'isolement des &icirc;les
en faisant mieux conna&icirc;tre sa culture et son peuple &agrave;
l'&eacute;tranger. Le premier film tourn&eacute; durant l'ann&eacute;e
1995 &quot;Ilheu de contenda&quot; constitue le premier long m&eacute;trage
de fiction du Cap vert. C'est l'oeuvre du r&eacute;alisateur Le&atilde;o
Lopes inspir&eacute; de l'ouvrage d'un autre enfant du pays, Teixeira
de Sousa, centr&eacute; sur l'histoire du Cap vert et la gen&egrave;se
de son identit&eacute; nationale. La participation du FED (environ
250 mille ECUS) correspond &agrave; 14% du montant total de la
production. Ce film est actuellement diffus&eacute; dans certains
pays europ&eacute;ens. C'est &agrave; quelques milliers d'ECU
pr&egrave;s la m&ecirc;me participation qui est prise dans une
autre production, d'un r&eacute;alisateur portugais cette fois,
Francisco Manso, mais bas&eacute;e sur un roman d'un auteur capverdien,
Germano de Almeida &quot;O testamento do Sr. Napuceno&quot;, dont
le tournage se faisait sur l'&icirc;le de S&atilde;o Vicente au
moment de notre visite. Ce film est financ&eacute; pour moiti&eacute;
par des producteurs portugais, les autres coproducteurs sont fran&ccedil;ais
et belge. 
<P>
Parmi les autres projets du FED r&eacute;alis&eacute;s r&eacute;cemment
ou en cours de r&eacute;alisation, on peut retenir celui d'am&eacute;lioration
des infrastructures routi&egrave;res (3 MECU) des &icirc;les de
Santiago, S. Nicolau et Maio et un programme de micror&eacute;alisations
d'un million d'ECU. En plus du Fonds europ&eacute;en de d&eacute;veloppement,
Le Cap Vert a re&ccedil;u, dans le cadre de la Convention de Lom&eacute;,
d'autres financements, dont 700.000 ECU au titre des transferts
Stabex pour les pertes subies dans le secteur de la banane durant
l'ann&eacute;e 1994.
<P>
<H3>Dessine-moi un micro-climat </H3>
<P>
La faiblesse de la production qui ne couvre qu'une petite partie
de la consommation rend imp&eacute;rative l'aide alimentaire ext&eacute;rieure.
La derni&egrave;re intervention du Budget Aide alimentaire de
la Commission se chiffrait &agrave; pr&egrave;s de deux millions
d'ECU. D'autres lignes budg&eacute;taires sp&eacute;ciales interviennenet
comme celle de&quot;Droits de l'Homme et d&eacute;mocratisation
dans les PVD.&quot;
<P>
Pour un voyageur &eacute;tranger attentif, l'une des r&eacute;alisations
les plus int&eacute;ressantes du Cap Vert est le progr&egrave;s
du reboisement sur un sol tellement ingrat. L'un de ces aires
de reboisement, d'une superficie de cinq mille hectares r&eacute;alis&eacute;
de 1990 &agrave; 1994 sert justement de base &agrave; un projet
r&eacute;gional de diffusion du savoir-faire accumul&eacute; dans
ce domaine au Cap Vert. Des stages de formation ont permis &agrave;
des techniciens et &agrave; d'autres personnes impliqu&eacute;es
dans la reforestation dans les pays du Sahel d'apprivoiser les
m&eacute;thodes qui ont fait leurs preuves ici. La production
et la diffusion d'outils p&eacute;dagogiques - livres, affiches,
films, etc - compl&egrave;tent le projet. Le Cap Vert est parvenu
depuis l'ind&eacute;pendance &agrave; d&eacute;cupler sa superficie
bois&eacute;e, c'est vrai qu'il &eacute;tait parti de peu, mais
les conditions climatiques &eacute;tant si difficiles, ce r&eacute;sultat
peut s'assimiler &agrave; un exploit. On se met m&ecirc;me &agrave;
esp&eacute;rer l'apparition de micro-climat. Dans l'&icirc;le
de Santiago, sur certains de ces nouveaux espaces verts, les canards
sauvages qui avaient disparu depuis longtemps sont revenus. Il
ne faut pas prendre un canard sauvage pour un enfant du bon Dieu,
mais on peut r&ecirc;ver.

<h4>Texte int&#233;gral d'un article paru dans <i>le Courrier ACP-UE</i><br>no. 157,
mai-juin 1996: pages 35 - 36</h4>
<h5>(N.B.: Ce texte peut diverger quelque peu de la version originale)

<br>

</center><hr>
<B>Les domaines prioritaires de la coop&eacute;ration entre l'Union
europ&eacute;enne et le Kenya ont &eacute;t&eacute;, au fil des
diff&eacute;rentes Conventions &agrave; partir de Lom&eacute;
I en 1975, le d&eacute;veloppement rural et l'autosuffisance alimentaire,
de m&ecirc;me que, dans une moindre mesure, l'&eacute;nergie,
le commerce et l'industrie, la sant&eacute; et l'&eacute;ducation.
Le programme des micror&eacute;alisations a traditionnellement
&eacute;t&eacute;, lui aussi, un volet important de cette coop&eacute;ration
et la onzi&egrave;me tranche vient d'en &ecirc;tre annonc&eacute;e.
</B>
<P>
Etant donn&eacute; qu'il tire la plus grande partie de ses recettes
&agrave; l'exportation de produits tels que le th&eacute; et le
caf&eacute;, le Kenya a largement b&eacute;n&eacute;fici&eacute;
du Stabex, ce syst&egrave;me qui contribue &agrave; compenser
les pertes subies par les grands secteurs d'exportations agricoles
lors d'une chute des prix sur les march&eacute;s mondiaux.
<P>
Au niveau r&eacute;gional, le r&eacute;seau routier, qui permet
aux voisins du Kenya d'acc&eacute;der au port de Mombasa, reste
un domaine prioritaire de la politique de d&eacute;veloppement
de l'UE, le Kenya lui-m&ecirc;me trouvant &eacute;videmment son
compte dans ce contexte.
<P>
L'assistance communautaire au Kenya a &eacute;t&eacute; touch&eacute;e
depuis 1991 par les tensions politiques survenues dans les relations
de ce pays avec la Banque mondiale et le FMI. Lors de la r&eacute;union
du Groupe consultatif en novembre 1991, les donateurs ont d&eacute;cid&eacute;
de suspendre leur aide &agrave; d&eacute;boursement rapide au
Kenya car ils n'&eacute;taient pas satisfaits des progr&egrave;s
accomplis en termes de droits de l'homme, de bonne gestion de
l'Etat et de r&eacute;forme &eacute;conomique. Cette d&eacute;cision
signifiait la perte d'un apport d'aide &eacute;valu&eacute; &agrave;
40 millions de dollars par mois. Cette situation s'est r&eacute;percut&eacute;e
sur l'assistance de l'UE dans le cadre de projets visant &agrave;
l'ajustement de l'&eacute;conomie, et plus particuli&egrave;rement
la r&eacute;forme du secteur des c&eacute;r&eacute;ales que devaient
soutenir Lom&eacute; III et IV. Les relations se sont am&eacute;lior&eacute;es
au cours de l'ann&eacute;e 1993 mais l'avancement des r&eacute;formes
structurelles reste sous haute surveillance, et une attention
particuli&egrave;re est accord&eacute;e aux droits de l'homme
et aux questions de d&eacute;mocratie.
<P>
<B>Lom&eacute; I et II</B> 
<P>
La plus grande partie de l'allocation de 72 millions ECU octroy&eacute;e
au titre de Lom&eacute; I (1976-1980) a &eacute;t&eacute; consacr&eacute;e
au d&eacute;veloppement rural et &agrave; l'&eacute;nergie, et
notamment au vaste projet de l'Upper Tana Reservoir (26,3 millions
ECU). Un montant de 20 millions a &eacute;t&eacute; affect&eacute;
au MIDP (Machakos Integrated Development Programme), destin&eacute;
&agrave; am&eacute;liorer le rendement agricole, la gestion de
l'eau et du sol et le niveau g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de vie. On
peut citer, parmi les autres projets, le renforcement des services
relatifs aux animaux dans la Province littorale, l'appui aux ateliers
ruraux et la contribution &agrave; l'am&eacute;lioration des conditions
de vie &agrave; Kawangware et dans la Mathare Valley dans l'agglom&eacute;ration
de Nairobi.
<P>
Le Kenya a &eacute;t&eacute; le principal b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire
ACP des pr&ecirc;ts de la BEI (Banque europ&eacute;enne d'Investissement)
au titre de Lom&eacute; I. Un montant total de 53,6 millions lui
a &eacute;t&eacute; affect&eacute; dans ce contexte en vue du
financement du barrage de Masinga, de la Kenya Tea Development
Authority, de la Development Finance Corporation et de l'Industrial
Development Bank, entre autres.
<P>
Les micror&eacute;alisations ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&egrave;s
le d&eacute;part une composante majeure de la politique de d&eacute;veloppement
de l'UE au Kenya. Il s'agit de projets bas&eacute;s sur l'auto-assistance
: l'ex&eacute;cution en incombe &agrave; la population locale
mais le financement est largement assur&eacute; par l'UE. Un montant
de 2,4 millions ECU a &eacute;t&eacute; affect&eacute; aux micror&eacute;alisations
dans le cadre de Lom&eacute; I avec une priorit&eacute; pour le
mat&eacute;riel et l'&eacute;quipement scolaires, les petits projets
d'irrigation et les projets li&eacute;s &agrave; la distribution
de l'eau.
<P>
Les principaux projets r&eacute;gionaux d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s
au titre de la premi&egrave;re Convention ont port&eacute; sur
la construction d'une liaison routi&egrave;re entre Lodwar (nord-ouest
du Kenya) et Juba au Soudan, ainsi que sur le renforcement du
r&eacute;seau d'aviation civile et de t&eacute;l&eacute;communications
couvrant les &icirc;les de l'Oc&eacute;an indien, la Corne de
l'Afrique et l'Afrique de l'Est.
<P>
Un montant de 88 millions ECU a &eacute;t&eacute; pr&eacute;vu
dans le cadre du Programme indicatif national (PIN) de Lom&eacute;
II pour la p&eacute;riode 1980-1985. Il a notamment servi &agrave;
la poursuite du MIDP tandis qu'un projet de grande envergure &eacute;tait
entrepris en vue de la r&eacute;habilitation de la production
de riz au Kenya occidental (Province de Nyanza), dans les vall&eacute;es
mar&eacute;cageuses du district de Kisii. L'objectif &eacute;tait
l'expansion des terres agricoles dans cette r&eacute;gion particuli&egrave;rement
peupl&eacute;e. Les pr&ecirc;ts de la BEI se sont &eacute;lev&eacute;s
&agrave; 47 millions ECU au cours de cette m&ecirc;me p&eacute;riode.
Les fonds r&eacute;gionaux ont &agrave; nouveau &eacute;t&eacute;
ax&eacute;s sur le transport avec une priorit&eacute; &agrave;
l'am&eacute;lioration du Corridor du Nord qui relie Mombasa avec
l'Ouganda, le Rwanda, le Za&iuml;re et le Soudan. Une aide au
titre &quot;r&eacute;gional&quot; a &eacute;galement &eacute;t&eacute;
fournie &agrave; des projets de recherche destin&eacute;s &agrave;
lutter contre les insectes migrants d'Afrique de l'Est ainsi qu'&agrave;
des campagnes contre la mouche ts&eacute;-ts&eacute;.
<P>
<B>Lom&eacute; III : lenteur d'ex&eacute;cution</B> 
<P>
Le PIN de Lom&eacute; III (1985-1990) affectait 128 millions ECU
aux programmes et projets de d&eacute;veloppement, ainsi que 7
millions suppl&eacute;mentaires &agrave; une facilit&eacute; sp&eacute;ciale
d'all&egrave;gement de la dette. Ce PIN a &eacute;t&eacute; consacr&eacute;
&agrave; 80 % au d&eacute;veloppement rural, et plus particuli&egrave;rement
&agrave; la s&eacute;curit&eacute; alimentaire et l'auto-suffisance
- le solde de 20 % allant &agrave; des projets dans le secteur
du commerce, de l'industrie, du transport et des communications.
<P>
La mise en oeuvre a &eacute;t&eacute; laborieuse. Le programme
de soutien au secteur des c&eacute;r&eacute;ales (23 millions
ECU) a &eacute;t&eacute; suspendu, l'avancement des r&eacute;formes
&eacute;tant jug&eacute; trop lent. Un projet de recensement du
cheptel et la mise en oeuvre d'un projet agricole de base &agrave;
Isiolo ont &eacute;galement enregistr&eacute; certains retards,
bien qu'ils semblent aujourd'hui bien repartis.
<P>
Le KARI (Kenya Agricultural Research Institute) pourrait b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier
d'une partie du solde de Lom&eacute; III mais des &quot;conditionnalit&eacute;s
sectorielles&quot; pourraient &ecirc;tre appliqu&eacute;es aux
futurs versements. Elles s'inscriraient dans la rationalisation
pr&eacute;vue par le programme de r&eacute;forme &eacute;conomique
de trois ans publi&eacute; en f&eacute;vrier en collaboration
avec le FMI et la Banque mondiale.
<P>
Les versements au titre de la neuvi&egrave;me et de la dixi&egrave;me
tranche du programme de micror&eacute;alisations se poursuivent
en d&eacute;pit de retards importants et de l'annonce d'un r&eacute;examen
&quot;financier et technique&quot; dans ce domaine. Les pr&ecirc;ts
de la BEI au Kenya dans le cadre de Lom&eacute; III concernent
notamment la modernisation du port de Mombasa, le d&eacute;veloppement
du secteur du th&eacute;, l'appui au secteur industriel et l'am&eacute;lioration
de la distribution d'eau &agrave; Nairobi.
<P>
L'un des grands projets r&eacute;gionaux de Lom&eacute; III a
&eacute;t&eacute; la r&eacute;habilitation de 103 km de l'axe
routier entre Nairobi et la fronti&egrave;re ougandaise. Des ressources
d'un montant de 50,9 millions ECU ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;bloqu&eacute;es
&agrave; cette fin dans le cadre du programme national et r&eacute;gional.
<P>
<B>Lom&eacute; IV va de l'avant</B> 
<P>
Le PIN de 140 millions ECU d&eacute;cid&eacute; pour le Kenya
au titre de Lom&eacute; IV a &eacute;t&eacute; revu en 1995 avec
la signature d'un protocole d'accord tenant compte des nouvelles
r&eacute;formes &eacute;conomiques entreprises par le gouvernement.
Cette r&eacute;orientation a eu pour cons&eacute;quence principale,
comme d&eacute;j&agrave; indiqu&eacute;, de r&eacute;orienter
les fonds vers la remise en &eacute;tat des routes (voir article
&agrave; ce sujet en page 34). Les domaines cl&eacute;s touch&eacute;s
par l'actualisation du programme - allant jusqu'&agrave; l'&eacute;ch&eacute;ance
de Lom&eacute; IV, &agrave; savoir l'an 2000 - sont la conservation
des ressources naturelles, le d&eacute;veloppement des ressources
humaines, l'appui au secteur priv&eacute; et le support institutionnel.
<P>
Plusieurs projets avaient toutefois &eacute;t&eacute; approuv&eacute;s
avant la signature de ce protocole d'accord. Ils portent notamment
sur une phase pr&eacute;paratoire dans le secteur routier (1,69
million ECU), sur une contribution &agrave; la r&eacute;habilitation
des tron&ccedil;ons Mukuyu-Isebania et St Austin-Kabate (4,97
millions ECU), sur la protection et la gestion de la for&ecirc;t
indig&egrave;ne (4,4 millions ECU), sur le programme de conservation
des &eacute;l&eacute;phants et de la faune et flore sauvages (4
millions ECU), sur un programme culturel swahili (1,99 million
ECU), sur le r&eacute;tablisessement de services-conseils (1,95
million ECU), sur des micror&eacute;alisations (5,5 millions ECU)
et sur une contribution du PIN aux programmes r&eacute;gionaux
(8,7 millions ECU).
<P>
Parmi les d&eacute;penses r&eacute;cemment approuv&eacute;es figurent
un programme de promotion commerciale g&eacute;r&eacute; par l'Export
Promotion Council (4 millions ECU), un programme de sant&eacute;
familiale (11,45 millions ECU), des r&eacute;parations urgentes
sur la liaison routi&egrave;re Nairobi-Mombasa (2 millions ECU),
des subventions au d&eacute;partement charg&eacute; de la gestion
des projets (1,45 million ECU) et &agrave; la KIPPRA (1,98 million
ECU), un programme de d&eacute;veloppement touristique (2 millions
ECU), un fonds pour le d&eacute;veloppement des communaut&eacute;s
locales (12,5 millions ECU) et un projet de promotion des micro-entreprises
(6 millions ECU). Les cr&eacute;dits de la BEI au titre de Lom&eacute;
IV ont &eacute;t&eacute; largement affect&eacute;s &agrave; ce
jour au d&eacute;veloppement des entreprises priv&eacute;es.
<P>
Enfin, toujours au titre de Lom&eacute; IV, des fonds r&eacute;gionaux
ont &eacute;t&eacute; allou&eacute;s &agrave; des projets routiers
suppl&eacute;mentaires, &agrave; la r&eacute;insertion de ressortissants
africains qualifi&eacute;s dans la soci&eacute;t&eacute; et &agrave;
l'intensification de la lutte contre le SIDA/VIH et les maladies
sexuellement transmissibles. Cette derni&egrave;re action a inclus
la r&eacute;novation de la clinique sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;e
dans les MST au centre de Nairobi, ainsi que la mise en place
de services de laboratoire et de conseils. Deux projets &eacute;taient
&agrave; l'&eacute;tude au moment de mettre <I>Le Courrier</I>
sous presse : l'aide &agrave; l'agriculture dans les r&eacute;gions
infest&eacute;es par la mouche ts&eacute;-ts&eacute; (1,5 million
ECU) et le financement d'un r&eacute;seau agro-forestier sur les
hauts plateaux d'Afrique orientale (1 million ECU).
<P>
<B>Le Stabex</B> 
<P>
Le Kenya a re&ccedil;u pr&egrave;s de 127 millions ECU entre 1987
et 1993 au titre du Stabex mais l'acheminement de ces fonds vers
des projets ad&eacute;quats a &eacute;t&eacute; retard&eacute;
par les changements de politique &eacute;conomique survenus depuis
1991. Les ressources du Stabex seront d&eacute;sormais orient&eacute;es
vers les routes secondaires, les recherches relatives au caf&eacute;,
les travaux d'&eacute;lectrification et l'assistance technique.
<P>
Outre l'aide qui vient d'&ecirc;tre d&eacute;crite, l'UE a octroy&eacute;
au fil des ann&eacute;es des montants importants &agrave; des
ONG op&eacute;rant au Kenya. La Commission a soutenu toute une
s&eacute;rie de projets dans ce contexte, notamment dans le secteur
de la sant&eacute; et de l'&eacute;ducation. Le Kenya a &eacute;galement
b&eacute;n&eacute;fici&eacute; d'allocations majeures en termes
d'aide alimentaire.

<br>

</center><hr>
<P>
<B>Pour la p&eacute;riode 1990-95, avec 151,7 millions d'&eacute;cu
(MECU), les montants inscrits au  Programme indicatif national
(PIN) du 7&egrave;me Fonds europ&eacute;en de d&eacute;veloppement
(FED) - c'est-&agrave;-dire l'aide aux projets - ont repr&eacute;sent&eacute;
chaque ann&eacute;e environ 1,5 % du PIB et 13 % du Programme
d'investissement public du Mali. Quant aux fonds acquis hors PIN
- aides exceptionnelles, Stabex, capitaux &agrave; risques de
la Banque europ&eacute;enne d'investissement (BEI) et facilit&eacute;
d'ajustement structurel - ils se sont &eacute;lev&eacute;s &agrave;
87,2  MECU pour ces cinq ann&eacute;es.</B>
<P>
 En 1995, l'appui au programme d'ajustement structurel a repr&eacute;sent&eacute;
5,4 % du d&eacute;ficit de la balance des paiements courants et
7,8 % du d&eacute;ficit budg&eacute;taire. Tous instruments confondus,
le montant des d&eacute;cisions de financement prises par la Commission
au cours de l'ann&eacute;e derni&egrave;re a atteint 42 MECU tandis
que celui des d&eacute;boursements s'&eacute;l&egrave;ve &agrave;
40 MECU.
<P>
 Le taux d'engagement primaire du PIN (7&egrave;me FED) est pass&eacute;
de 76 % en d&eacute;but d'exercice &agrave; 92 % en fin d'ann&eacute;e,
ce qui signifie que la presque totalit&eacute; des ressources
programmables disponibles est maintenant affect&eacute;e &agrave;
des projets et programmes. Quant aux taux d'engagement secondaire,
c'est-&agrave;-dire la traduction des  projets/programmes en march&eacute;s,
devis et contrats, elle est pass&eacute; de 33 &agrave; 45 % en
fin d'exercice.  Les taux de d&eacute;boursement demeurent donc
faibles (32 % des ressources disponibles).
<P>
<B>Orientations</B>
<P>
 La r&eacute;partition des interventions dans les diff&eacute;rents
secteurs est la suivante:
<ul>
<li>Routes (29 % du total);
<li>Appui &agrave; l'ajustement structurel (20 %);
<li>D&eacute;veloppement rural /Environne-ment (14 %);
<li>Appui au secteur priv&eacute; (12 %);
<li>D&eacute;centralisation (9 %);
<li>Sant&eacute; publique (9 %);
<li>Hydraulique (4 %);
<li>Education/Culture (3 %).</ul>
<P>
 On peut donc constater que l'aide communautaire se concentre
en priorit&eacute; sur les infrastructures routi&egrave;res -
entretien des routes et d&eacute;senclavement. L'appui &agrave;
l'ajustement structurel vient en deuxi&egrave;me position qui
contribue au financement des d&eacute;penses courantes du budget
de l'Etat, un accent particulier &eacute;tant mis sur l'am&eacute;lioration
des recettes fiscales et douani&egrave;res et une plus grande
efficacit&eacute; de la politique de sant&eacute;.
<P>
 Dans d'autres domaines, comme le d&eacute;veloppement rural,
l'aide communautaire tente &eacute;galement de consolider les
acquis des actions ant&eacute;rieures, notamment par le d&eacute;veloppement
de fili&egrave;res rizicoles et d'&eacute;levage qui devraient
am&eacute;liorer l'approvisionnement du march&eacute; int&eacute;rieur
 et les possibilit&eacute;s d'exportations. En mati&egrave;re
d'environnement, l'objectif est de contribuer &agrave; la gestion
durable des ressources naturelles par les utilisateurs de base
que sont les agriculteurs, &eacute;leveurs, etc.
<P>
 Le soutien au secteur priv&eacute;, quant &agrave; lui, se fait
au travers d'actions dans les domaines de concentration et le
programme d'appui &agrave; un &eacute;tablissement financier 
(Cr&eacute;dit Initiative SA), r&eacute;cemment cr&eacute;&eacute;
en vue de la promotion d'octroi de cr&eacute;dits aux PME, s'ins&egrave;re
parfaitement dans l'objectif global de la croissance &eacute;conomique.
<P>
 Dans le cadre de la r&eacute;forme administrative, priorit&eacute;
est donn&eacute;e au processus de d&eacute;centralisation qui
vise &agrave; favoriser l'&eacute;mergence de nouveaux centres
de d&eacute;cision locaux - qui devraient &agrave; terme devenir
les acteurs cl&eacute;s dans la mise en oeuvre et le d&eacute;veloppement
des projets - et &agrave; doter ces instances d&eacute;centralis&eacute;es
des moyens n&eacute;cessaires pour remplir ces nouvelles missions
de service public.
<P>
 Dans le domaine de la sant&eacute;, la contribution de l'aide
communautaire s'est concr&eacute;tis&eacute;e par une participation
au projet PSPHR, financ&eacute; par d'autres bailleurs de fonds
et se concentre, dans un premier temps, sur les infrastructures
et la politique des m&eacute;dicaments essentiels.
<P>
 Dans le secteur de l'hydraulique, les actions visent au renforcement
des infrastructures de l'hydraulique villageoise, notamment dans
les cercles de Bankass et Koro.  Un programme de pompes solaires
a &eacute;galement &eacute;t&eacute; mis en oeuvre dans les r&eacute;gions
de Mopti et de Koulikoro.
<P>
 Pour ce qui est du secteur de l'&eacute;ducation et de la culture,
outre un programme de reconstruction d'&eacute;coles dans le nord
du pays, la Commission a pu apporter son appui &agrave; la r&eacute;alisation
d'une douzaine de productions cin&eacute;matographiques.
<P>
 Sur les ressources non programmables, les interventions ont concern&eacute;
un appui suppl&eacute;mentaire &agrave; l'ajustement structurel,
le Stabex, les reliquats du 5&egrave;me FED, les projets de la
BEI (Cmdt, Huicoma, Cr&eacute;dit Initiative-SA, Sadiola) et des
actions d'urgence dans les r&eacute;gions du nord du pays o&ugrave;,
malgr&eacute; un contexte difficile, les programmes n'ont jamais
&eacute;t&eacute; interrompus.
<P>
 Enfin, l'aide communautaire est pr&eacute;sente dans les programmes
r&eacute;gionaux comme la lutte contre la peste bovine, la r&eacute;habilitation
des routes, la formation et l'information &agrave; la protection
de l'environnement.

<font size=+1><i>Wealth, not scarcity, makes people hungry. <b>Dinyar Godrej
</b>explains why pushing the 'free' market as a panacea is like
prescribing pneumonia for a cold.</i></font><hr width=90%>
A light came wobbling up the Banbury Road, Oxford, in the dead
of night. It stopped near a garbage bin and an elderly figure
dismounted from an equally elderly bicycle. It was a man, slim
and upright, if a little tremulous, dressed in faded but
impeccably pressed clothes, a clip on his right ankle to guard
the indeterminate grey of the trouser leg against any chance
encounter with bike grease. <p>
First he looked up and down the road. Then, very carefully, he
extricated a neatly folded plastic carrier bag from a pocket and
set about methodically searching through the contents of the
bin. From amongst the day's detritus he picked up some
half-eaten items, inspected them for decay, then placed them in
his carrier bag. In a few minutes he was through and set off in
the direction of Summertown, wobbling to a stop from time to
time. <p>
All of North Oxford seemed to be asleep, every locked house
silent, and I knew I had witnessed a routine which was meant to
be invisible. I couldn't help but feel that had it happened in
broad daylight in front of curious passers-by it would have been
just as dignified.<p>
In my mind this memory dovetails with a much older one from when
I was a child living in my family home in Indore - a city in
India's Deccan heartland which has grown pell-mell around
industry's magnet. One day a very old and skeletal man wearing
only a loincloth came and sat down by the potted cactus at the
end of our drive. Unlike other alms seekers he sat silently
until my mother noticed him - there was no telling how long he
had been there. He was immediately given some money which he
took with the kind of abundant gratitude that puts the giver to
shame.<p>
He returned once a week, every week, more emaciated each time.
He weighed heavy on our conscience - watching the bones
straining through his skin with every movement he made was a
lesson in anatomy and ethics rolled into one.<p>
We became more watchful, looking out several times a day to see
if he was there. He was persuaded to come round to the back of
the house and sit in the shade. My mother took to giving him
larger sums of money and food which he would take away to eat
elsewhere. He was nearly blind and had to be told the value of
the coins. We all feared that in reality it made little
difference because he would probably be cheated anyway. We asked
him to come around more often, but he had his own code of honour
and would only visit once a week. <p>
Eventually he stopped and then we knew he was dead. To be honest
it was a relief not to have to watch the skin hang from him or
his slow, angular, careful walk.<p>
In Indian folklore the gods often come down to earth to test
human beings. We felt as though we had been through such a test
but couldn't say whether we had passed it or not.<h3>Making Martians</h3>
Increasingly sophisticated lifestyles often distort our
relationship with food: we are even able to forget that its
basic purpose - apart from the obvious pleasure it gives - is to
keep us going. Another person's hunger is a reminder that there
is something as simple as eating to live. Yet nowhere are people
guaranteed a right to food. If the presence of hunger is an
affront to our notions of justice, then it is doubly unjust that
those who have the least power - the elderly, women and their
dependent children, refugees, the disabled - are the most likely
to go hungry.<p>
The shame of hunger is a double shame - it burns the hungry with
the brand of humiliation, despair and dependency and it burns us
with guilt and a feeling of powerlessness at being unable to
help. For the hungry it can mean being reduced to surrender the
dignity that attends being able to provide for oneself.
Sometimes this can be perceived oddly - as though the hungry had
no dignity to lose, as though they had no emotions to expend, as
though they were ciphers filled only by need, as though they
were Martians.<p>
The wealthy often go into denial - putting up walls around their
homes, sending their kids to special schools, policing their
malls, making sure that the poor are 'elsewhere'. This distance
is essential to making Martians of the poor - they are
completely alien, they have no connection to us, they are
illegal immigrants to our neighbourhood or our nation, they are
a problem. An aunt of mine once suggested that poor people
should be taken out at the dead of night and shot - such
'cleaning-up' happens for real in some parts of the world.<p>
Today it is estimated there are nearly 800 million people who
don't have enough to eat - 12 million die of hunger every year.
Two billion have vitamin and mineral deficiencies in their diets
which can cause serious health problems.[1],[2]<h3>Hidden war</h3>
There's a war going on and we hardly hear of it. The news media
chases famine, hooked onto a perverse aesthetics of death.
People with chronic, everyday hunger, who work and go about
their business with a hole inside, aren't quite sexy enough.
Famines have the 'advantage' of being dramatic, of coming and
going, of being, in retrospect, controllable. The hungry, on the
other hand, are always with us.<p>
And yet there is no reason why this should be so - more than
enough food is produced in our world to feed everyone. What is
more, estimates of food supply are usually based on grain
production alone and don't include vegetables, milk and meat. To
invoke this surplus is not just globaloney sung to the tune of
'There are people starving in China so eat your food' [what my
mother always told me]. It is not even to argue that countries
with surpluses should 'give' other countries their food. In the
majority of countries the surpluses exist within the country;
it's just that poor people have no means to buy the food. The
reallocation of less than 10 per cent of India's food supply
would feed its hungry population - the largest among all
countries. The food waits instead for the right price or a
foreign buyer.<p>
Hunger is not due to scarcity, it is created by wealth. The
wealthiest fifth of the population, living mainly in
industrialized countries, controls 85 per cent of global income,
whilst the poorest fifth lives off a mere 1.4 per cent.[1]
Britain's richest 10 people have as much wealth as 23 poor
countries with over 174 million people.[3] Statistics like that
don't just happen, they reflect theft on a vast scale. Mahatma
Gandhi pointed out that since the wealth of a country like
Britain was founded on the plunder of nearly half the world's
resources we would need several worlds to bring such prosperity
to everyone. What we are seeing is an unprecedented polarization
of wealth - fewer people are getting hold of more and more and
they seem to care less and less about the consequences.<p>
With money-economies firmly in place the wealthy can pull
markets in whichever direction they like. Something as basic as
food production is completely skewed by the demands of wealth.
Industrial countries contain 24 per cent of the world's
population, but they manage to use 48 per cent of the world's
grain and 61 percent of its meat.[4] In fact they stuff quite a
lot of this grain into what will become the meat. Their
consumption of non-food resources is even higher. Leftover money
is always available for the little luxuries of life - US
citizens spent $30 billion on jewellery and watches in 1991, a
sum equivalent to the entire Gross Domestic Product of 20
low-income countries.[1]<p>
None of this would matter so much if rich countries were
self-sufficient themselves - but they aren't. They corner
resources through the sheer power of money, and they turn the
rest of the world into beggars at the feast. The simplicity and
the cruelty with which this is done is worth exploring.<h3>Peddling the market</h3>
Colonialism turned the majority of the world's people into
resource providers. The trade advantage thus gained was
maintained even after subject countries got their independence.
Then along came the Gulf's oil boom and Western banks found
themselves flooded with investments from oil-rich sheikhs. They
peddled this money unscrupulously to governments in the Majority
World. Poor countries took up loans in the 70s because prices
for the raw materials they sold were rising at the time and they
thought they might get a foot in the door of the rich club.
Commodity prices fell, interest rates soared and in some cases a
Mobutu or a Marcos pocketed billions of dollars. The Third World
Debt had come to stay. The amount paid off as interest by poor
countries has already exceeded the original sums of money
borrowed, yet they are still in debt. In 1993, for every dollar
given in aid rich nations took back three in debt repayments.<p>
The marketplace is now being pushed as the panacea for countries
with problems feeding their populations, which is a bit like
prescribing pneumonia for a cold. The IMF and World Bank give
loans on condition that poor countries work towards increasing
their exports to pay off debt. So already-glutted and
recession-hit Western markets get more of the same things - more
cocoa, more coffee, more bananas - from producers in the
Majority World who are forced into competition with each other.
Prices drop as fast as production rises. <p>
Straddling markets from Djibouti to Detroit is the relatively
recent colossus of  the transnational corporation, funnelling
produce from farmers world-wide, shipping it hither and yon,
playing with it for profit. In 1989 transnationals controlled 70
per cent of international trade and 80 per cent of all the land
growing export crops. They employed just three per cent of the
world's paid labour.[5] Profits - and they are huge - go mainly to
a handful of owners. <p>
This, then, is the so-called 'free market' - a place where
wealthy governments and big business give poor producers the
freedom to sell their labour and goods at the lowest possible
prices. In another age it went by another name - slavery. <p>
Rich countries dictate terms to poor countries, protecting their
own produce with subsidies, imposing tariffs and squeezing the
lowest prices for raw materials. They don't feel a similar need
to protect their markets from each other.<h3>Milking the beast</h3>
The strangest thing about the market is that the movers and
shakers have tremendous influence but little control. They are
milking the beast for all it's worth today. That it may kick the
pail tomorrow is something they'd rather not think about.<p>
France's President Mitterand put his finger on it at the recent
UN Social Summit, where world leaders agreed to disagree over
the steps to be taken to combat poverty. 'Are we really going to
let the world become a global market without any rules other
than those of the jungle and with no purpose other than maximum
gain, maximum profit, in the minimum time?' he asked.[6]<p>
The market mentality is striking at the very heart of food
production - the farmers. In the West it has imposed an
unsustainable and heavily polluting commercial agriculture that
uses 10 calories of energy for every calorie of food it
produces. This very expensive food is made cheap for urban
consumers by subsidies, which have come from their taxes anyway.
The huge surpluses farmers in the West produce are then dumped
in the Majority World either as food aid or at ridiculously low
prices which often destroy local farmers in the process.
Increasingly this high-cost agriculture has edged out smaller
producers and has led to the present indebtedness of many a US
farmer.<p>
In the Majority World the Green Revolution got hijacked by the
lites who could afford it and starved large numbers of small
farmers who couldn't. Cash cropping took hold, uprooting a
diversity of food crops, driving those who couldn't hack it into
urban centres to look for jobs. <p>
This is a tremendous diminishment of human resources. People who
can provide for themselves become hungry and landless. Farmers
find decisions about what they grow and how they grow it being
taken by forces beyond their control and not in their best
interests. Consumers too find they are at the mercy of the
merchants, that they count not as people but as customers.<h3>Resistance</h3>
The resistance is about rescuing the control of food from this
market machine. Poor people around the world are bypassing the
system with communal efforts at growing and sharing food. <p>
In India farmers are successfully resisting the transnationals'
efforts to control their seeds. All across Latin America peasant
farmers are getting together under a movement called Campesino a
Campesino to share their knowledge and work towards growing more
food. In Bolivia women have taken to the streets protesting
against US food 'aid' which has crippled local wheat production.
In Zambia farmers are rediscovering the diversity of traditional
foodgrains like sorghum and millet; mills are opening in rural
areas loosening urban control over the finished product. <p>
Change is coming to the rich world, too. In Japan the Sekatsu
consumer network has directly linked up with banana growers in
the Philippines, getting a better deal for all parties
concerned. In France farmers are working with their Brazilian
counterparts to find ways of forgoing the use of Brazilian grain
as animal feed. Fair-trade movements have made a start at
getting better prices for coffee and cocoa producers, proving
cash crops needn't necessarily cause hunger. <p>
This is the kind of resistance which could safeguard our food in
the future, and we tell some of the stories in this issue.
However, the crisis that looms over the market minefield is not
just one of deepening poverty but of ultimate environmental
collapse. The world's relatively small wealthy population is
probably getting too large for it. This is the population whose
demand occupies swathes of rich farmland and makes it grow
strawberries, flowers and animal feed, forcing hungry farmers
into marginal, erosion-prone areas. This is the population which
ultimately endorses the poisoning of our environment and the
exhaustion of every exhaustible resource. <p>
All the realistic alternatives involve making choice available
to more, not less, people and doing so before environmental
imperatives dictate their own terms. Hunger is, in this sense, a
question of democracy and democratic control. At present the
most 'democratic' nations of the world are involved in the most
widespread massacre of human rights - the perpetuation of
hunger. <p>
The globe, we are told, is shrinking. Perhaps it has not yet
shrunk enough for the rich to see that they inhabit the same
planet as the poor. There is no neat boundary between the world
of wealth and the world from which the wealth comes. To make two
worlds out of one is, quite literally, to tear it apart.<hr>

<P>
<B>1. SADC/EU SIGN NEW REGIONAL INDICATIVE PROGRAMME FOR SOUTHERN
AFRICA </B>
<P>
 Stefan Smidt, European Commission Director-General for Development
and Kaire Mbuende, Executive Secretary of the South African Development
community, SADC, signed a Regional Indicative Programme worth
121 ECU last Tuesday in Windhoek at the EU SADC ministerial conference.
The Programme seeks to promote the development of infrastructures
and services, trade, investment and finance and promotion of intra-regional
exchanges of information and macroeconomics issues. An annex to
the Programme providing additional funds from the European Investment
Bank, EIB, for regional investment projects in the areas of energy,
water supply, telecommunication, transport, industrial development
and the strengthening of the private sector was also signed by
Mr Mbuende and EIB Financing Director Louis Biancarelli. 
<P>
 Dick Spring, the Irish Foreign Minister and EU Council President
described the SADC region as, &quot;one of the top ten most important
markets of the future&quot; adding, &quot;the region has the potential
to make an important contribution to the development of Africa
as a whole&quot;.
<P>
<B>2. EU ENVOY EXPRESSES HOPE FOR RWANDAN REFUGEES</B>
<P>
 Mr. Aldo Ajello, the EU's Special Envoy to the Great Lakes Region
voiced his hope that positive results would emerge from the new
approach set out in Geneva last week by the UN High Commissioner
for Refugees and countries assisting the 16 million Rwandan refugees
in Zaire and Tanzania. Mr Ajello who is currently on tour in the
Great Lakes Region stated that the action plan could only be successful
if there is co-operation between the international community and
interested countries, especially those directly concerned. He
added &quot;the human, financial and political cost is no longer
bearable&quot;. 
<P>
<B>3. EU THROWS ITS WEIGHT BEHIND EAST AFRICAN SUMMIT ON PEACE
IN BURUNDI</B>
<P>
 The European Union has pledged that it will do all it can to
move the peace process forward in Burundi as the leaders of Ethiopia,
Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda and Zaire prepared for a summit
on Burundi on 12 October in Tanzania. The region's leaders are
considering whether the sanctions they imposed on Burundi after
the military coup this year should be extended or eased.
<P>
 The EU main contribution so far has been in backing Central and
East African nation politically and providing humanitarian and
financial to the countries in the region. Since 1995 the EU has
pledged 5.5 million ECU for health programmes, 2.4 million ECU
for the country's treasury, 700 000 ECU for human rights and democracy.<B>
</B>The EU Humanitarian Aid Commissioner has also appealed to
European lawyers to help restore Burundi's judicial system after
appeals from the Bujumbura government, but so far no European
lawyers have gone to the region. 
<P>
 Current EU proposals stop just short of sending personnel to
the region. Last month at a meeting with Tanzanian ex-president
Julius Nyerere, the UN-appointed mediator for the region, Dick
Spring, President of the EU Council of Ministers ruled out the
possibility of sending EU peacekeepers to Burundi. He stated that
there was no military solution to the problem. The Commission's
own office in Bujumbura is only manned by secretaries as the delegates
wait in Europe for security conditions to improve. 
<P>
<B>4. EU PRESIDENCY STOPS SHORT OF PRAISING POLITICAL REFORMS
 IN GAMBIA</B>
<P>
 The Irish Presidency of the EU on 15 October published a declaration
on the political reforms in Gambia. The Union welcomed the peaceful
passing of  presidential elections and congratulated the Provisional
Independent Electoral Commission (PIEC) for its role in the elections.
It however, voiced its regret &quot;that recommendations drawn
by the PIEC ignored and that conditions which would have ensured
free and fair elections were not met.&quot; 
<P>
 The Declaration called on the Gambian authorities to &quot;take
all necessary measures so that parliamentary elections due on
11 December 1996 meet the guidelines established by PIEC.&quot;
<P>
<B>5. EU CONTEMPLATES FURTHER SANCTIONS AGAINST BURMA UNDER CFSP</B>
<P>
 The EU Council President and Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring
told the Irish Parliament last week that the European Union is
considering imposing further sanctions on Burma after the Burmese
government's lack of response to the EU's legitimate concerns.
 Mr Spring said that the issue had been raised by the Common Foreign
and Security Policy, CFSP, working group and the Commission was
considering the suspension of trade benefits Burma enjoys under
the Generalized System of Preferences. This comes after Mr. Spring's
meeting with Burma Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw in parallel with
the UN General Assembly on 26 September. Mr. Spring added that
the EU has also asked a special UN working group on arbitrary
detention and imprisonment to be allowed into Burma to investigate
circumstances surrounding the death of Danish Consul, Mr. Nichols
and for the UN Commissioner for Human Rights to take action on
the situation in Burma. 
<P>
<B> </B>The situation in Burma will be discussed on 22 and 23
October at the European Parliament in Strasbourg. 
<P>
<B>6. EU HUMANITARIAN OFFICE SHORTLISTS 18 TV AND RADIO REPORTS
FOR ITS AWARDS</B>
<P>
 The Selection Committee of TV and Radio Awards of the European
Community's Humanitarian Office shortlisted 18 TV and radio reports
for rewards. The ECHO awards are given to best reports on humanitarian
subjects. Emma Bonino, the European Commissioner explaining the
practice stated, &quot;with daily reports of humanitarian crises,
and concern about the loss of Iraq and Burma, to name but three
- a 'victim' can appear as just another face, another statistic.
Documentary reporting brings these statistics and faces to life,
making their fears and concerns real (...) This is why the ECHO
awards were created, to recognise the vital role that is played
by broadcasters in bringing to the public awareness issues and
situations which would otherwise go largely ignored.&quot; 
<P>
 A judging panel will meet in Brussels on 7 November  to choose
the winners who will be presented with their awards on 9 December
in the presence of  Emma Bonino and Irish President Mary Robins.
<P>
<B>7. ATD/FOURTH WORLD PRESENT REPORT ON POVERTY ON WORLD ANTI-POVERTY
DAY&quot; IN BRUSSELS</B>
<P>
 Last Thursday, 17 October,  ATD/Fourth World presented the General
Report on Poverty at a procession titled World Anti Poverty Day.
The Report was drawn up at the request of the Belgian government
and published at the beginning of the year. The ATD, who sponsored
the procession,  recalled the message its founder, Father J. Wresinski,
gave before 100 000 persons demonstrating for human rights in
Paris in 1987: Slavery has been abolished. Poverty can be abolished
also.&quot; The United Nations has proclaimed 1996 the &quot;International
Year for the Abolition of Poverty&quot;

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>1.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=1> </FONT><B><FONT SIZE=2>DEVELOPMENT
CO-OPERATION FALLS FURTHER BEHIND AS AN EU PRIORITY AS EUROPEAN
PARLIAMENT 1997 BUDGET CUTS MONEY FOR  CO-OPERATION</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>The adoption of the EU
budget at its second reading by the European Parliament, EP, on
12 December may confirm the fears of many involved in international
co-operation of the relegation of development co-operation to
matters of lesser importance by the European Union. The EP in
line with its quest for austerity adopted an uncharacteristically
slim line budget for 1997 and there were hardly any differences
between the first and the second reading. Unfortunately, development
co-operation seems to be the sector which has been sacrificed
to achieve the near 0% growth in the budget over last year. (See
table provided in the last two pages of the PAF)</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Despite lobbying from the NGO community (Mr. Brinkhorst,
rapporteur of the budget committee,  received more than 200 letters
from NGOs), the Budget Committee agreed on the figure of 160 MECU
+ 36 MECU in reserve for co-finnancing of NGOs. This 36 MECU in
reserve would only be released after agreement by the Development
Committee. The Committee wants to have more control on this reserve
and will set up the conditions, be more strict and limiting. The
conditions will be set on the basis of reports from Reylandt,
(we do not know what the criteria will be yet). The DGVIII B/2
has to give a report to the Development Committee before May 1997
on how the funds are to be used.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> In the table the 'M' in the second column means
that those lines have been merged with the co-financing line,
so they will be administrated by the DGVIII. There is also a significant
reduction in the funds for rehabilitation. The Council had wanted
to decrease it to 50 million ECU, while the Parliament demanded
75 million and the 62.5 million represent the compromise between
the Council's proposal and the Parliament's. The B7-321 (Rehabilitation
in Southern Africa) is also part of the reserve. The B7-611N (Role
of women in development) has been created by the Parliament; it
should include the B7-633.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The rest of the sectorial budget lines are the same
as in 1996. There is a huge increase for the MEDA line, but the
line for NGOs has been suppressed. Concerning the Central and
Eastern Europe line, there is a new line for ex-Yugoslavia, which
is quite substantial. The B7-6008N is a line created to repatriate
the refugees with temporary asylum in Europe.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> On the whole it has been a quite difficult year
in the fight to maintain a decent level of funding for development.
NGOs need to be on the alert in the coming years. Member States
are trying to reach the level demanded of them to enter the EMU
system, which means that in the future there will be less money
for development. NGOs will have to step up the pressure on the
national governments. The Development Committee will start working
on the budget early in the next year.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  Although the budget for 1996 has been entirely
allocated, there are still some problems in its provision. The
general conditions for funding have not been settled yet. There
are some advances from the Dutch government, who are planning
to take some decisions on this issue during their Presidency.
NGOs in Luxembourg will be pushing this issue during Luxembourg's
Presidency<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. BUDGET COMMITTEE REJECTS PARLIAMENTARY VOTE
ON ALLOCATION FOR TURKEY</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>In a major development
since last week's adoption of the budget, the Budget Committee
on Tuesday 17 December overruled the total allocation of 62 967
million ECU for Turkey under the MEDA programme.  The allocation
which came from two different budget lines had been agreed on
in the vote on the budget and had angered many MEPs who protested
Turkey's continuing poor human rights record and interference
from the Council and the European Commission. The European Parliament
has now threatened to freeze the entire budget for Turkey under
the MEDA programme if the European Commission does not bow to
its demands for the creation of a joint committee for approving
individual programmes in the MEDA package. The EP wants to examine
each programme to determine if it would benefit Turkey, and if
so to block it. Turkish officials have reacted saying that the
cut in funding will not hurt Turkey. They however concede that
the symbolic significance is great as it puts Turkey in a worse
category than Algeria and Syria who continue to receive money
from the EU. &quot;To compare us with those regimes is ridiculous
.... We are being treated pretty badly&quot; said a Turkish diplomat.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>3. EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTS EU URGE TO PAY GREATER
ATTENTION TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND CALL FOR A EU HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSIONER</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> With the adoption of its annual report on human
rights the European Parliament has asked for greater clarification
on aid conditionality so as to avoid  ambiguity in future agreements
with the likes of Turkey and Russia. Rapporteur Cath&eacute;rine
Lalumi&egrave;re, President of the Radical Alliance Group, said
that  preventive diplomacy requires international control of the
arms trade and a code of conduct for European Companies carrying
out activities in Third Countries. Mrs. Lalumi&egrave;re criticised
the council for its hesitations on human rights infringements
in Bosnia, Rwanda, Chechnya, Zaire, China and Turkey. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The EP report asked the ACP-EU Joint Assembly not
to schedule plenary sessions in countries where co-operation is
suspended. It also outlined EU priorities for 1997  as - support
to the international tribunals for former Yugoslavia and Rwanda,
establishment of democratic institutions in former Yugoslavia;
the inclusion of systematic rape to the list of war crimes; the
launching of programmes for reconciliation of civil society; confirmation
of European programmes in for reconstruction and development in
South Africa, the Near East and Bosnia Herzegovina.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   During a debate on the report several MEPs criticised
the Union's attitude on human rights. As Jan Bertens, a Dutch
Liberal,  put much of the argument being made succinctly, &quot;economic
interests must never prevail over human interests&quot;. Mr. Jose
Barros Mouta expressed his hope that the year 2000 would be proclaimed
as the Year of Human Rights by the Union. In defence of the Union,
Hans van der Broek, Commissioner for External Affairs said that
a network designed to gather necessary information for conflict
prevention was currently being set up. He stated however, that
a code of conduct could not be imposed on European multinationals
and that even though he thought that every year should be a Year
of Human Rights, he had recommended the proclamation of 1998 to
be European Year of Human Rights in line with the fiftieth Universal
Declaration on Human Rights. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>4. EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT DEBATES THE FUTURE OF DEVELOPMENT
CO-OPERATION</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>On Tuesday 17 December,
in a debate largely centring on the European Commission's recent
Green Paper on the future of EU-ACP co-operation, the European
Parliament's Development Committee discussed the future of the
EU's development co-operation with the EU Commissioner for Mr
Joao de Deus Pinheiro and other development experts.   </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>Mr. Pinheiro, expounded
on some of the Green Paper major themes such as the need for more
conditionally in aid provision and the need to develop a new political
partnership between the two regions. He cautioned however, that
the Green Paper in no way pre-empts the Commission's future position
on the ACP-EU relationship but was rather a document to encourage
debate. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Among those invited to provide constructive criticism
on the Paper was Mr Claude Cheysson who is a former Commissioner,
French Minister, European Parliamentarian and one of the negotiators
of the first Lom&eacute; Convention. Mr. Cheysson outlining his
misgivings about the Green Paper criticised the increased emphasis
on conditionally, warning that the Commission would have to be
very careful in implementing this policy as it could easily be
misconstrued as a case of the EU taking the decisions sovereign
African countries have to take. He added that political dialogue
between the two groups should be promoted to the fore and as much
as possible the identity of the poor African countries should
be preserved. Commenting on the general view of the difficulty
of maintaining equality of the partners in the ACP-EU relationship,
Mr. Cheysson compared the Lom&eacute; Convention to the US's Marshall
Plan after  the second world war which according to Mr. Cheysson
achieved success because of the equality of partnership between
Europe and the USA.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Mr. Pinheiro's sudden departure following Mr. Cheysson's
speech, provided a humorous point for discussion giving that Mr.
Pinheiro had said earlier that he was ready to openly discuss
issues raised in the Green Paper.<B> </B>Others present however
remained to express their views on the issues. The Netherlands
Foreign Minister Mr. Pronk reassured the MEPs that the forthcoming
Dutch Presidency would carefully listen to the requests of ACP
countries. Mrs. Kinnock of the Socialist group criticised of the
lack of co-ordination between the EU's policies in other sectors
with its development policies while Lord Plumb of the Christian
Democrats lamented on the lack of progress on the EU's Common
Foreign and Security Policy. Several speakers called for the European
Development Fund used to finance the Lom&eacute; Conventions to
be included in the regular EU budget. <BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. EP AGREES TO LOME IV REVISION AGREEMENT IN
SPITE OF DISAPPOINTING ASPECTS<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>The European Parliament
has issued its assent to revision of the Lom&eacute; IV Convention
signed in 1995 paving the way for a Council's adoption of the
revision. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Rapporteur France Wurtz stated that even though
the results were disappointing with regard to political and institutional
issues, trade and development financing, he urged the EP to consent
to the revision for two reasons: firstly the ACP's wish for the
EP to ratify the revisions as they know they are vulnerable have
very little room to manoeuvre; secondly stalling in consenting
to revision could be used by those who want to diminish EC-ACP
co-operation. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The European parliament's assent is an indispensable
but  insufficient step for the entry into force of the revised
Convention, particularly its financial protocol for the period
up to the year 2000. All the Union Member States and at least
two thirds of the ACP States must ratify the revised Convention
and its financial protocol for it to enter into force.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. NGOS FACE  DILEMMA OVER MAINTAINING NEUTRALITY
IN THE FACE OF      HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> European development NGOs are increasingly facing
a moral dilemma as to whether to continue  maintain their neutrality
in areas where there have been, gross human rights violations.
At a seminar on &quot;What ethics in humanitarian aid,&quot; organised
by the EC Humanitarian Office last December in Geneva, the majority
of speakers concluded that though principles of independence and
neutrality are fundamental, the Geneva Conventions governing these
principles are no longer suitable. Jaques Lebas, a doctor and
teacher at the university of Paris, said, neutrality &quot;threatens
to subject aid and assistance actions to the good will of the
fighters, factions or active authorities.&quot; Mrs. Emma Bonino
the EC Humanitarian Commissioner replied, &quot;Most humanitarians
play the role of judge and policeman in refugee camps? No, they
do not have the means and it is not their role. But should human
rights not also take into account in humanitarian actions. ..
Our Identity must be independent from foreign policy.&quot; According
to the head of the Portuguese NGO, AMA, Fernando Nobre, &quot;We
(NGOs) have become too professional, too idealistic and too politician.&quot;
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The issue is particularly relevant given that 94
% of emergency aid transits through NGOs or international organisations
whereas twenty years ago 95% of this aid went through governments.
<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>3. NEW UN SECRETARY GENERAL TO APPOINT SPECIAL
ENVOY FOR EXPLORATORY MISSION IN GREAT LAKES REGION<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>Kofi Annan the new Secretary
General of the UN stated, in an interview with the AFP last week,
that he planned to appoint a new special envoy for issues concerning
the Great Lakes region. He said that the post may go to Algerian
diplomat Lakhdat Brahimi who had experience with UN in South Africa,
Haiti and Yemen.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Mr. Annan said that he had raised the issue with
Mr. Boutros Ghali, the out-going Secretary General and stated:
&quot;First of all, we shall appoint someone who will visit the
region to discuss with the Heads of State and, after that, we
shall decide how to proceed&quot;. Notably on the convening of
an international conference on the Great Lake issues, he emphasised
that the conference must be &quot;well-prepared&quot; because
of the great deal of suspicion between Heads of State in the region.

<B><FONT SIZE=2>4. EC AND WORLD BANK TO SHARE EXPERIENCE ON EVALUATION
OF PROJECTS<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>The European Commission
and the World Bank plan to share their experience in evaluating
development aid programmes. The first top-level working meeting
on the subject took place in Brussels three weeks ago in the presence
of EU Budget Commissioner, Erkki Liikane; EU Development Commissioner,
Joao de Deus Pinheiro; Director General of Operations Evaluation
at the World Bank, Robert Picciotto and representatives from the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European
Investment Bank. The main topics of the meeting were on how to
integrate the evaluation in the implementation of programmes,
how to measure the results and which methods to use to evaluate
the results of macro-economic measures.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The two institutions have agreed to a programme
to evaluate their structural adjustment aid in recipient countries.
In relation to this, the evaluation unit of DG VIII (Development
Department of the EC) and the equivalent service of the Bank will
carry out a joint impact study this year in certain sectors. The
two bodies will also exchange information on the evaluation of
development programmes in transition. This initiative is part
of the EC's financial management efforts in line with &quot;SEM
2000&quot; programme.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>5. ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AGAINST BURUNDI ARE WIDELY
CIRCUMVENTED<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>According to information
from Nairobi, economic sanctions imposed on Burundi by neighbouring
countries after Major Buyoya's coup d'etat have been largely circumvented.
Reports of the availability of petrol, abundant sales of Zambian
cement, salt from Tanzania, beer from Rwanda and household goods
from Kenya bear witness to this. Apparently the high price of
petrol created by the sanctions is an attraction for all kinds
of suppliers. <BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>6. EU COUNCIL TO DECIDE ON SUSPENDING GSP TO BURMA
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>The European Council
of Foreign Ministers will decide on whether to take up the Commission's
recommendation to suspend the General System of Preferences, GSP,
on agricultural and industrial products from Burma on 19 January.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> However, reports seem to indicate that France and
Germany may not be wholly committed to the penalising Burma. Several
German companies are planning to open an investment office in
Rangoon, the Burmese capital. The Burmese campaigner for democracy,
Aung San Suu Kyi, attacked the German plans saying &quot;We are
not in favour of investments in Burma at this particular moment
because money that gets into the country does not get to the people
that need it most&quot;. The German Asia-Pacific Business Association
regional manager, Wolfgang Niedermark, defended German companies
in a German paper, saying, &quot;We are really business oriented
and we do not have any political ambitions.&quot; Ms Suu Kyi responded
to these comments saying, &quot;With Germany's history and experience
I think it's shocking that any German should say that we're only
interested in economics, we have nothing to do with politics.
The fact that Germany was involved in the second world war was
due to political errors not economic errors.&quot; <BR>

<B>1 EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ACCEPTS DEAL WITH MOROCCO</B>
<P>
On Friday 7 June the European Parliament voted to accept the Euro-Mediterranean
agreement with Morocco.  The vote is seen as a great dissapontment
to many who were hoping for a clear rejection of the deal on the
grounds of the human rights situation in Morocco.  The basis of
the debate was a report to the Parliament which advised that the
agreement has great political and geostrategic importance.  Mr
Bernard Kouchner said in the debate that a 'yes' given hesitantly
would be more useful in the long run than an outright rejection.
 Although only the Greens and European United Left groups actually
voted against the agreement (65 votes against compared to 263
for), most of the members who spoke voiced some criticism of the
situation in Morocco.  MEPs criticised the continuing human rights
abuses and the failure of Morocco to give constructive support
to the settlement of the conflict in Western Sahara, an initative
started by the United Nations.
<P>
The vote was overshadowed by the recent history of the expansion
of the European Union's agreements with its neighbours, especially
the free trade agreement with Turkey which was approved by the
Parliament in December last year.  A similar logic was applied
on that occassion where the Parliament felt that engagement would
be more useful than rejection.  
<P>
<B><a href="reality.htm">REALITY OF AID</a></B>
<P>
The 1996 edition of <I>Reality of Aid</I> will be launched on
Monday 17 June.  The report aims to give a critique from an NGO
perspective and has a growing reputation as an accessible reference
for information and trends in official developlent aid and donor
policies.  The central theme for the 1996 <I>Reality of Aid</I>
is the eradication of poverty.
<P>
Key points highlighted in the report include the continuing reductions
in the aid budget of major donors and the difference between the
rhetoric and reality of donor policies.  Although every donor
(except the USA) has reaffirmed its commitment to the UN aid target
of 0.7% of GDP within the last five years, 8 out of 21 donors
cut their aid as a percentage of GDP in 1995.  
<P>
Figures published for the first time in 1995 reveal almost unbelievably
small expenditures on basic education (0.1% of total aid) and
basic health (0.3%).  The average amount spent by donors on water
and sanitation is just 4%.
<P>
<I>Reality of Aid</I> is published by Earthscan for Eurostep and
ICVA.  Not only is it being lauched simultaneously in Brussels
and Washington on Monday, but there will also be launches in many
other places including the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Australia,
Canada, Vietnam, Nepal, Zimbabwe, Fiji and India.  It is designed
so that agencies can disseminate the report as widely as possible
and use it as an advocacy tool to highlight dwindling aid budgets
and the impact on the poor.
<P>
<B>3 EURO - AFRICA SUMMIT FOR AID</B>
<P>
The idea of a summit meeting between European and African countries
has been put forward as a means of revitalising the interest of
the european public in the EU's aid policies.  The suggestion
came from European Development Commissioner Jaoa de Deus Pinheiro.
 He said that the meeting, to be held in 1997, would throw open
the debate over the future of the Lom&eacute; convention and encourage
'people-driven' renegotiation.  Mr Pinheiro also hoped that the
Commissions green paper on Lom&eacute;, to be published in October
this year, would have a similar effect.
<P>
The Commission is evidently worried by the Eurobarometer poll,
which was mentioned in the PAF two weeks ago.  This survey of
the opinions of people across Europe showed that 'helping people
in poor countries in Asia, Africa, and South America' had slipped
down the list of priorities.  
<P>
<B>4 CONFERENCE ON RELATIONS BEYOND LOME IV</B>
<P>
Today is the last day of a conference on the future of relations
between European Union and ACP countries.  The conference is organised
in Maastricht by the European Centre for Development Policy Management
and started on Wednesday of this week.  The idea was to provide
an interface between the EU Commision and representatives of member
states with the views of all others interested in the negotiations
including NGOs, private sector, university etc.
<P>
<B>5 SOCIALISTS OPEN DEVELOPMENT DEBATE</B>
<P>
On 11 July the Socialist Group of the European Parliament is beginning
a series of talks with representatives from developing countries
over the European Union's development policy.  The discussions
will include issues such as the future of the Lom&eacute; convention,
the targetting of EU assistance to the poorest countries etc.
 These talks will continue until October of this year and will
culminate in some sort of socialist summit meeting, the exact
nature of which has not yet been announced.

the Italian sales representatives draw up a contract and a small
project (often in Italian) and either party promises to use his
influences and lobby the necessary bodies for the project's goahead.

<I>Donors are constantly developing new programmes and initiatives

<P>
M.S. Shivakumar, Cooperation Committee for Cambodia, author of
the chapter on development assistance to Cambodia
<P>
<I>This problem is further compounded by the fact that those who
define the programmes -  Technical Assistance staff and donor
agencies - are often interlopers or third parties in the development

distortions in developing policies and programmes.  </I>

the chapter on development assistance to Cambodia
<P>
<I>The European Community Delegations, which represent the Community
in other countries, are equally constrained by limited staffing.

are often expected to control programs  twice or even ten times

of people or more.</I>
<P>
Mirjam van Reisen, author of the chapter on the European Community's
development  cooperation programme
<P>
<I>The process constructed to manage and implement the Community
program is the result of the perceived needs of the Member States
to oversee their own interests. However, apart from the costs
involved, it is obvious that, given the relatively limited number
of staff, the strain on the Commission who has to manage these
Committees, is enormous, and, consequentially,  constrains the
quality of the implementation of the European Community Program.</I>

First published in 1993, the <I>Reality of Aid</I> has been produced
each year.  Published by Earthscan for <I>Eurostep</I> and ICVA,
the report provides a critique from an NGO perspective of the
aid programmes of 21 donor countries of the OECD's Development
Assistance Committee (DAC).
<P>
The report includes separate chapters on each of each donor country,
including a specific chapter on the European Community programme.
 Each chapter is written by an NGO from that country and provides
a critical analysis of the country's development assistance policies
and programmes, explaining the impact of the changes taking place.
<P>
The report also includes tables, graphs and charts on the quantity
and quality of official aid from the DAC member countries.
<P>
The 1996 report also includes some perspectives of aid from NGOs
in Cambodia, India, Peru, Zimbabwe, Fiji and Poland.

<H3>Reality of Aid 1996:<br>Donor governments accused of turning their backs on people
living in poverty</H3>

<HR>

<P>
Major improvements in human well being are being put at risk,
and the chance to end world poverty is being passed up, as governments
in rich countries cut aid to the world's poorest communities,
say non-governmental organisations from 27 countries in the 1996
<I>Reality of Aid</I>.
<P>
The fourth annual <I>Reality of Aid</I> report notes the contribution
made by aid in halving child death rates and a 30% reduction in
malnutrition over the last 30 years.
<P>
But in spite of commitments by donors to social development and
poverty eradication at the UN Social Summit in March 1995, the
report shows that 8 out of 21 donors cut their aid in 1994, with
a further 4 only managing to maintain their aid as a percentage
of GNP.
<P>
Although every donor (except the USA) has reaffirmed its commitment
to the UN 0.7% aid target within the last 5 years, aid in 1995
looks set to fall to its lowest level ever.
<P>
The report points out that by cutting $6 billion from aid programmes
in 1993, governments saved just 1.8 cents out of every thousand
dollars of public expenditure.  $6 billion dollars would have
paid for universal access to safe and reliable family planning.
<P>
The report welcomes donor policies that emphasise investment in
people,  but points to the gulf between these policies and statistices
which show no increase in spending on the two key areas of health
and education.
<P>
Figures published for the first time in 1995 show almost unbelievably
small expenditures - just 0.1% of total aid allocated to basic
education (things like primary schools and adult literacy) and
just 0.3% to basic health.  The average amount spent by donors
on water and sanitation is just 4%.
<P>
The gulf between donors' rhetoric and actions is a key theme of
the <I>Reality of Aid</I>.
<UL>
<LI>OECD donor countries support the principle of free trade and
market mechanisms - yet their tying of aid reduces competition
and therefore costs recipient countries and estimated $2 billion
in overpricing;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Donors stress good governance, human rights and the need for
recipients to reduce military spending.  But such considerations
are often submerged under the weight of commercial pressures as
donors compete for markets;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Donor commitment to poverty reduction, aid coordination and
long term development has not led to any noticeable moves towards
effective concentration by individual donors on those countries
which are most vulnerable:
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Least Developed and other Low Income Countries have seen their
share of aid fall by 7% since 1990.  Bilateral aid to Sub Saharan
Africa has now fallen consistently in real terms for the past
five years.  Since 1991, donors have reduced aid by $670 million
- more than the entire national income of Sierra Leone.
<P>
Spending by official aid agencies on emergencies has quadrupled
over a decade to about $6 billion in 1994 - reducing the levels
available for long term development programmes
<P>
The <I>Reality of Aid</I> criticises OECD governments for their
lack of leadership and for failing to foster political commitment
to poverty eradication.
<P>
In 1996, the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty,
the <I>Reality of Aid</I> calls on governments to:
<UL>
<LI>Set time bound targets for reducing overall poverty and for
the eradication of absolute poverty;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Restore aid to a growth path, at the very least, maintaining
aid at the 0.33% average.  Between now and the end of the century
all donors are called upon to ensure positive annual growth in
aid as a percentage of GNP;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Allocate fifty per cent of ODA for direct investment in social
development;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Find the $34 billion a year which is needed to provide for
the global unmet demand for family planning, universal primary
education, clean water and safe sanitation, basic health care
and nutrition;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Put in place measures to relieve the burden of multilateral
debt on the Least Developed Countries;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Become more transparent and accountable for aid spending -
setting and reporting on specific targets for the allocation of
aid to poverty reduction.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The <I>Reality of Aid</I> challenges donor governments to build
on consistent public commitment to humanitarian action.  It underlines
the need for donors to invest in public awareness and understanding
at home.
<P>
It urges governments not to squander aid in the narrow pursuit
of political or economic interest, but to see aid as an investment
- an effective catalyst which enables poor people to help themselves.
<P>
The <I>Reality of Aid</I> concludes that the eradication of poverty
is possible within our lifetimes.  The challenge is to find the
vision and sustained political commitment needed to complete the
task.<HR>

<P>
<I>&quot;We must not accept that the poor will always be with
us.  The world has the material and natural resources, the know-how
and the people to make a poverty-free world a reality.  And until
the Social Summit last March, all that was lacking was a global
commitment.  This is more than just a dream.  One hundred sixty
years ago the world launched a crusade against slavery.  Most
people were sceptical.  But there was a will to change.  Today,
I call upon you to launch a similar crusade - for a world without
poverty.&quot;</I>
<P>
James Gustave Speth, Director of the UNDP (January 1996).
<P>
In the last three decades, the well-being of mankind has been
considerably improved in a number of fields.  Infant mortality
has been reduced by half.  The extent of malnutrition has been
reduced by 30 per cent.  And over 60 per cent of people in rural
areas now have safe drinking water, compared with only 10 per
cent in the 1960s.
<P>
These are successes, certainly, but they need to be put into context.
 In 1996, declared by the United Nations as the International
Year for the Eradication of Poverty, 1.9 billion people are living
in poverty.  Every day, their numbers increase by 67 000.  The
global army of poor people is growing by more than 25 million
every year, mainly in developing countries.  All around them and
through the media, they see the new prosperity that is denied
them.
<P>
During the World Summit for Social Development in March 1995 in
Copenhagen, governments made new commitments in the battle against
poverty.  People's basic rights to food, health, education, the
right to be able to support themselves and the right to equal
participation in society were explicitly recognised in Copenhagen.
<P>
To date,  governments have barely drawn the consequences of this.
 Few countries have made these basic rights a central feature
of their policy, which should be aimed at giving poor people the
opportunity to take an active role in their development process.
<P>
To change that, we must do a number of things.  Development aid
is very important, but is only really effective if it is part
of an overall government policy aimed at social development. 
Aid that is actually able to reach the poorest people makes an
important contribution to implementing basic human rights;  The
report &quot;<I>Reality of Aid 1996</I>&quot;, written by a large
number of NGOs from all over the world that deal with aid and
actions to relieve poverty, makes this abundantly clear. The potential
of development aid will only be fully exploited when governments
in the North and the South put human development and the eradication
of poverty at the top of their agenda.
<P>
Secondly, effective emphasis needs to be placed on the people
involved, to obtain their participation.  Development aid projects
that do not properly take account of the opinions and knowledge
of those who are supposed to benefit from the project are doomed
to failure. The 20:20 compact is a step in the right direction.
 The Social Summit in Copenhagen accepted this concept in which
20 per cent of aid and 20 per cent of government expenditure in
developing countries are devoted to investments in social sectors.
 These cover: basic education, primary health care, including
reproductive health care and family planning, nutrition, safe
drinking water and hygiene, and increasing the institutional capacity
to provide these services.  This initiative offers donors and
the recipient countries the opportunity to take responsibility
jointly for a policy of social development.
<P>
&quot;Sustainable development&quot; and &quot;human security&quot;
sound good in statements at Summit Conferences.  But here we are
not talking soundbites:  these concepts must be made central features
of government policies worldwide.  Policy in fields like trade,
debt, defence etc. cannot be treated in isolation from social
development.  The way in which we in the industrialised countries
treat the environment, agriculture and consumption has direct
consequences for poverty in other parts of the world.
<P>
Finally, development aid is a scarce resource and is becoming
even scarcer.  What is even worse is that a significant proportion
of the aid is still tied to projects which have more to do with
commercial or political interests than with the eradication of
poverty.  Aid must reach where the need is greatest.  Thorough
evaluation must identify those programmes that have the required
impact, and then the flow of aid must be channelled in that direction.
<P>
In the past year, a number of positive developments have occurred.
 After the Social Summit in Copenhagen, a meeting was held recently
in Norway where a number of countries discussed the 20:20 compact.
 There appeared to be a broad consensus about fulfilling the objective
of the 20:20 compact.  A number of donors and developing countries
expressed the intention to start using the concept and hold a
follow-up meeting in a maximum of two years to discuss progress.
<P>
The resources for implementing 20:20 will have to come from a
re-allocation of the existing budgets.  The developing countries
will review their national budgets and divert resources to basic
social provisions, and this will also be done at regional and
local level  Extra resources are necessary for this, in view of
the great extent of poverty and indebtedness of these countries.
 The donor nations present agreed to reserve more resources for
basic social provisions and allocated them via the existing aid
channels (aid to programmes and projects) and via multilateral
or private organisations.
<P>
The Oslo Declaration, which was adopted by the meeting, invited
the Development Assistance Committee of OECD (the organisation
of the rich, industrialised countries) to devise further criteria
and set up a reporting system to help the donor countries in re-allocating
their aid expenditure.  This initiative offers possibilities to
reach a policy genuinely aimed at eradicating poverty, provided
that civil society and NGOs are involved in all phases of policy,
from inception to evaluation, and not just in the implementation
phase.
<P>
The Social Summit and the follow-up conference in Norway are important
steps forward.  However, a great deal more is needed to make governments
all over the world shift the emphasis of their policy to the social
sector and the eradication of poverty. The world is standing on
the threshold of a new millennium, in a situation in which one
in every five inhabitants of the planet is born and dies in abject
poverty.  The situation can be combated effectively.  What we
need is the political will to make it the number one priority.

<H3>Reality of Aid 1996:<br>European aid under increasing pressure</H3>

<HR>
<P>
The European Community's development aid programme consists of
two components.  The programme of development cooperation with
African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries is based on the
Lom&eacute; Convention, an intergovernmental convention between
the European Member States and the ACP countries.  The implementation
of this agreement is handled by the European Commission and the
ACP countries.
<P>
Secondly there are the programmes usually referred to as &quot;budgetary
aid&quot;.  The legal basis for these programmes comes from the
Treaty of Maastricht, in which development aid is mentioned as
being a specific area of competence for the European Community.
<P>
<B>Lom&eacute;</B>
<P>
In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that the European
Union wants to revise its special relationship with the ACP countries.
 However, an interim revision of the Fourth Lom&eacute; Convention
was signed in early November 1995 in Mauritius.   The revised
Treaty will run for five years, ending in the year 2000.  The
Commission's view of the revision can be clearly understood from
the words of Development Commissioner Pinheiro, quoted in the
Courier; March/April 1995): &quot;<I>This is the last of the Conventions
as we know them</I>&quot;.  Anxiety among ACP countries that their
special status with the EU could disappear after the year 2000
is easily stirred up by such statements.
<P>
The <I>Revision</I> makes a number of important changes to Lom&eacute;
IV.  A striking change is that respect of human rights, democracy
and the rule of law are now essential components of the Convention.
 A suspensory condition is included for cases where &quot;<I>one
party considers that the other party has not fulfilled an obligation
with regard to the essential components&quot;</I>.
<P>
ACP countries will have slightly improved access to EU markets
for agricultural produce.  Both parties agreed that trade should
be high on the agenda.  It was also agreed to use resources for
Structural Adjustment to stimulate regional integration and intra-regional
economic liberalisation.  There was no progress on easing the
burden of debt.
<P>
The negotiations about the financial basis were difficult, and
were only completed just before the European Summit in June 1995,
under heavy pressure from the French Presidency.  The new Financial
Protocol (the financial resources available up to the year 2000)
amounts to 14 623 MECU.  That amount represents no real increase
on the financial resources by comparison with the previous period.
 This decision was strongly criticised by the Joint ACP/EU meeting.
<P>
The way in which European Union foreign policy evolves will largely
determine the future of the Lom&eacute; Convention.  A number
of factors are important:
<P>
- The potential accession of a substantial number of Central and
East European countries to the Community would make them an important
political factor.  They would want to take part in decisions about
EU foreign policy.  They have their own history and foreign policy
interests to bring to the table.  This would form the backdrop
against which they would pronounce judgement on the desirable
foreign policy for the Union.  Central and East European countries
are already associated with large areas of common European foreign
policy.  In future, they would play an increasing role in determining
the European identity;
<P>
- the financial cost of assimilating the Central and East European
countries will be high.  This would lead to increasing competition
for resources in the EU;
<P>
- discussions about the usefulness of development aid, combined
with the meagre prospects for political and economic improvement
in the ACP countries are leading to an unfavourable &quot;aid
climate&quot;;
<P>
- the increasing number of free trade agreements signed by the
European Union means that preferential treatment that ACP states
are granted is becoming less significant;
<P>
- the setting up of free trade areas could lead to discussion
being initiated about whether it would not be better to split
the ACP bloc into regional groups.  This would raise the issue
of the <I>raison d'&ecirc;tre</I> of the ACP as a group.
<P>
The European Commission has set up a working group which is due
to reflect upon the relationship between the Community and the
ACP countries in the next century.
<P>
<B>The EC Development Programme</B>
<P>
The Treaty of Maastricht set out the overall objectives of the
development policy to be adopted by the Community.
<P>
The Treaty established development aid as a subject area which
was unquestionably a matter for the European Community, the so-called
&quot;pillar 1&quot; of the European Union.  The powers of the
Community to implement development programmes is seen as complementary
to actions taken in this field by Member States.
<P>
Although the Maastricht Treaty provides that development aid in
the European Union must be coordinated to a greater extent, there
are a large number of problems standing in the way of a more efficient
policy.  Ultimately it is the Member States who decide what scope
the European Commission has to carry out its work  The Member
States take the decisions within the Council, and the Commission
has to implement them.  The problems facing the Commission are
of an institutional nature:
<P>
- <I>a lack of staff</I>.  Within the Directorate General dealing
with development, there are always a large number of vacancies,
sometimes up to one-third of the total management staff.  In addition,
a large number of temporary external staff are used.  A considerable
proportion of the core tasks are carried out by consultants working
outside the Commission.  In the programmes for Eastern Europe
and the CIS (PHARE and TACIS), the whole cycle of monitoring,
assessment and evaluation is handled by subcontractors;
<P>
- <I>a lack of expertise, mainly in the fields of social affairs
and the environment.</I> In a number of evaluations, it has already
been concluded that the limited number of staff and the lack of
expertise in major areas of policy are having a significant negative
impact on the quality of the programme.  The OECD's DAC committee
recently stated; <I>&quot;The main constraint may be, not refinement
of the policy itself, but the availability of sufficient specialised
staff and contractors for the Commission and its delegations to
carry out the policy in its details.  At present, as noted above,
the Commission needs to assure that it is not deficient in some
of the key fields for working on poverty alleviation - participatory
development, gender, population, health, education, environment
and the social sciences&quot;;</I>
<P>
- <I>an incoherent organisational structure.</I>  Since the appointment
of the present Commissioners, there are four Directorates General
dealing with parts of development policy, as well as the European
Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO).  These DGs are regionally-oriented.
 In addition, Member States have tried to influence the EC development
programme by setting up a bureaucratic web of committees;
<P>
- <I>divergent  objectives of different policy interests</I>.
 The regional orientation of the DGs means that they also have
to deal with other aspects of European foreign policy (politics,
security, trade) in their region.  This is a potential source
of conflicts of interest.
<P>
- a<I> complex budget</I> creates considerable tension between
multilateral and bilateral actions (by the Member States) and
between the resources within and outside the EU budget;
<P>
- <I>increasing pressure from Member States to exert influence
on the EC development policy via a bureaucratic web of committees.</I>

<P>
The Member States can improve aid policy through the Council of
Ministers.  As long as they fail to do so, they are responsible
for the continuation of the implementation problems mentioned.
 The European Commission merely has an executive role.  The Treaty
of Maastricht requires greater coordination of European aid, including
the European Community policy and that of the Member States. 
A large proportion of the coordination is the job of the Commission,
but their is a lack of cooperation from the Member States.  The
main reason for this reluctance is probably that development aid
is considered as a visiting card for the donor country.  It appears
that there is a need for better cooperation on foreign policy
(via the Intergovernmental Conference) before there can be better
coordination of European aid.
<P>
In 1995, a number of important decisions were taken to flesh out
the European development policy.  In additional a large number
of bilateral and regional cooperation and association agreements
were concluded with countries outside the Union.  This contributed
to the development of EU foreign policy.
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
<P>
The Maastricht Treaty emphasized the need to coordinate the Development
efforts of the European Union, including the European Community
Program and the Member States, in a complementary but coherent
fashion.
<P>
   
<P>
Important decisions were made during 1995 to advance these objectives
through regulations concerning development instruments. Moreover
a large number of bilateral and regional cooperation and association
agreements were agreed with countries outside the Union. The increasing
clarification of the EU external framework in itself should be
commended.
<P>
  
<P>
 Also important limitations were identified, constraining the
quality of the work of the European Commission on development
cooperation. These limitations are institutional in nature:
<P>
  
<P>
  * extreme limitations in terms of staffing;
<P>
  * lack of expertise in key areas of development; particularly
in social areas and the environment;
<P>
  * the disjointed nature of the organisation and structure of
the implementing Directorates General;
<P>
  * the complexity of the budget;
<P>
  * the contradictions between goals within the scope of foreign,
security, commercial and development policies;
<P>
  * and the way in which the Member States have sought to influence
decisions in relation to the European Community  Program through
a bureaucratic set up of mazes of various committees.
<P>
  
<P>
 External relations of the European Union are changing. Soon the
European Union will probably include 12 new Members States, which
will take almost half of the political weight inside the Community
and with specific interests of their own. This integration process
will consume enormous financial resources. Only the best of programs
will be able to survive competing demands for EU resources.
<P>
  
<P>
The impact of the traditional emphasis on trade of the EU development
program has also eroded as the EU is engaging in a large number
of Free Trade Agreements with other external regions. These developments
will lead to further questioning regarding the future of the EU
development program.
<P>
  
<P>
The key question concerns the relationship between the European
Union and the Member States. That is what the Inter Governmental
Conference in 1996 will deal with, and what makes the conference
extremely important. Also for development cooperation, even if
it will not be explicitly on the agenda. For all those involved
in development cooperation this provides an opportunity. The challenge
will be to formulate common but specific objectives and actions
to develop the future European external relations, which recognizes
and addresses the global social needs as a common European interest.

<TR><TD><B>When I became involved in the Pure Genius occupation I was working for a Borough Council's Engineering Consultancy and living in a squat in Hackney. I am opposed to the building of the Newbury Bypass and had been actively involved in the protests along the route. I heard of plans to occupy a derelict site in the city for a week and was interested  as it presented the opportunity to demonstrate a positive side of the direct action movement. 
<P>
Different groups spend much of their time in retrospective campaigning to stop this or that development. Often because another part of our disappearing natural wealth is threatened and too few people cared to take action early enough. So we get TV pictures of protesters up trees whilst the police, industrialists and politicians talk about the cost to the country of the action as if the protesters were committing treason.
<P>
Politicians and business people are great at giving lip service to the need for sustainability yet are apparently unwilling to take the actions necessary to move towards it.... It is only the actions of politicians that have the means to pass laws controlling the boundaries of business...... And it is increasingly only multinational or very large business that controls the resources which can  effect change on the scale necessary. 
<P>
It is generally excepted that much environmental destruction is caused directly or indirectly by the way we globally consume resources. The cities of the world are the places with the highest resource and energy consumption. If unchecked  unwise lifestyles will sooner or later lead to more and more global crisis, getting closer and closer to the homes of even the very rich. As societies and individuals we must produce huge changes in patterns of consumption.  
<P>
In urban areas these changes could come in the form of developments which are more people centred, that encourage the use of sustainable transport and energy systems, the recycling of materials and that reduce the costs of living to communities by cycling more of their wealth within themselves and therefore stop it disappearing into the global money market upon which it needs to be replaced by wages from artificial jobs which only increase consumption. The planning system allows for this to happen. But it is so often manipulated by land owners and developers who's interests are simply to make the largest profits possible.
<P>
This is why The Land Is Ours campaign's occupation of a derelict urban site highlighted so well the farcical nature of the current planning and economic systems and the lack of real will within influential companies to put sustainable ideas into practice..... To occupy a site with nothing of interest to anyone on it, that had been left empty and inaccessible for many years due to the fact that the owners simply wished to make a profit from it was a great idea..... That the developers who where employed had chosen to try and force planning permission through for an unwanted carpark and supermarket, the cheapest type of things to build for the largest returns, brilliant....The fact that the site was in a rare, prime riverside location in a European capital city and hence should be the perfect place in which to demonstrate the ideas of forward thinking sustainable urban development, an opportunity which had been ignored by the council planners, the city planners, the owners and the developers, Genius. After all it is so much easier to carry on doing what you have always done.
<P>
There are many other people who have chosen to have lifestyles which put into practice the ideas of sustainable living. By their very nature these low income, high quality lifestyles need the attention  and time of the folk involved which often means they can give less time to long term occupations and protests than they would wish. People could plan to be involved in this protest for a short period of time and be seen to be supporting a change in attitudes towards urban development and the manipulation of peoples possible futures which are so often dictated by the short sighted actions of those who hold the financial power for change in our cities. 
<P>
I decided to help out..... After the initial meetings, publicised in newspapers,  groups of people willing to take on various tasks had formed. I was to help with the buildings and materials gathering. There were about ten of us working on this when we could between work and other commitments. Different groups identified their needs, Jacqueline with her van, Brendan myself and others were out searching for sources of useful things as requested.  The date was set for the occupation and I had a vague idea of the sorts of materials that could be found and might be useful. The material gathering team had drop off points around the city and folk were out scanning the streets from the top decks of buses looking for piles of waste wood from demolitions. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="oct.gif" ALT="Octavaia's" WIDTH=282 HEIGHT=162 BORDER=0 ALIGN="RIGHT">
We needed to build a big structure as a focus for the village. It was agreed to build a round house to take two hundred people. A simple sketch and a little thought and I had a list of timber sizes and lengths we were looking for and fixings we would need to hold it together safely. The building had to be flexible and able to be erected on hard or soft land as we still didn't know were we were going. Other buildings would have to be built from whatever was available. There was very little money to be spent, most of that would go on transport and food, some on the compost and materials for the gardens.
<P>
I was evicted from the flat I had been squatting with three friends, we had just started decorating. This gave me more opportunity to try new bus routes to work. Another friend offered the floor of a spare room, whilst moving our stuff round in a camper van the engine caught fire under our belongings. The fire extinguisher from an Indian takeaway saved the day, the omens were good, there were three weeks to go.
<P>
The wood for the roundhouse was finally located, Brendan had been bringing in bits from a mysterious source but there wasn't enough. Then on a bus up the A40 I spotted it, a huge pile from the demolition of the houses to widen the road. A quick visit from Jacqueline and I, some negotiations with the contractors and we had a truck load delivered to our storage space.   
<P>
We were still faced with a transport problem. I have not owned a vehicle for four years and there was only one, very busy, van between us and the piles for collection were growing, skips were going unemptied. Then late one evening the phone rang "I hear you need a van ?" a cheery voice said " If you can get to Norfolk its all yours for a few weeks.  My name's Ken." This was a problem, I was one of the few people that could drive but I was working every day and most of the other time was tied up with sorting out the materials for possible building work and preparing the timber for the roundhouse. I phoned back to try and get him to drive over to London, a yo-yo of telephone conversations followed, at last two days later it was resolved. Ken would come to help in a few days time. I slept well that night..... until the phone rang at four in the morning. It was Ken back from a night out celebrating his birthday, drunk and apologetically dialing the wrong number. Who was this weird guy? 
<P>
In the next few days I watched our piles of tat grow in our central storage. There was now a team of us working on the wood, Steve, Brendan, Gary, Nick and I sawing, shaping and piling a few hours here a few hours there. Yurt frames began to take shape as Anja provided the instructions to us. Spirits were high but there was no where near enough materials to provide shelter for the hundreds of people expected  and to deal with their waste. Jacqueline's van was increasingly busy with food and gardening materials. She was constantly collecting at any free moment in her own busy life. Piles of pallets and plastic barrels for bins were appearing day by day. 
<P>
Ken arrived bringing energy and enthusiasm he was the one of the many great people I would meet in the next few months. With the increased capacity to shift things the piles increased. Old sleepers arrived, plastic sheet from scaffold companies around the city, more pallets, plywood, guttering and pipe for the gardens. At last I felt we had what we needed to be sure the first few days would be constructive. Other people started to arrive with their contributions. The truck and coaches were arranged for moving everything in to the site. I had arranged the occupation week off work and was happy things were going to plan.
<P>
May 4th arrived and many other people gathered at the battlebridge. The truck was carefully loaded with all the materials for the roundhouse, gardens and the most essential composting toilets, the two vans were full to their weight limits with food, yurts, plastic sheet, tools and a scaffold tower. Travellers vehicles took still more things. There was still piles to be moved but they would have to wait for a second journey assuming we got in to the site.... Wherever it was. 
<P>
The material gatherers retired to the pub for a well earned rest. I just had to sleep, get up and find the meeting place on time in the morning.         
<P>
When I arrived at the small green in Hammersmith the next morning there were hundreds of people milling around. What was happening? Where were we going? Who knew what coach to get on?  Portable phones were stuck to ears and some sort of raffle was going on. It turned out this was tickets for the coaches. Slowly they were filling, but where was the truck with the materials in that I was supposed to get a lift in? Had the police decided to stop it as they had with other demonstrations in the past?, surely not.... 
<BR>
At last a phone rang, it was just coming down the road, London's great road network was just working as normal.
<P>
The convoy moved off, leaving still more people for second coach journeys. I could see bicycles moving amongst the traffic, waving at the coaches, excited faces peered through windows smiling. Passers by looked on, something not quite normal was going on. The vehicles headed south. I was apprehensive but excited, it was happening.... I was about to suffer a shock. 
<P>
We moved through Hammersmith, down towards the river and into Putney across the bridge. This was all familiar to me as I worked on a contract for the local council here. The coaches turned east along the south of the river, I began to have an uneasy feeling about possible destinations. Sure enough my worst fears were about to be confirmed. Wandsworth bridge appeared in front of us. As we pulled onto the roundabout I could see the coaches parked in front of the site and people getting out. We were waved past in the truck and into the gateway. Excited, smiling people looked up at the cab directing us on, happy laughter rose above the noise of the passing traffic...  Shit, I thought, I can see the office from here.
<P>
There was no time now to dwell on this. A brief welcome to the site and a meeting time was set. The back of the truck was opened and the unloading began. Piles of different timbers and materials that had taken three weeks to accumulate were reformed in seconds by masses of willing hands. I was kept busy making sure colour coded parts were all stacked together, meanwhile all around many more people were exploring the site. It was quite beautiful, behind the timber hoarding it had been forgotten and the scrubland was dotted with trees, shrubs and flowers almost like a secret garden. There was a sense of peace there, hidden from the busy road with the sounds of the river to one side. In the weeks to come I would often find this calm after the chaos of the city.
<P>
Unloading over, there was a little time before the meeting to find a place for the roundhouse. I thought that there was to be a short discussion about where to erect the different structures. But as I looked for the place that felt best to focus the village on I could see a huge dome already rising above the heads of it's builders. Meantime Steve, Gary and I found our spot. It was large enough for the roundhouse and left space all around for an outer circle of homes. There was a space to the west which was grassy and raised up perfect for watching a play or band in the roundhouse. I guestimated where the centre pole should go and scratched a cross in the ground.      
<P>      
The meeting started, various points were raised, where campers should pitch tents, which areas were to be left for wild life, where was potentially dangerous, phone locations for emergencies. There was a great level of excitement, we were here and in, the police had visited and had no problem, the site was owned by Guinness and was due to become a carpark and supermarket but the developers couldn't get planning permission and were taking it to a public enquiry. This was good news for me. If the site had been owned by the council I would have had big problems, If it had been granted planning permission I would also have a lot of explaining to do on the way to the dole office. I still had to go back to work in a weeks time where I was sure my colleagues would be very interested in what was going on.
<P>
In retrospect I think that more time should have been given from the start to laying out the site. There was a great momentum from different groups of people who all wanted to get on with erecting buildings and laying out gardens. But as most of the longer term dwellings had yet to be built and at this stage few people knew if they would be staying for longer than a week things just kept appearing here and there. In the longer term this was to mean that there was too much distance between different parts of the site and therefore it would be harder to keep an eye on everything and people would not be living or working so closely together. 
<P>
Back at the roundhouse site we began to dig the hole for the central post, the only bit which needed to go into the ground. Amazingly we had picked a point between two huge chunks of concrete a foot from each other with another piece about four foot down making the perfect foundation. Soon the post was up and by the end of the day the central section of the building was nearing completion. Steve and I spent much of the next three days working with a small group to get the rest of the frame up. Plywood was cut and nailed on the central roof and a tarpaulin formed temporary walls. Old light fittings found in Ken's van were nailed to four of the eight posts and filled with candles. As the sun set over Wandsworth bridge directly in front of the one open side it cast a golden light into the building. To me it took on the air of a temple, peaceful and calm with people sitting happily talking up plans for the rest of the site, playing music and reading poetry. 
<P>
The outer section began to appear, eleven more posts with beams and rafters leaving only the space where the sun came through in the evenings. From the roof there was a great view of the rest of the site. A fair few people had left after the bank holiday Monday but more were arriving every day drawn by the TV and newspaper coverage. There were Yurts, benders, tents, buses and wooden frames for houses. People carrying gardening equipment, plants and children. TV cameras and journalists appeared as if by magic out of bushes grabbing anyone passing. I began to feel a little frustrated by the lack of privacy and the constant questioning. Talking to other people they were having the same experiences, in the middle of carrying a large piece of wood from the wood pile or wheeling a barrow full of soil to a garden someone would stand in front of you and ask "what are you doing?" as if it wasn't obvious. 
<P>
I had ventured into the council office's on the Tuesday to confess my involvement in the occupation and to test the water amongst the staff. I believed in my motivations for being part of the protest but still had a strong responsibility to the people of the borough and to my colleagues who had given me their trust and whom spent their time working hard to provide services to the people of Wandsworth. I didn't want them to feel I was somehow doing something which would harm the people of the borough. Especially when my motives were to draw attention to the manipulation of local council's by big businesses which so often happens, putting profits in front of community and more and more creating a world in their own image which the rest of us have to live with.
<P>
Things were OK. The ruling conservative councillors (who had been busy selling off parks and graveyards for building on ) were not very happy to say the least. However my bosses felt there was no conflict of interest as it was private land. Many council workers were enjoying seeing the councillors getting wound up and finding the whole thing very amusing. I still had a job to go back to .....
<P>
Things on the site buzzed on. There was a shortage of plywood for the walls of the roundhouse. Early morning trips to local waste disposal sites soon turned up the required wood. Ken and I would set off before the city had woken and use the empty roads to do a round trip taking in a load of skips and three waste sites. Later the roads were a nightmare and trips could take hours. The local DIY superstore proved to have friendly managers and big skips. 
<P>
Unlike the next door building site. The £150,000 to £450,000 flats being built by the river were obviously going to benefit many of the locals! Especially the (not) local developer (offices in the city, investments world-wide), the multinational contractor, the labourers (very few of which turned out to be local) and the local prospective Tory councillor  who would gain some wealthier residents in this generally poor part of the Borough. The site manager refused to let us take the waste wood from the skips, it being much more useful in landfill sites. Fortunately the night watchman was much more reasonable.
<P>
I now had time to work on a home for myself. I had been to the meetings held for people who might want to stay on after the protest finished, I was homeless, though with the security of friends and family to stay with if I needed to. The site was local to my work and my contract had some time to run. I am not fond of cities but as I had planned to be around until my job finished and as I had come to feel a responsibility for the local area through my work I decided I would stay. I found some pine trunks which had come from near Newbury and looked around for other materials, there were a few pallets. Later that day the frame had taken shape. It was to be a small pyramid with two floors. The design was simply the easiest way of using the materials lying around. The bed space upstairs was small and could be insulated easily, the downstairs was big enough to work and live in. Not the greatest flat in London but the rent was cheap and the garden magnificent.
<P>
I was waking early with the first light and watching the river and the wildlife on the site. Foxes came and went, birds sang and butterflies danced. I sat one morning in the compost toilets taking a morning dump with the sunlight filtering through the plastic walls along with distant city noises. It was more than halfway though the week and I was happy with the progress. Still seated I pulled the plastic aside to watch the Butterflies in the Buddlia and found the lens of a video camera and the channel four film crew smiling at me "could you tell us what you are doing now"..... It sort of summed up much of the first week.
<P>
Another thing that stood out was the failure of much of the media to realise that what they were watching was people who were used to living a certain way, co-operatively instead of competitively, spontaneously meeting and organising what to do next based on immediate resources and a desire to communicate and draw from our collective knowledge. I remember one early article which said "the protesters met and organisers read prepared speeches" what actually happened was we met and people stood up and talked as they thought necessary at the time. 
<P>
On the Friday night I left and took a bus to Oxford to draw a plan of the site on a friend's computer. I worked through the night to prepare a plan of how the site could possibly develop in the future with workshops and homes for local people, riverside cafes, a circular bus route and recreational spaces. It was intended to stimulate discussion amongst local people who were invited to an open day on the Saturday. 
<P>
What we had created was a low impact temporary settlement. I thought to create a sustainable, ecological urban development needed a realistic view that only a minority  of people would be content to live for long on the site as it had become. For me the main point was to get people thinking of ways to use this valuable space for the benefit of as many people as possible in ways that demonstrated the accepted ideas for planning sustainable cities: renewable energy generation (we had obtained a small wind generator for the site), public transport favoured over the private car, easy pedestrian and cycle access and buildings that were built as much as possible by those who were to live in them (making them cheaper, creating a sense of community by working together, providing work and cycling as much finance as possible back into the local economy).
<P>
I returned on Saturday lunch time to find a transformation. The wind generator span on the roof of the roundhouse above solar panels, the walls were finished, thin branches formed patterns in the windows and more candle holders made from reclaimed copper pipe spiralled around the central post. Gardens were full of plants and seedlings had already begun to sprout. The irrigation system for the gardens was working. Locals wandered around the site and a party spirit  was building up. That evening was the high point of the occupation for me. The efforts of so many different people had come together and created a truly unique place in the heart of a city.  Bands played late into the night as two hundred people danced inside the roundhouse. 
<P>
All that remained to do on the Sunday was to fit a lock to the small gate which had been chosen as the future entrance and present the keys to the people who had decided to stay on and the local people who had supported the occupation and were to hopefully become part of any future community. Steve and I got on with it finishing minutes before the ceremony. 
<P>
I was apprehensive about the future. I was homeless, living on the site would be insecure and I couldn't really expect to have many valuable belongings. Things had been going missing already, whilst many of the local children found the site fascinating some found it an easy place to nick things from. This had however had the interesting effect of drastically cutting crime and vandalism on the local estates. Worst of all I realised that many of the wonderful people whom I'd lived and worked with through the week would now be going back home. I also had to go back to work.
<P>
A new time was about to start and after the highs of the week and the energy and expectations that had been created it would be hard to hang on to the sense of community which had grown. Already people were arriving who had had no part in creating the space. They were homeless and needed a place to be, they were also unaware of some of the motivations behind the protest. They were joining those of us that wanted to stay, many who were also homeless but had shared experiences together.
<P>
It had always been known that after the protest week the village created would be left to those who wished to live there and would provide a place for the city's homeless. It would also be important to maintain the good relationship with the locals that had been developed. It was a big thing to ask of the residents, after all "the land is ours" so how do you ask someone to respect a place and what do you do when they refuse to do so?       
<P>
Those of us who had decided to stay had drawn up a list of things we felt should be respected by ourselves and new arrivals. Many people didn't want to impose rules and regulations on themselves, I felt and do still feel that boundaries have to be set for communities to live together. They have to deal with how you intend to live around each other and how you will treat the world  you live in. They provide a basis upon which to deal with conflicts that may arise. Maybe one of the problems that our society faces now is that its laws have evolved over long timescales and too much emphasis is now placed on those that focus on restricting individual freedoms and not enough on those that protecting what is there for us all from the interests of more powerful organisations. This has led to a widespread disrespect for all boundaries and a loss of recognition of why they were there in the first place. When governments and companies or their representatives can seemingly do what they wish, changing the rules if they don't suit them why shouldn't an individual?   
<P>
At the end of the second week I left for two days to have a break and think about the future. When  I returned there was a huge difference about the place, so many familiar faces were gone strangers sat around the fire with cans of beer. I felt lost and hurt in some way, as if you had returned home to find your family had undergone a transformation. It was unfair of me to feel this, many of the people there were fine just unknown at the time. It was the change from hundreds of people buzzing with enthusiasm to sixty trying to figure out what to do now that really caused this uncomfortable sensation. 
<P>
There were still about thirty people from the first few weeks and I soon settled down. I worked for two or three days a week and spent the rest of the time working on projects for the site or getting on with the rest of my life. The immediate problems now were the threat of eviction, what to do about the public enquiry into Safeway and Guinness's unpopular plans for the site, how to encourage and present alternative plans for the site and how to continue to create a good place to live amongst all these pressures. The eviction hearings were out of my hands. The advisory service for squatters was dealing with our defence as best it could. 
<P>
I could go and meet with Guinness, which small parties of us did on  three or four occasions. At these meetings I tried my best to communicate to their representatives the potential benefits of adopting a sustainable green development strategy for the site. Imagine one of the largest green developments of any major European capital, making a truly positive contribution to altering the face of our cities. Something politicians and various international bodies assure us is vital for the future.
<P>
Guinness pride themselves as a company on their environmental record. Indeed they have helped many worthwhile causes and support the Guinness housing trust. Their products whilst being mainly legal drugs are less harmful in production than many other industries.  However they suffer from the same, I believe, mistaken viewpoint that afflicts so many multinational companies caught up in their own financial momentum; That by encouraging people to consume more and more of their products and buying up and stamping out smaller competitors fuelling the profits for their shareholders, whilst giving a little to charities, they are somehow helping the world. As opposed to increasing the already unsustainable levels of consumption in the developed world and stopping badly needed finance from cycling in local economies. They didn't want to listen. As one of their directors said to me, typifying the attitudes of big business globally "We abdicated responsibility for the site in 1989 when we turned it over to the developers." To them it represented nothing more than an investment with a better rate of return than a bank.
<P>
I could also help in the presentation of objections to the government inspector at the planning public enquiry. There were already five local groups who objected to the proposals as well as the council planning committee who had already rejected two schemes. A small group of us formed and started to examine the plans. We drew upon the governments planning policy guidance notes (PPG) which are published under code numbers and titles, PPG7 for example deals with development in rural areas. There was also special guidance for Thameside development and the council's own Local plan. 
<P>
It is useless to object to any planning application on the grounds that you don't like it. For an objection to be successful you must prove harm will come from the proposal based upon the guidance given in PPG's and a few other official documents. Planning is a complex and seemingly dull area of bureaucracy and it is no surpass that so many unwelcome schemes get permission when large companies can employ specialists to force them through. Whilst most people objecting will be facing the system for the first time and be lost in a maze of paperwork. I had never been involved firsthand in  any of this stuff, though I had some idea of the process. To be honest it did my head in.  
<P>
Fortunately other people had more experience and provided  guidance. I spent the evenings either in the local pub using the light to read endless dull documents to counter the proposed traffic scheme or at friend's houses typing my proof of evidence. According to Safeway's engineers 700 new carparking spaces were not going to encourage more traffic in the area nor make the already dangerous roads worse. I asked traffic engineer friends for advice and used my own judgement to represent Safeway's  own traffic surveys in a less rosy light. At the same time I helped prepared our own planning application for the site which we finally presented on the day the enquiry opened. I was busy at work and becoming more tired due to the amount I had taken on.
<P>
The enquiry was to last for two weeks. I attended nearly every day with a few other people, except when I had to work. Finally my turn to give evidence came. I read the summary I had prepared and sat waiting to be cross examined by Safeway's lawyer. It was thankfully short, he questioned my qualifications. I wasn't a pure traffic engineer. Fortunately I was sure of the validity of my arguments and managed to give firm answers to his questions. I don't know how worried I looked. Mostly I felt angry that people like him are paid huge amounts by companies to argue for the most harmful of developments whilst the public usually have to rely on volunteers or overworked council officials. The true meaning of "the land is ours" for me is our right to have our voices heard and to be represented on an equal footing to the developers and planning specialists. We are all guardians of our country and its future should not be held in the hands of those who can be bought.
<P>
We produced flyers to encourage local people to come and have their say. Several hundred turned up for the special session which we persuaded the inspector to hold in a local church hall and I got to present a petition against the supermarket plan signed by several thousand more. This was an uplifting evening for me as I had started to doubt if people could be bothered to try and express their views. Most I had talked to didn't know they could influence decisions or were too busy trying to get by, caught up in the struggles of their own lives. Some simply didn't give a shit. Many did however, people I had never seen were there to reject the plans and ask for better schemes to be considered.    
<P>
As I write this I have no idea if we succeeded to block the proposal as the inspector has yet to report. If we did then for me the occupation did something for the people of Wandsworth as well as the first week's protest had done something to highlight the many abuses of our shared land by faceless profit hungry organisations. Our planning application was rejected by the council. 
<P>     
Back on the site many people had little idea what was going on. Some were alienated by the idea of the communal meetings so didn't come. Others were far to drunk to care. Some had other problems of their own. As more of London's homeless found the site or were sent by churches or shelters so the hardships of living there had increased. Most of my friends from the first weeks were trying to get on with building homes and gardens. Many supporters from all over the country came to visit and help during the days. But increasingly I came to feel we were being overwhelmed by the needs of those less able or unwilling to sort themselves out. At night the local drunks would come to hang out, a few folk had serious drug problems, some had mental health problems.... I finally found time to finish my home.
<P>
Basically we were facing the same problems as much of society, more concentrated in the cities and more so on the streets. We had failed to stop people who would not or could not respect the place or themselves from coming in and there were too few with the skills or the energy to confront it. It was obvious by the praise from visitors that this was not so obvious from the outside. Maybe I was simply too sensitive about my home and ideals. There were certainly still lots of good times and on the whole it was amazing how well a large group of strangers were getting on in hard circumstances...                     
Those of us who cared for the site and had invested time in it, including many of the later arrivals, were increasingly tense. The threat of eviction was constantly there and we had no more legal avenues left. The fact was many people now on the site didn't seem to care about this. They had to many problems of their own and being moved on was a normal part of existence. The late night visitors didn't care anyway as it was just another place to hang around when it was gone they could find another.
<P>
For me communicating with the local people and getting them to participate in the future of the site was the only way I had ever seen to take the protest further and to provide any possible security to those who wanted to stay on. I was increasingly finding it frustrating that so many site residents took no interest in welcoming visitors or communicating with the local people. Even so there were still a core of regular visitors from the local estates some of whom worked on improving the site some who used it as a place for recreation. The weekly "open" days usually went well and the arts and music provided much needed energy to those who were struggling behind the scenes to tidy up before the events. 
<P>
For me though it was becoming harder to face both the supporters from off site and those who were working so hard within it. My contract had finished and I had to come to terms with my own needs and desires. On the positive side there had been no eviction despite having lost the court battle. There were new people arriving who wanted to make the place work. There was a diverse community forming on the land. A developer had expressed interest in buying the site for housing and small business. Though I was unsure if he truly appreciated sustainable principles he was at least listening. I had some part time work and could get another contract if I wanted to, though this would be in another part of the city. I had a home I was happy to live in and good friends on the site and elsewhere in the city. 
<P>
On the down side I felt that after the excitement of the protest and the enquiry many local people had increasingly been alienated by the behaviour of some people. There was an increased level of conflict between those who's interests were a little broader than self and those who just wanted a fire and a beer. Occasional fights had broken out between drunks. My home had been broken into by one of the local teenagers and a friend and I had lost some belongings. Losing the stuff was OK but the fact that It was so easy to do and that most of the locals knew those of us living there had very little was upsetting. 
<P>
Mainly I had to recognise that I have a deep dislike for city life and that long-term I had no intention of staying there. This led to me being unwilling to forcefully express my opinions to the other residents who were happy to live within the city. If I was not to be a part of the place whatever the future held then I could only offer advice and accept the decisions of others. Worst of all I could no longer face the supporters and friends who wanted so much for the place and saw the good things that were going on as I was unsure if enough residents were now still aware of the reason the site existed. I had no energy left to confront the selfish elements of our community who were abusing the good will of the local people and all those who had put so much effort into creating the place to start with. Thankfully others did.
<P>
Kate a friend who had helped at the start of the occupation had asked Mike Feingold a top permaculture teacher to visit and hold a two day workshop. This was a great event. There were a fair number of people who had been continuing to practice the techniques of permaculture on the site since the first protest week. Many others who had arrived had little idea of green sustainable lifestyles and had been mainly unwilling (or unable) to listen to those of us who did. Visitors had received as much information as they wanted but I think many of the new residents thought that the people they met when they arrived were just hanging around and  didn't have any worthwhile knowledge to share. Or they felt threatened by anyone who wanted to discuss ways of living with them. Mike, being an "expert" was listened to by more people and it was incredible how talking stopped, faces turned and eyes lit up as he explained how people all over the world have taken wasted land and a long term way of thinking and turned them into an ecological livelihood. The silence followed by gasps that greeted his slides of places transformed not by Governments, developers and big business but by people who worked together for a sustainable green future was for me the perfect communication of the vision so many people had shown during the first week.          
<P>
Several more weeks passed. The stress to all of not knowing if or when we were to be evicted showed. Occasionally tempers frayed.  I withdrew more from active involvement in the social life of the site. I was exhausted and only wanted to spend my time with friends. I was also increasingly unhealthy and run down. Whereas in the past I had enjoyed running around the place helping to build new things now I mainly wanted to be left alone or with friends who bounced back the energy I shared with them. I still couldn't decide if I wanted to stay or leave. I had shared so much with so many wonderful people who were still there and felt unable to leave those I cared for who had given me so much. Finally I left for a break to decide my future plans. I wasn't going to live on the site again. 
<P>
I returned for a few days after two weeks and was glad to see friends getting on with life and to be able to view the site from a different perspective. However for me it was enough, the place felt better than I remembered but I had decided to put my efforts into somewhere that had more chance of being there in ten or a hundred years time where the weight of corporate finance was less likely to march the bailiffs in to further increase their profits.  For me the site had failed to have a collective vision of its future that was strong enough to move towards.                
<P>
Land rights and land use issues command a lot of attention when they occur in other countries. Their effects on the environment are noted and publicised. In the South American rainforests, mining, fossil fuel exploration and the actions of homeless people driven off their land into the forest by huge landowners have long been recognised by large sections of the public in Europe as damaging to the environment. People are horrified to hear of the corruption and manipulation of legal processes which goes on in the name of business and economics. 
<P>
Why then do we allow (often the same) large wealthy organisations to control and manipulate land use in our own countries ? Maybe because the inequities in the distribution of wealth between very rich and poor are less obvious here, there are fewer very poor and there is a welfare system to assist those at the bottom of the pile which blurs the edges of the problem. Maybe because it is hundreds of years since the land here was divided and enclosed. Maybe because we have a system of strong established planning Laws and very few people know or care how they work. Maybe because developments of the scale that we have become accustomed to require the resources and expertise only available in such organisations and we are not offered and, as a society, do not yet want an alternative?   
<P>
The protest gave me a greater insight into the social problems of our and other nations. It also gave me a still greater respect for those who spend their lives dealing with them. However I remain convinced that they are symptoms of the greater problems of greed and over consumption which have developed over centuries.
<P>
The future  must be shaped by us all working towards ways of having satisfying, stimulating lives that respect and maintain the diversity of life on the planet and provide for our needs. This does not necessarily mean having a "job" in the traditional sense, simply to supply the money to buy our desires. A sustainable secure future is one where our education and knowledge of the interactions and processes in nature are enhanced by our skills and technology to provide for our needs and give time for the social interactions which support our sense of self and reduce our insecurities. 
<P>
There is a beautiful  world to share, not to be denied to people because they have to participate in an economic roundabout the proceeds of which are siphoned off to the financial elite before they can even start to buy their bit of it. If the pure genius occupation did nothing else it housed and fed sixty people over four months close to central  London, with no more social problems than are seen on any estate, for a cost of around four thousand pounds. Or, putting it another way, less than £20 a person a month. So when we are told there simply isn't the money to educate our children or develop alternative sustainable cities maybe we will start to question supermarket profits in the hundreds of millions and  developers and financiers speculating with billions of pounds worth of land whilst manipulating the planning system and forcing us all to live with the results?

<TITLE>The Impact of Armed Conflict on Children</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR=FFFFFF>

<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR> 
The <A HREF="http://www.unicef.org/graca">Impact of Armed Conflict on Children</A> is the result of a
two-year process of research and consultation undertaken by Gra&ccedil;a Machel, the
Secretary-General's Expert on the subject and a former Minister for Education in Mozambique. 
<P>
Millions of children are caught up in conflicts in which they are not merely bystanders, but targets. Some
fall victim to a general onslaught against civilians; others die as part of a calculated genocide. Still other
children suffer the effects of sexual violence or the multiple deprivations of armed conflict that expose
them to hunger or disease. Just as shocking, thousands of young people are cynically exploited as
combatants.
<P>
The report says that in the past decade, around 2 million children have been killed in armed conflict, three
times as many have been seriously injured or permanently disabled, and countless others have been
forced to witness or even to take part in horrifying acts of violence.
<P>
As a result, says the report, children are being denied the protection promised them in the <A
HREF="http://www.unicef.org/crc">Convention on the Rights of the Child</A>. War violates every right of a
child &#151; the right to life, the right to be with family and community, the right to health, the right to
the development of the personality, and the right to be nurtured and protected.

<P>
<B>Necesidad de una pol&#237;tica comunitaria m&aacute;s activa en
la cooperaci&oacute;n para el desarrollo. La Comisi&oacute;n de
las Comunidades Europeas (CE) present&oacute; al Consejo y al
Parlamento Europeo un documento en el que se analiza la pol&#237;tica
comunitaria de cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica con los pa&#237;ses
en desarollo y se realizan recomendaciones para el futuro.
D+C publica los capitulos III y IV de ese documento.</B>
<P>
<B>D&eacute;ficits de la situaci&oacute;n actual</B>
<P>
En la actualidad la politica de desarrollo se caracteriza por
cierta atomizaci&oacute;n de la ayuda estatal individual y de
la comunitaria, as&#237; como por tres grandes obst&aacute;culos que
impiden una pol&#237;tica realmente coordinada. Se trata del d&eacute;ficit
en la coordinaci&oacute;n entre la cooperaci&oacute;n para el
desarrollo comunitaria y la de cada uno de los Estados;el d&eacute;ficit
en la coherencia pol&#237;tica global entre pol&#237;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n
y otras pol&#237;ticas comunitarias, as&#237; como ciertos aspectos de los
procesos comunitarios de integraci&oacute;n, y finalmente la escasa
fuerza de expresi&oacute;n y de convicci&oacute;n de la Comunidad
en los gremios internacionales y ante otros donantes.
<P>
Con este d&eacute;ficit se ven perjudicados en primer lugar los
pa&#237;ses en desarrollo, ya que se les priva de las ventajas concentradas
de una pol&#237;tica coherente acordada entre la Comunidad y sus Estados
miembros. Adem&aacute;s, a menudo caen en la tentaci&oacute;n
de aprovechar las rivalidades existentes para obtener ventajas
inmediatas. Por ello los pa&#237;ses en desarrollo no siempre pueden
contar con una posici&oacute;n comunitaria previsible, univoca,
por parte de sus socios internacionales.
<P>
Fuera de esto, la situaci&oacute;n mencionada es desventajosa
para los propios Estados miembros: el d&eacute;ficit de coordinaci&oacute;n
y la escasa fuerza de expresi&oacute;n y convicci&oacute;n de
la Comunidad permiten, a menudo en contra de los aut&eacute;nticos
intereses de los Estados miembros, un espacio pare rivalidades
intracomunitarias y debilitan su posici&oacute;n competitiva.
<P>
Esta situaci&oacute;n afecta, no en &uacute;ltima instancia, a
la misma Comunidad, porque el d&eacute;ficit de coherencia global
y la escasa fuerza de expresi&oacute;n y convicci&oacute;n de
la Comunidad reducer las posibilidades para el reconocimiento
de la identidad europea en la arena internacional.
<P>
<B>Consecuencias del Tratado de Maastricht</B>
<P>
El tratado demanda la definici&oacute;n de objetivos comunitarios,
pero tambi&eacute;n su consideraci&oacute;n &quot;en las pol&#237;ticas
perseguidas por ella (la CE), que pueden afectar a los pa&#237;ses
en desarrollo (articulo 130, V)&quot;. Se recomienda expresamente,
por lo tanto, una coherencia global en t&eacute;rminos de pol&#237;ticas.
<P>
En el articulo 130 x, p&aacute;rrafo 1, se dice: &quot;La Comunidad
y los Estados miembros coordinan su pol&#237;tica en el &aacute;rea
de la cooperaci&oacute;n para el desarrollo y acuerdan sus programas
de ayuda, incluso en las organizaciones internacionales y en las
conferencias internacionales. Pueden adoptar medidas conjuntas.
Los Estados miembros contribuyen, en caso de ser necesario, a
la realizaci&oacute;n de los programas de ayuda de la Comunidad&quot;.
Estas determinaciones apuntan al d&eacute;ficit de coordinaci&oacute;n.
<P>
La Comunidad y los Estados miembros son llamados adem&aacute;s
en el art&#237;culo 130 x a una concertaci&oacute;n fortalecida dentro
de los gremios internacionales, lo que se refiere a la escasa
capacidad de expresi&oacute;n y convicci&oacute;n de la Comunidad.
<P>
<B>Ventajas comparativas</B>
<P>
Si se consideran las atribuciones transferidas a la Comunidad
y los efectos de la uni&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica y monetaria,
queda de manifiesto que las cuestiones de las nuevas interdependencias
Norte-Sur (comercio, medio ambiente, poblaci&oacute;n, drogas,
sida) no pueden ser resueltas sin m&aacute;s por un Estado miembro
a nivel bilateral. O estos temas superan el marco nacional (medio
ambiente) por su tem&aacute;tica, o caen en el &aacute;mbito de
la Comunidad (comercio), o se prev&eacute; f&aacute;cilmente su
coordinaci&oacute;n en el proceso de la integraci&oacute;n europea
(por ejemplo, libertad de movimiento y pol&#237;tica de inmigraci&oacute;n,
las que pueden beneficiarse de la pol&#237;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n),
o simplemente las ventajas de la concentraci&oacute;n y de la
coordinaci&oacute;n arrojadas por una unificaci&oacute;n de las
posibilidades pol&#237;ticas y materiales de la Comunidad y de los
Estados miembros incrementar&#237;an sustantivamente la efectividad
de su ayuda. En cada uno de estos temas hay que reflexionar sobre
la medida en que se ha de aplicar el principio de la subsidiaridad.
<P>
<B>Compromisos pr&oacute;ximos</B>
<P>
El primer protocolo financiero en el marco del cuarto Tratado
de Lom&eacute; comprende el periodo entre 1990 y 1994. Las orientaciones
establecidas por el Consejo para Am&eacute;rica Latina y Asia
son v&aacute;lidas hasta 1995, y los protocolos del Mediterr&aacute;neo
pierden vigencia un a&ntilde;o despu&eacute;s. Por ello la Comunidad
se ver&aacute; obligada en los a&ntilde;os de 1994 a 1996 a examinar
sus relaciones con el conjunto de los pa&#237;ses en desarrollo en
una medida que ella misma se fije. Es importante determinar con
vistas a estas fechas un marco coherente pare esta pol&#237;tica de
cooperaci&oacute;n para el desarrollo.
<P>
<B>Bases de una pol&#237;tica comunitaria de cooperaci&oacute;n para el
desarrollo</B>
<P>
<B>Principios b&aacute;sicos</B>
<P>
Como toda otra pol&#237;tica comunitaria, la pol&#237;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n
tambi&eacute;n debe basarse en los valores fundamentales que fueron
determinantes para los comienzos de la Comunidad, vale decir,
fomento de la paz en el mundo, soluci&oacute;n de conflictos por
medio del di&aacute;logo, desarrollo y consolidaci&oacute;n de
la democracia y del Estado de derecho, as&#237; como respeto a los
derechos humanos y las libertades b&aacute;sicas. El acuerdo de
Maastricht reitera estos valores en el titulo XVII, art&#237;culo 130.
<P>
Como la solidaridad es uno de los principios b&aacute;sicos de
la cooperaci&oacute;n para el desarrollo y uno de los valores
centrales de la obra de envergadura que construye Europa, habr&#237;a
sido imperdonable que s&oacute;lo fructificara en el marco de
la Comunidad y fuese palabra hueca m&aacute;s all&aacute; de sus
fronteras. Pero no se debe olvidar que la pol&#237;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n
econ&oacute;mica se sit&uacute;a en el marco m&aacute;s amplio
de las relaciones exteriores de la Comunidad.
<P>
Por ello deben considerarse los intereses rec&#237;procos de todos
los participantes, por ejemplo, en el otorgar miento de ventajas
comerciales y en las medidas relacionadas con la cooperaci&oacute;n
para el desarrollo.
<P>
Una pol&#237;tica comunitaria de la cooperaci&oacute;n para el desarrollo
debe, no en &uacute;ltima instancia, fortalecer tambi&eacute;n
la presencia de la Comunidad en el mundo y contribuir as&#237; al reconocimiento
de la identidad europea por parte de terceros pa&#237;ses y de las
organizaciones internacionales.
<P>
<B>Objetivos</B>
<P>
La pol&#237;tica de la cooperaci&oacute;n para el desarrollo fomentar&aacute;,
por medio de los recursos a disposici&oacute;n, la democracia
en los pa&#237;ses en desarrollo en el marco de una estabilidad pol&#237;tica
recuperada. Adem&aacute;s exige, de acuerdo al art&#237;culo 130 u,
p&aacute;rrafo 1, del Tratado de Maastricht
<P>
<ul>
<li>el desarrollo econ&oacute;mico y social permanente de los pa&#237;ses
en desarrollo, en especial de los pa&#237;ses en desarrollo m&aacute;s
afectados;
<P>
<li>la incorporaci&oacute;n arm&oacute;nica y gradual de los pa&#237;ses
en desarrollo a la econom&#237;a mundial;
<P>
<li>la lucha contra la pobreza en los pa&#237;ses en desarrollo.</ul>
<P>
<B>Consolidaci&oacute;n de la democracia en los pa&#237;ses en desarrollo:
reforma del Estado y del sistema pol&#237;tico</B>
<P>
La democratizaci&oacute;n continuar&aacute; siendo el factor decisivo.
Pero ning&uacute;n proceso pol&#237;tico puede permanecer en el tiempo
sin un proceso econ&oacute;mico correspondiente. Se requieren
estructuras econ&oacute;micasy democr&aacute;ticas s&oacute;lidas.
El cambio de las estructuras pol&#237;ticas tiene que ir acompa&ntilde;ado
de una profunda reforma de la estructura administrativa y de las
instituciones estatales, que deben ser apoyadas por medio de diversas
medidas (control de las tareas del Estado, que debe restringirse
a sus tareas esenciales, descentralizaci&oacute;n de los mecanismos
para toma de decisiones y de la administraci&oacute;n, perfeccionamiento
continuo y motivaci&oacute;n de los funcionarios estatales, etc.).
<P>
Al mismo tiempo las estructuras econ&oacute;micas y democr&aacute;ticas
deben fortalecerse por medio de la cooperaci&oacute;n descentralizaday
por medio de medidas para el desarrollo de la economia privada.
<P>
<B>Desarrollo econ&oacute;mico y social sostenido</B>
<P>
El principal objetivo tiene que ser la restauraci&oacute;n de
las premisas de crecimiento econ&oacute;mico en concordancia con
las exigencias ecol&oacute;gicas, vale decir,
<P>
<ul>
<li>por medio del regreso a un equilibrio econ&oacute;mico global
a trav&eacute;s de una fase de estabilizaci&oacute;n, cuya duraci&oacute;n
y costos - en especial, los sociales - a menudo son subestimados;
<P>
<li>por medio de una reconfiguraci&oacute;n detallada del aparato
econ&oacute;mico y - como n&uacute;cleo - la liberalizaci&oacute;n
consecuente de !a economia. Esto significa que el Estado no debe
operar m&aacute;s en las inversiones directas, pero debe crear
las premises pr&aacute;cticas y regales pare las inversiones.
<P>
<li>por &uacute;ltimo, por medio del control permanente de las premisas
para un desarrollo sostenido. Entre estas premisas se encuentran
la planificaci&oacute;n de la familia y la pol&#237;tica de educaci&oacute;n,
con el objeto de controlar el crecimiento demogr&aacute;fico,
un desarrollo econ&oacute;mico que sea compatible con un manejo
racional de los recursos naturales, que no afecte los grandes
equilibrios ecol&oacute;gicos, y el desarrollo de los recursos
humanos. Debera fortalecerse el papel de la programaci&oacute;n
a largo plazo bajo este aspecto.</ul>
<P>
<B>Incorporaci&oacute;n de los pa&#237;ses en desarrollo a la econom&#237;a
mundial</B>
<P>
Con la pol&#237;tica del ajuste estructural, los pa&#237;ses en desarrollo
persiguen sobre todo el objetivo de convertirse en actores plenos
de la econom&#237;a mundial. El comercio exterior es para la mayor&#237;a
de los pa&#237;ses en desarrollo la principal fuente externa de financiamiento.
Es de extraordinaria importancia para el desarrollo. El acceso
de los pa&#237;ses en desarrollo a los mercados de los pa&#237;ses industriales
se convierte por esto en una premisa b&aacute;sica para su desarrollo.
<P>
Una mayor apertura de los mercados de los pa&#237;ses industriales
demanda lo siguiente:
<P>
<ul>
<li>un incremento del poder&#237;o competitivo de los pa&#237;ses exportadores,
sin el cual no tendr&#237;a efecto un mejoramiento del acceso a los
mercados. De esto surge explicitamente la necesidad de crear un
marco institucional y normativo adecuado, de ampliar la transferencia
tecnol&oacute;gica y de intensificar la cooperaci&oacute;n industrial.
<P>
<li>reflexiones de la Comunidad sobre reestructuraciones que debe
adoptar consigo misma para posibilitar una mayor apertura de su
mercado para los productos provenientes de pa&#237;ses en desarrollo;
<P>
<li>consideraci&oacute;n del hecho de que los paises en desarrollo
obtendr&aacute;n, debido a su diverse capacidad competitive, beneficios
muy diversos de una aperture de los mercados, proceso en el que
algunos paises incluso correr&aacute;n el peligro de perder posiciones
si no adoptan medidas colaterales. Para numerosos paises en desarrollo
se brinda, en la via hacia el espacio econ&oacute;mico m&aacute;s
amplio, la posibilidad de cambiar su dimensi&oacute;n nacional
por la regional. La Comunidad cuenta con experiencia en estas
materias y continuar&aacute; y profundizar&aacute; las iniciativas
ya desarrolladas en este sentido.</ul>
<P>
<B>Lucha contra la pobreza</B>
<P>
Toda estrategia destinada a reducir la pobreza que afecta actualmente
a m&aacute;s de un tercio de la humanidad tiene que presuponer
una recuperaci&oacute;n del crecimiento, la creaci&oacute;n de
estructuras econ&oacute;micas s&oacute;lidas y la superaci&oacute;n
de las desigualdades.
<P>
Los frutos de estas reformas imprescindibles s&oacute;lo maduran
gradualmente. La pol&#237;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n para el desarrollo
debe apoyar por lo tanto medidas enfocadas a paliar directamente
ciertas formas de pobreza, as&#237; como las asperezas de los programas
de ajuste econ&oacute;mico. La prioridad la tiene bajo estas condiciones
todo aquello que fomenta el desarrollo humano, especialmente los
servicios b&aacute;sicos en los sectores de la salud y la educaci&oacute;n.

sur l'Union politique europ&#233;enne (d&#233;cembre 1991), dit "Trait&#233; de

europ&#233;enne.</b>
<p>
<h3>Le Trait&#233; de Maastricht et la coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppement</h3>

Le Trait&#233; de Maastricht, sign&#233; d&#233;but 1992 par les &Eacute;tats membres
de la Communaut&#233; europ&#233;enne, formule pour la premi&#232;re fois les
objectifs de la Communaut&#233; et de ses &Eacute;tats membres en mati&#232;re de
coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement.
<p>
Le ministre de la Coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement a demand&#233; au Conseil
Consultatif National pour la Coop&#233;ration au D&#233;veloppement (NAR) son avis
sur la fa&#231;on de pr&#233;ciser la politique de coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppement de la CE et de ses &Eacute;tats membres par l'&#233;laboration et la
mise en oeuvre des articles pertinents du Trait&#233; de Maastricht, une fois celui-ci
ratifi&#233;. Le ministre avait bas&#233; sa question entre autres sur le Commentaire
(septembre 1992), r&#233;dig&#233; par quatre membres du NAR, sur le rapport
intitul&#233; "La Communaut&#233; europ&#233;enne et la Coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppement dans la perspective de Maastricht", pr&#233;sent&#233; en juin 1992
&#224; la Seconde Chambre par le ministre, J. P. Pronk, et son secr&#233;taire
d'&Eacute;tat, P. Dankert. Les questions suivantes ont &#233;t&#233; pos&#233;es.
<p>
Comment interpr&#233;ter l'article 130 V du Trait&#233;, aux termes duquel la
Communaut&#233; tient compte des objectifs de la coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppement, vis&#233;s &#224; l'article 130 U, dans les politiques qu'elle met en
oeuvre et qui sont susceptibles d'affecter les pays en d&#233;veloppement? Quelles actions
peuvent-elles &ecirc;tre entreprises d&#232;s lors que l'article 130 W, paragraphe 1, rend
possible la prise de d&#233;cisions &#224; la majorit&#233; qualifi&#233;e? L'article 130
X permet de renforcer la coordination entre la Communaut&#233; et les &Eacute;tats
membres, tant pour ce qui concerne leurs politiques que pour la mise en oeuvre des
programmes d'aide. Quelles mesures pratiques peuvent-elles &ecirc;tre prises pour donner
forme &#224; cette coordination? Quelles cons&#233;quences la Communaut&#233; et les
&Eacute;tats membres doivent-ils y attacher? Comment interpr&#233;ter
concr&#232;tement le droit d'initiative de la Commission &#224; l'&#233;gard de la
coordination des politiques nationales en mati&#232;re de coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppement, y compris l'attitude des &Eacute;tats membres dans les organisations
internationales et lors des conf&#233;rences internationales?
<p>
<h3>L'avis du NAR (r&#233;sum&#233;)</h3>

Coh&#233;rence de la politique communautaire et coordination entre la CE et les
&Eacute;tats membres
Le NAR estime que la mise en oeuvre de la politique communautaire dans un domaine
donn&#233; - ou une proposition de politique - doit &ecirc;tre soigneusement
reconsid&#233;r&#233;e s'il appara&icirc;t qu'elle d&#233;favorise structurellement
(certains) pays en d&#233;veloppement. Si les probl&#232;mes entra&icirc;n&#233;s se
situent exclusivement au niveau de la transition, il est logique que la CE prenne des mesures
compensatoires temporaires tout en introduisant progressivement la nouvelle politique et en
aidant les pays en d&#233;veloppement &#224; mettre en oeuvre les nouvelles mesures.
<p>
Le NAR souligne la n&#233;cessit&#233; d'op&#233;rationnaliser la coop&#233;ration
d'abord au niveau de la mise en oeuvre, dans des secteurs sp&#233;cifiques et clairement
d&#233;finis pour lesquels des programmes peuvent &ecirc;tre formul&#233;s et mis en
oeuvre. Il convient de choisir, &#224; cet effet, de nouveaux terrains d'action
sp&#233;cifiques, par exemple la lutte contre le sida en Afrique, la politique
&#233;nerg&#233;tique en Afrique sub-saharienne, le soutien &#224; l'int&#233;gration
&#233;conomique des pays en d&#233;veloppement dans la r&#233;gion et la lutte contre
les probl&#232;mes environnementaux sp&#233;cifiques. Cette coordination devrait
remplacer les propositions de coordination actuelles, larges et relativement vagues, du
Conseil des ministres et de la Commission. La coordination ne peut &ecirc;tre
op&#233;rationnelle dans un domaine sp&#233;cifique de la politique qu'une fois
d&#233;finis les objectifs communautaires dans ce domaine. L'une des conditions en est
l'&#233;change d'informations sur les politiques nationales de la coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppement des &Eacute;tats membres. Accorder la priorit&#233; &#224; la
coordination au niveau de la mise en oeuvre implique que les repr&#233;sentants de la CE
dans les pays en d&#233;veloppement jouent un r&ocirc;le directeur et que leurs
comp&#233;tences soient renforc&#233;es.  
<p>
Le NAR pr&#233;conise une coordination efficace et l'int&#233;gration de toute la gamme
de conditions li&#233;es aux flux d'aide bilat&#233;rale des &Eacute;tats membres et de la
CE, et met en garde contre une accumulation et une diversification croissante des conditions
pos&#233;es par les donateurs et contre l'application de la conditionnalit&#233; &#224; un
nombre trop &#233;lev&#233; de domaines. Il sera indispensable de fixer des
priorit&#233;s, par exemple en mati&#232;re de bonne administration et de droits de
l'homme.
<p>
<h4>Le Conseil des ministres de la CE et la Commission europ&#233;enne</h4>
Le Conseil des ministres, responsable de domaines sp&#233;cifiques de la politique
communautaire, doit &#233;galement veiller &#224; ce que cette politique soit conforme
&#224; la politique communautaire en mati&#232;re de coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppement: c'est ce qu'en d'autres termes on appelle la coh&#233;rence. Il est
n&#233;cessaire que la Commission fasse rapport, annuellement, au Conseil des ministres
et au Parlement europ&#233;en de la  concr&#233;tisation de cette coh&#233;rence. Le
NAR estime qu'il faut octroyer au Conseil des ministres la comp&#233;tence de prendre
des d&#233;cisions contraignantes &#224; l'&#233;gard de la coordination de la politique
de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement de la CE et des &Eacute;tats membres.
<p>
La Trait&#233; de Maastricht et les recommandations du NAR en mati&#232;re de
coh&#233;rence et de coordination assignent de nouvelles t&#226;ches &#224;  la
Commission europ&#233;enne, dont la capacit&#233; est d&#233;j&#224; limit&#233;e et
jug&#233;e insuffisante par d'aucuns. Le NAR pr&#233;conise le renforcement des
divisions de la Commission responsables de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement
afin d'am&#233;liorer l'efficacit&#233;, la flexibilit&#233;, la qualit&#233; et le feedback
de l'organisation des programmes d'aide. Cette am&#233;lioration est n&#233;cessaire,
m&ecirc;me si les t&#226;ches actuelles de la Commission restent inchang&#233;es.
L'&#233;largissement &#224; court terme des t&#226;ches de la Commission dans le
domaine de la mise en oeuvre des programmes d'aide n'est pas souhaitable. Dans
l'hypoth&#232;se d'une extension de l'aide communautaire, le NAR recommande de choisir
les canaux d'ex&#233;cution de l'aide communautaire et/ou de l'aide coordonn&#233;e en
fonction des r&#233;sultats d'une &#233;tude comparative de l'efficience et de
l'efficacit&#233; des institutions gouvernementales, communautaires et
&#233;ventuellement non gouvernementales d'origine communautaire.
<p>
<h4>La politique communautaire commerciale et la Convention de Lom&#233;</h4>
Le NAR entend que soient conserv&#233;s les b&#233;n&#233;fices de la Convention de
Lom&#233; - un instrument combinant l'aide et le commerce, un "contrat" renfermant
&#224; la fois des droits et des obligations, un cadre institutionnalis&#233; de
concertation - mais propose en m&ecirc;me temps de reconsid&#233;rer la base de ce cadre
avant l'expiration de la Convention de Lom&#233; IV, et ce en vue de fonder la
Convention, plus que dans le pass&#233;, sur les principes de la coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppement. Cette reconsid&#233;ration doit avoir pour effet qu'un certain
nombre des pays les "plus d&#233;favoris&#233;s" soient ajout&#233;s &#224; la liste des
pays en d&#233;veloppement qui sont Parties &#224; la Convention.
<p>
<h4>Capacit&#233; de la CE en mati&#232;re d'avis</h4>
Le NAR poursuit ses activit&#233;s visant &#224; promouvoir au niveau communautaire sa
capacit&#233; consultative en mati&#232;re de politique de coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppement et propose au gouvernement n&#233;erlandais de demander &#224; la
CE de soutenir plus largement cette activit&#233;. Le NAR pr&#233;conise d'associer les
initiatives communautaires visant &#224; la formulation d'une politique europ&#233;enne
du d&#233;veloppement coordonn&#233;e et coh&#233;rente &#224; la mise en place de
ce r&#233;seau.

Development cooperation after the Treaty of Maastricht</h2>

</center>
<hr>
<b>On 7 September 1993 the National Advisory Council for Development Cooperation (NAR) presented
Mr Jan Pronk, the Minister for Development Cooperation, with a report on the consequences of the Treaty
on European Union of December 1991 (the "Maastricht Treaty") for the development cooperation policy of
the European Community.</b>
<p>

<h3>The Treaty of Maastricht and development cooperation</h3>

The Treaty of Maastricht, which was signed by the EC member states at the beginning of 1992, is the first
document to set forth the development cooperation objectives of the Community and its constituent
members. 
<p>
The Minister had requested the NAR to give its views on how, after ratification, the articles of the Treaty
might be interpreted and applied to enable the development cooperation policy of the European Community
and its Member States to be more clearly defined. In June 1992 Mr Pronk and Mr P Dankert, State
Secretary for European Affairs, presented to the Lower House of Parliament a memorandum entitled "The
European Community and Development Cooperation in the light of Maastricht". The Minister for
Development Cooperation's request for a report was based partly on an appraisal of this memorandum
compiled by four members of the NAR in September 1992. The Minister requested replies to the following
questions.
<p>
How is it possible to give effect to article 130v of the Treaty, which stipulates that the Community shall
take account of development cooperation objectives (article 130u) in the implementation of policies which
are likely to affect developing countries? What activities can be initiated now that article 130w enables
decisions to be taken by qualified majority vote? Article 130x makes it possible for the Community and its
Members States to coordinate aid programme policy and implementation more closely. What practical
measures can be taken to give coordination concrete form? What consequences should the Community and
its member states attach to coordination? What specific steps can be taken to give effect to the Commission's
right of initiative regarding the coordination of national development cooperation policies, with particular
reference to positions adopted by member states at international fora and conferences? 
<p>
<h3>Summary of the NAR recommendations</h3>

<h4>Coherence of EC policy and coordination between the EC and the member states</h4>

The NAR takes the view that if Community policy (or a policy proposal) in a certain area puts developing
countries at a structural disadvantage, its implementation ought to be carefully reviewed. If the problems in
question are only of a temporary nature, interim compensatory measures by the EC, such as the gradual
introduction of new policy and assistance to developing countries in the implementation of new measures,
are a logical consequence.
<p>
The NAR stresses the need to initiate operational coordination at the implementation level, in specific,
clearly defined sectors for which programmes can be formulated and put into effect. To this end selection
should focus on specific new areas of activity, e.g. the fight against AIDS in Africa, energy policy in sub-
Saharan Africa, support for the regional economic integration of developing countries and measures to
combat specific environmental problems. Such an approach is preferable to the broad and somewhat vague
proposals for coordination now put forward by the Council of Ministers and the Commission. Operational
coordination in a specific policy area only becomes possible once Community objectives for the area in
question have been formulated. The member states must therefore exchange information on their respective
development cooperation policies. If priority is to be given to coordination at the implementation level, EC
representatives in developing countries must be assigned a leading role and their powers strengthened.
<p>
The NAR advocates that the whole range of conditions attached to member state and Community bilateral
aid flows be effectively coordinated and integrated. It points to the danger of donor requirements ac-
cumulating and becoming increasingly divergent and warns against extending conditionality to too many
areas. Setting priorities, e.g. making aid conditional upon such criteria as good governance and respect for
human rights, is inevitable.
<p>
<h4>The Council of Ministers of the Community and the European Commission</h4>

The Council of Ministers, which, depending on its composition, is responsible for a specific policy area,
should also take responsibility for ensuring coherence, i.e. that its policy ties in with Community develop-
ment cooperation policy. The Commission should report annually to the Council of Ministers and the
Parliament on the degree to which coherence is being achieved. The NAR takes the view that the Council of
Ministers should be empowered to take decisions which are binding with regard to the coordination of EC
and member state development cooperation policies.
<p>
The Maastricht Treaty and the recommendations made by the NAR with regard to coherence and coor-
dination involve new tasks for the European Commission, whose capacity is already limited and has often
been criticised as inadequate. The NAR advocates that those departments of the Commission which are
responsible for development cooperation be strengthened in order to improve organisational aspects of aid
programmes such as efficiency, flexibility, quality and feedback. The NAR regards improvements in these
areas as essential even if the present tasks of the Commission remain unchanged. Adding to the Commis-
sion's responsibilities in the area of aid programme implementation in the short term is undesirable. If EC
aid is extended, the NAR recommends that channels for implementing Community and/or coordinated aid
programmes be selected according to the results of a comparative study of the efficiency and effectiveness of
Community, governmental and possibly non-governmental EC organisations.
<p>
<h4>Common commercial policy and the Lom&#233; Convention</h4>

The NAR would like to see the advantages of the Lom&#233; Convention preserved.    The Convention
functions as an an instrument which combines aid and trade, a "contract" which embraces rights and
obligations and a framework for institutionalised consultation. The NAR recommends that the basis of this
framework be reviewed before the present Convention (Lom&#233; IV) comes to an end, with the aim of
ensuring that henceforth it is based more on development cooperation principles. The review should lead to
greater benefits for the poorest countries and fewer for the richer nations, as a result of which some of the
"most disadvantaged" countries will join the group of developing countries which are parties to the Conven-
tion.
<p>
<h4>European advisory network</h4>

The NAR will continue to promote the development of a European network for advising on development
cooperation policy and proposes that the Netherlands Government request the EC to provide more support
for its activities in this field. The NAR advocates that EC initiatives aimed at formulating a coherent and
coordinated European development policy be linked to the establishment of this advisory network.

EU Aid Post-Maastricht: Fifteen into One?<br>

<hr>
<i>When the Maastricht Treaty on European Union (TEU) came into effect 
in November
1993,
development co-operation became a stated part of  European policy in 
a treaty for the first
time. This Briefing Paper covers the main aspects of the EU aid 
programme and explains
what has changed in EU development co-operation since the Treaty of 
Maastricht. It asks
if a
Europeanisation of EU aid is taking place and describes what has 
happened to the
priorities
for EU aid.  Finally, it discusses ideas about the future shape and 
direction of EU
development policy and the role of the European Commission in 
relation to the donor
agencies of the EU's fifteen Member States.</i><hr>
<p>

<h3>Characteristics of EU Aid </h3>
The incorporation of development co-operation in the Maastricht 
Treaty is a step towards a
common European policy in this area and provides a juridical basis 
and objectives for EU
development assistance. The Treaty is built, nonetheless, on an 
extensive existing aid
programme consisting of the expenditures under the Lom&#233; Convention's 
European
Development Fund (EDF) and under the general budget of the Union.
<p>
   The Lom&#233; Conventions, whose precursors drew on historical links 
with former colonies,
and the 1957 Treaty of Rome, have provided programmes of development 
assistance,
including aid and trade provisions, for African, Caribbean and 
Pacific (ACP) countries.
The
ACP group expanded from 46 under Lom&#233; I in 1975 to 70 countries in 
1993, and over
time
the coverage of the Convention's provisions has been extended. The 
EDF, funded directly
by
Member States' contributions to aid for the ACP countries, made up 
35% of EU aid
disbursements in 1993. <p>

In addition to Lom&#233; aid, there have been increasing aid 
allocations under the general EU
budget. Until 1990, food aid accounted for most (66% in 1989 and 50% 
in 1990) of the
aid
disbursed from the budget, but recently aid to Asian, Latin American 
(ALA), and
Mediterranean countries in particular, has taken a growing share.<p>

   On a country basis, however, South Africa, which is the only 
sub-Saharan country
outside
the Lom&#233; Convention, receives the largest aid programme of all 
countries funded via the
European Commission. New flows to Central and Eastern Europe (CEEC) 
and the former
Soviet Republics (FSR) also took 19% of EU aid in 1993. Most striking 
in recent years
has
been the  expansion of humanitarian aid, which in 1993 accounted for 
9% of EU aid.   <p>

   The legal and budgetary distinction between development assistance 
to ACP and
non-ACP
countries is reinforced by the  division of responsibilities among 
two Directorates-General
of
the Commission plus a separate humanitarian office and, since January 
1995, among four Commissioners. It is further emphasised by the Maastricht 
Treaty which
excludes
the Lom&#233; Convention from new provisions relating to development co- 
operation (Art.130w), at least until 1999.<p>
   
<h3>Implications of the Treaty </h3>
Development co-operation is envisaged to become a part of  the EU's 
Common Foreign
and
Security Policy (one of the three pillars providing the basis for 
political union) which has
yet
to be established. However, while European foreign and security 
policies remain
intergovernmental, in the area of development co- operation, the 
Member States have
succeeded in spelling out common objectives under Article 130u of the 
Maastricht Treaty
namely to `foster: <ul>

    <li> the sustainable economic and social development of developing 
countries, and more
particularly the most disadvantaged among them,<br>
    <li> the smooth and gradual integration of developing countries into 
the world economy,<br>
    <li> the campaign against poverty in developing countries,<br> 
   <li>  the observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and 
developing and
consolidating democracy and the rule of law.' </ul>

In addition, article 130u states that development policy should be 
`complementary to the
policies pursued by the Member States', indicating that Member States 
and the European
Commission share competence and responsibility for the achievement of 
these objectives.
Their efforts should reinforce each other and lead to greater 
effectiveness. However, the
imprecision of the Treaty on how this can be achieved has encouraged 
different views as
to
what complementarity entails. This contrasts with other areas of 
common policy, such as
trade
in goods, where Member States have transferred full responsibility to 
the Union.
<p>

   Another article of the Treaty with a significant impact on EU 
development co-operation is 130v which states that the EU should take account of the above objectives in any of its policies likely to affect developing countries. This legally-binding requirement for policy coherence implies that development objectives should be taken into account in every common policy and may well require the EU to amend all its existing policies (including the Common Agricultural Policy) that have an impact on developing countries.
<p>

   The integration of development policy as an area of shared 
competence for the Union
and
the Member States implies that  communal (<i>communautaire</i>) procedures 
will now be
applied
to its management. This gives the European Commission the right of 
initiative and the
responsibility for elaborating strategies as well as for implementing 
EU policy. The
Council
of Ministers can now take binding decisions on Commission proposals 
by qualified
majority
voting rather than unanimity. The Council of Development Ministers 
meets only twice a year and its resolutions are effectively subordinate to the General 
Affairs Council which takes the final decision on all issues relating to foreign affairs, including development co-operation.
<p>
   
   The powers of the European Parliament have also been extended, 
although the Council still has the power to override its amendments, or its rejections, of 
Directives and the EDF remains free from its scrutiny and subsequent intervention.
<p>

<h3>Bilateral versus European aid flows</h3> 
In the last decade the contribution of EU Member States to aid 
disbursed through the
European Commission, including the EDF, has increased from US$1,479m 
in 1984 to
US$4,098m in 1993. Although this is a significant shift, the 
Commission is still only a medium-sized donor, compared with Member States such as France and Germany, as most bilateral aid budgets have grown considerably over that time. Aid channelled through the Commission represented 15.3 % of total official development assistance funded by the governments of EU members in 1993.<p>

   Contributions are likely to be increased in the next five years 
following the decision on
the
budget taken at the Edinburgh Summit in December 1992 when the then 
twelve Member
States voted a near-doubling of the ceiling for the budget for 
external actions, to 5.6bn
ecu,
by 1999. It is not yet clear where the extra money will be spent and 
in particular how
much
will be left for developing countries after aid for the CEEC and FSR 
has been decided.   <p>
   
   
   The decision will be reviewed together with other post-Maastricht 
constitutional
developments at a special intergovernmental conference in 1996, so 
numbers could move
up
or down from then. For some Member States, any such EU budget 
increase is likely to be
balanced by cuts in other multilateral contributions or in their 
bilateral aid expenditure.      <p>

   
   Commitments to increase EU budget aid are already having an effect 
on the EDF.
Member
States are having difficulty in agreeing on an increase in real terms 
for the final five years
of
Lom&#233; IV, despite the enlargement of the EU. In the past the Fund has always
been expanded  Lom&#233; IV saw an increase of 39%  but this time some Member States have proposed a reduction in their contribution to the EDF, which is 
voluntary, in contrast to the contribution to budget aid which depends on Member States' share of the EU's GDP, and other factors.<p>

The question whether the EDF should now be integrated into the EU 
budget has again arisen during the negotiations.  Currently the EDF share of UK, 
France, Belgium and Denmark is relatively larger than their share of the EU budget, but the latter is not fixed and might change annually. Although integration is favoured 
by some Member States, by the European Parliament, and formally by the Commission, 
others (among them
France and the UK) remain reluctant to hand over control of the fund. 
This may be due
less
to concerns over losing control over aid management (in which DG VIII 
now has much
expertise in the long established Lom, tradition) but rather over the 
ceiling on EU aid.  <p>

<h3>Changes in priorities? </h3>

In contrast to the commitment to increase the budget for external 
relations, stagnation of
the
EDF might indicate a shift in priority away from the ACP group to 
other regions. During
the
Essen Summit in December 1994, promises were made to both Eastern 
Europe and to
North
Africa.<p>

    Aid to Asia and Latin America is to be increased as well, with 
the latter countries
expected to benefit from the completion of the transition period 
following Spanish and
Portuguese entry. Increasing aid for some Asian countries seems to be 
a logical
consequence
of the Treaty's objective of paying special attention to the most 
disadvantaged developing
countries. Although the ACP group includes most of the least 
developed, according to the
UN
classification, it excludes some extremely poor Asian countries, such 
as Bangladesh,
Afghanistan, Nepal, Cambodia, as well as India. There are signs that 
the new EU member
states, in particular Sweden, will support a global development 
policy allocating EU aid on
a
poverty basis rather than in terms of the past colonial links of some 
Member States.   <p>
       
  
   Change to reflect such a global EU aid policy will be gradual. The 
current Lom&#233; Convention does not end until 1999. Thereafter the situation might 
look different. At a London press conference in 1994 the then Acting Director-General for Development stated that he did not see Lom&#233; lasting as an exclusive club beyond the end of the century. It is not clear what would happen then to the special EU-ACP relationship. One option would be to extend the coverage of this special co-operation programme by incorporating more of the poorest developing countries, while reducing the scope of the Convention, in narrowing its instruments and sectors, and thus making a global EU development policy appropriate to the management capacity of the European Commission.<p>

   However the stagnation of aid to the ACP countries and the 
reluctance to integrate the EDF in the EU budget may indicate that Member States want to protect their bilateral aid programmes and reconsider the rationale of a distinctively European aid programme, only just over a year after the Maastricht Treaty came into force. <p>

<h3>Co-ordination and Complementarity:  towards better aid effectiveness </h3>

The Maastricht Treaty places greater emphasis on aid co- ordination 
and complementarity.
Article 130x of the Treaty states that `The Community and the Member 
States shall
coordinate their policies on development cooperation and shall 
consult each other on their
aid
programmes, including in international organisations and during 
international conferences'. This article allows the Commission the opportunity to take initiatives to promote co-ordination. Although this in itself is not a new objective as early as 1974 the Council of Ministers passed a resolution expressing the desire for more exchange of information, donor consultation and a common voice in international conferences Ministers seem more committed to its implementation than before.<p>

   Three potential levels for co-ordination have been outlined: policy co-ordination,
co-ordination in international fora, and operational co-ordination. For policy co-ordination, EU Development Ministers have selected four priority areas   health, 
education, poverty alleviation and food security, and the Council has adopted a 
resolution for common policies during 1993 and 1994.<p>

   In order to achieve more complementary operational co-ordination 
of EU aid, EU Development Ministers have also agreed on a pilot exercise in six 
developing countries: Costa Rica, Peru, Mozambique, Ethiopia, C&#244;te d'Ivoire and Bangladesh. If successful, the exercise could be extended to other sectors and countries. There are obstacles, however. National development objectives still diverge (e.g. with respect to conditionality and tying of aid) and the capacities of donor delegations in recipient countries are still uneven. The recipient governments themselves remain ambiguous about improved aid co-ordination.                 
   <p>

   The exercise will show whether co-ordination on this basis is 
cost-effective for the
donors
and beneficial for the recipients. If it is decided to extend the 
exercise, there is a question
to
be addressed on whether co-ordination should go beyond an exchange of 
information and
experience, and move towards  sharing and allocating responsibilities 
for taking the lead in
a
more intensive effort in particular areas. In such a case, it would 
need to be established
which
donor   Member State or the Commission   would have the major role in 
which area or
sector, or, to put it differently, which agency   or even government  
 would be prepared to
be
co-ordinated by another in a particular area.<p>

   Some Member States, in particular Belgium and Germany, do not 
think the
co-ordination
effort goes far enough to improve EU aid effectiveness. They propose 
a reallocation of
tasks
on the basis of comparative effectiveness and potential capacity to 
deal with different
sectors,
instruments or geographical areas of development co-operation. The 
division of labour
would
be gradual and agreed upon voluntarily, and it would not amount to a 
transfer of
responsibilities; competence would remain shared. <p>

   The allocation of tasks is interpreted differently. Its advocates 
regard it as a two-way
mechanism whereby Member States and the Commission allocate tasks on 
the basis of
comparative advantage, capacity and competence. Opponents voice fears 
of loss of
sovereignty, political influence and commercial advantage. They 
expect to end up
transferring
tasks, and resources, from a bilateral level to the Commission, which 
would become a
stronger institution slowly taking over the sovereignty of the Member 
States without
necessarily having the capacity to deliver aid effectively.    

<h3>The role of the Commission </h3>
So can the European Commission be other than just a sixteenth 
European donor, and exploit its `multilateral' role? What would be the most effective 
institutional arrangement for delivering EU aid in the future?<p>

   The Commission has a duty to ensure the coherence of aid and other 
EU policies affecting developing countries, but apart from that, various roles can be 
envisaged. Some propose that the Commission should concentrate its attention on policy co-ordination and that it should withdraw from implementing and monitoring development assistance on the ground.Another option would be for it to take the lead in operational co-ordination and manage teams of European donors in the appropriate sectors selected. Others feel that the Commission should concentrate on areas where it might appear to have some comparative advantage: such as regional co-operation, influencing the context of structural adjustment programmes, and trade promotion. Another option is for the Commission to provide the financial resources for large aid projects and programmes, while the Member States complement this with institutional
skills and technical co- operation to improve the programmes' sustainability.
<p>
 
   These options contrast with an alternative scenario in which 
competence and financial
resources are shifted from the Member States to the Commission, with 
development policy
becoming the full responsibility of the EU. There is clearly great 
reluctance among
Member
States to concede such a possibility of eliminating national aid 
agencies. Some would
prefer
the responsibility of the Commission to be reduced simply to that of 
an administering body
rather than see its competence expand substantially.  <p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3> 
The Europeanisation of development co-operation policy in the form of a
`communitarisation' has not followed instantly from the Maastricht Treaty. National 
development policies remain predominant; EU aid channelled through the Commission amounts to only 15% of Member
States' development assistance; new decision- taking powers of the 
Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament have been extended to only a part of EU aid; and despite the pressure for the globalisation of EU aid, the Lom&#233; Convention continues to be an intergovernmental issue separate from the rest of EU development assistance.  <p>
   
   Nevertheless, it seems inevitable that the separation between Lom&#233; 
and EU budget aid will be eliminated at some stage. If this happens, the special treatment of the Lom&#233; countries could be amended after 1999 with the richest ACP states `graduated', and the exclusive ACP arrangements replaced by a more balanced worldwide policy combining respect for EU global interests with the Maastricht undertakings to help the poorest and most disadvantaged.       <p>
   
 More broadly, efforts towards greater coordination and complementarity of European aid appear to require a greater commitment, on the part of the fifteen member governments, towards putting the objectives of the Maastricht Treaty into 
practice.  <p>

<P>
Gerade in der Europ&auml;ischen Gemeinschaft ist das Bewu&szlig;tsein
f&uuml;r das Heranbrechen einer neuen &Auml;ra der internationalen
Beziehungen und der Zusammenarbeit besonders gesch&auml;rft. Wie
Sie wissen, befinden wir uns am Vorabend weitreichender Entscheidungen
f&uuml;r die Zukunft der Europ&auml;ischen Einigung. In drei Wochen
werden die Staats- und Regierungschefs in Maastricht &uuml;ber
die beiden Regierungskonferenzen zu befinden haben. Die eine betrifft
den Ausbau der Gemeinschaft zu einer Wirtschafts- und W&auml;hrungsunion;
die andere f&uuml;hrt diesen Entwurf noch dar&uuml;ber hinaus
bis hin zur Gestaltung einer politischen Union.
<P>
Wenn diese Beschl&uuml;sse gefa&szlig;t werden, wird der Auftrieb
der bisher schon von der schrittweisen Verwirklichung des gemeinsamen
Binnenmarktes ausgeht, eine weitere Steigerung erfahren. Demn&auml;chst
soll auch ein Vertragswerk beschlossen werden, das die Grundlage
daf&uuml;r bildet, da&szlig; zusammen mit den sieben EFTA-Staaten
und der Gemeinschaft in Europa ein gro&szlig;er Europ&auml;ischer
Wirtschaftsraum mit 375 Millionen B&uuml;rgern entstehen kann.
Allein wirtschaftlich wird diese neue Gruppierung einen Faktor
darstellen, der weltweit seinesgleichen sucht. Sie wird eine Quelle
f&uuml;r mehr Wachstum und mehr Chancen f&uuml;r alle L&auml;nder,
auch f&uuml;r die Entwicklungsl&auml;nder, sein.
<P>
Ich m&ouml;chte in dieser Einf&uuml;hrung die gewaltigen Aufgaben
und Chancen des Neuanfangs in Mittel- und Osteuropa, aber auch
in der Sowjetunion nicht &uuml;bersehen. Die Gemeinschaft hat
in diesem Zusammenhang von Anfang an eine besondere Rolle gespielt.
Sie hat das Modell der Wertegemeinschaft und der Zusammenarbeit
geliefert, das schlie&szlig;lich ma&szlig;geblich wurde f&uuml;r
den Aufbruch im Osten, und sie ist nun f&uuml;hrend daran beteiligt,
Unterst&uuml;tzung f&uuml;r den &Uuml;bergang zur Marktwirtschaft
zu leisten. In diesem Jahr werden die ersten Assoziierungsabkommen
mit L&auml;ndern Mittel- und Osteuropas abgeschlossen. Im Rahmen
des PHARE-Programms, der Wirtschafts- und Finanzhilfe der Gruppe
der 24, leistet die Kommission nicht nur die entscheidende Koordinierungsarbeit,
die Gemeinschaft selbst stellt auch mit nahezu 19 Milliarden ECUs
rund zwei Drittel der Gesamthilfe des PHARE-Programms.
<P>
Ich hielt es f&uuml;r wichtig, am Anfang dieses Vortrags auf diese
beiden sich erg&auml;nzenden Vorg&auml;nge, die Vertiefung der
Europ&auml;ischen Einigung auf der einen Seite und die Herstellung
immer engerer Beziehungen zwischen West-, Mittel- und Osteuropa
andererseits, hinzuweisen, weil dadurch Voraussetzungen geschaffen
werden, nicht nur f&uuml;r den Zusammenhalt und den Fortschritt
auf unserem Kontinent, sondern auch f&uuml;r unsere M&ouml;glichkeiten
als f&uuml;hrende Akteure der Weltwirtschaft.
<P>
Wir haben also heute eine engere politische Zusammenarbeit, bessere
Voraussetzungen, und zwar nicht nur in der Gemeinschaft, in Europa.
Auch weltweit haben sich die politischen Rahmenbedingungen verbessert.
Ich erinnere an die Rolle, die die Vereinten Nationen in den j&uuml;ngsten
Konflikten gespielt haben, an das Ereignis der Madrider Friedensgespr&auml;che,
an die intensivierten Bem&uuml;hungen um regionale Zusammenschl&uuml;sse
in Lateinamerika, in Asien, aber auch zwischen Teilregionen des
Nordens und des S&uuml;dens. Eigentlich alles hervorragende Voraussetzungen.
<P>
Dennoch bleiben zwei Dinge im Zusammenhang mit der Entwicklungspolitik
bemerkenswert: Die gegenl&auml;ufigen Entwicklungen im Norden
einerseits, im S&uuml;den andererseits.
<P>
Der Norden macht, wie gesagt, gro&szlig;e Fortschritte auf dem
Weg zur Verst&auml;ndigung, zum Ausgleich. Demgegen&uuml;ber kompliziert
sich die Lage im S&uuml;den. Sie wird immer uneinheitlicher und
widerspr&uuml;chlicher:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Da gibt es zun&auml;chst den S&uuml;den, der aufw&auml;rts strebt,
der auf der Seite der Gewinner steht. Beispiele sind Teile S&uuml;dostasiens
- Singapur -, auch Indonesien, Thailand, Malaysien. In einigen
L&auml;ndern S&uuml;damerikas sind die wirtschaftlichen Aussichten
ermutigend, beispielsweise in Chile, auch in Mexiko und in Venezuela.
<P>
<li>Dann gibt es den S&uuml;den, der stagniert; hierzu z&auml;hlen
weite Bereiche Latein-amerikas, auch einige L&auml;nder im s&uuml;dostasiatischen
Raum, wie Indochina, Indien, Pakistan oder Bangladesh.
<P>
<li>Ferner der S&uuml;den, der deutlich an Terrain verliert - etwa
Afrika s&uuml;dlich des Sahelbereiches.
<P>
<li>Schlie&szlig;lich gibt es auch den S&uuml;den, der Anschlu&szlig;
an den Norden sucht und findet - die T&uuml;rkei und Europa, Mexiko
und die Vereinigten Staaten.</ul>
<P>
Verbesserte politische Rahmenbedingungen, und dann diese Situation.
Wie soll man das erkl&auml;ren? Der Versuch einer Ursachenanalyse
f&uuml;hrt leider genau in jene Zusammenh&auml;nge, die f&uuml;r
die L&ouml;sung der dringendsten Entwicklungsprobleme entscheidend
bleiben, n&auml;mlich in den wirtschaftlichen Bereich. Hier haben
sich die objektiven Bedingungen weltweit verschlechtert, und zwar
ziemlich zu Lasten der Entwicklungsl&auml;nder. Und es handelt
sich dabei trotz aller Bem&uuml;hungen um Faktoren, die kurzfristig
nur schwer zu beeinflussen sind. Ja, die sogar die Gefahr beinhalten,
da&szlig; auch politische R&uuml;ckschl&auml;ge folgen, ein R&uuml;ckzug
in eine neue Innerlichkeit der Industriestaaten. Jede Verkapselung
der westlichen Gesellschaften mu&szlig; direkt oder indirekt dem
Entwicklungsproze&szlig; entgegenwirken.
<P>
Folgendes sei hierzu erw&auml;hnt:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Das Wirtschaftswachstum hat sich weltweit im Zeitraum von 1982
bis 1991 gegen&uuml;ber der Vergleichsperiode beinahe halbiert:
auf 3,4 % im Durchschnitt und 1,16 % Pro-Kopf der Bev&ouml;lkerung.
Mit anderen Worten, wenn man bedenkt, da&szlig; eine Wachstumsrate
von 1 % j&auml;hrlich eine Verdoppelung des Resultates erst in
70 Jahren zul&auml;&szlig;t, m&uuml;ssen wir ganz einfach feststellen,
da&szlig; Wachstum heute nicht mehr ausreicht, um in den am wenigsten
entwickelten L&auml;ndern eine sp&uuml;rbare Verbesserung des
Lebensstandards zu erreichen.
<P>
<li>Die realen Zinss&auml;tze sind im Vergleich zu den 70er Jahren
stark angestiegen: von 0 % auf &uuml;ber 6 % in den 80er Jahren.
Vielf&auml;ltige wirtschaftliche Zw&auml;nge haben zu diesen Ergebnissen
gef&uuml;hrt (der strukturelle Anpassungsbedarf, die &Uuml;berforderung
der &ouml;ffentlichen Haushalte). Der Norden mu&szlig;te zum Teil
sehr scharf auf Anti-inflationskurs gehen. Sicher ist dies langfristig
die richtige Strategie, auch im Interesse der Entwicklung des
S&uuml;dens. Doch sind dort die Probleme heute so gro&szlig;,
da&szlig; nicht mehr viel Zeit zur Verf&uuml;gung steht. Ein weltweit
stabileres Wachstum in einer ferneren Zukunft abzuwarten, reicht
als Antwort nicht aus.
<P>
<li>Protektionistische Neigungen haben zugenommen. Folglich entwickelt
sich der Handelsaustausch zwischen den entwickelten L&auml;ndern
st&auml;rker als der in dieser Situation w&uuml;nschenswerte Austausch
des Nordens mit dem S&uuml;den. Ermutigende Ans&auml;tze einer
Handelsausweitung zwischen den Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern selbst
k&ouml;nnen dies nicht kompensieren.
<P>
<li>Sodann hat der Zusammenbruch der Preise f&uuml;r Rohstoffe,
einschlie&szlig;lich Erd&ouml;l, eine Rolle gespielt - ein wesentlicher
Faktor des Absackens der Nachfrage aus den industrialisierten
L&auml;ndern. Die Terms-of-trade haben sich in den 80er Jahren
um ein Viertel zu Lasten der Entwicklungsl&auml;nder verschlechtert
(die 2. &Ouml;lkrise, R&uuml;ckgang des relativen Anteils dieser
Produkte in der Fertigung).
<P>
<li>Schlie&szlig;lich hat sich ausgewirkt, da&szlig; seit einigen
Jahren ein negativer Nettokapitaltransfer zu Lasten der Entwicklungsl&auml;nder
stattfindet, der inzwischen 2,5 % ihres BSP erreicht haben d&uuml;rfte.
Diese perverse Entwicklung hat dazu gef&uuml;hrt, da&szlig; diese
L&auml;nder inzwischen erheblich mehr an Zins- und Tilgungs-zahlungen
an den industrialisierten Norden leisten, als dieser seinerseits
bereit ist, f&uuml;r Entwicklungshilfe zur Verf&uuml;gung zu stellen.
Daf&uuml;r gibt es sicher Erkl&auml;rungen: Demographische Alterungsprozesse
in den Industriel&auml;ndern begrenzen die Bereitstellung von
Sparkapital; gro&szlig;er Investitionsbedarf zur Modernisierung
der wirtschaftlichen Infrastruktur (dritte industrielle Revolution,
Umweltschutz); Aufholbedarf Mittel- und Osteuropas sowie der Sowjetunion
usw., also enorme Nachfrage nach Ressourcen bei stagnierendem
Angebot an knappem Sparkapital.
<P>
<li>In den Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern selbst hat sich das &Uuml;bergewicht
der Innenpolitik l&auml;hmend ausgewirkt. Deutlich zu beobachten
in Afrika, wo der Proze&szlig; der &Ouml;ffnung und der Umstellung
sehr langsam vorankommt. Vor allem, wenn man demgegen&uuml;ber
die Entwicklung in Teilen S&uuml;dostasiens betrachtet.</ul>
<P>
Ich m&ouml;chte diesen Versuch einer Analyse nicht vertiefen.
Er liefert aber Anhaltspunkte, die f&uuml;r unser Thema wichtig
sind.
<P>
Welche Rolle kann nun die Gemeinschaft spielen, um unter Nutzung
des gr&ouml;&szlig;eren politischen Spielraums weltweit, aber
auch bei Ber&uuml;cksichtigung der erschwerten wirtschaftlichen
Bedingungen einen angemessenen Beitrag zur &Uuml;berwindung des
Entwicklungsnotstandes zu leisten?
<P>
Die h&auml;ufig gestellte Frage ist nat&uuml;rlich die, ob die
Gemeinschaft, ob Europa &uuml;ber die Verwirklichung der eigenen
weit gesteckten Ziele diese M&ouml;glichkeiten und diese Verantwortung
gegen&uuml;ber der &uuml;brigen Welt nicht aus den Augen verlieren
k&ouml;nnte. Die Bef&uuml;rchtung ist verbreitet, da&szlig; gerade
die Entwicklungsl&auml;nder in einem solchen Fall ins Hintertreffen
geraten w&uuml;rden.
<P>
Da&szlig; diese Bef&uuml;rchtungen unbegr&uuml;ndet sind, m&ouml;chte
ich im folgenden erl&auml;utern. Die Fakten sprechen eigentlich
f&uuml;r sich selbst. Da&szlig; die Handelspolitik, da&szlig;
die Uruguay Runde, so wichtig sie ist, nur eine Teilantwort liefern
kann, auch das, so hoffe ich, werden Sie dem Folgenden entnehmen.
<P>
Zun&auml;chst einige Angaben zu den Leistungen der Gemeinschaft.
Da&szlig; auch diese schwergewichtige Handels- und Wirtschaftsmacht
allein die Gegebenheiten nicht grundlegend ver&auml;ndern kann,
versteht sich von selbst. Das wird sofort klar, wenn man bedenkt,
da&szlig; etwa die &Uuml;berwindung der Folgen des Golfkrieges
allein in Kuwait 530 bis 1000 Milliarden Dollar in 5 Jahren erfordern
wird, da&szlig; die neue Situation im Osten gewaltige Mittel schon
heute verschlingt (f&uuml;r die Sowjetunion allein 2000/3000 Mrd$
in 10 Jahren), und da&szlig; auch die Politik der Banken den Spielraum
einengt.
<P>
Tatsache ist aber auch, da&szlig; die Bereitstellung &ouml;ffentlicher
Mittel von seiten der Gemeinschaft stark ausgeweitet wurde; die
Zahlen sprechen eine deutliche Sprache:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Lom&eacute; IV (1991 bis 1995): 12 Milliarden ECU, oder plus
25 % real;
<P>
<li>Lateinamerika und Asien (ohne nichtamtliche Hilfsorganisationen
und Nahrungsmittelhilfe): 1992 bis 1996: 2,752 Milliarden ECU,
oder plus 72 % im Vergleich zu 1986 bis 1991;
<P>
<li>Mittelmeer: 4,405 Milliarden ECU (davon EIB - &quot;Europ&auml;ische
Investitionsbank&quot;: 1,3 Milliarden ECU), oder nahezu eine
Verdreifachung gegen&uuml;ber dem Vergleichszeitraum von 1986
bis 1991;
<P>
<li>In der Zeit von 1988 bis 1989 hat die Gemeinschaft 0,5 % ihres
BIP den Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern zur Verf&uuml;gung gestellt,
gegen&uuml;ber einem Beitrag der Vereinigten Staaten oder Japans
von jeweils 0,18 und 0,32 %.
<P>
<li>Die Entwicklungshilfeleistungen der Gemeinschaft und ihrer Mitgliedsstaaten
betragen 40 % der f&uuml;r diesen Zweck weltweit zur Verf&uuml;gung
gestellten &ouml;ffentlichen Mittel, gegen&uuml;ber 16 % f&uuml;r
die Vereinigten Staaten und 17 % f&uuml;r Japan.
<P>
<li>Der Anteil der Leistungen der Gemeinschaft selbst im Vergleich
zu den von ihren Mitgliedsstaaten aufgebrachten Mittel betr&auml;gt
inzwischen 15 % der &ouml;ffentlichen Entwicklungshilfe weltweit.
Richtig ist, da&szlig; das &quot;Burden-Sharing&quot; zwischen
den einzelnen Mitgliedsstaaten noch unausgewogen ist: D&auml;nemark
1 %, Niederlande 0,94 %, Frankreich 0,87 % (0,45 % ohne die &uuml;berseeischen
Gebiete), UK 0,32 %, Griechenland 0,52 %.</ul>
<P>
Dies zum ersten, zur &ouml;ffentlichen Hilfe. Zum zweiten ist
zu bemerken: Die Gemeinschaft hat die neuen entwicklungspolitischen
Erkenntnisse, die ja auf den teilweise bitteren Erfahrungen der
Vergangenheit beruhen, in ihre Strategie einbezogen. Seit der
UNCTAD VII Konferenz von 1987 haben sich diese Erkenntnisse immer
mehr Bahn gebrochen. Sie wurden in den darauffolgenden Konferenzen
im Rahmen der VN und der OECD auch weitgehend festgeschrieben.
Sie sind inzwischen ma&szlig;gebend f&uuml;r die Vorbereitungsarbeiten
f&uuml;r UNCTAD VIII im n&auml;chsten Jahr.
<P>
Worum geht es? Eigentlich um zwei Dinge:
<P>
Erstens: Wir wissen heute, da&szlig; die Schaffung vern&uuml;nftiger
Rahmenbedingungen und die F&ouml;rderung der sich entwickelnden
Privatinitiative entscheidend sind. Zweitens wissen wir, da&szlig;
die Aussch&ouml;pfung der Synergien, die durch ein erfolgreiches
Zusammenwirken der internen Anpassungsbem&uuml;hungen der Entwicklungsl&auml;nder
und einer aktiven und erg&auml;nzenden Unterst&uuml;tzung von
drau&szlig;en freigesetzt werden k&ouml;nnen, viel bewirken k&ouml;nnen.
Das Beispiel Indonesiens seit 1986 wird in diesem Zusammenhang
immer wieder genannt.
<P>
Zu den Rahmenbedingungen: Niemand untersch&auml;tzt heute mehr
die Bedeutung stabiler politischer, wirtschaftlicher und sozialer
Verh&auml;ltnisse in den Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern selbst. Daf&uuml;r
wurde auch ein sch&ouml;nes Wort gepr&auml;gt - &quot;good governance&quot;.
Damit ist folgendes gemeint: eine leistungsf&auml;hige Verwaltung,
befriedigende Infrastrukturen und soziale Ausgewogenheit sind
wichtig f&uuml;r die Entfaltung der Privatinitiative, die Bereitstellung
von Sparkapital, die Ausdehnung der Investitionen und eine erfolgreiche
Entwicklung der Exporte. Das Beispiel einiger afrikanischer Staaten
(Botswana, Ghana) oder verschiedener Staaten Lateinamerikas (Chile,
Bolivien) sprechen f&uuml;r die Richtigkeit dieses Ansatzes. Umgekehrt
hat seine Mi&szlig;achtung in anderen Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern,
sowohl in Lateinamerika als auch in Afrika, zu teilweise verheerenden
Verh&auml;ltnissen gef&uuml;hrt (Hyperinflation, &Uuml;berschuldung,
Terrorismus, Drogenproblem, B&uuml;rgerkrieg - j&uuml;ngstes Beispiel
Zaire).
<P>
Die Gemeinschaft hat in diesem Zuammenhang massiv Unterst&uuml;tzung
geleistet beim Aufbau leistungsf&auml;higer Infrastrukturen und
ausgewogenerer innenpolitischer Verh&auml;ltnisse. Wir haben in
vielen L&auml;ndern einen Beitrag geleistet zur Herstellung eines
effizienten Banken- und Finanzsektors und zur Durchsetzung realistischer
Preise. Wir haben gro&szlig;e Bem&uuml;hungen unternommen, um
einer realistischen Bev&ouml;lkerungspolitik und einer Strategie
zur Erhaltung der nat&uuml;rlichen Ressourcen (Beispiel tropische
Regenw&auml;lder) zum Durchbruch zu verhelfen.
<P>
Die Verwirklichung moderner Voraussetzungen in diesen L&auml;ndern
ist wichtig. Ohne weltweit bessere wirtschaftliche Rahmenbedingungen
k&ouml;nnen sie den erhofften Erfolg nat&uuml;rlich nicht sicherstellen.
Die Gemeinschaft bem&uuml;ht sich darum, auf solche Bedingungen
hinzuwirken. Sie tut dies, indem sie bei internationalen Verhandlungen
und Foren auf einheitliche Positionen dr&auml;ngt. Dies geschieht
durch intensive Abstimmung und Koordinierung mit den Mitgliedsstaaten
und den wichtigsten Handelspartnern, durch das geschlossene Auftreten
als f&uuml;hrender Welthandelspartner im eigenen Namen.
<P>
<ul>
<li>Im Vordergrund stehen gegenw&auml;rtig unsere Bem&uuml;hungen
um verst&auml;rkte Zusammenarbeit im Rahmen der G-7, also der
sieben reichsten Industriel&auml;nder.
<P>
<li>Sie soll tendenziell m&auml;&szlig;igend auf die Zinsentwicklung
einwirken und Voraus-setzungen f&uuml;r Wachstum schaffen. Wenn
hier die Zusammenarbeit gelingt, sind gute Bedingungen f&uuml;r
Fortschritt und Entwicklung geschaffen: Die Gemeinschaft und ihre
Partner, Nordamerika und Japan, vereinigen auf sich 60 % des Weltprodukts,
65 % des Welthandels, 60 % der W&auml;hrungsreserven und &uuml;ber
90 % der Direktinvestitionen in der Welt.
<P>
<li>Die Gemeinschaft hat den Ehrgeiz, Verhandlungen im Rahmen der
Uruguay-Runde energisch und konstruktiv zu f&uuml;hren; wir wissen,
da&szlig; es dabei ohne auch f&uuml;r die Gemeinschaft schwierige
Zugest&auml;ndnisse nicht abgehen wird.
<P>
<li>Die Gemeinschaft spielt eine wichtige Rolle bei den vorbereitenden
Gespr&auml;chen f&uuml;r UNCTAD VIII im n&auml;chsten Jahr. Ich
erinnere an das kontroverse Thema der Finanzierung der Erhaltung
der tropischen Regenw&auml;lder oder an Fragen der Entschuldung.
<P>
<li>Schlie&szlig;lich ermutigt die Gemeinschaft, schon aufgrund
ihrer eigenen Erfahrung, die Schaffung regionaler Gruppierungen.
Auf diese Weise werden ausreichend gro&szlig;e und attraktive
Wirtschaftsr&auml;ume geschaffen. Beispielsweise haben wir an
den Verhandlungen zur Einrichtung einer Freihandelszone in Mittelamerika
aktiv mitgewirkt; wir haben dieses Programm auch mit 120 Mio ECUs
unterst&uuml;tzt.</ul>
<P>
Im Mittelpunkt steht heute unsere &Uuml;berzeugung, da&szlig;
der Erfolg der Zusammenarbeit letztendlich von der Ermutigung
zur Privatinitiative, immer unter der Voraussetzung angemessener
Rahmenbedingungen, abh&auml;ngen wird. Zur Illustration darf ich
die Bereitstellung eines neuen Finanzierungsinstruments ECIP (European
Investment-Partners) erw&auml;hnen.
<P>
F&uuml;r viele dieser L&auml;nder sind Direktinvestitionen ein
Schl&uuml;sselfaktor der Entwicklung; sie sind der direkte Weg
zu Technologie und Know-how. Au&szlig;erdem er&ouml;ffnen sie
Auslandsm&auml;rkte. Die Zahlungsbilanz wird entlastet. Dieses
neue europ&auml;ische Finanzierungsinstrument, das &uuml;brigens
alle Aspekte des Investitionszyklus, von der Suche nach Partnern
&uuml;ber die direkte Kapitalbeteiligung bis zur Ausbildung von
Fachkr&auml;ften abdeckt, dient diesem Zweck. Es unterst&uuml;tzt
die Gr&uuml;ndung von Joint-ventures zwischen europ&auml;ischen
und Unternehmen in diesen L&auml;ndern. Die Erfahrungen sind ausgesprochen
ermutigend. In der kurzen Zeit des Bestehens von ECIP (1988) haben
wir bereits Hunderte von Projekten finanziert, und die Inanspruchnahme
beschleunigt sich. Beachtlich dabei ist der Multiplikatoreffekt:
jeder ECU aus dem Gemeinschaftshaushalt bewirkt Investitionen
von 10 bis 20 ECUs. Ein Vorschlag zur Verl&auml;ngerung und Ausweitung
des Instruments wird gegenw&auml;rtig im Ministerrat er&ouml;rtert.
<P>
Ich komme zur Handelspolitik und den Aussichten der Uruguay-Runde.
<P>
Es ist klar, da&szlig; die Gemeinschaft als gr&ouml;&szlig;ter
Welthandelspartner im Bereich des Marktzugangs besondere Verantwortung
tr&auml;gt. Was die Volumina angeht, brauchen wir uns nicht zu
verstecken. So hat die Gemeinschaft im Jahre 1989 ein Importvolumen
aus den Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern aufgenommen, das dem der Vereinigten
Staaten nicht nachsteht: Einfuhren im Werte von 151,5 Mrd USD.
Seit 1985 nehmen unsere Importe aus diesen L&auml;ndern j&auml;hrlich
um durchschnittlich 8,2 % zu, um 17,6 %, wenn nur gewerbliche
Erzeugnisse ber&uuml;cksichtigt werden. Die Gemeinschaft ist &uuml;brigens
auch im landwirtschaftlichen Bereich der gr&ouml;&szlig;te Importeur
- und die H&auml;lfte davon ist &quot;duty-free&quot;.
<P>
Die Gemeinschaft ist n&auml;mlich der Welthandelspartner, der
das gro&szlig;z&uuml;gigste Pr&auml;ferenzsystem (Lom&eacute;,
Allgemeine Zollpr&auml;ferenzen, Handelspr&auml;ferenzen f&uuml;r
die Mittelmeerl&auml;nder) zur Verf&uuml;gung stellt.
<P>
Als gr&ouml;&szlig;ter Welthandelspartner haben wir ein ganz nat&uuml;rliches
Interesse am erfolgreichen Abschlu&szlig; der GATT-Verhandlungen.
Man sollte also der Gemeinschaft nicht vorwerfen, sie hintertreibe
ein Ergebnis, das ihr nur n&uuml;tzen kann.
<P>
Die Uruguay-Runde ist die wichtigste Welthandelskonferenz, die
je in Angriff genommen wurde. 108 Nationen, die mehr als 90 %
des Welthandels auf sich vereinigen, am runden Tisch! Da steht
viel auf dem Spiel; da ist aber auch viel zu gewinnen. 108 Nationen
mit 90 % Welthandelsanteil k&ouml;nnen mehr bewirken, um M&auml;rkte
zu &ouml;ffnen, den Handel anzukurbeln und Wachstum zu erzeugen,
als 3 oder 30 L&auml;nder. Gelingt die Runde wie geplant, k&ouml;nnte
das Weltprodukt um Hunderte von Mrd. USD ausgeweitet werden.
<P>
Das erg&auml;be dann sicher den Spielraum, den wir gerade in der
Entwicklungspolitik brauchen.
<P>
Aber wird es nun gelingen? Die Aussichten sind heute besser als
noch vor einigen Wochen. Der Plan des GATT-Generaldirektors Dunkel
zur &Uuml;berwindung der agrarpolitischen Blockaden, die deutschen
und franz&ouml;sischen Vorst&ouml;&szlig;e, sind Anla&szlig; zur
Zuversicht. Gerade weil wir in diesem Bereich immer wieder auf
Vorbehalte sto&szlig;en, m&ouml;chte ich hier doch in aller Bescheidenheit
an die mutigen Vorschl&auml;ge von EG-Kommissar Ray Mac Sharry
zur schrittweisen Erneuerung der EG-Agrarpolitik erinnern. Die
Kommission hat damit einen gro&szlig;en Beitrag geleistet. Freilich,
noch ist nichts entschieden. Bis zum Ende des Jahres werden wir
mehr wissen.
<P>
Ich darf diesen Vortrag mit einem pers&ouml;nlichen Kommentar
beenden, den viele meiner Kollegen unterschreiben w&uuml;rden.
Die Entwicklungspolitik der Gemeinschaft mu&szlig; als eigenst&auml;ndige
Materie erweiterten Eingang in das R&ouml;mische Vertragswerk
finden. Ans&auml;tze sind in Sektion IV dieser Vertr&auml;ge vorhanden.
Vielleicht bieten die bevorstehenden Regierungskonferenzen im
Dezember in Maastricht Gelegenheit, daf&uuml;r Voraussetzungen
zu schaffen. Eine so abgesicherte Politik w&uuml;rde schlie&szlig;lich
auf eine B&uuml;ndelung von Ma&szlig;nahmen, die Abstimmung von
Einzelpolitiken und das Eingreifen dort, wo die Gemeinschaft die
besten Erfolgschancen bietet, hinauslaufen.
<P>

<a name=lom></a><H3>Das Lom&#233; IV - Assoziierungsabkommen</H3>
<P>
<B>Siegfried GRUNER</B> 
<P>
<b>1. EINLEITUNG (GRUNDLEGENDES UND HINTERGRUND DER VERHANDLUNGEN)</b>
<P>
Die Europ&auml;ische Gemeinschaft ist heute weltweit auf dem Gebiet
der Entwicklungspolitik t&auml;tig. Weltweit haben die Entwicklungsl&auml;nder
in j&uuml;ngster Zeit &Auml;ngste ge&auml;u&szlig;ert &uuml;ber
die Entwicklung in Europa: vor allem gekennzeichnet durch die
Umw&auml;lzungen in Mittel-, Ost- und S&uuml;dosteuropa und die
sich abzeichnende neue (verst&auml;rkte) Rolle f&uuml;r die Europ&auml;ische
Gemeinschaft auf der internationalen Szene (Stichwort Binnenmarkt
1992 - &quot;Festung Europa&quot;). Besonders die sogenannten
AKP-Staaten, die mit der EG durch das Lom&eacute;-Abkommen verbunden
sind, bef&uuml;rchten weitere Marginalisierung.
<P>
&Uuml;ber die weltweite Aufgabe und T&auml;tigkeit der EG in der
Dritten Welt wurde im Rahmen der vom Wiener Institut f&uuml;r
Entwicklungsfragen und Zusammenarbeit veranstalteten Vortragsreihe
ja bereits im September dieses Jahres referiert und debattiert.
<P>
Ich werde mich also hier im wesentlichen auf das Lom&eacute;-Abkommen
konzentrieren, das das Kernst&uuml;ck der EG-Entwicklungspolitik
ist und bleibt und dessen jetzt 69 Mitgliedsl&auml;nder in Afrika
sowie im karibischen Raum und im Pazifischen Ozean (die sogenannten
AKP-Staaten) etwa die H&auml;lfte der der Gemeinschaft zur Verf&uuml;gung
stehenden Mittel (insgesamt liegen die j&auml;hrlichen Ausgaben
der EG ungef&auml;hr bei 2,5 Milliarden ECU; die Mittelbindungen
sind sogar noch etwas h&ouml;her) erhalten, und denen auch die
handelspolitisch g&uuml;nstigsten Bedingungen einger&auml;umt
werden.
<P>
Mitten im zentral- und osteurop&auml;ischen Aufbruch, am 15. Dezember
1989, wurde ein wesentlich verbessertes und finanziell gut ausgestattetes
Lom&eacute; IV-Kooperations-abkommen zwischen der EG und der AKP-Gruppe
unterzeichnet. Allein an dieser Tatsache kann man den hohen Stellenwert
ablesen, den die Entwicklungspolitik in der EG weiterhin einnimmt.
<P>
Dieses neue Abkommen schlie&szlig;t sich an drei vorangegangene
(Lom&eacute;-) Kooperations-Abkommen mit einer Laufzeit von jeweils
f&uuml;nf Jahren an. Der &quot;Grundstein&quot; f&uuml;r die Entwicklungshilfepolitik
der EG wurde aber bereits im vierten Teil des Vertrages von Rom
(1957) gelegt, der den sog. &uuml;berseeischen L&auml;ndern und
Hoheitsgebieten gewidmet ist (im wesentlichen die damaligen franz&ouml;sischen
Kolonien in Afrika). In den sechziger Jahren kam es dann zu ersten
Verhandlungen zwischen der damaligen Sechser-Gemeinschaft und
18 in jenen Jahren unabh&auml;ngig gewordenen afrikanischen Staaten,
die zum Kooperations-Abkommen von Jaunde f&uuml;hrten. &quot;Jaunde
I&quot; galt von 1965 bis 1970 und &quot;Jaunde II&quot; von 1970
bis 1975. Inhalt war die Schaffung einer Art Freihandelszone mit
mehr oder weniger freiem Warenaustausch in beiden Richtungen,
und die Finanzierung von Entwicklungsprojekten vor allem im wirtschaftlichen
und sozialen Infrastrukturbereich.
<P>
Zur&uuml;ck zur &quot;Lom&eacute;-Kooperation&quot;: Das erste
Lom&eacute;-Abkommen, ein wesentlich umfassenderes Abkommen &uuml;ber
die Zusammenarbeit zwischen der Europ&auml;ischen Gemeinschaft
(den EWG-Staaten) und der AKP-Gruppe, wurde 1975 unterzeichnet
und anschlie&szlig;end, nach neuen Verhandlungen, 1979, 1984 und
- wie schon gesagt - Ende 1989 erneuert. Das Lom&eacute;-Abkommen
setzt den Nord-S&uuml;d-Dialog in die Praxis um und bietet:
<P>
<ol>
<li>eine Partnerschaft, in der die politischen, sozialen, kulturellen
und wirtschaftlichen Entscheidungen der einzelnen Partner respektiert
werden;
<P>
<li>eine sichere und dauerhafte Zusammenarbeit auf der Grundlage
eines frei ausgehandelten und rechtsverbindlichen Vertrages;
<P>
<li>eine globale, flexible Zusammenarbeit unter Einsatz des gesamten
Hilfe- und Handelsf&ouml;rderungsinstrumentariums;
<P>
<li>einen st&auml;ndigen Dialog in drei gemeinsamen Einrichtungen
(AKP-EWG-Ministerrat, AKP-EWG-Botschafterausschu&szlig;, Parit&auml;tische
Versammlung AKP-EWG).</ol>
<P>
<b>2. DAS LOM&#201; IV-ABKOMMEN: KONTINUIT&#196;T-NEUERUNGEN-VERBESSERUNGEN</b>
<P>
Damit habe ich bereits allgemein einige wesentliche Elemente der
&quot;Lom&eacute;-Politik&quot; angedeutet. Im Folgenden m&ouml;chte
ich n&auml;her eingehen auf die Frage, wodurch sich die durch
Lom&eacute; begr&uuml;ndete Zusammenarbeit so besonders auszeichnet.
Dabei werde ich nat&uuml;rlich vor allem &uuml;ber das neueste
Lom&eacute; IV-Abkommen sprechen (mein Hauptthema), dessen Ausrichtung
man vielleicht am besten mit den Schlagworten Kontinuit&auml;t,
Neuerungen und Verbesserungen skizzieren k&ouml;nnte:
<P>
<i>a) Lom&eacute; als attraktives Kooperationsmodell - Beziehungen
von Gruppe zu Gruppe.</i>
<P>
Lom&eacute; bleibt ein attraktives Kooperationsmodell, das weit
&uuml;ber die klassische Entwicklungszusammenarbeit, wie der Projekthilfe
im Rahmen der finanziellen und technischen Kooperation, hinausgeht
und das international als beispielhaft gilt (E. Carrington: &quot;Bis
heute das beste Kooperationsinstrument zwischen n&ouml;rdlichen
und s&uuml;dlichen Partnern unseres Planeten.&quot;). In diesem
Zusammenhang erscheint es mir besonders wichtig hervorzuheben,
da&szlig; es hier um die Beziehung von Gruppe zu Gruppe geht.
Ich glaube, da&szlig; in den Nord-S&uuml;d-Beziehungen zwischen
wirtschaftlich starken und wirtschaftlich schwachen L&auml;ndern,
also in solchen per definitionem unausgeglichenen Beziehungen,
die Tatsache, eine Gruppe zu sein und einen Sprecher f&uuml;r
69 L&auml;nder zu haben, ein beachtliches politisches Korrektiv
darstellt.
<P>
Mit Lom&eacute; IV ist die Zahl der urspr&uuml;nglich 46 Partnerstaaten
(vorher 18 und 43) auf 69 angewachsen. Damit sind insbesondere
alle afrikanischen L&auml;nder s&uuml;dlich der Sahara - mit Ausnahme
von S&uuml;dafrika - Partner im Lom&eacute;-Abkommen.
<P>
Das afrikanische Element ist also allein schon quantitativ dominierend.
Von den eben genannten 69 AKP-Staaten sind 46 L&auml;nder zu Afrika
zu z&auml;hlen (wenn hier und im Folgenden von Afrika bzw. Schwarzafrika
die Rede ist, so sind die L&auml;nder s&uuml;dlich der Sahara
gemeint, die Mitglied des Abkommens sind). Von rund 12 Mrd. ECU
(1 ECU = rd. 14,4 &ouml;sterr. Schilling), die im Zeitraum 1976-1989
(d.h. seit Wirksamwerden des ersten Abkommens von Lom&eacute;)
f&uuml;r die AKP-L&auml;nder insgesamt aus Mitteln der Europ&auml;ischen
Entwicklungsfonds (EEF) bereitgestellt wurden, gingen rund 11
Mrd. ECU bzw. 92% nach Schwarzafrika.
<P>
<i>b) Vertragliche Verankerung.</i> 
<P>
Ein zweiter wichtiger Aspekt ist, in meinen Augen, die vertragliche
Verankerung dieser auf gegenseitigen Verpflichtungen beruhenden
Beziehungen. Die handelspolitischen und finanziellen Fragen sind
vertraglich geregelt. Die Hilfe verteilt sich z.B. auf nationale
(oder regionale) F&uuml;nf-Jahres-Programme, die gemeinsam mit
den einzelnen AKP-L&auml;ndern erarbeitet werden und f&uuml;r
die vor Erarbeitung dieser Programme ein fester Finanzbetrag feststeht.
So wissen die L&auml;nder von Anfang an, womit sie seitens der
Gemeinschaft rechnen k&ouml;nnen.
<P>
Der Wunsch der Partner, einen solideren Rahmen f&uuml;r die Entwicklungsplanung
zu schaffen (und auch f&uuml;r Investoren eine sichere Perspektive
zu er&ouml;ffnen), kommt auch darin zum Ausdruck, da&szlig; Lom&eacute;
IV erstmalig den Zeitrahmen auf 10 Jahre ausdehnt - das neue Abkommen
l&auml;uft bis ins Jahr 2000! -, mit einem Finanzprotokoll von
5 Jahren und einer Revisionsklausel f&uuml;r die Halbzeit. (Dies
wird uns - hoffentlich - auch sehr aufwendige (zeit- und kostspielige)
Marathonverhandlungen alle 5 Jahre ersparen!)
<P>
<i>c) Globales Vorgehen.</i> 
<P>
Der dritte Punkt ist der &auml;u&szlig;erst globale Charakter
dieses Abkommens, das die gesamte Palette an Instrumenten f&uuml;r
die Zusammenarbeit enth&auml;lt. Es wurde versucht, sie bei allen
Verhandlungen zu erg&auml;nzen und zu vervollst&auml;ndigen.
<P>
Das Abkommen enth&auml;lt klassische, aber auch ganz neuartige
Instrumente. Ich denke hier zum Beispiel an das STABEX-System,
das eine &quot;Erfindung&quot; der Verhandlungs-partner von Lom&eacute;
I war. Es handelt sich dabei um ein Instrument, das weit &uuml;ber
die klassischen Handelsregeln hinausgeht und das keineswegs der
klassischen Entwicklungshilfe zuzurechnen ist. Mit Hilfe dieses
Instruments werden die Verluste bei den Ausfuhrerl&ouml;sen f&uuml;r
landwirtschaftliche Rohstoffe ausgeglichen, die unsere Partner
in die Gemeinschaft ausf&uuml;hren. Das System st&uuml;tzt sich
auf einen Referenz-zeitraum, der mit einem bestimmten Jahr verglichen
wird; ab einem gewissen Betrag werden die Einnahmeverluste finanziell
ausgeglichen, bzw. man versucht es.
<P>
Denn trotz &uuml;berproportionaler Erh&ouml;hung der daf&uuml;r
im neuen Abkommen zur Verf&uuml;gung stehenden Mittel k&ouml;nnen
f&uuml;r das Jahr 1990 die wegen des drastischen Preisverfalls
hohen Verluste von ca. 1,4 Mrd. ECU nur maximal zu 40% abgedeckt
werden. Die dramatische Entwicklung auf den Rohstoffm&auml;rkten
wird auch hier durch die Tatsache verdeutlicht, da&szlig; dies
trotz allem der bisher h&ouml;chste Auszahlungsbetrag des STABEX-Systems
seit Lom&eacute; I sein wird.
<P>
Diese Entwicklung unterstreicht gleichzeitig die Notwendigkeit
- wie im neuen Abkommen vorgesehen -, diese Mittel k&uuml;nftig
noch st&auml;rker als bisher f&uuml;r Strukturver-besserung und
Diversifizierung einzusetzen.
<P>
Dies gilt auch f&uuml;r die sogenannten SYSMIN-Mittel, die eingesetzt
werden k&ouml;nnen zur Wiederherstellung der Produktions- oder
Ausfuhrkapazit&auml;ten von Bergbauunternehmen in AKP-L&auml;ndern
oder auch, in bestimmten F&auml;llen (bei mangelnder Lebensf&auml;higkeit
der betroffenen Produktionseinheiten), zur Finanzierung von Diversifizierungs-
oder Umstellungsprojekten bzw. -programmen.
<P>
<i>d) &Auml;u&szlig;erst g&uuml;nstige finanzielle Bedingungen.</i>
<P>
Die finanzielle und technische Zusammenarbeit hat ein beachtliches
Volumen erreicht (12 Mrd. ECU f&uuml;r die ersten f&uuml;nf Jahre
von Lom&eacute; IV; 12 Mrd. ECU = &ouml;S 173 Mrd., davon: Mittel
des EEF: 10,8 Mrd. ECU, Darlehen der EIB: 1,2 Mrd. ECU); die finanziellen
Bedingungen sind &auml;u&szlig;erst liberal oder &quot;konzessionell&quot;,
wie der Fachmann sagt.
<P>
Der gr&ouml;&szlig;te Teil der Finanzhilfe wurde immer als Zuschu&szlig;
gew&auml;hrt, auch schon zu Zeiten, als viele noch an den p&auml;dagogischen
und erzieherischen Wert r&uuml;ckzahlbarer Finanzhilfe im Falle
der &auml;rmsten L&auml;nder glaubten! Heutzutage wissen es alle
zu sch&auml;tzen, da&szlig; die EG bei der Finanzhilfe haupts&auml;chlich
Zusch&uuml;sse und nur zu einem kleinen Teil Darlehen gew&auml;hrt
haben. So steht die Gemeinschaft heute bei diesem furchtbaren
Schuldenproblem, das die meisten unserer Partnerl&auml;nder zu
erdr&uuml;cken droht, wenigstens nicht als einer der gro&szlig;en
Gl&auml;ubiger da.
<P>
<i>e) Projekte und Programme. Unterst&uuml;tzung sektororientierter
Politiken. Konzentration der Hilfe. Politikdialog. F&ouml;rderung
der strukturellen Anpassung.</i> 
<P>
Seit Lom&eacute; III hat man sich von dem traditionellen Weg,
Einzelprojekte zu finanzieren, weit entfernt. Der Schwerpunkt
hat sich auf Programme und auf die Unterst&uuml;tzung sektororientierter
Politiken verlegt. Mit den meisten der AKP-L&auml;nder wurde auch
f&uuml;r Lom&eacute; IV eine Konzentration des Einsatzes der Mittel
f&uuml;r einen oder zwei vorrangige Sektoren vereinbart. (Die
Vorstellung, wir k&ouml;nnten in jedem Entwicklungsland alles
tun - &quot;Gie&szlig;kannenprinzip&quot; -, geh&ouml;rt l&auml;ngst
der Vergangenheit an!)
<P>
Damit wurde die &quot;kritische Masse&quot; f&uuml;r einen aussichtsreicheren
&quot;policy-dialogue&quot;, z.B. zum Thema Ern&auml;hrungssicherung
oder Gesundheitswesen usw., geschaffen. Dieser &quot;policy-dialogue&quot;,
der selbst mit &quot;schwierigeren&quot; L&auml;ndern recht erfolgreich
gef&uuml;hrt wird, hat zum Ziel, die finanzielle Unterst&uuml;tzung
der Gemeinschaft mit notwendigen wirtschaftspolitischen Ma&szlig;nahmen
der Regierung der Partnerl&auml;nder, z.B. im Bereich der Preispolitik,
der Liberalisierung des internen Handels, der Privatisierung usw.,
effektiver zu verbinden. (Es ist das Recht eines Entwicklungslandes,
seine Priorit&auml;ten selbst festzulegen. Es ist aber selbstverst&auml;ndlich
auch unser Recht, nur das zu unterst&uuml;tzen, was wir f&uuml;r
sinnvoll halten.)
<P>
Allerdings, wenn die Kommission Ratschl&auml;ge erteilt, was zu
tun w&auml;re, damit die Hilfe Fr&uuml;chte tr&auml;gt, dann d&uuml;rfen
ihre Ratschl&auml;ge nat&uuml;rlich nicht im Widerspruch zu denen
stehen, die von anderer Seite kommen. Daher ist eine engere Koordinierung
mit anderen bilateralen oder multilateralen Gebern, z.B. der Weltbank,
auch im Bereich der &quot;policy&quot; erforderlich und nicht
nur bei der praktischen Umsetzung der Projekte, wo man ohne sie
ohnehin nicht auskommt.
<P>
In logischer Erg&auml;nzung des Konzeptes des &quot;policy-dialogues&quot;
wurde f&uuml;r Lom&eacute; IV auch die Unterst&uuml;tzung von
globalen oder sektoralen Strukturanpassungsma&szlig;nahmen entschieden.
Daf&uuml;r stehen dem Abkommen f&uuml;r die ersten f&uuml;nf Jahre
Finanzmittel in H&ouml;he von 1,150 Mrd. ECU zur Verf&uuml;gung.
Sie sollen f&uuml;r rasch auszahlbare Hilfen, wie z.B. Einfuhrprogramme
zur St&uuml;tzung der Zahlungsbilanz, verwendet werden. Die dabei
anfallenden Gegenwertmittel k&ouml;nnen dann als St&uuml;tzung
der &ouml;ffentlichen Haushalte gezielt vor allem im sozialen
Bereich verwendet werden. Ziel ist es, die L&auml;nder in der
schwierigen Phase der Umstrukturierung ihrer Wirtschaft zu unterst&uuml;tzen,
in der klassische Finanzierungsarten mit wesentlich langsamerer
Auszahlung ungeeignet sind. In diesem Bereich wurden ebenfalls
enge Kontakte mit der Weltbank, aber auch mit dem IWF gekn&uuml;pft,
den beiden Initiatoren dieses Ansatzes.
<P>
<i>f) Dezentrale Kooperation.</i> 
<P>
Im Gegenzug zu dieser St&uuml;tzung staatlicher Ma&szlig;nahmen
wurde im Lom&eacute; IV-Abkommen erstmals ein eigener Abschnitt
zur sogenannten &quot;dezentralen Kooperation&quot; aufgenommen.
Dieser Ansatz zielt darauf ab, Initiativen der vielen kleineren
und &quot;dezentralisierten&quot; Akteure in der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit
direkt zu f&ouml;rdern: dezentralisierte und lokale Institutionen
der &ouml;ffentlichen Hand, St&auml;dte, Dorfgemeinschaften oder
andere organisierte Bev&ouml;lkerungsgruppen, Genossenschaften,
Unternehmer, Gewerkschaften, Nichtregierungsorganisationen usw..
Besonderes Gewicht wird dabei auch auf die Rolle der Frau im Entwicklungsproze&szlig;
gelegt, die hierbei ja eine Schl&uuml;sselrolle spielt.
<P>
Die dezentrale Kooperation dient dem Ziel, Ans&auml;tze der Eigeninitiative
und Selbsthilfe auf den verschiedensten Ebenen zu unterst&uuml;tzen
und damit einen partizipativen, demokratischen Entwicklungsproze&szlig;
zu f&ouml;rdern. Diese Idee ist zwar nicht neu, doch ist mit der
expliziten Ber&uuml;cksichtigung dieses Ansatzes im Lom&eacute;-Abkommen
geplant, den direkten Beitrag der verschiedenen Akteure zu systematisieren
und dabei die verschiedenen Institutionen, aber auch deren Sachkenntnisse
zu nutzen und diese Art der Zusammenarbeit auszuweiten.
<P>
Entwicklung von unten, nicht verordnet von oben!
<P>
Es geht vor allem darum, einen konkreten Beitrag zu leisten zur
besseren Befriedigung der menschlichen Grundbed&uuml;rfnisse,
wie Gesundheit, Bildung und Ern&auml;hrung, aber auch Selbstbestimmung
und Demokratisierung, Partizipation, nationale und kulturelle
Identit&auml;t u.a.m. als vorrangiges entwicklungspolitisches
Ziel.
<P>
<i>g) Thematische Schwerpunkte.</i> 
<P>
Das Lom&eacute;-Abkommen setzt thematische Schwerpunkte. Ein zentrales
Thema bleibt nach wie vor die Ern&auml;hrungssicherung. Andere
Themen, die damit zusammenh&auml;ngen und deren Bedeutung f&uuml;r
eine nachhaltige Entwicklung besonders wichtig sind, wurden besonders
hervorgehoben. Das gilt beispielsweise f&uuml;r Themen wie die
Umwelt und die Bev&ouml;lkerungsentwicklung.
<P>
Wenn man wei&szlig;, da&szlig; zur Zeit der Jaunde-Abkommen und
noch zu Beginn von Lom&eacute; I die Ern&auml;hrungssituation
Afrikas kein Problem darstellte, wenn man die heutige Lage kennt
und dazu wei&szlig;, da&szlig; sich die Bev&ouml;lkerung der AKP-L&auml;nder
bis zum Anfang des n&auml;chsten Jahrtausend, also in den n&auml;chsten
10 bis 12 Jahren, praktisch um 50 % erh&ouml;hen wird - und daran
wird sich nichts mehr &auml;ndern -, dann wird klar, wie dringend
und vorrangig Aktionen in den genannten Themenbereichen sind,
um im Wettlauf mit der Zeit nur in etwa mithalten zu k&ouml;nnen.
<P>
(Endlich ist das zukunftsentscheidende Thema &quot;Bev&ouml;lkerungspolitik&quot;
kein Tabu mehr! Sicher erscheint auch, da&szlig; das Lebens- und
Produktionsmodell der Industriel&auml;nder schon aus &ouml;kologischen
Gr&uuml;nden nicht weltweit &uuml;bertragen werden kann!)
<P>
Ein anderes Thema, das im Lom&eacute; IV-Abkommen neu angesprochen
wird, ist die Verschuldungssituation der AKP-L&auml;nder. Konsequenterweise
sind daher im Abkommen ab jetzt nur noch Finanzierungen in Form
von nicht r&uuml;ckzahlbaren Zusch&uuml;ssen vorgesehen. Eine
Ausnahme bilden die von der EIB verwalteten Mittel, deren Konditionen
allerdings stark verbessert wurden und im &uuml;brigen mehr zu
privatwirtschaftlichen Zwecken verwendet werden.
<P>
<i>h) Regionale Zusammenarbeit.</i> 
<P>
Das neue Lom&eacute; IV-Abkommen gibt auch neue Impulse f&uuml;r
die regionale Zusammenarbeit, einem bereits traditionellen Schwerpunkt
der EG-Entwicklungspolitik (von der bilateralen Hilfe und der
Weltbank lange vernachl&auml;ssigt). Obgleich eine regionale Kooperation
anerkannterma&szlig;en schwierig ist und in der Praxis h&auml;ufig
schleppend verl&auml;uft, gewinnt sie in einer kleiner werdenden,
konkurrierenden Welt zunehmend an Bedeutung. Diesem Tatbestand
wird in Lom&eacute; IV Rechnung getragen: 1.250 Millionen ECU
werden f&uuml;r die regionale Zusammenarbeit, gegen&uuml;ber 1.000
Millionen ECU w&auml;hrend Lom&eacute; III, bereitgestellt.
<P>
Besonderes Augenmerk soll der regionalen wirtschaftlichen Integration
gelten, weshalb Leistungen, die den Handel zwischen den AKP-Staaten
erleichtern k&ouml;nnten, eingef&uuml;hrt oder verbessert werden
sollen, so z.B. Clearing-Stellen f&uuml;r den internationalen
Zahlungsverkehr zwischen H&auml;ndlern, die Gesch&auml;fte in
unterschiedlichen W&auml;hrungen abschlie&szlig;en, oder Durchfuhrvereinbarungen,
mit denen sich der Warenverkehr beschleunigen und ebenso schwerf&auml;llige
wie kostspielige Zollformalit&auml;ten verringern lassen.
<P>
<i>i) Die handelspolitischen Dispositionen.</i> 
<P>
Die handelspolitischen Dispositionen, die vor allem den freien
Zugang zum EG-Markt f&uuml;r die meisten AKP-Produkte gew&auml;hren,
wurden im Lom&eacute; IV-Abkommen noch erweitert und vor allem
im Bereich der administrativen Verfahren zur Warenherkunfts-bestimmung
stark verbessert. Im &uuml;brigen sieht Lom&eacute; IV M&ouml;glichkeiten
vor, mit denen die AKP-Staaten auf die Herausforderungen des k&uuml;nftigen
gro&szlig;en Binnenmarktes reagieren k&ouml;nnen:
<P>
<ul>
<li>es sind Dialog- und Konsultationsverfahren vorgesehen, um sicherzugehen,
da&szlig; die von der Gemeinschaft gew&auml;hlten Ma&szlig;nahmen
den Interessen der AKP-Staaten nicht schaden;
<P>
<li>die Gemeinschaft hat sich verpflichtet daf&uuml;r zu sorgen,
da&szlig; die Gemeinschafts-regelungen &uuml;ber M&auml;rkte f&uuml;r
Waren, wie Bananen und Rum, die wichtig f&uuml;r die Ausfuhren
einiger AKP-Staaten sind, die Interessen dieser Staaten nicht
beeintr&auml;chtigen;
<P>
<li>generell kann mit Instrumenten, wie der finanziellen und technischen
Zusammenarbeit oder der Absatzf&ouml;rderung, wenn sie klug eingesetzt
werden, den AKP-Staaten geholfen werden, die neuen M&ouml;glichkeiten
zu nutzen, die ein einheitlich gewordener Markt f&uuml;r ihre
Ausfuhren bietet.</ul>
<P>
<i>j) Wahrung der Menschenrechte und demokratische Reformen.</i>
<P>
Eine weitere Besonderheit des neuen Lom&eacute; IV-Abkommens,
die der Kommission sehr am Herzen liegt, ist schlie&szlig;lich
die Wahrung der Menschenrechte und die F&ouml;rderung der Menschenw&uuml;rde.
Diese Bestimmungen gewinnen eine neue Bedeutung im Lichte der
Entwicklung in Mittel- und Osteuropa. Dar&uuml;ber hinaus m&uuml;ssen
wir eine wesentlich st&auml;rkere Sensibilit&auml;t in der europ&auml;ischen
&ouml;ffentlichen Meinung (z.B. Europ&auml;isches Parlament) f&uuml;r
Fragen der Menschenrechte und der Demokratie in Rechnung stellen.
Allgemein kann man sicherlich sagen, da&szlig; zu Beginn der vierten
Entwicklungsdekade eine gr&ouml;&szlig;ere M&ouml;glichkeit als
je zuvor besteht, die (Gefahr der) Unterordnung der Menschenrechtspolitik
unter au&szlig;enpolitischen Interessen zu beenden.
<P>
Das Abkommen von Lom&eacute; nimmt ausdr&uuml;cklich auf die Wahrung
der Menschenrechte Bezug. Die Gemeinschaft weist dabei darauf
hin, da&szlig; ohne Respektierung der Menschenrechte, aber auch
ohne demokratische Reformen es keine wirkliche Entwicklung geben
kann. (Wirtschaftliche und politische Freiheit lassen sich nicht
trennen!)
<P>
Im &uuml;brigen wird sich der EG-Ministerrat demn&auml;chst mit
diesem Thema befassen und vermutlich eine allgemein g&uuml;ltige
Erkl&auml;rung &uuml;ber Menschenrechte, Demokratie und Entwicklung
verabschieden, die konkrete positive oder negative Ma&szlig;nahmen
in diesem Bereich vorsieht.
<P>
<i>k) Die Institutionen des Lom&eacute;-Abkommens: ein Modell
der &quot;Mitbestimmung&quot;.</i> 
<P>
Eine Besonderheit des Lom&eacute;-Abkommens sind seine Institutionen:
Das Abkommen sieht gemeinsame Organe vor, die daf&uuml;r sorgen,
da&szlig; die Gemeinschaft und ihre Partner in den AKP-L&auml;ndern
auf der Ebene der Botschafter, der Minister, der Parit&auml;tischen
Versammlung usw. gleich stark vertreten sind und das Abkommen
gemeinsam verwaltet wird.
<P>
Die laufende Verwaltungsarbeit ist im &uuml;brigen weitgehend
dezentralisiert: Den Beh&ouml;rden der Empf&auml;ngerl&auml;nder
wurden f&uuml;r die Durchf&uuml;hrung der Projekte Kompetenzen
zugewiesen (Vorbereitung der Projekte, Ver&ouml;ffentlichung der
Ausschreibungen, Durchf&uuml;hrung der Projekte usw.), und in
jedem dieser L&auml;nder ist eine mit der &Uuml;berwachung der
Projekte befa&szlig;te Delegation der Kommission vor Ort vertreten.
<P>
<b>3. GESAMTBILD UND AUSBLICK</b> 
<P>
Lom&eacute; kann sicher nicht allein alles bew&auml;ltigen. Aber
es bleibt ein wesentlicher, origineller Beitrag zur L&ouml;sung
der anstehenden Probleme. Unser Beitrag w&uuml;rde entscheidender
und effizienter, wenn die EG-Mitgliedsstaaten ihre bilaterale
Politik noch systematischer mit der Lom&eacute;-Politik b&uuml;ndelten.
<P>
Daf&uuml;r bestehen gute Aussichten: Binnenmarkt 1992/93, Wirtschafts-
und W&auml;hrungsunion und vor allem das Projekt &quot;Politische
Union&quot; werden die Entwicklungspolitik st&auml;rker integrieren:
Die Vertragstexte zur politischen Union, die bisher nur in Entw&uuml;rfen
vorliegen und die Ende des Jahres in der in Maastricht vorgesehenen
Regierungskonferenz diskutiert und - hoffentlich - verabschiedet
werden sollen, sehen neben der Schaffung einer gemeinsamen Au&szlig;en-
und Sicherheitspolitik auch die Festlegung der (f&uuml;r alle
Mitgliedsstaaten verbindlichen) Entwicklungspolitik der Gemeinschaft
vor.
<P>
Aber das hei&szlig;t nicht, da&szlig; die Durchf&uuml;hrung dieser
Politik vergemeinschaftet wird. Das w&auml;re ineffizient und
unrealistisch. Nur durch den Einsatz des technischen und administrativen
Wissens all derer, die bisher in Europa auf diesem Gebiet t&auml;tig
sind, k&ouml;nnen wir im Rahmen einer gemeinsamen Konzeption und
Disziplin mehr erreichen als bisher. Im Interesse der Entwicklungsl&auml;nder
und damit auch in unserem eigenen Interesse.
<P>

<a name=eur></a><H3>Die Europ&#228;ische Gemeinschaft und das S&#252;dliche Afrika</H3>
<P>
<B>Jacob HOUTMAN</B> 
<P>
Afrika erlebt derzeit eine Periode des positiven &Uuml;berganges.
Es gibt zwar einige R&uuml;ckschl&auml;ge, z.B. Verz&ouml;gerungen
im Demokratisierungsproze&szlig; in S&uuml;dafrika und die Menschenrechtssituation
in Malawi, aber es gibt auch hoffnungsvolle Entwicklungen, wie
die in Angola seit Mai 1991 und vor kurzem in Mozambique. Durch
unsere Verpflichtungen gegen&uuml;ber den SADC-Staaten im Rahmen
des Lom&eacute;-Abkommens und durch das &quot;Special-Programme&quot;
f&uuml;r S&uuml;dafrika versucht die Kommission, die Region in
diesem &Uuml;bergangsproze&szlig; zu unterst&uuml;tzen.
<P>
<b>1. Politische Entwicklungen in S&uuml;dafrika</b> 
<P>
Die einst hoffnungsvollen Erwartungen wichen aufgrund der politischen
Entwicklungen einem Gef&uuml;hl der Unsicherheit, obwohl das vor
kurzem stattgefundene Gespr&auml;ch zwischen Mandela und de Klerk
wieder Grund zur Hoffnung gibt.
<P>
W&auml;hrend der Vorbereitung zu CODESA II im Mai dieses Jahres,
an der die Europ&auml;ische Gemeinschaft als offizieller Beobachter
teilnahm, wurde offensichtlich, da&szlig; es schwierig sein w&uuml;rde,
eine Einigung in den grundlegenden Fragen zu erzielen.
<P>
Diese betreffen den wichtigen Bereich der Vereinbarungen zur Entscheidungsfindung
f&uuml;r die verfassunggebende K&ouml;rperschaft. Zur Diskussion
steht nicht die blo&szlig;e Frage nach dem ein oder anderen Prozent,
sondern es geht vielmehr um den fundamentalen Unterschied zwischen
verschiedenen Regierungskonzepten: Geteilte Machtaus&uuml;bung
contra Mehrheitsprinzip. Abgesehen von diesen Differenzen, hoffte
die Europ&auml;ische Gemeinschaft auf die Weiterf&uuml;hrung des
Dialogs zur friedlichen Kl&auml;rung der noch offenen Fragen zwischen
der Regierung S&uuml;dafrikas und dem ANC.
<P>
Parallel zu den Verfassungsgespr&auml;chen beherrschte weiterhin
die Gewalt S&uuml;dafrika, obwohl die wichtigsten politischen
Parteien versuchten, durch das &quot;Nationale Friedens-&uuml;bereinkommen&quot;
den Ausschreitungen ein Ende zu setzen. Boipatong, Bisho und andere
Beispiele unterstrichen einerseits die Bedeutung internationaler
Beobachter f&uuml;r die Untersuchung der Vorf&auml;lle, wie sie
die Goldstone Kommission durchf&uuml;hrte, andererseits aber auch
die Wichtigkeit ihrer blo&szlig;en Pr&auml;senz in den Krisengebieten.
<P>
Eine Troika der Europ&auml;ischen Gemeinschaft besuchte vom 2.
bis 3. September 1992 S&uuml;dafrika und versuchte unter anderem,
die Parteien zu ermutigen, die konstitutionellen Verhandlungen
fortzusetzen und mit den politischen Parteien und anderen Organisationen
dar&uuml;ber zu diskutieren, wie man den toten Punkt &uuml;berwinden
und Wege und Mittel finden k&ouml;nnte, um die Gewalt zu vermindern.
<P>
Es liegt sicher bei der Bev&ouml;lkerung S&uuml;dafrikas selbst,
ihre Probleme zu l&ouml;sen, aber der Internationalen Gemeinschaft
kommt durch die Unterst&uuml;tzung dieses Prozesses auch eine
wichtige Rolle zu. Deshalb erkl&auml;rte sich die EG bereit, 15
Beobachter zu entsenden, die innerhalb des strukturellen Rahmens
des &quot;Nationalen Friedens-&uuml;bereinkommens&quot; einen
Beitrag zur Befriedung leisten sollten. Die Gemeinschaft beschlo&szlig;
au&szlig;erdem, dem unabh&auml;ngigen Untersuchungsausschu&szlig;
der Goldstone Kommission 5 Beobachter zur Verf&uuml;gung zu stellen.
<P>
Trotz der R&uuml;ckschl&auml;ge mu&szlig; der Proze&szlig; zur
Schaffung einer demokratischen, nicht-rassistischen s&uuml;dafrikanischen
Gesellschaft fortgesetzt werden, und es m&uuml;ssen dringend Aktivit&auml;ten
gesetzt werden, um den Proze&szlig; wieder in Gang zu bringen.
Nicht nur die politische Entwicklung zeigt, da&szlig; Handlungsbedarf
besteht, auch mit der Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft des Landes geht
es rapide bergab.
<P>
Deshalb beobachteten wir auch mit gro&szlig;er Freude, wie rasch
sich Pr&auml;sident de Klerk und Pr&auml;sident Mandela auf ein
Treffen einigten. Wir begr&uuml;&szlig;ten die Unterzeichnung
des Protokolls des gegenseitigen Einvernehmens (&quot;Record of
Understanding&quot;) durch den ANC und die Regierung und ihre
neuerliche Verpflichtung, die Verhandlungen voranzutreiben. Wir
hoffen, da&szlig; mit diesem Schritt nach vorne einige der grunds&auml;tzlichen
Meinungsverschiedenheiten bald beseitigt werden k&ouml;nnen.
<P>
Die Ablehnung dieses Protokolls durch Anf&uuml;hrer Buthelezi,
Pr&auml;sident der Inkatha Freiheitspartei, haben wir zur Kenntnis
genommen. Es ist jedoch sehr wichtig, da&szlig; alle Parteien,
besonders die Inkatha Freiheitspartei, in den Verhandlungsproze&szlig;
involviert sind und an der n&auml;chsten Runde der &quot;Verhandlungen
f&uuml;r ein demokratisches S&uuml;dafrika&quot; teilnehmen.
<P>
Die L&ouml;sung dieser Probleme liegt zwar in den H&auml;nden
der S&uuml;dafrikaner selbst, aber die EG wird alles M&ouml;gliche
unternehmen, um den Proze&szlig; zu erleichtern.
<P>
<b>2. &quot;Special-Programme&quot; f&uuml;r die Opfer der Apartheid</b>
<P>
Das Special-Programme der EG f&uuml;r die Opfer der Apartheid
wurde im Rahmen der Europ&auml;ischen Politischen Kooperation
im Jahre 1985 gegr&uuml;ndet. Es wurde der Beschlu&szlig; gefa&szlig;t,
da&szlig; die Hilfe &uuml;ber die nicht-militanten Organisationen,
wie Kirchen, Gewerkschaften und die Kagiso Stiftung, abgewickelt
werden sollte.
<P>
Das Budget des Programmes f&uuml;r &quot;Positive Ma&szlig;nahmen&quot;
stieg seit 1986 stetig an und bel&auml;uft sich jetzt, im Jahre
1992, auf 80 MECU. Damit ist dieses Special-Programme gegenw&auml;rtig
das gr&ouml;&szlig;te EZA-Programm der EG in Afrika.
<P>
Ich m&ouml;chte hier ein wenig n&auml;her auf die wichtige Rolle
des Europ&auml;ischen Parlaments sowohl beim Aufbau des Special-Programme
als auch in bezug auf die Unterst&uuml;tzung, die es in den letzten
7 Jahren dem Programm zukommen lie&szlig;, eingehen.
<P>
In Anbetracht der ver&auml;nderten Lage in S&uuml;dafrika er&ouml;ffnete
die Kommission in Pretoria ein Koordinationsb&uuml;ro f&uuml;r
das Programm.
<P>
Die Neuorientierung des Special-Programme Mitte 1991 veranla&szlig;te
die Kommission, sich von der reinen Projektunterst&uuml;tzung
zu l&ouml;sen und sich einem mehr programmatisch orientierten
Ansatz hinzuwenden. Dadurch sollte die Verlagerung des Schwerpunkts
von politisch orientierten Programmen auf Projekte mit mehr EZA-Charakter
gef&ouml;rdert und au&szlig;erdem die Beteiligung an Bildungsprojekten
gesteigert werden.
<P>
Von 1986 bis Mitte 1991 wurden 402 Projekte im Ausma&szlig; von
130.7 MECU ausschlie&szlig;lich &uuml;ber den Verteiler der 4
herk&ouml;mmlichen s&uuml;dafrikanischen Kan&auml;le finanziert.
Dabei lag das Hauptaugenmerk auf den Bereichen der humanit&auml;ren
und sozialen Hilfe, Schulung und Bildung und des juridischen Beistands.
<P>
Seit der Wende zu mehr EZA-orientierten Programmen, Mitte 1991,
wurden 115 Projekte in H&ouml;he von insgesamt 101,3 MECU genehmigt.
Hauptbereiche sind weiterhin Schulung und Bildung, aber auch l&auml;ndliche
Entwicklung und Landwirtschaft gewinnen immer mehr an Bedeutung.
Die fr&uuml;heren Sektoren der humanit&auml;ren, sozialen und
juridischen Hilfe werden jedoch weiterhin nicht vernachl&auml;ssigt.
<P>
Von 1986 bis heute wurden insgesamt 517 Projekte im Rahmen des
Special-Programme im Gesamtausma&szlig; von eindrucksvollen 231
MECU finanziert.
<P>
Das Special-Programme ist also in der Tat speziell. Es agierte
unter immensen Schwierigkeiten, doch trotz all dieser Widrigkeiten
ist es gelungen, durch dieses Programm den Unterprivilegierten
in der s&uuml;dafrikanischen Gesellschaft Hilfe zukommen zu lassen.
Aber das ist nicht allein das Verdienst der Gemeinschaft. Ohne
die enormen Bem&uuml;hungen der europ&auml;ischen NGOs, unserer
s&uuml;dafrikanischen Partner und der Unterst&uuml;tzung des Europ&auml;ischen
Parlaments h&auml;tten wir das, was wir erreicht haben, nicht
geschafft.
<P>
<b>3. Das S&uuml;dliche Afrika im regionalen Kontext</b> 
<P>
Zun&auml;chst ist zu erw&auml;hnen, da&szlig; w&auml;hrend des
SADCC-Gipfels, der letzten August in Windhoek stattfand, neue
Schritte im S&uuml;dlichen Afrika gesetzt wurden, um die regionale
Kooperation und Integration zu st&auml;rken. De facto wurde aus
SADCC (&quot;Southern Africa Development Coordination Conference&quot;)
die SADC (&quot;Southern Africa Development Community&quot;).
<P>
Die EG begr&uuml;&szlig;t die neue Gemeinschaft SADC und hofft,
da&szlig; sie unter Ber&uuml;cksichtigung der Entwicklung in S&uuml;dafrika
die Kooperation zwischen den L&auml;ndern des S&uuml;dlichen Afrika
noch mehr st&auml;rken wird. Die EG wird, wie zuvor mit der SADCC,
nunmehr mit der SADC zusammenarbeiten und auch die Kooperation
mit PTA fortsetzen.
<P>
Im Rahmen der Lom&eacute;-Konvention und des zur Verf&uuml;gung
stehenden Budgets leistete die Gemeinschaft dem S&uuml;dlichen
Afrika betr&auml;chtliche Hilfe. Zwischen 1985 - 1990 stellte
die EG sch&auml;tzungsweise mehr als 1,7 Milliarden ECUs, das
sind mehr als 2 Milliarden US-Dollar, allein dem S&uuml;dlichen
Afrika zur Verf&uuml;gung. Diese Betr&auml;ge unterstreichen die
Bedeutung, die die EG der EZA in dieser Region beimi&szlig;t.
<P>
F&uuml;r die Zeit von 1990 - 1995 wird sich die lokale Hilfe der
Gemeinschaft auf die Sektoren Transport und Kommunikation konzentrieren,
im speziellen auf Nahrungsmittel, Landwirtschaft und Bodensch&auml;tze,
auf das Arbeitskr&auml;ftepotential und auf die Entwicklung des
Handels und der Aktivit&auml;ten im Gesch&auml;ftsbereich.
<P>
Zur Zeit k&auml;mpft die Region mit der &auml;rgsten Trockenperiode
seit Anfang des Jahrhunderts. Die Gemeinschaft stellte deshalb
dem S&uuml;dlichen Afrika im Laufe des Jahres 1992 rund 770.000
Tonnen Lebensmittelhilfe zur Verf&uuml;gung (zu einem Preis, inklusive
Transportkosten, von ca. 220 MECU).
<P>
<b>4. Angola</b> 
<P>
Durch die Abkommen, die im Mai 1991 zwischen der Regierung und
UNITA geschlossen wurden, trat Angola in einen ernst zu nehmenden
Proze&szlig; der Friedensbem&uuml;hungen ein, der schlie&szlig;lich
zu Wahlen f&uuml;hrte, die letzte Woche abgehalten wurden.
<P>
Dieser Proze&szlig; wurde von der Gemeinschaft und ihren Mitgliedstaaten
genauestens beobachtet und gem&auml;&szlig; der politischen Linie,
die im Rahmen der Europ&auml;isch Politischen Kooperation festgelegt
wurde, und gem&auml;&szlig; den Beschl&uuml;ssen des EZA Gipfeltreffens
vom 28. November 1991 unterst&uuml;tzt.
<P>
Diese europ&auml;ische Unterst&uuml;tzung war sowohl politischer
als auch finanzieller Natur. Politischerseits m&ouml;chte ich
auf den gemeinsamen Besuch der EZA Troika der Gemeinschaft in
Angola, der im Februar dieses Jahres unter portugiesischem Vorsitz
stattfand, verweisen.
<P>
Unsere Unterst&uuml;tzung des Friedensprozesses in Angola hat
auch eine finanzielle Dimension: Als Instrument der Koordination
zwischen der Gemeinschaft und ihren Mitgliedstaaten wurde eine
&quot;Gemeinschafts-Plattform&quot; gegr&uuml;ndet, die nun Angola
beim sozialen und wirtschaftlichen Wiederaufbau hilft. Der F&ouml;rderungsbeitrag
der Gemeinschaft bel&auml;uft sich f&uuml;r 1992/93 auf 70 Millionen
ECUs, der der Reintegration von zur&uuml;ckkehrenden Fl&uuml;chtlingen,
Vertriebenen und abger&uuml;steten Soldaten (insgesamt 1 Million
Menschen) und dem Wahlvorgang zuflie&szlig;t.
<P>
Besonders hohen Stellenwert f&uuml;r die Kommission nahm die Unterst&uuml;tzung
der Wahlen ein, f&uuml;r die ein eigenes Budget und Hilfsprogramm
(Gesamtf&ouml;rderung 5 MECU) zur Verf&uuml;gung gestellt wurde.
Sehr erfreulich ist, da&szlig; diese Unterst&uuml;tzung besonders
im logistischen Bereich (Hubschrauber und Flugzeuge) zum Erfolg
und der hohen Wahlbeteiligung beitragen konnte.
<P>
Obwohl die Wahlen in einer friedlichen, ruhigen und verantwortungsbewu&szlig;ten
Atmosph&auml;re stattfanden, was auch von den Beobachtern (worunter
sich auch europ&auml;ische Parlamentarier befanden) best&auml;tigt
wurde, erhielten wir leider eher beunruhigende Informationen,
da&szlig; die Ergebnisse von einer der Parteien nicht akzeptiert
werden k&ouml;nnten. Wir hoffen sehr, da&szlig; die Ergebnisse
von allen an der Wahl beteiligten Parteien respektiert werden
und ein wirklich dauerhafter Friede und eine uneingeschr&auml;nkte
Demokratie entsteht. Dies ist die einzige Basis f&uuml;r eine
langfristige, nachhaltige und gerechte Entwicklung.
<P>
<b>5. Mozambique</b> 
<P>
Wie bekannt ist, verliefen die Entwicklungen in Mozambique letztendlich
sehr gut. Das Allgemeine Friedensabkommen wurde am letzten Sonntag,
dem 4. Oktober, unterzeichnet. Die Gemeinschaft und ihre Mitgliedstaaten
unterst&uuml;tzten vollkommen diesen Friedensproze&szlig; und
sind froh, da&szlig; die Waffenruhe nun endlich bald eintreten
wird. Die Rolle Italiens, der San Egidio Gemeinschaft und einiger
Pr&auml;sidenten des S&uuml;dlichen Afrika mu&szlig; hier besonders
hervorgehoben werden.
<P>
W&auml;hrend des Krieges hat die Gemeinschaft mit allen ihr zur
Verf&uuml;gung stehenden Mitteln zur&uuml;ckkehrenden Fl&uuml;chtlingen,
Vertriebenen und vor allem der Bev&ouml;lkerung, die vom Krieg
betroffen war, Hilfe zukommen lassen. Die Kommission wird auch
weiterhin ihren Beitrag zur Befriedung des Landes w&auml;hrend
dieser schwierigen Nachkriegsphase und ebenso w&auml;hrend der
Phase des Wiederaufbaus leisten.
<P>
Vor zwei Jahren hat Vize-Pr&auml;sident Marin Mozambiques Pr&auml;sidenten
Chissano versprochen, da&szlig; die Kommission auf Ersuchen der
Regierung eine Geber-Konferenz zum wirtschaftlichen und sozialen
Wiederaufbau Mozambiques organisieren und durchf&uuml;hren wird.
<P>
Das Allgemeine Friedensabkommen ist ein erster Schritt in Richtung
einer neuen Entwicklung Mozambiques, aber es ist auch der Beginn
eines schwierigen Prozesses der sozialen Integration, der wirtschaftlichen
Rehabilitation und Demokratisierung. Die EG ist bereit, zu dieser
neuen und aufregenden Herausforderung ihren Beitrag zu leisten.
<P>
<b>6. Schlu&szlig;folgerung</b> 
<P>
Wie Sie erkennen k&ouml;nnen, ist das Engagement der Gemeinschaft
sowohl im Rahmen der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit als auch in seiner
politischen Dimension wichtig f&uuml;r das S&uuml;dliche Afrika,
und es wird auch in Zukunft so sein. Sicherlich ist eine Anpassung
der unterst&uuml;tzenden Ma&szlig;nahmen an die politischen und
wirtschaftlichen Entwicklungen in diesem Teil Afrikas, die genauestens
von der Kommission beobachtet werden, notwendig.

<a name=bez></a><H3>Die Beziehungen der Europ&#228;ischen Gemeinschaft zu Lateinamerika</H3>
<P>
<B>Wolf GRABENDORFF</B> 
<P>
Lassen Sie mich Ihnen heute, l&auml;ssig formuliert, das Strukturbild
einer &quot;Beziehungskiste&quot; vorstellen. Da Sie alle aus
eigener Erfahrung wissen, wie schwierig bilaterale Beziehungen
sind, k&ouml;nnen Sie nachf&uuml;hlen, wieviel problematischer
es ist, wenn es sich um biregionale Beziehungen handelt, n&auml;mlich
um das Verh&auml;ltnis zwischen der Europ&auml;ischen Gemeinschaft
(EG) und Lateinamerika.
<P>
W&auml;hrend die EG relativ klar definiert und in Erweiterung
begriffen ist, fehlt eine genaue Definition Lateinamerikas. Diese
Region ist niemals eine &ouml;konomische oder politische Einheit
gewesen, sie ist auch nur in beschr&auml;nktem Ma&szlig;e eine
kulturelle Einheit, und die Auseinandersetzungen dar&uuml;ber,
ob sie eine geographische Einheit ist, haben 1992, anl&auml;&szlig;lich
des 500. Jahrestages der &quot;Entdeckung&quot; Lateinamerikas,
entspechend gro&szlig;e Wellen geschlagen.
<P>
Man sollte daher mit den Vorstellungen anfangen, die die Einwohner
Europas und Lateinamerikas von der jeweils anderen Region haben.
Europa ist aus lateinamerikanischer Sicht ein Platz der Stabilit&auml;t,
des Wohlstands und der Homogenit&auml;t - obwohl das einige Europ&auml;er
bestreiten w&uuml;rden -, w&auml;hrend viele Lateinamerikaner
ihre eigene Region lange Zeit als eine der Instabilit&auml;t und
der Armut gesehen haben. Auf jeden Fall ist Lateinamerika heute
eine au&szlig;erordentlich heterogene Region, in der die Unterschiede
zwischen einzelnen L&auml;ndern und Gesellschaften um ein Vielfaches
gr&ouml;&szlig;er sind, als sie es vor zehn, zwanzig oder f&uuml;nfzig
Jahren waren.
<P>
Die Staaten und Gesellschaften Lateinamerikas haben sich immer
mehr auseinander entwickelt. Dies spiegelt sich auch darin wider,
wie Lateinamerika heute in der Welt gesehen wird. Es wird nicht
mehr lange dauern, dann wird man den Zeitungen entnehmen, da&szlig;
Mexiko und Chile Mitglieder der OECD (Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development), des Clubs der Reichen, werden. Das
sind die Lateinamerikaner auf dem Weg in die Erste Welt. Andere
Lateinamerikaner - ich brauche hier nur die Peruaner zu erw&auml;hnen
- sind eher auf dem Weg dahin, was man fr&uuml;her die Vierte
Welt nannte. Wenn wir also von den Beziehungen zwischen Europa
und Lateinamerika sprechen, m&uuml;ssen wir immer von Generalisierungen
ausgehen, obwohl eigentlich besondere Unterscheidungen und Akzente
angebracht w&auml;ren.
<P>
Die S&uuml;derweiterung der EG um Spanien und Portugal 1986 hat
zu einer &quot;S&uuml;dsensibilisierung&quot; gef&uuml;hrt. Das
bedeutet, da&szlig; in Br&uuml;ssel die sogenannte &quot;lateinische
Welt&quot; etwas st&auml;rker wahrgenommen wird als zuvor. Im
Augenblick stehen wir vor einer S&uuml;derweiterung der USA, da
Mexiko sich an der Nordamerikanischen Freihandelszone NAFTA (North
American Free Trade Agreement) beteiligt. Dadurch werden auch
die USA - das ist zumindest zu hoffen - eine S&uuml;dsensibilisierung
erfahren, die u.a. damit zusammenh&auml;ngt, da&szlig; wenige
Industrienationen in den letzten zehn Jahren einen vergleichsweise
so starken wirtschaftlichen Abstieg erlebt haben wie die USA,
die heute auf ihre Nachbarn st&auml;rker angewiesen sind als je
zuvor.
<P>
In Lateinamerika besteht die gro&szlig;e Sorge, da&szlig; Osteuropa,
insbesondere gegen&uuml;ber der EG, in den Bereichen Handel, Entwicklungshilfe
und Investitionen ein neuer Konkurrent werden k&ouml;nnte. Das
ist nicht aus der Luft gegriffen, da Osteuropa, wenn Sie sich
die internationalen Statistiken ansehen, die einzige Region der
Welt ist, die Lateinamerika strukturell sehr &auml;hnlich ist.
Das hei&szlig;t, sowohl Osteuropa als auch Lateinamerika geh&ouml;ren
im Weltdurchschnitt weder zu den Reichen noch zu den ganz Armen,
sie haben ein durchschnittlich besseres Erziehungsniveau als andere
Entwicklungsl&auml;nder und eine gr&ouml;&szlig;ere industrielle
Kapazit&auml;t. Wenn Osteuropa in ein paar Jahren seine wirtschaftliche
und politische Situation besser in den Griff bekommen hat, dann
k&ouml;nnte die Region aufgrund der geographischen N&auml;he zur
EG tats&auml;chlich zum gr&ouml;&szlig;ten Konkurrenten Lateinamerikas
werden. &Auml;hnliches bef&uuml;rchten die Lateinamerikaner vom
Nahen Osten und vor allem von Nordafrika. Der Maghreb ist schon
heute eine Region, die enger an die EG heranr&uuml;ckt, und eine
Freihandelszone mit der EG zu bilden, liegt f&uuml;r einige Staaten
Nordafrikas durchaus im Bereich des M&ouml;glichen.
<P>
Wir stehen hier also vor der Situation einer nicht mehr ideologisch,
sondern zunehmend wirtschaftlich ausgerichteten Konkurrenz, die
heute das internationale System pr&auml;gt. Dem steht eine Globalisierung
bestimmter Probleme gegen&uuml;ber: Drogen, Umwelt, Armut, Migration
- Themen, die auch im Dialog der EG mit Lateinamerika eine gro&szlig;e
Rolle spielen - sind globale Herausforderungen und keine Probleme
bestimmter Beziehungsmuster. Dasselbe gilt f&uuml;r den Handel.
Sie wissen aus den Zeitungen, wie kritisch die Situation der GATT-Verhandlungen
ist, von denen sich besonders die Lateinamerikaner erhebliche
Vorteile versprechen.
<P>
Lassen Sie mich in drei Bl&ouml;cken versuchen darzustellen, wie,
zumindest aus meiner Sicht, ein Strukturbild der Beziehungen zwischen
Lateinamerika und der EG aussieht. Ich werde zun&auml;chst &uuml;ber
die interregionalen Beziehungen als solche sprechen, dann &uuml;ber
die Ebenen und zum Schlu&szlig; &uuml;ber die Inhalte der Beziehungen.
<P>
Wenn wir uns das Umfeld der interregionalen Beziehungen im Jahre
drei nach dem Ende des Kalten Krieges ansehen, kann man feststellen,
da&szlig; wir in einem internationalen politischen System leben,
dessen Regeln noch niemand definiert hat. Es gibt keine Superm&auml;chte
mehr. Die USA sind es vielleicht noch auf milit&auml;rischem Gebiet,
aber auch das ist umstritten, da das Land h&ouml;her verschuldet
ist als jedes andere in der Welt und kaum mehr imstande ist, die
Probleme seiner eigenen Gesellschaft in den Griff zu bekommen.
Die USA fallen daher als individuelle F&uuml;hrungsmacht immer
mehr aus.
<P>
Demgegen&uuml;ber k&ouml;nnen wir heute das Entstehen von drei
Wirtschaftsbl&ouml;cken beobachten. Vorreiter war die EG (jetzt
erweitert um den Europ&auml;ischen Wirtschaftsraum einschlie&szlig;lich
&Ouml;sterreich), es folgte die NAFTA, die sich in den n&auml;chsten
Jahren wohl noch erweitern wird, und schlie&szlig;lich das Entwicklungszentrum
Japan und die NICs, die &quot;Newly Industrializing Countries&quot;
in S&uuml;dostasien, der Region mit den h&ouml;chsten Wachstumsraten
der Welt.
<P>
Das hei&szlig;t, wir werden uns in Zukunft daran gew&ouml;hnen
m&uuml;ssen, da&szlig; bilaterale Beziehungen in der Au&szlig;enpolitik
keine so entscheidende Rolle mehr spielen werden, w&auml;hrend
die interregionalen oder die inter-Block-Beziehungen (wie zuvor
zwischen dem Ostblock und der westlichen Welt), ebenso wie die
Konkurrenz zwischen den Bl&ouml;cken, enorm zunehmen werden.
<P>
Die EG ist keine Supermacht und wird auch keine werden. Sie ist
eine Konsensmacht. Dieser Konsens besteht in vielen Fragen aus
dem kleinsten gemeinsamen Nenner. Die rege Diskussion um das Innenleben
der EG, die in den letzten Monaten stattgefunden hat, ist sicher
noch lange nicht beendet. Dennoch wissen alle, auch die D&auml;nen,
da&szlig; vor ihnen nur der wirtschaftliche Abgrund st&uuml;nde,
wenn sie aus der EG austreten w&uuml;rden, da die Frage der wirtschaftlichen
&Uuml;berlebensf&auml;higkeit nicht mehr an staatliche Grenzen
gebunden ist. Das wird immer mehr, nicht zuletzt auch in den USA,
erkannt.
<P>
Die Gemeinschaftspolitik ist aber gleichzeitig mehr als die Summe
der Politik ihrer Mitglieder. Das ist besonders deutlich geworden
in den Beziehungen der EG zu Zentralamerika. Dort hat die EG die
Vorreiterrolle gespielt, eine Rolle, die kein einzelnes EG-Mitgliedsland,
entgegen den Vorstellungen der US-Politik in der Region, h&auml;tte
&uuml;bernehmen k&ouml;nnen. Einen &auml;hnlichen Fall haben Sie
jetzt bei den GATT-Verhandlungen. Keines der europ&auml;ischen
L&auml;nder k&ouml;nnte allein den USA die Stirn bieten. Die EG
hingegen kann, so hat sie es auch erkl&auml;rt, durchaus die Wahl
eines neuen US-Pr&auml;sidenten abwarten, weil die GATT-Verhandlungen
heute vielleicht f&uuml;r die USA wichtiger sind als f&uuml;r
die EG.
<P>
In den internationalen Beziehungen scheitert vieles an Managementproblemen.
Dabei ist das Management von interregionalen Beziehungen noch
weitaus schwieriger als das von Au&szlig;enbeziehungen, das sowieso
schon kompliziert genug ist. Wenn wir uns zum Beispiel ansehen,
da&szlig; in den Beziehungen zu Zentralamerika die 12 EG-Mitgliedsstaaten,
die 6 zentralamerikanischen Staaten und die drei sogenannten kooperierenden
Staaten (Mexiko, Venezuela und Kolumbien) in einem Konsenverfahren,
dem San-Jos&eacute; Proze&szlig;, zusammengefa&szlig;t sind, dann
k&ouml;nnen wir uns vorstellen, wie schwierig es ist, eine gemeinsame
Position zu erarbeiten. Dasselbe gilt auch f&uuml;r die Beziehungen
zu der sogenannten Rio-Gruppe der 11 lateinamerikanischen Staaten,
die sich zu einem informellen au&szlig;enpolitischen Forum zusammengeschlossen
haben und j&auml;hrliche Ministerkonferenzen mit den Au&szlig;enministern
der EG abhalten.
<P>
Ehe ich in die Details gehe, lassen sie mich einen kurzen Blick
auf das werfen, was man die Interessen&uuml;bereinstimmung zwischen
Lateinamerika und der EG nennen k&ouml;nnte. Es gibt sicherlich,
und das Jahr 1992 hat das durchaus bewiesen, eine kulturelle und
in einigen Bereichen auch eine politische Wertegemeinschaft. Das
war nicht immer so. Heute hingegen ist Lateinamerika neben Europa
und Nordamerika die gr&ouml;&szlig;te demokratische Region der
Welt. Die Au&szlig;enbeziehungen der Internationalen, sei es der
Sozialisten, der Christdemokraten, der Liberalen oder der Konservativen,
beschr&auml;nken sich im wesentlichen auf die Kontakte zwischen
europ&auml;ischen und lateinamerikanischen Parteien. Das ist kein
Zufall, sondern zeugt von jahrzehntelangen, sehr engen Verbindungen
und &auml;hnlichen Vorstellungen &uuml;ber die Entwicklung politischer
Systeme. Zudem haben beide Regionen aufgrund der erfahrenen Abh&auml;ngigkeit
einen hohen Grad an politischer Sensibilit&auml;t. Die Abh&auml;ngigkeit
Lateinamerikas von den USA ist zwar wesentlich ausgepr&auml;gter
gewesen als die Europas von den USA, aber man sollte diesen Faktor
auch hier nicht untersch&auml;tzen. Das gilt zumindest f&uuml;r
Deutschland, das erst 1990 &quot;souver&auml;n&quot; geworden
ist. Die Vorstellung, da&szlig; man lernen mu&szlig;, mit einer
Hegemonialmacht umzugehen, ist deshalb nicht nur eine lateinamerikanische,
sondern auch eine europ&auml;ische Erfahrung.
<P>
Hinzu kommt, da&szlig; die europ&auml;ischen Staaten, obwohl manche
es noch nicht so recht glauben wollen, seit vielen Jahrzehnten
Mittelm&auml;chte sind. Die Europ&auml;er sind deshalb daran interessiert,
mit den mittleren M&auml;chten Lateinamerikas, insbesondere Brasilien
und Mexiko, zusammenzuarbeiten, weil sie selbst zur Zeit des Kalten
Krieges kein Interesse an einer Vorherrschaft der Gro&szlig;m&auml;chte
haben konnten. Sowohl in Lateinamerika als auch in Europa geht
es h&auml;ufig darum, den Giganten, den jeweils politisch und/oder
wirtschaftlich Gr&ouml;&szlig;ten, durch Integration einzubinden.
Das versucht man im MERCOSUR (Mercado Com&uacute;n del Sur) mit
Brasilien, in der EG mit der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, und es
wird jetzt in einer erweiterten NAFTA sicher auch mit den USA
versucht werden. Die St&auml;rke der kleinen L&auml;nder oder
Grenzl&auml;nder besteht immer in der Kooperation mit den jeweils
angrenzenden Staaten, da man so den Einflu&szlig; der &quot;Gro&szlig;en&quot;
m&ouml;glichst gering halten kann.
<P>
Wo liegen die Interessengegens&auml;tze zwischen beiden Regionen?
Nach dem Ende des Kalten Krieges ist das Nord-S&uuml;d-Gef&auml;lle
die entscheidende internationale Herausforderung, da sich die
Welt heute nicht mehr um die Ost-West-, sondern haupts&auml;chlich
um die Nord-S&uuml;d-Achse dreht. Hier haben die Lateinamerikaner
uns sehr viel voraus, weil sie immer davon &uuml;berzeugt waren,
da&szlig; dies die eigentliche ideologische Achse ist, die ihre
Entwicklung bestimmt hat. Das historisch gewachsene Nord-S&uuml;d-Gef&auml;lle
bedingt die Asymmetrie der Beziehungen. Zahlen sind schon genannt
worden. Es sind tats&auml;chlich nicht einmal f&uuml;nf Prozent
ihres Au&szlig;enhandels (4,7 Prozent), den die EG mit Lateinamerika
abwickelt. Damit ist Lateinamerika f&uuml;r den Au&szlig;enhandel
der EG von geringerer Bedeutung als die Schweiz. Das gibt Ihnen,
so traurig das sein mag, eine Vorstellung davon, wie vergleichsweise
unbedeutend Lateinamerikas Rolle in den Wirtschaftsbeziehungen
Europas ist.
<P>
Ein weiterer Interessengegensatz liegt darin, da&szlig; die lateinamerikanischen
L&auml;nder, das spiegelt sich auch in ihrem Abstimmungsverhalten
bei den Vereinten Nationen wider, verst&auml;ndlicherweise die
Staaten sind, die den Status quo in der Welt ver&auml;ndern wollen,
w&auml;hrend die Europ&auml;er - insbesondere die EG - an der
Erhaltung dieses Status quo interessiert sind. Hier bestehen Grundsatzunterschiede,
die nur sehr schwer zu &uuml;berbr&uuml;cken sind. Auch sind die
Hierarchien, denen die Au&szlig;enbeziehungen beider Regionen
unterliegen, sehr unterschiedlich. Wenn man sich die wirtschaftlichen
Austauschbeziehungen ansieht, stehen die USA aus lateinamerikanischer
Sicht an erster Stelle, gefolgt von Europa, Japan und schlie&szlig;lich
von den eigenen L&auml;ndern der Region. In Europa ist es umgekehrt:
zuerst kommen die europ&auml;ischen Nachbarstaaten und die EFTA,
dann die USA, dann Japan gefolgt von Zentral- und Osteuropa, den
Mittelmeerl&auml;ndern und schlie&szlig;lich Lateinamerika und
den AKP-Staaten (Afrika, Karibik, Pazifik). Diese Art der sogenannten
Hardware in den Beziehungen, die sich in Statistiken ablesen l&auml;&szlig;t,
ist etwas, was die Lateinamerikaner stark trifft, weil viele von
ihnen, nicht zuletzt aufgrund der Migrationsbeziehungen, sich
kulturell und politisch sehr eng mit den Europ&auml;ern verbunden
f&uuml;hlen.
<P>
Wenn Sie jetzt einen Blick auf die einzelnen Beziehungsebenen
werfen, m&uuml;ssen Sie, um die EG-Beziehungen zu verstehen, im
Geflecht bestehender Beziehungen sehr genau unterscheiden. Es
gibt zun&auml;chst die supranationalen Beziehungen, die in den
Kompetenzbereich der EG fallen, dann die bilateralen Beziehungen,
die die einzelnen EG-Mitgliedsstaaten - zum Teil in Abstimmung
mit und im Namen der EG - weiterhin mit den Einzelstaaten Lateinamerikas
unterhalten, und schlie&szlig;lich gilt es, die transnationalen,
die substaatlichen Beziehungen zu betrachten, die gerade mit Lateinamerika
besonders ausgepr&auml;gt sind.
<P>
Lassen Sie mich kurz die einzelnen Ebenen ansprechen. In den supranationalen
Beziehungen ist die EG-Kommission nicht immer die Schuldige, obwohl
ihr auch in Europa h&auml;ufig, vor allem in den Handelsbeziehungen,
diese Rolle zugewiesen wird. Die Rolle der Kommission wird eher
&uuml;bersch&auml;tzt. Es ist auch nicht das Europ&auml;ische
Parlament, das in Lateinamerika eine sehr gute Presse hat und
sich ausf&uuml;hrlich mit lateinamerikanischen Fragen besch&auml;ftigt,
sondern es ist der Europ&auml;ische Rat, der Ministerrat, der
die Entscheidungen trifft. Damit sind es die Vertreter der Mitgliedsl&auml;nder,
die Schwerpunkte setzen, politische Entscheidungen f&auml;llen
und die dadurch, da&szlig; ihre Sitzungen nicht &ouml;ffentlich
sind, den durchf&uuml;hrenden Organen, also vor allem der Kommission,
den &quot;schwarzen Peter&quot; zuschreiben.
<P>
Auch im Geflecht der supranationalen Beziehungen hat es, wie mir
scheint, in den letzten Jahren gro&szlig;e Fortschritte gegeben.
1984 ist der San Jos&eacute;-Proze&szlig;, genannt nach dem ersten
Au&szlig;enministertreffen in San Jos&eacute;, Costa Rica, in
Zentralamerika eingeleitet worden. Damals sprach man in amerikanischen
Zeitungen vom Ende der Monroe-Doktrin, weil die Vorstellung, da&szlig;
sich 12 europ&auml;ische Au&szlig;enminister mit ihren zentralamerikanischen
Amtskollegen in Zentralamerika treffen, das Weltbild der Amerikaner
ver&auml;nderte. Die Beziehungen zu einer kleinen, damals in Kriege
und B&uuml;rgerkriege verstrickten Region haben in der Au&szlig;enpolitik
der EG Akzente gesetzt. 1986 wurde ein Dialog mit dem Andenpakt
aufgenommen und 1991 schlie&szlig;lich mit den MERCOSUR-Staaten,
dem sich herausbildenden Integrationsmechanismus im S&uuml;den
Lateinamerikas.
<P>
Dar&uuml;berhinaus hat die EG mit den meisten lateinamerikanischen
Staaten bilaterale Vertr&auml;ge der sogenannten Dritten Generation
abgeschlossen. Es handelt sich um die dritte Folge von Vertr&auml;gen
seit den 70er Jahren, die jedesmal neu ausgehandelt wurden und
immer anspruchsvoller geworden sind. Nach den Erfahrungen der
letzten Jahrzehnte enthalten die neuen Vertr&auml;ge zwei wichtige
Klauseln: eine Demokratieklausel, derzufolge die Vertr&auml;ge
am Tage eines Milit&auml;rputsches hinf&auml;llig werden und eine
Integrationsklausel, die besagt, da&szlig; die L&auml;nder sich
aktiv f&uuml;r die Integration einsetzen sollen. Diese Art, wie
ich meine, positiver Klauseln und nicht der - wie oft in amerikanischen
Kooperationsvertr&auml;gen enthaltenen - sogenannten Negativklauseln
- sind Ausdruck einer sehr vorw&auml;rtsblickenden Politik der
EG. Auch der 1990 in Rom unterzeichnete institutionelle Vertrag
zwischen der EG und der Rio-Gruppe enth&auml;lt eine Demokratieklausel.
Die letzte Konferenz zwischen der Rio-Gruppe und den EG-Au&szlig;enministern,
die im Mai 1992 in Santiago de Chile stattfand, ist ein gutes
Beispiel f&uuml;r die Anwendung dieser Klausel. So wurde Peru,
obwohl das Land der Rio-Gruppe angeh&ouml;rt, zu diesem Treffen
nicht mehr eingeladen mit der Begr&uuml;ndung, man k&ouml;nne
den Europ&auml;ern nicht zumuten, mit einem Land, in dem gerade
das Parlament aufgel&ouml;st worden ist, weiter zu verhandeln.
Es gibt also hier, &uuml;ber die eigentlichen kommerziellen Beziehungen
hinaus, eine Chance f&uuml;r die Fortentwicklung gemeinsamer politischer
Wertvorstellungen, die &uuml;ber die M&ouml;glichkeiten eines
Einzelstaates weit hinausgehen.
<P>
Die n&auml;chste Ebene sind die bilateralen Beziehungen. Sie sind,
wie Sie wissen, besonders traditionsreich, und, wie man so sch&ouml;n
sagt, &quot;pr&auml;ferenzlastig&quot;.
<P>
Hier gibt es bilaterale Verbindungen, die besonders wichtig sind,
wie z.B. die mexikanisch-franz&ouml;sischen Beziehungen oder die
italienisch-argentinischen Beziehungen, die chilenisch-britischen
oder die brasilianisch-deutschen Beziehungen. Es hat sich im bilateralen
Bereich herausgebildet, da&szlig; bestimmte europ&auml;ische L&auml;nder
besonders umfangreiche Programme oder intensive wirtschaftliche
und entwicklungspolitische Beziehungen mit bestimmten lateinamerikanischen
Partnern pflegen. Das macht es f&uuml;r die EG nicht immer leicht,
einen gemeinsamen Nenner zu finden, weil ein lateinamerikanisches
Land, das sich von einer EG-Direktive besonders betroffen f&uuml;hlt,
bei seinem st&auml;rksten Partner in der EG Unterst&uuml;tzung
suchen kann. Bei den EG-Sitzungen &uuml;ber eine gemeinsame Lateinamerikapolitik
gibt es daher aufgrund traditioneller bilateraler Verbindungen
durchaus Allianzbindungen zugunsten bestimmter lateinamerikanischer
L&auml;nder. Weil Italien und Spanien die Meinung teilen, da&szlig;
die Beziehungen der EG zu Lateinamerika nicht ausgepr&auml;gt
genug sind, haben beide L&auml;nder, die gleichzeitig die st&auml;rksten
Einwanderergruppen in Lateinamerika stellten, in den letzten Jahren
mit zahlreichen lateinamerikanischen Staaten eigene Freundschafts-
und Kooperationsvertr&auml;ge abgeschlossen, die, insbesondere
in den Bereichen Investitionskapital und soft loans, weit &uuml;ber
das hinausgehen, was die EG zu geben bereit war. Wenn Kritik an
der Entwicklungshilfe der EG ge&uuml;bt wird, mu&szlig; man dabei
allerdings ber&uuml;cksichtigen, da&szlig; 81 Prozent der europ&auml;ischen
Mittel immer noch bilateral vergeben werden, w&auml;hrend lediglich
19 Prozent von der EG verteilt werden.
<P>
Ein anderer Punkt, der auch in &Ouml;sterreich eine gewisse Rolle
gespielt hat, ist, da&szlig; sich die bilateralen Beziehungen
zu Lateinamerika, zwar nicht immer, aber h&auml;ufig, auf die
Innenpolitik auswirken. Nikaragua, Kuba, Brasilien - Umweltprobleme,
der Amazonas - das sind Themen, die in den meisten europ&auml;ischen
L&auml;ndern nicht mehr nur au&szlig;enpolitische, sondern auch
innenpolitische Bedeutung erlangt haben. Oft ist die innenpolitische
Auseinandersetzung eher hinderlich f&uuml;r gute Beziehungen zu
diesen L&auml;ndern, weil vor allem aus ideologischen Gr&uuml;nden
die eine oder andere Seite das jeweilige Land in den Vordergrund
r&uuml;ckt, ohne damit eigentlich entwicklungs-politischen Zielsetzungen
zu dienen. Dies war in erster Linie bei den Auseinandersetzungen
&uuml;ber Chile und Nikaragua der Fall.
<P>
Die dritte, gerade aus Sicht der EG, sehr wichtige Ebene ist die
der transnationalen Beziehungen. Transnational in dem Sinne, da&szlig;
die Beziehungen weitgehend frei bleiben von nationalen Steuerungen,
aber durchaus aus nationalen und oft aus staatlichen Quellen finanziert
werden. In den letzten Jahrzehnten sind hier sicherlich, nicht
zuletzt aufgrund der innenpolitischen Entwicklungen in Lateinamerika,
besonders enge Beziehungen aufgebaut worden.
<P>
Das engste Netz der transnationalen Beziehungen bilden die einzelnen
Unternehmen und Banken, die oft schon seit vielen Jahrzehnten
vor Ort sind. Es gibt etwa 3.000 europ&auml;ische Unternehmen
in Lateinamerika, von denen einige schon seit &uuml;ber 100 Jahren
in der Region ans&auml;ssig sind.
<P>
Auch die Kirchen spielen eine entscheidende Rolle. Sie sind sicherlich,
was die Mobilisierung von Entwicklungshilfe und den Transfer neuer
Ideen aus der Region nach Europa angeht (man denke nur an die
Befreiungstheologie), neben den Wirtschaftsunternehmen der wichtigste
Akteur. In einzelnen L&auml;ndern haben die jeweiligen, auch finanziellen
Aktionen der Kirchen eine gr&ouml;&szlig;ere Rolle gespielt als
die staatlichen Hilfen. Das entwicklungspolitische Engagement
kirchlicher Einrichtungen ist urspr&uuml;nglich ein europ&auml;isches
Konzept gewesen, das von nordamerikanischen Kirchen in den letzten
Jahren, vor allem unter dem Einflu&szlig; von Nikaragua und El
Salvador, in Zentralamerika noch ausgebaut worden ist.
<P>
An dritter Stelle stehen die Internationalen. Die Parteienb&uuml;ndnisse
sind in den biregionalen Beziehungen sehr wichtig. Da dieselben
politischen Gruppierungen auch im Europ&auml;ischen Parlament
vertreten sind, unterh&auml;lt das Europ&auml;ische Parlament
besonders ausgepr&auml;gte Beziehungen zu den lateinamerikanischen
Parteien. Das ist am Beispiel Chiles, w&auml;hrend der langen
Jahre des politischen Exils oppositioneller Politiker, besonders
deutlich geworden. Chile ist, von der Kommunistischen Partei bis
zu den Konservativen, das Land Lateinamerikas gewesen, das nahezu
zu allen Parteienb&uuml;ndnissen in Europa aus allen ideologischen
Richtungen enge Beziehungen unterhalten hat und wahrscheinlich
auch deshalb, als die Demokratisierung begann, vom Europ&auml;ischen
Parlament bei den Ma&szlig;nahmen der EG-Kommission besonders
stark unterst&uuml;tzt worden ist.
<P>
Die Nichtregierungsorganisationen (NROs) sind als n&auml;chstes
zu nennen. In Lateinamerika sind etwa 600 europ&auml;ische NROs
aktiv. Oft handelt es sich um sehr effiziente, besonders engagierte
Organisationen, die zunehmend auch von der EG finanziert werden,
weil sie die Betroffenen besser und direkter erreichen, als wenn
die Entwicklungshilfe &uuml;ber den jeweiligen Staatsapparat kanalisiert
wird. Es ensteht dabei h&auml;ufig das Problem, da&szlig; diese
Organisationen gerade wegen ihres Engagements und ihrer Militanz
bestimmte Gruppen bevorzugen und dadurch neue Interessen- und
Zielkonflikte hervorrufen. Dennoch haben sie sich gerade in den
letzten zehn bis f&uuml;nfzehn Jahren im entwicklungspolitischen
Bereich au&szlig;erordentlich bew&auml;hrt. Als die mit Abstand
erfolgreichsten Organisationen in der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit
mit Lateinamerika k&ouml;nnen vor allem die schwedischen, niederl&auml;ndischen
und italienischen NROs bewertet werden.
<P>
Schlie&szlig;lich gibt es die politischen Stiftungen, zun&auml;chst
eine Erfindung der Deutschen, die inzwischen auch von Niederl&auml;ndern,
Spaniern und Italienern sehr stark gef&ouml;rdert werden. Die
Stiftungen haben gerade in der Zeit der Milit&auml;rdiktaturen,
wenn andere direkte politische Kontakte nicht m&ouml;glich waren,
im parlamentarischen und politischen Bereich in Lateinamerika
eine wichtige Rolle gespielt.
<P>
Ich glaube, man sollte darauf hinweisen, da&szlig; es sich bei
diesen transnationalen Beziehungen um eine neue Dimension der
Au&szlig;enpolitik handelt, die nicht nur weitgehend unbekannt
ist, sondern die dadurch, da&szlig; die traditionellen Bahnen
internationaler Zusammenarbeit verlassen worden sind, oft im Schatten
der bilateralen und supranationalen Beziehungen steht. Gerade
die vielf&auml;ltigen und oft unkoordinierten Aktivit&auml;ten
der NROs spiegeln die Tatsache wider, da&szlig; Au&szlig;enpolitik
heute nicht nur auf der staatlichen Ebene betrieben wird, sondern
da&szlig; sich die verschiedenen gesellschaftlichen Gruppen in
einer immer demokratischeren Gesellschaft international unterschiedliche
Partner suchen.
<P>
Lassen Sie mich jetzt auf die Beziehungsinhalte eingehen. Sie
werden innerhalb der EG nicht zuletzt von den ins Amt kommenden
EG-Kommissaren in einem gewissen Rahmen jeweils neu bestimmt.
Die Inhalte der biregionalen Beziehung sind daher, im wirtschaftlichen
und politischen Bereich, nicht nur Konjunkturen, sondern auch
dem politischen Willen unterworfen.
<P>
Die wirtschaftlichen Beziehungen zwischen Lateinamerika und Europa
bzw. der EG haben sich generell negativ entwickelt. W&auml;hrend
der Anteil Lateinamerikas an den Importen der EG zwischen 1980
und 1985 auf 7,5 Prozent stieg, fiel er bis 1991 wieder auf 5,3
Prozent zur&uuml;ck. Das h&auml;ngt vor allem damit zusammen,
da&szlig; wir insbesondere bei den Prim&auml;rprodukten einen
enormen weltweiten Preisverfall erlebt haben und da&szlig; 80
Prozent der lateinamerikanischen Exportprodukte in diese Gruppe
fallen. Diese 80 Prozent sind im wesentlichen Nahrungsmittel und
Mineralien. Der Preisverfall und der daraus folgende Importr&uuml;ckgang
l&auml;&szlig;t sich darauf zur&uuml;ckf&uuml;hren, da&szlig;
die moderne Technologie immer weniger auf Mineralien angewiesen
ist. Dar&uuml;berhinaus hat die EG es mit einer in vielen Bereichen
sicherlich auch verfehlten Politik erreicht, nicht nur zum bedeutendsten
Nahrungsmittelimporteur, sondern auch zum gr&ouml;&szlig;ten Nahrungsmittelexporteur
der Welt zu werden. Das hei&szlig;t, Nahrungsmittel lassen sich
heute in der Welt besonders schlecht verkaufen, weil die armen
L&auml;nder, die auf sie angewiesen sind, nicht das Geld haben,
sie zu kaufen und die reichen L&auml;nder, die sie kaufen k&ouml;nnten,
sie h&auml;ufig selber produzieren.
<P>
Andererseits stellt sich immer wieder heraus, da&szlig; L&auml;nder,
die sich besonders geschickt auf den EG-Markt einzustellen wissen,
es auch schaffen, in den Markt hineinzukommen. Ein ber&uuml;hmtes
Beispiel daf&uuml;r sind die brasilianischen Fruchts&auml;fte.
Die Brasilianer konnten weder Orangens&auml;fte noch Grapefruits&auml;fte
in die EG liefern, weil ein Assoziationsabkommen Israel den Export
dieser Produkte erleichterte. Vor diesem Hintergrund exportierten
die Brasilianer Maracuja- und &auml;hnliche tropische S&auml;fte
und starteten in zahlreichen EG-Staaten eine gro&szlig;e Werbekampagne.
Heute, etwa zehn Jahre sp&auml;ter, verf&uuml;gen sie in der EG
&uuml;ber einen beachtlichen Anteil am Fruchtsaftmarkt. Es ist
daher nicht so, da&szlig; man in den europ&auml;ischen Markt nicht
hineinkommt, man mu&szlig; nur versuchen, nicht gerade das zu
verkaufen, was andere L&auml;nder, oft mit pr&auml;ferenziellem
Marktzugang, schon en masse an die Gemeinschaft liefern.
<P>
Das n&auml;chste Problem entsteht in diesem Zusammenhang durch
das Bananenprotokoll. Bananen sind eines der wenigen Produkte,
f&uuml;r die es in der EG bisher noch keine gemeinschaftliche
Regelung gibt. Das hei&szlig;t, jedes Land hat bisher seine eigenen
Quoten, seine eigenen Beziehungs- und Tarifm&ouml;glichkeiten
gehabt. Es gibt drei gro&szlig;e Bananen-Anbieter unterschiedlicher
Gr&ouml;&szlig;e. Die sogenannte Dollar-Banane kommt aus Zentralamerika,
Kolumbien und Ekuador, dann gibt es die Bananen aus der Karibik
und dem afrikanischen Raum, die unter die AKP-Regelung der EG
fallen (Lom&eacute;-Abkommen) und schlie&szlig;lich die Bananen
von den Kanarischen Inseln, die zur EG geh&ouml;ren. Hier hat
sich klar herausgestellt, da&szlig; L&auml;nder, wie Frankreich
und England, die besondere Beziehungen zu ihren Ex-Kolonien unterhalten,
darauf dr&auml;ngen, da&szlig; deren Bananen nicht aus dem Markt
geworfen werden. Daraufhin sagten die Spanier, die sonst immer
sehr schnell bereit sind, sich f&uuml;r lateinamerikanische Interessen
einzusetzen: &quot;Unter diesen Umst&auml;nden auf keinen Fall,
denn das w&uuml;rde den Verkauf unserer wesentlich teureren Bananen
von den Kanarischen Inseln in Europa benachteiligen&quot;. Im
Endeffekt wird der Konflikt darauf hinauslaufen, da&szlig; die
deutschen Abnehmer, die bisher keinen Zoll auf Bananen gezahlt
und diese vohrnehmlich aus Lateinamerika eingef&uuml;hrt haben,
demn&auml;chst 20 Prozent Zoll zahlen m&uuml;ssen, damit die lateinamerikanischen
Bananen teurer werden und die &quot;einheimischen&quot; Bananen
auch verkauft werden k&ouml;nnen. Dieser Konflikt zeigt, da&szlig;
der Europ&auml;ische Binnenmarkt f&uuml;r Lateinamerika sicherlich
nicht nur positive Konsequenzen haben wird.
<P>
Andererseits m&uuml;ssen auch die Lateinamerikaner einsehen, da&szlig;
der Binnenmarkt f&uuml;r die Europ&auml;er geschaffen worden ist
und nicht unbedingt f&uuml;r Drittl&auml;nder. Gleiches gilt auch
f&uuml;r die Nordamerikaner. Die biregionalen Wirtschaftsbeziehungen
m&uuml;ssen daher auch weiterhin als Problembeziehungen betrachtet
werden. Die Schwierigkeiten entstehen u.a. dadurch, da&szlig;
die Lateinamerikaner es im Gegensatz zu den s&uuml;dostasiatischen
Staaten in den letzten 25 Jahren nicht geschafft haben, ein breites
Produktangebot auf den europ&auml;ischen Markt zu bringen, sondern
der Meinung waren, da&szlig; sie bestimmte Produkte besonders
preiswert produzieren und diese deshalb auch in Europa verkaufen
m&uuml;&szlig;ten. Diese Hoffnung hat sich leider nicht durchsetzen
lassen.
<P>
Nur die L&auml;nder, die sich Marktnischen gesucht haben, sind
erfolgreich gewesen. Noch vor zehn Jahren kamen die meisten Blumen
auf dem europ&auml;ischen Markt aus den Niederlanden. Das hat
sich inzwischen ge&auml;ndert. Heute kommen die meisten Blumen
aus Lateinamerika. Mit Jumbos werden sie jeden Morgen p&uuml;nktlich
in sechs verschiedene Hauptst&auml;dte der Gemeinschaft geliefert.
Das ist ein &quot;Riesengesch&auml;ft&quot; und hat dazu gef&uuml;hrt,
da&szlig; Kolumbien (Costa Rica ist jetzt auch eingestiegen) gesehen
hat, wo man besonders gute Gesch&auml;fte mit der EG machen kann.
Die Chilenen haben einige Jahre sp&auml;ter nachgezogen mit den
sogenannten &quot;Fr&uuml;chten au&szlig;erhalb der Saison&quot;.
Bei all diesen Produkten handelt es sich zwar um leicht verderbliche
Waren, aber auch, im Vergleich zu den Herstellungskosten, um sehr
teure Waren. Das hei&szlig;t, wie immer und &uuml;berall auf dem
Weltmarkt, bringen die Produkte, die besonders verpackungs- und
finanzierungsintensiv sowie besonders schwer zu verkaufen sind,
auch die besseren Gewinne. Das l&auml;&szlig;t sich eben f&uuml;r
eine Tonne Kupfer nicht sagen.
<P>
Nat&uuml;rlich ist die wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit auch komplexer
geworden. Heute gibt es in Lateinamerika eine Reihe von Exportf&ouml;rderungsprogrammen
der EG, in denen die Gemeinschaft versucht, durch Training, Aufkl&auml;rung
und Finanzierung, bestimmte lateinamerikanische Produkte besser
auf dem europ&auml;ischen Markt zu plazieren. Es gibt dar&uuml;berhinaus
Investitionsfonds, die zur Gr&uuml;ndung von Klein- und Mittelbetrieben
in der Art von Joint-ventures (lateinamerikanisches und europ&auml;isches
Kapital plus ein Drittel Risikokapital aus der EG) zusammengefa&szlig;t
werden, um kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen in Lateinamerika
eine bessere Startchance zu geben. Die Kolumbien-Initiative, die
von der EG vor allem als Antwort auf den Koka-Anbau eingef&uuml;hrt
wurde und sich auch auf Peru, Ekuador und Bolivien erstreckt,
ist im Bereich der Drogenbek&auml;mpfung ein wichtigstes Instrument.
Die Initiative r&auml;umt diesen L&auml;ndern vier Jahre lang
f&uuml;r fast alle Produkte absolute Zollfreiheit ein, damit sie
in der Lage sind, besser auf dem europ&auml;ischen Markt Fu&szlig;
zu fassen. Leider ist Kolumbien das einzige Land, das bisher intensiv
davon Gebrauch gemacht hat. Weil diese Regelung sich auch auf
den Export von Blumen und Kaffee bezieht, Produkte, die auch Zentralamerika
an die Gemeinschaft liefert, sprachen die Zentralamerikaner von
Diskriminierung, da ihren Produkten keine Zollfreiheit einger&auml;umt
wurde. Im vergangenen Jahr hat die EG daher f&uuml;r die zentralamerikanischen
L&auml;nder eine &auml;hnliche Initiative ins Leben gerufen. Das
bedeutet, da&szlig; heute de facto alle Niedrigeinkommensl&auml;nder
(Paraguay ist davon ausgeschlossen), zumindest f&uuml;r die n&auml;chsten
drei bis vier Jahre, auf dem europ&auml;ischen Markt bevorzugt
behandelt werden.
<P>
Schlie&szlig;lich komme ich zur Entwicklungszusammenarbeit. Ich
glaube, es ist interessant, sich einmal die Gr&ouml;&szlig;enordnungen
zu verdeutlichen. In den 15 Jahren von 1976 bis 1991 sind 1.937
Millionen Ecu (ein Ecu = etwa 15 Schilling) von der EG allein
als Entwicklungshilfe f&uuml;r Lateinamerika eingesetzt worden.
Von 1991 bis 1995 wird der Beitrag um insgesamt 72% (ca. 18 Prozent
j&auml;hrlich) steigen, zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die USA und
selbst Schweden ihre Entwicklungshilfe gegen&uuml;ber Lateinamerika
verringern. Lateinamerika erh&auml;lt nur 12 Prozent der gesamten
Entwicklungshilfe der EG, weil der Gro&szlig;teil an die &auml;rmsten
L&auml;nder geht, zu denen Lateinamerika, mit Ausnahme von Haiti,
nicht z&auml;hlt. Damit sind die Kommission und die EG-Mitgliedsstaaten
immerhin f&uuml;r 45 Prozent der gesamten an Lateinamerika geleisteten
Entwicklungshilfe verantwortlich, die USA f&uuml;r 27 Prozent
und Japan f&uuml;r 18 Prozent.
<P>
Im Bereich der Entwicklungshilfe gibt es drei wichtige Kriterien.
Bevorzugt werden in erster Linie regionale Projekte. Das hei&szlig;t,
wenn mehrere Staaten sich um ein Projekt bei der EG bem&uuml;hen,
ist die Chance, es zu bekommen, gr&ouml;&szlig;er, da die EG sich,
auch in Lateinamerika, als integrationsf&ouml;rdernde Institution
versteht. An zweiter Stelle werden nichtstaatlicher Tr&auml;ger
bevorzugt. Die EG hat, im Gegensatz zu den USA und zu zahlreichen
EG-Mitgliedsstaaten, die Erfahrung gemacht, da&szlig; Budgetst&uuml;tzungen
und Hilfen an staatliche Organisationen ihren Entwicklungshilfekriterien
nicht ausreichend entsprechen. Drittens werden Ma&szlig;nahmen
zum Ausbau der wirtschaftlichen Leistungsf&auml;higkeit gef&ouml;rdert
- Training, Exportf&ouml;rderung sowie Ma&szlig;nahmen im Bildungsbereich
und im Agrarbereich - , weil Entwicklungshilfe niemals ein Zweck
an sich sein kann, sondern nur eine Starthilfe geben soll.
<P>
Die Entwicklungsprogramme der EG sind sehr unterschiedlich. Es
gibt Umweltprogramme, Drogenprogramme, technische Hilfe, in Zentralamerika
sehr ausgepr&auml;gte Fl&uuml;chtlingsprogramme, Demokratie- und
Integrationsf&ouml;rderungs-programme, Nahrungsmittelhilfe und
neuerdings f&uuml;r Staaten, die sich in einer besonderen Krisensituation
befinden, L&auml;nderprogramme. Ein solches Programm ist f&uuml;r
Peru entwickelt worden, nachdem sich dort im vergangenen Jahr
die Situation versch&auml;rfte. Im Augenblick ist ein besonderes
Aufbauprogramm f&uuml;r El Salvador geplant, um dort, wenn die
politischen Reformen greifen, auch wirtschaftliche Unterst&uuml;tzung
zu leisten. Diese Programme werden von den acht EG-Vertretungen
in Lateinamerika verwaltet (vor zehn Jahren gab es nur eine, in
drei bis vier Jahren werden es zw&ouml;lf oder dreizehn sein).
Diese Vertretungen sind vor allem f&uuml;r die Handels- und Entwicklungspolitik,
die in den Kompetenzbereich der EG fallen, zust&auml;ndig. Damit
ist auch eine verst&auml;rkte Pr&auml;senz der EG in der Region
zu sp&uuml;ren.
<P>
Der politische Dialog ist ein anderer wichtiger Bestandteil der
Beziehungsinhalte. Ich habe vorhin schon erw&auml;hnt, da&szlig;
die Rio-Gruppe seit 1990 f&uuml;r Lateinamerika der wichtigste
Gespr&auml;chspartner mit den europ&auml;ischen Au&szlig;enministern
ist. Interessant ist dabei, da&szlig; bei den Treffen nicht nur
&uuml;ber biregionale Probleme, sondern auch &uuml;ber generelle
Themen gesprochen wird (GATT-Runde, Probleme internationaler Finanzstr&ouml;me,
die Entwicklung Osteuropas). Lateinamerika ist dadurch von den
Europ&auml;ern in einem Ma&szlig;e in die internationale Diskussion
miteinbezogen worden, wie es bis heute nicht einmal die Nordamerikaner
getan haben. Hinzu kommt, da&szlig; auf Botschafterebene regelm&auml;&szlig;ige
Treffen der sogenannten GRULA, das ist die Gruppe der Lateinamerikaner
in Br&uuml;ssel (alle lateinamerikanischen Staaten einschlie&szlig;lich
Kuba sind mit einem eigenen Botschafter bei der EG vertreten),
stattfinden. Im Rahmen der GRULA wird sozusagen der Tagesdialog
mit der EG gef&uuml;hrt. Au&szlig;erdem treffen sich seit &uuml;ber
18 Jahren in einem zweij&auml;hrigen Abstand die Parlamentarier
beider Regionen. Bei den Konferenzen zwischen dem Europ&auml;ischen
und dem Lateinamerikanischen Parlament, die abwechselnd in Europa
und Lateinamerika stattfinden, geht es in erster Linie um die
Pflege der politischen Beziehungen. Diese Art von Treffen hat
zwar nicht immer sehr spektakul&auml;re Schlagzeilen gemacht,
daf&uuml;r ist sie aber gerade w&auml;hrend der Zeit der Milit&auml;rdiktaturen
f&uuml;r die lateinamerikanischen Parteien eine wichtige Unterst&uuml;tzung
von europ&auml;ischer Seite gewesen.
<P>
Lassen Sie mich, bevor ich zum Schlu&szlig; komme, einmal am Beispiel
Zentralamerikas genauer aufschl&uuml;sseln, wie die Entwicklungszusammenarbeit
aussieht, da Zentralamerika in vieler Hinsicht ein Beispiel f&uuml;r
das Konfliktmanagement der EG ist und wahrscheinlich das deutlichste
Beispiel eines EG-Eingreifens in eine internationale Krise war.
Das europ&auml;ische Engagement in Zentralamerika ist u.a. darauf
zur&uuml;ckzuf&uuml;hren, da&szlig; Zentralamerika der europ&auml;ischen
Au&szlig;enpolitik Mitte der 80er Jahre eine besondere Ausgangssituation
geboten hat. Ich will versuchen, das in f&uuml;nf verschiedenen
Begriffen zusammenzufassen.
<P>
Zentralamerika ist einmal eine Region gewesen, in der keines der
europ&auml;ischen Mitgliedsl&auml;nder ein spezielles &ouml;konomisches
Interesse gehabt hat. Das hat nat&uuml;rlich die Formulierung
und Durchf&uuml;hrung einer gemeinsamen Politik au&szlig;erordentlich
erleichtert. Es ist, zweitens, eine Region gewesen, die gleichzeitig
eine ungeheuer gro&szlig;e politische Tragweite gehabt hat. Das
gilt sowohl f&uuml;r den Nord-S&uuml;d-Konflikt als auch f&uuml;r
den Ost-West- und den Allianzkonflikt, das hei&szlig;t, der Konflikt,
den die Franzosen &ouml;ffentlich, die Deutschen, Spanier und
Italiener weniger &ouml;ffentlich mit den USA ausgetragen haben,
weil man sich nicht auf eine gemeinsame Politik des Westens gegen&uuml;ber
Zentralamerika einigen konnte. Damit wurden in Zentralamerika
internationale Auseinandersetzungen auf drei Ebenen virulent,
w&auml;hrend die Region gleichzeitig im Mittelpunkt vieler politischer
Aktivit&auml;ten stand.
<P>
Drittens ist der Mitteleinsatz im Verh&auml;ltnis zum Ergebnis
in Zentralamerika au&szlig;erordentlich positiv. Da die Region
nur 25 Millionen Einwohnern hat, machen ein paar hundert Millionen
Dollar in Zentralamerika schon etwas aus. Wenn Sie hingegen ein
paar hundert Millionen Dollar nach Brasilien schicken, ver&auml;ndern
Sie damit gar nichts. Auch das d&uuml;rfte bei der Politikformulierung
eine Rolle gespielt haben.
<P>
Hinzu kam, ich habe es vorhin kurz angedeutet, da&szlig; Zentralamerika
in Europa eine intensive Wertediskussion ausl&ouml;ste. Menschenrechte,
alternative Entwicklungsmodelle und Milit&auml;rterror waren Themen,
die in die europ&auml;ische Alltagsdiskussion mitaufgenommen wurden
und &uuml;ber die auch in den nationalen Parlamenten ein besonderes
Interesse an Aktivit&auml;ten in Zentralamerika sp&uuml;rbar wurde.
<P>
Daraus folgt, da&szlig; sowohl von seiten der Politiker als auch
der Nichtregierungsorganisationen ein besonders starkes Engagement
in Zentralamerika bestand. Keine Region Lateinamerikas wurde in
den 80er Jahren so oft von europ&auml;ischen Politikern besucht
wie Zentralamerika. Zentralamerika stand pl&ouml;tzlich im Zentrum
einer Politik, die in der Gemeinschaft relativ stark umstritten
war. Es hat gro&szlig;e Auseinandersetzungen &uuml;ber die, meiner
Ansicht nach, sehr positive Politik der EG in Zentralamerika gegeben.
Am Ende haben sich dann die L&auml;nder durchgesetzt, die der
Meinung waren, man m&uuml;sse weniger R&uuml;cksicht auf die nordamerikanischen
und mehr R&uuml;cksicht auf die zentralamerikanischen Interessen
nehmen.
<P>
Zentralamerika (und das gilt seit 1988) erh&auml;lt heute pro
Kopf die h&ouml;chste Entwicklungshilfe der EG. Von 1979 bis 1985
waren es im Durchschnitt 40 Millionen Ecu j&auml;hrlich, in diesem
Jahr sind es bereits 160 Millionen Ecu. &Uuml;ber 50 Prozent der
gesamten EG-Hilfe f&uuml;r Lateinamerika gehen nach Zentralamerika
und wiederum die H&auml;lfte davon flie&szlig;t ausschlie&szlig;lich
in regionale Projekte. Damit wird die Integrationszusammenarbeit
in Zentralamerika durch EG-Mittel stark gef&ouml;rdert. Dar&uuml;berhinaus
bewirkten die Ma&szlig;nahmen der EG aber auch einen enormen Einigungsdruck
zur Zeit der starken ideologischen Auseinandersetzungen zwischen
den verschiedenen Regimen Zentralamerikas (was heute nicht mehr
der Fall ist, aber f&uuml;r die Regierungsperiode der Sandinisten
gilt).
<P>
In den letzten Jahren lagen die entwicklungspolitischen Schwerpunkte
auf dem Wiederaufbauprogramm in Nikaragua - das 1988 fast 35 Prozent
der gesamten Hilfe der EG f&uuml;r die Region ausmachte - und
1992 auf dem Wiederaufbauprogramm in El Salvador, das die EG mit
ungef&auml;hr 40 Prozent der Gesamthilfe an Zentralamerika finanzieren
wird. Die restliche Entwicklungshilfe flie&szlig;t zur H&auml;lfte
in Landentwicklung, Infrastruktur und Kleinbetriebsf&ouml;rderung.
Die n&auml;chsten gr&ouml;&szlig;eren Posten sind Nahrungsmittelhilfe
und Fl&uuml;chtlingshilfe.
<P>
Lassen Sie mich zum Schlu&szlig; ein paar Worte zu den Perspektiven
sagen. Wir sehen in den 90er Jahren ein Lateinamerika vor uns,
das mit der Vorstellung, die wir in den 80er Jahren von der Region
gehabt haben - und das gilt, glaube ich, f&uuml;r die meisten
Europ&auml;er -, nur noch sehr wenig gemein hat. Es ist in vielen
Bereichen ein sehr selbstbewu&szlig;tes, stark modernisiertes
Lateinamerika einer neuen Politiker- und Wirtschaftlergeneration,
ein Lateinamerika, das viel ideologischen Ballast &uuml;ber Bord
geworfen hat, allerdings auch Gefahr l&auml;uft, da&szlig; das
Pendel jetzt, insbesondere bei Privatisierung und Staatsabbau,
zu sehr in die andere Richtung ausschl&auml;gt. Dabei kann es
durchaus passieren, da&szlig; die gew&uuml;nschten Modernisierungseffekte
von den negativen Sozialeffekten eingeholt werden. Es ist aber
auch ein Lateinamerika, das wir nicht mehr als Einheit betrachten
k&ouml;nnen. Wir m&uuml;ssen Peru, Nikaragua und El Salvador ganz
anders behandeln als Chile, Argentinien oder Mexiko. Au&szlig;erdem
wird sich Lateinamerika mit ziemlicher Wahrscheinlichkeit bis
Ende des Jahrhunderts in zwei, zwar nicht ideologische, aber &ouml;konomische
Bl&ouml;cke aufteilen.
<P>
Zum einen wird sich die jetzige NAFTA um die sogenannte Gro&szlig;e
Karibik (Venezuela und Kolumbien) erweitern und nat&uuml;rlich
auch Zentralamerika miteinschlie&szlig;en. Ein solcher Regionalverband
h&auml;tte den nicht unbedeutenden Nebeneffekt, da&szlig; die
Region weltweit der einzige absolute Energieselbstversorger w&auml;re.
Das wiederum w&uuml;rde die internationalen Beziehungen au&szlig;erordentlich
ver&auml;ndern, da die USA von diesem Tag an keinen Tropfen &Ouml;l
mehr aus dem Nahen Osten beziehen m&uuml;&szlig;ten. In der Gro&szlig;en
Karibik liegen mit Mexiko, Kolumbien und Venezuela alle bedeutenden
&Ouml;lexportstaaten der Region, womit auch wirtschaftspolitisch
ein besonderer Akzent gesetzt w&auml;re.
<P>
Das restliche Lateinamerika - s&uuml;dlich des &Auml;quators -
w&auml;re dann vorl&auml;ufig noch ein Verband der vier Staaten,
die sich im MERCOSUR zusammengeschlossen haben. Chile &uuml;bernimmt
dabei zur Zeit die Rolle, die bei uns die Engl&auml;nder innehatten,
indem sie zun&auml;chst abwarteten und kritisierten, um dann eines
Tages aus wirtschaftlicher Notwendigkeit dem Integrationsproze&szlig;
beizutreten.
<P>
Beide Bl&ouml;cke werden sich au&szlig;en- und wirtschaftspolitisch
unterschiedlich orientieren. Es ist schon heute so, da&szlig;
Mexiko, aber auch Venezuela und Kolumbien den gr&ouml;&szlig;ten
Teil ihres Handels und ihrer Investitionen mit den USA abwickeln,
w&auml;hrend Europa f&uuml;r Brasilien, Chile und Argentinien
der wichtigste Au&szlig;enhandelspartner ist und europ&auml;ische
Investitionen dort, mit Ausnahme von Chile, die gr&ouml;&szlig;te
Rolle spielen. Die Politik der Staaten s&uuml;dlich des &Auml;quators
l&auml;uft eher darauf hinaus, da&szlig; man sich sowohl am Norden
als auch an Europa orientiert und gleichzeitig die Kontakte zu
den pazifischen Staaten ausbauen m&ouml;chte. Der Integrationsmechanismus
dieser L&auml;nder k&ouml;nnte vielleicht in zehn bis f&uuml;nfzehn
Jahren der EG nicht allzu un&auml;hnlich sein.
<P>
Die Tatsache, da&szlig; mit dem 1. Januar 1993 zwar nicht &uuml;ber
Nacht, aber doch mittelfristig in Europa ein sehr gro&szlig;er
Markt entsteht, wird, unabh&auml;ngig von seiner Strukturierung,
auch die europ&auml;isch-lateinamerikanischen Beziehungen beeinflussen.
Der EG-Binnenmarkt wird sich allerdings auf Lateinamerika weniger
stark auswirken als auf die USA und Kanada, da er haupts&auml;chlich
L&auml;nder mit hohem Industrieexport betreffen wird, zu denen
die Lateinamerikaner gerade nicht geh&ouml;ren. Der gemeinsame
europ&auml;ische Markt wird aber auch dazu beitragen, da&szlig;
die Nachfrage steigt. Man kalkuliert in der EG sehr optimistisch
eine Nachfragesteigerung zwischen 3 und 4,5 Prozent. Das wird
sich auch auf die Importe niederschlagen, obwohl sich noch nicht
voraussagen l&auml;&szlig;t, welche Produkte und welche L&auml;nder
davon betroffen sein werden.
<P>
Es werden auch Probleme auftreten, weil die Normen und Standards,
die Vorschriften der EG eine immer st&auml;rkere Rolle in der
Weltwirtschaft spielen d&uuml;rften. Die Europ&auml;er haben den
weltweit gr&ouml;&szlig;ten Markt. Das gilt nach der Einbeziehung
der EFTA umso mehr und bedeutet, da&szlig; man bestimmte Produkte,
die man in diesen Markt exportieren m&ouml;chte, auch auf ihn
ausrichten mu&szlig;. Im Bereich der Normen kann zum Beispiel
eine Getriebefabrik in Mexiko nicht mehr gleichzeitig nach amerikanischen
Normen f&uuml;r die USA und f&uuml;r den Export nach Europa produzieren.
Angesichts der enormen Notwendigkeit st&auml;ndiger Wettbewerbsverbesserung
werden solche Probleme, und nicht so sehr die Zollfragen, eine
zunehmende Rolle spielen.
<P>
Der EG-Binnenmarkt wird die Lateinamerikaner schlie&szlig;lich
auch dazu zwingen, ihr Angebot auf dem europ&auml;ischen Markt
zu ver&auml;ndern. Bei einigen Produkten wird sich das sehr positiv
auswirken. Bisher konnten Sie zum Beispiel kubanischen Rum nur
in Italien und in Spanien kaufen. Da ab 1993 jeder Hafen in der
EG als gleichwertiger Eingangshafen gilt, kann dieses Produkt
von diesem Zeitpunkt an in allen L&auml;ndern der Europ&auml;ischen
Gemeinschaft verkauft werden. Wie das im einzelnen aussehen wird,
ist zwar noch nicht genau abzusehen, es wird jedoch dazu f&uuml;hren,
da&szlig; sich die Angebotspalette bei den meisten Produkten au&szlig;erordentlich
ver&auml;ndern mu&szlig;.
<P>
Lassen Sie mich zum Abschlu&szlig; eine kleine Anekdote erz&auml;hlen,
die es mir erleichtert hat, zu verstehen, wie schwierig ein solcher
Umstellungsproze&szlig; ist. Ein Bekannter von mir ist Eink&auml;ufer
f&uuml;r ein gro&szlig;es franz&ouml;sisches Unternehmen, das
400 Warenh&auml;user in Europa unterh&auml;lt. Ich traf ihn vor
ein paar Jahren in El Salvador, das bekannt ist f&uuml;r seine
guten Baumwollprodukte und Handt&uuml;cher, bei intensiven Verhandlungen
mit den gr&ouml;&szlig;ten Unternehmen dort. Er sagte mir, die
Aussichten f&uuml;r einen Vertragsabschlu&szlig; seien hervorragend.
Als ich ihn zwei Tage sp&auml;ter wieder traf, erz&auml;hlte er:
&quot;Nein, daraus ist nichts geworden, denn als wir uns &uuml;ber
die Preise geeinigt hatten, sagte ich zu den Herren, die die Firmen
vertraten, ich werde also f&uuml;r die n&auml;chsten f&uuml;nf
Jahre am 15. eines jeden Monats 23.000 Tonnen dieser Qualit&auml;t
bekommen. Daraufhin h&auml;tten die Herren sich angeschaut und
geantwortet: Nein, das k&ouml;nnen wir nicht machen, dann m&uuml;&szlig;te
ja einer von uns die Qualit&auml;tskontrolle f&uuml;r die Produkte
der anderen Firmen mit&uuml;bernehmen und, und, und...&quot; Am
Ende ist der Auftrag nach S&uuml;dostasien gegangen.
<P>
Ich glaube, das ist mehr als eine Anekdote, weil es gleichzeitig
die Probleme des lateinamerikanischen Individualismus widerspiegelt,
der das Denken in gro&szlig;r&auml;umigen, konsumintensiven M&auml;rkten
noch nicht gew&ouml;hnt ist, und auch zeigt, da&szlig; die Vorteile
im internationalen Wettbewerb bisher kaum wahrgenommen werden.
<P>
Lassen Sie mich mit der Hoffnung schlie&szlig;en, da&szlig; das
Wort von Felipe Gonz&aacute;lez, der von allen europ&auml;ischen
Staatschefs Lateinamerika sicherlich am besten kennt, bis Ende
dieses Jahrhunderts verwirklicht werden wird. Felipe Gonz&aacute;lez
hat einmal gesagt: &quot;Wir reden immer von der gro&szlig;en
Bedeutung der transatlantischen Beziehungen. Bisher waren es die
nordatlantischen Beziehungen. Wir leben jetzt in dem Zeitalter,
wo wir die s&uuml;datlantischen ausbauen wollen&quot;.
